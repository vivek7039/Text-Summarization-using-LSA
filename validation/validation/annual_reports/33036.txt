*from continuing activities Your company has continued to make good
progress this year – delivering strong
ﬁnancial results while continuing to
transform the business. New wave revenues
grew by 30% to £3,387 million.
Earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items, grew by 19% to 16.9 pence –
almost doubling in two years. While continuing to
invest for the future, we generated free cash ﬂow of
over £2 billion and reduced net debt to £8.4 billion – a
reduction of two thirds on the level of three years ago.
Our business
Your company continues to make progress by
innovating in our traditional markets and by growing
revenues in all the new wave markets – ICT
(information and communications technology),
broadband, mobility and managed services – in which
we operate. We continue to invest where we believe it
will make the greatest difference, while achieving
rigorous standards of cost efﬁciency and smarter
working practices.
Returns to shareholders
Although long-term shareholder return remains the key
measure of our success, our share price performance
this year has not been strong. Earnings per share
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
have risen well, but this has yet to be reﬂected in our
share price.
However, total shareholder return also includes the
dividend, and here the news for shareholders is
positive.
We are recommending a full year dividend of
8.5 pence per share. Reﬂecting BT’s commitment to a
progressive dividend policy, the dividend pay out ratio
for the 2004 ﬁnancial year was around 50% of
earnings before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items. The full year dividend is 31% up on last year,
and over four times higher than two years ago. We are
targeting a 60% pay out ratio in 2005/06.
The strong cash ﬂow generated by the group also
enabled us to begin a share buy back programme in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year. This is being funded from cash
generated over and above that required to meet our
debt target of £7 billion in 2006/07, after paying
dividends and taking into account any acquisitions or
disposals.
Regulation
The recently announced strategic review of
telecommunications by the UK regulator, Ofcom, is
important and welcome to BT.
The review will cover, within the 21 key strategic
questions to be addressed, the possibility of the
structural separation of BT. Your company believes this
is not in the interests of shareholders, customers or
employees, and will argue in favour of a strong and
integrated BT.
Wider responsibilities
It is important that companies such as BT live up to
their responsibilities in the wider communities in which
we operate. I’m proud to report that in the 2004
ﬁnancial year, we were the highest placed
telecommunications company in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index for the third year in a row.
Our goal is to help everyone beneﬁt from
improved communications and to spread the beneﬁts
of new technology as widely as possible. This is
demonstrated, for example, by our wide deployment of
broadband technology throughout the UK, and by the
BT Education Programme, which has enabled more
than two million young people to participate in a
drama-based campaign designed to help them improve
their communications skills.
Strategic progress and outlook
The strong growth in new wave turnover, our ICT order
book and broadband shows that our strategy is
working. We remain committed to that strategy and
are conﬁdent in our ability to deliver our key strategic
goals.
We’ve come a long way since May 2001, when
your Board announced a radical plan to reduce debts,
manage costs and improve customer satisfaction.
We’ve established a solid platform for future growth
and success.
None of this could have happened without the
loyalty and support of our shareholders, customers,
suppliers and employees. Given the continued support
of all our stakeholders, we will build on this success
and accelerate the transformation of our business.
Sir Christopher Bland
Chairman
19 May 2004
Chairman’s message
3 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 We live in an era of greater customer
choice than we have ever seen before. This
choice is good for customers and good for
our industry.
Changes in technology are leading to changes in
people’s behaviour. People are, for example, spending
more time on the internet and sending information by
e-mail, where once they would have used the phone or
fax.
This transformation is putting converged services
at the heart of our offering, enabling our customers to
communicate wherever they happen to be.
As we move from a narrowband to a broadband
world, we are offering a new mix of products and
services in new markets – ICT, broadband, mobility
and managed services.
‘‘Technology substitution’’ is also having a
signiﬁcant impact in our traditional voice markets,
where ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed voice revenues were down in both
the consumer and business markets.
This is both a challenge and an opportunity. We
have to respond to those changes in technology, the
market and behaviour, at the same time as working to
accelerate them.
We have to be absolutely focused on defending
and reinventing our traditional markets, through
imaginative sales and marketing, through delivering
the right products at the right prices. And we have to
follow our customers where they want to go, offering
them new, ﬂexible services that match their changing
personal and business needs.
Customer satisfaction
Our passion for customers is at the heart of everything
we do.
A year ago we launched our brand promise to
make every customer experience ‘‘simple and
complete.’’ This is essential to driving down customer
dissatisfaction, which remains a critical goal for us. In
the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we reduced dissatisfaction by
22%.
As customer dissatisfaction is driven down, so is
the cost of failure. A great customer experience – and
cost savings – really can be two sides of the same coin.
Getting things right for customers the ﬁrst time keeps
them loyal, contributes to cost effectiveness, and
boosts our reputation.
New wave business
ICT used to be an aspiration; it’s now a reality. We had
a superb year with ICT orders worth more than
£7 billion – up 59% on just a year ago. The three deals
we signed with the NHS, for example – expected to be
worth more than £2.1 billion – indicate our strength in
this market.
I believe that we have something very special to
offer – the ability to act as ‘‘the telco inside’’ our
customers’ organisations. We offer our customers –
businesses and other large organisations, including
local and national government – the chance to enhance
their productivity, through expert management of their
information systems, desktop to desktop.
And we have a full range of network-centric ICT
solutions depending on what our customers want –
from full service assurance across their ICT
infrastructure, through monitoring levels of service
throughout their operations, to validation of their
networks, data centres and desktops.
Broadband
It’s been a tremendous year for broadband as well.
People were sceptical when we said we’d reach two
million DSL wholesale lines by the summer of 2004.
What nobody expected was that we would achieve two
million in February 2004. As at 14 May 2004, we had
2.45 million – and climbing. The UK is now moving
towards the top of the broadband league.
And our programme for upgrading our exchanges
to broadband has been extremely effective in bringing
the beneﬁts of this amazing technology to some of the
remoter parts of the UK. In April 2004, we announced
a roll-out plan that will bring broadband to 99.6% of
the UK’s homes and businesses.
The announcement, in May 2004, that we will
redesign and reduce the cost of our local loop
unbundling product, should encourage investment in
broadband infrastructure and promote innovation. It’s
a major move towards the telecommunications market
of the future.
In the consumer broadband market we’ve teamed
up with Yahoo! to offer compelling, world-class content
and launched a suite of new products that will enable
customers to get the most from broadband. A couple
of years ago we were among the ﬁrst to offer a
broadband connection for less than £30 a month. This
year we’ve broken the £20 barrier, with an entry-level
broadband product for just £19.99 a month.
Mobility
We also stepped back into the consumer mobility
market with BT Mobile Home Plan and we established
the high street presence that will enable us to offer
converged products and services in the future.
Again, our goal is to offer communications
ﬂexibility, enabling our customers to communicate the
information they choose, in the way that they choose,
using whatever communications device they choose.
In May 2004, we announced that we will be
working with Vodafone UK to dismantle the barriers
between ﬁxed and mobile services, by offering fully
converged, ﬁxed/mobile services in the business and
Chief Executive’s statement
4 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 consumer mobile markets. Our customers will beneﬁt
from being able to communicate and access the same
information and services however and wherever they
want; whether they are connected to a ﬁxed network
or on the move.
For our larger business customers we also offer
convergence, managing their ﬁxed and mobile
communications seamlessly.
And the growth of Wi-Fi (wireless broadband)
suggests that it could well be one of those
technologies which rapidly becomes a part of our
customers’ lives. Once they’ve experienced it, they
ﬁnd it hard to imagine life without it.
Traditional business
Given the impact of new technology and increasing
competition, voice call volumes may no longer be the
absolute guide to the health of the company that they
once were, but they remain a fundamental part of our
business and we are bringing an innovative approach
to product development, sales and marketing in the
voice calls business. Robust defence doesn’t mean
retreat, it means seizing new opportunities.
BT Together, for example, has been a major
success with around nine million customers. During the
year, we announced that we will be abolishing the
standard rate for our existing customers from 1 July
2004, and launched an enhanced range of option
packages. In the business calls market BT Business
Plan has had similar success – customer numbers were
up from 20,000 to 175,000 in the year. And BT Local
Business is demonstrating that getting close to our
customers can deliver signiﬁcant revenue beneﬁts.
Cost leadership
Cost leadership is vital to the accelerating
transformation of BT.
We can and must operate as efﬁciently and
effectively as possible, benchmarking our costs against
those of other European telecommunications
companies. Most recently, these comparisons showed
that our costs are better than average for large
telecommunications companies but that we still have
some way to go to achieve best-in-class costs.
In the last three years, we’ve made major reductions in
the costs of our operations and we’ve identiﬁed a
further £1 billion that can be achieved.
Our Hands Off Access Network (HOAN) project,
for example, is helping to improve network efﬁciency
by minimising manual network intervention and
reducing the need for exchange visits.
This is not about cutting corners or compromising
on service, but about ﬁnding innovative, cost-effective
new ways to meet customers’ needs.
And, over the next few years, we’ll be creating the
21st century network. We are transforming our
networks, converging them on to a modern, single,
multi-purpose platform that will enable us to reduce
costs, meet customers’ changing needs and improve
customer satisfaction. The 21st century network will
offer higher performance in return for lower operating
costs.
Our people
Of course, without the commitment and hard work of
BT people, our strategy would be nothing more than
words on the page.
A year ago, we introduced our new values –
trustworthy, helpful, inspiring, straightforward, heart.
Since then, our people have translated those values
into action, driving down customer dissatisfaction,
defending the traditional business and winning
business in new markets.
We’re very proud of what they’ve done and of
what they are continuing to do.

6 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 Introduction
BT Group plc is the listed holding company for an
integrated group of businesses that provides voice and
data services in the UK and overseas, particularly in
Europe, but also in the Americas and the Asia Paciﬁc
region. British Telecommunications plc is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of BT Group plc and holds virtually all
businesses and assets of the BT group.
Our aim is to increase shareholder value through
service excellence, an effective brand, our large-scale
networks and our existing customer base, and also
through innovation in products, services and solutions.
These increasingly build on our strengths in ICT
(information and communications technology),
broadband, IP (internet protocol) and solutions.
BT is the UK’s largest communications service
provider, by market share, to the residential and
business markets, supplying over 20 million customers
with a wide range of communications products and
services, including voice, data, internet and
multimedia services, and offering a comprehensive
range of managed and packaged communications
solutions.
Our core portfolio covers traditional telephony
products such as calls, analogue/digital lines and
private circuits. New wave revenue generation is
focused on ICT, broadband, mobility and managed
services.
In the UK wholesale market, we provide network
services and solutions – including broadband ADSL
(asymmetric digital subscriber line), interconnect,
transit and private circuits – to other operators. We
serve around 500 communications companies, ﬁxed
and mobile network operators, and service providers.
We aim to build complete communications packages
and work with our customers to help them succeed in
their businesses.
Our aim in these markets is to continue to increase
proﬁtable revenues from data and advanced
broadband and internet services, which will further
reduce our dependence on revenues and proﬁt
generated by traditional ﬁxed-line voice services.
In the year ended 31 March 2004 (the 2004
ﬁnancial year), 93% of our revenues were derived from
operations within the UK.
Outside the UK, we supply managed services and
solutions to multi-site organisations worldwide. Our
core target market is the top 10,000 global multi-site
corporations and European multi-site organisations.
Building on our existing relationships with large multi-
site organisations in the UK and internationally, we
provide global reach and a complete range of ICT
solutions and services.
Our extensive global communications network and
strong strategic partnerships enable us to serve
customers in the key commercial centres of Europe,
North America and the Asia Paciﬁc region. In Europe,
this network links more than 270 towns and cities
across 19 countries to our UK network, and beyond
into the Americas and the Asia Paciﬁc region.
Our global communications services portfolio
ranges from desktop and network equipment and
software, transport and connectivity, managed LAN
(local area network), WAN (wide area network) and
IPVPN (internet protocol virtual private network)
services, applications hosting, storage and security
services, through to business transformation and
change management.
Governance
BT’s policy is to achieve best practice in our standards
of business integrity in all our operations, in line with
our published statement of business practice – The Way
We Work. This includes a commitment to maintaining
the highest standards of corporate governance
throughout the group (see Corporate governance).
Corporate social responsibility
BT is committed to enhancing its positive impact on
society through leadership in CSR (corporate social
responsibility). In our view, a well managed CSR
programme supports the delivery of strategy and is in
the best interests of customers, shareholders,
employees and the community (see Our commitment
to society).
From Oftel to Ofcom
The UK regulatory environment changed in 2003
when, on 25 July, the Communications Act came into
force, bringing in a new regulator – the Ofﬁce of
Communications (Ofcom) – and a new regulatory
framework.
See Regulation, competition and prices for more
information on Ofcom’s duties and powers, and the
Communications Act.
Group structure
Background
Telephone services in almost all of the UK were, until
1981, provided by the Post Ofﬁce, which was a
government department until 1969, when it was
established as a state public corporation. In 1981, the
postal and telecommunications services of the Post
Ofﬁce became the responsibility of two separate
corporations, with British Telecommunications – under
the trading name of British Telecom – taking over the
telecommunications business.
As a result of the Telecommunications Act 1984,
British Telecommunications plc was incorporated in
England and Wales as a public limited company, wholly
owned by the UK Government.
In November 1984, the UK Government offered
3,012 million ordinary shares (50.2% of the total
issued ordinary shares) to the public. British Telecom
shares made their debut on the London Stock
Exchange on 3 December 1984. From April 1991,
British Telecommunications plc traded as BT.
In December 1991, the UK Government sold over
half its remaining shares in BT, retaining a holding of
about 22%. It sold this residual holding in July 1993.
In 1985, Cellnet, the mobile phone operator, was
launched as a joint venture between British Telecom
and Securicor, which held 40% of the company. BT
acquired full control of Cellnet (now O
2
UK – part of
mmO
2
plc) by acquiring Securicor’s minority holding in
November 1999.
7 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 In January 2000, BT and AT&T established Concert as
a 50/50 joint venture serving customers around the
world and transferred their trans-border assets and
operations to Concert.
2002 restructuring
During the 2002 ﬁnancial year, we substantially
completed a radical restructuring programme, the key
elements of which were:
& the UK’s largest-ever rights issue – raising
£5.9 billion
& the demerger of the majority of BT’s mobile
businesses
& the disposal of signiﬁcant non-core businesses and
assets
& the unwind of Concert, BT’s joint venture with
AT&T
& the creation of customer-focused lines of business.
This restructuring resulted in a signiﬁcant
reduction of our debt levels.
Demerger of mmO
2
On 19 November 2001, we completed the demerger
of mmO
2
, comprising what were BT’s wholly-owned
mobile assets in Europe.
Concert
On 1 April 2002, we completed the unwind of Concert.
The assets taken back into our ownership have been
rationalised and integrated with our existing operations
with the aim of optimising performance of the business
and simplifying the product set for our customers.
Acquisitions and disposals prior to the 2004
ﬁnancial year
Between the 1999 and 2002 ﬁnancial years, we made
a number of signiﬁcant acquisitions, including a stake
in J-Phone Communications and Japan Telecom and
control of Viag Interkom in Germany.
During the 2002 ﬁnancial year, reﬂecting the
change in the group’s strategy, we disposed of a
number of businesses and assets, including Yell – our
international directories and e-commerce business –
and our stakes in Japan Telecom, J-Phone
Communications and Airtel – the Spanish wireless
operator.
In January 2003, we completed the sale of our
26% stake in Cegetel Groupe SA, the leading
alternative ﬁxed-line operator in France, to Vivendi
Universal for £2.6 billion in cash. After accounting for
goodwill written back from reserves, BT realised a
proﬁt of approximately £1.5 billion before an
exceptional interest charge of £0.3 billion on closing
out ﬁxed interest rate swaps.
Also in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, we disposed of a
number of non-core investments, including our stakes
in BSkyB, Mediaset, Blu and SmarTone.
Acquisitions and disposals in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year
In July 2003, BT received full repayment of loan notes
issued by Yell plc, the principal and accrued interest
totalling £109 million. The notes, redeemable in 2013
and accruing interest at LIBOR, became repayable, in
full, on the IPO (initial public offering) of Yell.
In December 2003, BT issued bonds worth
£99 million, maturing in December 2008, which are
exchangeable into our 16.6% holding in LG Telecom
(LGT) shares. LGT is a wireless telecommunications
service provider in the Republic of Korea. At a 17.5%
premium to LGT’s current share price at the time of
issue and a coupon of 0.75%, this was an efﬁcient way
to monetise our shareholding in LGT.
In December 2003, we sold our 7.8% stake in
Inmarsat Ventures – a provider of global mobile
satellite communication services – for a total cash
consideration of £67 million.
In January 2004, we acquired the UK operations of
NSB Retail Systems, a supplier of software products
and services to the retail market for a consideration of
£17 million. We also became NSB’s exclusive
distributor in the UK and Ireland.
Also in January 2004 we announced an offer for
the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of
Transcomm plc, at a price of 15.5 pence per share,
valuing the company at £16 million. Transcomm is one
of the leading providers of data-only wireless services
in the UK. In March 2004, the offer was declared
wholly unconditional and in April 2004, more than
90% of Transcomm’s shareholders had accepted the
offer, enabling us compulsorily to purchase the
remaining shares in the company.
How BT operates
BT consists principally of three lines of business: BT
Retail, BT Wholesale and BT Global Services.
BT Retail and BT Wholesale operate almost
entirely within the UK, addressing the consumer, major
corporate, business and wholesale markets, and offer a
broad spectrum of communications products and
services. BT Global Services is BT’s managed services
and solutions provider, serving the needs of global,
multi-site corporations and European multi-site
organisations. These three lines of business are
focused on providing a simple and complete
experience for our customers.

In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, consumer revenues declined
by 2% to £5,974 million.
Our strategy in the consumer market is to defend
traditional revenues and market share vigorously
through innovative service offerings backed by
innovative marketing and excellent quality of service,
at the same time as driving for new wave revenues,
particularly in the areas of ICT, broadband and
mobility.

charges) was £268 in the 2004 ﬁnancial year,
compared with £271 in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
In the consumer market, new wave revenues grew
by 135% from £95 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year to
£223 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year, driven
principally by broadband.
The number of UK consumer DSL (digital
subscriber line) lines grew by 132%.
Business customers
As at 31 March 2004, we had over one million
business customers worldwide, with more than nine
million exchange lines.
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, major corporate
revenues increased by 2% to £5,909 million. The
increase in new wave turnover of 21% to
£2,452 million was driven by ICT, broadband and by
mobility, not only in the UK but also globally.
Our strategy in the major corporate market is to drive
a continued migration from traditional voice-only
services to managed ICT solutions. This enables us to
build closer and more integrated relationships with our
customers, enabling them to manage their
communications spend more effectively and gain
competitive advantage in their markets.
In the SME market (companies with between one
and 500 employees), our strategy is to provide
business customers with tailored communications
products and services that enable them to manage
their business more simply and efﬁciently. Although we
increased the number of BT Business Plan customers,
the contraction of the ﬁxed-call market and regulation-
driven price cuts in our telephony services reduced our
traditional turnover. This reduction was only partially
offset by robust and continued turnover growth in new
wave services. Overall, in the SME market during the
2004 ﬁnancial year, revenues reduced by 4% to
£2,600 million.
Wholesale customers
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, turnover from our wholesale
activities totalled £4,002 million, a decline of 3%.
In the UK, external turnover from BT Wholesale
activities was £3,445 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year, compared with £3,525 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year.
New wave revenues were £361 million, up 54% on
the 2003 ﬁnancial year. This growth has been achieved
through broadband and the provision of tailored
managed services to UK wholesale customers.
In the coming year, our strategic emphasis for
growth will continue to move from the capital-intensive
products of our traditional portfolio to broadband, ICT
and mobility.
We aim to provide the right solution, be it
application, service or product, for our wholesale
customers in order that we can continue to build our
new wave revenues.
In our global carrier business, revenues were
£557 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year, down from
£585 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. Our global
carrier business customers include other ﬁxed-line
telecommunications operators, mobile operators and
selected internet service providers.
Report structure
For the purposes of this Business review,we are
reporting on each of our strategic priorities.
For ﬁnancial reporting purposes, we continue to
report by line of business (see Financial review).
Other businesses
As at 31 March 2004, we held stakes in a number of
other businesses, including:
& stakes in three satellite entities – Eutelsat, Intelsat
and New Skies
& a 16.6% stake in LG Telecom, a mobile cellular
telephone operator in the Republic of Korea
& an 11.9% stake in StarHub, a ﬁxed and mobile
communications operator and pay-TV operator in
Singapore.
9 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 Group strategy
Our strategy is to build long-term partnerships with
our customers. With their support, we aim to maximise
the potential of our traditional business – through a
combination of enhanced quality of service, creative
marketing, innovative pricing and cost efﬁciency –
while pursuing proﬁtable growth by migrating our
customers to new wave products and services such as
ICT, broadband, mobility and managed services.
Our strategic priorities are to:
& keep a relentless focus on improving customer
satisfaction
& put broadband at the heart of BT
& create mobility services and solutions
& transform our network for the twenty-ﬁrst century
& achieve competitive advantage through cost
leadership
& lead the world in network-centric ICT solutions
& reinvent our traditional business
& motivate our people and live the BT values.
Keep a relentless focus on improving customer
satisfaction
Reducing customer dissatisfaction by 25% a year over
three years, on a compound annual basis, to the 2005
ﬁnancial year is a key target in our drive to deliver the
highest levels of customer satisfaction. In the 2004
ﬁnancial year, we achieved a 22% reduction in
customer dissatisfaction, based on qualitative
customer research conducted by external agencies.
This follows a 37% reduction in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year.
The lines of business all reduced customer
dissatisfaction levels during the year.
We are working to remove barriers to providing
customers with excellent service and to involve all our
customer-facing people in improving our service.
For example, our retail customer-facing and
support teams participated in the my customer
programme, designed to improve our customers’
experience and to promote teamworking.
Examples of my customer successes include the
introduction of a new contact centre structure that
enables our people to handle more calls at the ﬁrst
point of contact and enabling engineering and contact
centre teams directly to update customer records.
Put broadband at the heart of BT
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we continued our drive to
enhance the awareness, availability and attractiveness
of broadband. As at 31 March 2004, in the highly
competitive retail market, BT’s share of consumer and
business broadband connections in the UK was 42%,
representing 928,000 lines.
We aim to be a major player in wholesale
broadband and data services in the UK.
Broadband for wholesale customers
& In February 2004, ahead of our target, BT’s
installed base of broadband lines reached two
million. We achieved the second million lines in
just over eight months. As at 31 March 2004, we
had 2.2 million broadband lines, which represents
growth of 177% on the previous year, and our
target is to reach ﬁve million by 2006. In March
2004, we were taking an average of 50,000 orders
a week. In total, 2,465 exchanges had been
upgraded by the end of the 2004 ﬁnancial year,
reaching more than 85% of the UK’s homes and
businesses. In May 2004, we announced further
broadband progress. The number of broadband
lines increased to 2.45 million, 2,652 exchanges
had been upgraded and total UK coverage reached
90%.
& The ﬁrst step was upgrading to broadband more
than 1,100 of our exchanges where there was a
clear commercial case for doing so. In July 2002,
we introduced a demand-driven registration
scheme, which enabled people in areas where the
exchange had not been upgraded to register an
interest. This hugely successful scheme attracted
more than 860,000 registrations, helping us
match our investment to demand. Because the
registration scheme gave us such a clear picture of
demand, we were able to announce in April 2004
the speeding up of the delivery of broadband
services to rural communities. The scheme is now
closed and we intend to roll out broadband to a
further 1,128 exchanges by no later than the
summer of 2005. This will help bring broadband to
exchanges serving 99.6% of UK homes and
businesses.
& We continue to explore commercially viable ways
of bringing wireless broadband to rural
communities. In December 2003, for example, we
launched a trial of wireless broadband at sites
throughout the UK.
& The commercial launch of BT DataStream
Symmetric and BT IPStream Symmetric to 150
exchanges during the year signiﬁcantly
strengthened our portfolio of business-class
broadband services, which service providers can
offer their customers. Based on SDSL (symmetric
digital subscriber line) technology, it provides the
same rate upstream and downstream and is
suitable for the SME, remote ofﬁce and
teleworking access markets.
& In November 2003, we introduced a new, faster
broadband service for wholesale customers. BT
IPStream Home 1000 is a self-install product for
residential customers who want greater bandwidth
than the standard 512Kbit/s available at present.
& In May 2004, we announced that we are to
redesign and cut the price for our LLU (local loop
unbundling) product by between 15% and up to
70% in a phased series of price cuts. We believe
that this move will beneﬁt those companies that
are willing to innovate and invest in broadband
infrastructure. The new LLU product will be closer
to simpler continental European models and we
aim to bring it to the market within six months.
Immediate price cuts should ensure that there is
sustainable demand prior to launch and help
potential customers plan ahead with conﬁdence.
(See Other market reviews).
10 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 & We also announced that we will be adjusting the
price of Datastream products to ensure there are
adequate margins between Datastream and
IPStream Home 500. The details will be
announced by the end of May 2004.

Broadband for consumers
During the year, we focused on improving sales
processes, reduced the cost of our broadband help-
desk operations and increased the number of orders
placed online. We also launched several additions to
our family of products and announced trials and
launches of a new set of value-added products and
services.
& In September 2003, BT and Yahoo! relaunched
the Openworld consumer internet service as BT
Yahoo! Broadband, a broadband internet service
combining high-quality access and a wide range of
content and services, for the same price as the
existing BT Openworld Broadband offering. The
service combines high-quality access with
compelling content and services such as intelligent
personalisation (to help understand our customers’
needs and tailor content accordingly),
LAUNCHcast (a personalised radio station),
advanced security services – including anti-spam,
e-mail anti-virus and a free ﬁrewall – news, sport
and entertainment.
& In October 2003, we launched a broadband access
product for gamers – Broadband from BT for
Online Console Gaming.
& December 2003 saw the launch of our BT
Broadband Voice package, which enables cable
broadband customers to make voice calls over the
internet. This was the ﬁrst move by a major UK
player into the consumer VOIP (voice over IP)
market.
& In January 2004, we offered our fastest-ever
consumer internet service, a 1Mbit/s broadband
service through BT Yahoo! Broadband and BT
Broadband. This is twice the speed of ordinary
broadband and up to 20 times faster than
traditional dial-up internet. The service is available
to customers living within approximately
3.5 kilometres of a broadband-enabled exchange –
around 75% of existing broadband users.
& In March 2004, we launched BT Broadband Basic,
a simple to use, 0.5Mbit/s broadband entry level
service, for under £20 a month.
& From March 2004, our broadband advertising
changed to focus on the range of our broadband
portfolio – a set of broadband products which give
the consumer choice.
& In March 2004, we announced a set of broadband
products and services for consumers that will be at
the heart of our broadband lifestyle strategy, as
the priorities in the market switch from access to
content, applications, ﬂexibility and managed
services. Flexible Bandwidth, which began trials in
April 2004, enables users to increase bandwidth –
up to 2Mbit/s – temporarily or permanently. BT
Rich Media, launched in April 2004, is a platform
that enables content providers to make content
easily available to users. BT Communicator
enables consumers to use a home PC for VOIP,
instant messaging, text messaging and other
related services. Trials will begin later this year.
Broadband for business customers
& In January 2004, we rebranded our business
broadband products and business broadband
information portal, in order to simplify our
offerings. BT Openworld Broadband products
became BT Business Broadband products and our
revamped business information portal became BT
Broadband Ofﬁce. BT Business Broadband
remained the leading ISP for SMEs in the UK. As
at March 2004, we had over 240,000 business
customers. Around 40% of these customers use
value-added services such as the Internet Security
Pack and the Internet Business Pack.
& During the ﬁnancial year, BT Business Broadband
joined forces with a number of companies to
enhance its networking and value-added services.
These companies include: Siebel e.pages,
Worldpay, Interland, learndirect, 2Wire and Lexis
Nexis.
& As part of our drive to break down perceived
barriers to broadband adoption and to accelerate
take-up rates, we offered SME customers savings
and activation deals worth up to £260 during the
summer of 2003 on a range of broadband
products (BT Business Broadband, 500 PLUS,
1,000 PLUS and 2,000 PLUS).
& At the end of the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we were
connecting around 500 business customers to
broadband every day.
& In April 2004, we announced that we had joined
forces with Microsoft to launch a one-stop shop IT
and broadband solution. BT Connected &
Complete, featuring Microsoft technology, gives
small businesses access to regularly updated and
individually tailored IT software and support –
previously available only to large companies.
BT Connected & Complete will, for the ﬁrst time,
provide small businesses with secure broadband
11 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 access, applications service, support and
maintenance, all from a single source and on one
bill.
Create mobility services and solutions
Mobility for consumers
In the consumer mobility market our strategy is to
build a foundation for the delivery of added-value,
ﬁxed/mobile convergent solutions.
& The launch of BT Mobile Home Plan was a major
step back into the mass mobility market and a ﬁrst
step towards a converged ﬁxed/mobile service. BT
Mobile Home Plan is targeted at families and its
features include bundled, ﬁxed-price packages of
call minutes, lower line rental and free short calls
home to the family ﬁxed line. The launch was
supported by a major advertising campaign. As at
31 March 2004, we had over 41,000 contract
customers (for BT Mobile Home Plan and
BT Mobile Sense, a previous mobile consumer
offering). BT Mobile Home Plan is available
through bt.com, BT’s direct voice channels and
over 1,000 retail outlets (Carphone Warehouse,
The Link and Phones 4U).
& In May 2004, we announced plans to launch
Project Bluephone – the ﬁrst step towards handset
convergence. Project Bluephone removes the need
to own more than one phone as customers will be
able to use a single device that can switch
seamlessly between ﬁxed and mobile networks,
offering a better service with more guaranteed
coverage and lower overall costs. A ‘‘soft launch’’,
involving more than 1,000 users, is planned for
the summer of 2004 and a full launch for later in
the year.
Mobility for business customers
We are a service provider in the business mobile
market and had over 103,000 business connections at
31 March 2004.
BT provides a range of managed mobile services to
UK and global customers who either outsource their
mobile communications entirely or rely on BT to
provide speciﬁc managed services, such as supplier
management or managed billing for mobility.
& The introduction of BT Mobile Ofﬁce – a
convergent, multi-access remote and ﬂexible
solution – in September 2003 made it possible for
business customers to access their corporate
networks via a single, smart log-in application.
& During the year, we established our position as a
major UK provider of public wireless broadband
(Wi-Fi) services. As at 31 March 2004, we had
almost 2,400 Openzone live sites throughout the
UK. In January 2004, we reached agreement with
McDonald’s to install Openzone access points in
more than 500 McDonald’s restaurants. We also
started installing Openzone access points in our
public telephone network. The target is to have
4,000 access points throughout the UK by the end
of summer 2004. In January 2004, we sponsored
Wireless Broadband Week, which offered seven
days of free access to BT Openzone and saw trafﬁc
in the network increase by 133%. In February
2004, we announced a global deal with British
Airways to install Openzone access points in 80 of
its main customer lounges around the world.
& The acquisition of Transcomm in 2004 enhanced
BT’s position in providing remote monitoring and
management information services for business
customers in the UK. Remote monitoring enables
the control of electronic devices over long
distances, helping businesses to manage their
assets and risks. Devices which can be remotely
monitored include: ﬁre and burglar alarms,
vending machines, refrigerators, EPOS (electronic
point of sale) terminals, parking meters and
distribution ﬂeets. Through our BT Redcare
operation, BT is already a leading player in ﬁxed-
line M2M (machine to machine) applications in the
UK. This acquisition enhances our M2M service
offering by adding wireless capabilities.
Mobility for wholesale customers
For wholesale customers, we will move towards our
strategy in the UK wholesale mobile arena which is to
defend our traditional mobility revenues and to grow
the new mobility business.
& We reached agreement to provide Vodafone UK
with a managed access transmission network in
the UK, connecting its base stations to its core
switches. Vodafone will beneﬁt from simpliﬁcation
of processes – including a formalised payment
structure – as well as access to any new
technologies implemented by BT within the ﬁve-
year term of the contract.
Transform our network for the twenty-ﬁrst century
Our UK network today
In the UK, we have 873 local and trunk processor
units, 121.7 million kilometres of copper wire and
7.3 million kilometres of optical ﬁbre. The network
services we provide include Frame Relay, ATM
(asynchronous transfer mode) and IPVPN, and we have
the most extensive IP backbone network in the UK. We
interconnect with over 100 other operators, as well as
carrying transit trafﬁc between telecommunications
operators.
Our global reach
In Europe, we own operations in Belgium, France,
Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain, Scandinavia and
Central and Eastern Europe. We deliver service to our
customers in Italy through our joint venture, Albacom,
and our applications hosting company, I.Net. In the
Americas and the Asia Paciﬁc region, we deliver service
to our customers through a combination of direct sales
and services operations and strategic partners.
Our network-based services (Frame Relay, ATM
and IPVPN) extend to and across North and South
America and the Asia Paciﬁc region. This means that
products are delivered seamlessly within and from
Europe to our own locations in the Americas and
delivered locally through interconnect and supply
agreements with regional carriers.
12 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 & As at 31 March 2004, our ﬂagship MPLS (multi-
protocol label switching) product, which was
launched in 2002, had 1,000 points of presence
around the globe and could be accessed from
more than 70 countries. MPLS-based IP virtual
private networks are the next generation of data
networks for corporate customers, supporting
voice, data and video applications, offering
enhanced ﬂexibility and service performance.
MPLS revenues grew by 102% during the 2004
ﬁnancial year.
Global customer service is provided via service and
network management centres around the world,
24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Twenty-ﬁrst century network
As one of our strategic priorities, we are working to
create an intelligent, ﬂexible and customer-focused
network for the 21st century (21CN). BT’s 21CN is
designed to support the next generation of services
and revenues for BT and for our wholesale customers,
while enhancing the customer experience and reducing
costs through greater network intelligence and
automation.
21CN aims to support the end-to-end
transformation of BT’s wholesale business and is
designed to deliver tangible beneﬁts to our customers’
businesses. The multi-service capabilities of 21CN
were reﬁned during a period of consultation with many
of the leading communications operators in the
industry, as well as technical and equipment vendors
from around the world.
The phased introduction of the new platform will
support communication in a range of formats and
across multiple devices. 21CN will also introduce new
levels of network simplicity, intelligence and ﬂexibility
and will aim to support the delivery of new revenue-
generating services faster than is currently possible.
This is an innovative, long-term transformation
programme which is already delivering beneﬁts for our
customers. Key developments in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year included:
& a programme of industry consultation to help
reﬁne the network’s technical architecture
requirements.
& BT’s supplier base for next-generation exchange
equipment to support voice, video and data was
expanded following comprehensive assessments
and trials.
& advanced next-generation network component and
services trials will enable us to begin to move
21CN from the laboratory to the live network over
the next 12 months.
& we continued to eradicate duplication, increase
efﬁciency and reduce network operating costs. For
example, our Hands Off Access Network project is
helping to improve efﬁciency by minimising
manual network intervention and reducing
exchange visits.
We expect to launch a range of new commercial
broadband services over the next 12 months. These
include:
& variable bandwidth – giving users the power to
boost temporarily broadband speeds online,
providing access to premium content such as
DVD-quality streamed videos or online gaming.
& digital content management – capitalising on
ﬂexible bandwidth, we are launching a platform to
support the management and distribution of new
digital content.
& voice over IP – domestic customers will be able to
manage all personal communications from a home
PC, enabling phone or video calls over broadband
connections.
During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we undertook a
detailed technical and economic analysis of the options
for 21CN deployment. The 2005 ﬁnancial year will see
the initial stages of implementation and live technical
trials will begin, prior to investment and deployment
decisions being taken.
Capital expenditure is expected to rise, but remain
within the group’s £3 billion annual target, in the 2005
ﬁnancial year as the group invests in its 21CN
programme.
Achieve competitive advantage through cost
leadership
Our focus on continued operational efﬁciencies helped
reduce overall group operating costs before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items by £348 million in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year. Some of the savings in
traditional activities have been re-invested in growing
new wave activities.
Looking forward, we have identiﬁed additional
efﬁciency savings of over £1 billion which we aim to
achieve over the next three years by focusing on
reducing the costs of failure, complexity and
duplication and by working smarter. For example, we
will continue to use new technology to develop more
cost-effective relationships with our customers.
& As at 31 March 2004, we had a total of 4.4 million
online relationships with customers (via bt.com)
and 1.2 million customers receiving e-bills.
& During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we completed our
Next Generation Contact Centre programme,
having achieved our three-year target of
£150 million annual savings by 31 March 2004.
(The reduction in the 2004 ﬁnancial year was
£63.6 million). We also invested 1.5 million hours
in training contact centre people and continued to
rationalise the number of sites – down from 104 to
41 in the last three ﬁnancial years. We invested
£45 million in upgrading environmental standards
and deploying new systems and technology.
We are driving for cost leadership within the
telecoms industry. Although we currently benchmark
well against many other large European
telecommunications companies, we remain less
efﬁcient than the best in class in our industry. We aim
to narrow that gap signiﬁcantly over the next three
years.
Lead the world in network-centric ICT solutions
Our strategy in the ICT market is to establish BT as a
global ICT player capable of competing with the
13 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 world’s best in selected growth markets – outsourcing;
IP infrastructure; broadband; mobility; managed
desktop solutions; and CRM. These are the markets in
which communication and networking skills are
signiﬁcant, migration is from our traditional markets,
our brand has value and in which partnerships
proﬁtably supplement our capability.
ICT for business customers
As applications such as email and ofﬁce productivity
software are increasingly being networked, networks
are increasingly seen as vital to productivity and
competitive advantage.
ICT revenues for the 2004 ﬁnancial year were
£2.6 billion, a rise of 19% on the 2003 ﬁnancial year,
itself a rise of 8% on the previous year. We aim to
deliver ICT solutions to large business customers and
other organisations (particularly in the public and
government sectors), which give them the
communications tools they need for proﬁtability and/or
business improvement.
Our larger or more complex and global customer
contracts are delivered through or managed by our BT
Global Solutions and BT Syntegra businesses. BT
Global Solutions’ portfolio covers a number of key
ICT-related areas including IP infrastructure, CRM,
applications and hosting, and outsourcing. BT
Syntegra offers business transformation and change
management services and is a key player in the global
trading systems market. BT Global Solutions and
BT Syntegra won business worth more than £7 billion
during the 2004 ﬁnancial year.

& The highest proﬁle contracts in the year were
three NHS contracts which are expected to be
worth more than £2.1 billion and form an integral
part of the National Programme for Information
Technology in the NHS. These contracts represent
some of the largest BT has ever won.
One, worth up to £620 million over ten years is
to design, deliver and manage a national patient
record database and transactional messaging
service for the NHS Care Records Service. This will
provide all 50 million NHS patients in England with
an individual electronic care record and connect
more than 30,000 GPs and 270 acute community
and mental health NHS trusts in a single, secure
national system.
A second contract, expected to be worth up to
£996 million over ten years, is to design, deliver
and operate integrated local patient record
applications and systems for the whole of the
London care community.
The third, worth an estimated £533 million over
seven years, is to procure, integrate and manage
high-speed, broadband networking services for the
New National Network for the NHS.
& Capgemini UK chose BT under a ten-year
sub-contract with a total sales order value of
approximately £364 million as the
telecommunication and WAN supplier for service
delivery to the Inland Revenue.
& Other signiﬁcant wins included a six-year contract
with ITV to create a new multimedia network and
a ﬁve-year deal with Alliance & Leicester worth
£10.5 million to upgrade its existing network
infrastructure to IP.
& In February 2004, we launched BT Applications
Assured Infrastructure (AAI), designed to help
organisations understand and master the complex
interactions that occur within their
communications infrastructure – from desktop to
data centre. With AAI, it becomes possible to
guarantee that the performance of our customers’
ICT systems supports their business priorities and
enhances their efﬁciency. This new proposition
combines BT’s extensive experience in the
provision of corporate data networks and hosting
with our professional services capability.
& In the ﬁrst quarter of 2004, BT became the ﬁrst
UK-based company to introduce Siebel CRM
OnDemand to businesses in the UK, enabling
SMEs and divisions of larger businesses to
organise, manage and streamline their sales,
marketing and customer service activity through a
hosted environment. Customers can access the
service either as an integrated part of BT’s existing
Siebel-based Contract Central CRM portfolio,
which provides a full multimedia contact centre
solution, or as a stand-alone CRM application.
& In May 2004, BT and HP announced plans to
develop a strategic alliance to address mutual
growth opportunities jointly in the global ICT
marketplace. As a ﬁrst step, we have signed
managed service agreements with a combined
value of US$1.5 billion over the next seven years.
Under these agreements, HP will manage BT’s
mid-range and desktop ICT infrastructure in the
UK, and BT will manage HP’s voice and data
network and product support call centres in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
ICT for consumers
& Initiatives under the ‘‘Home of Possibilities’’
programme aim to bring the beneﬁts of
broadband into the home. BT Home Networking
enables customers to connect a number of PCs to
broadband simultaneously, without wires. And in
December 2003, we introduced a broadband-
14 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 enabled entertainment service, in partnership with
Phillips, which enables customers to stream online
radio stations and download music to any part of
the house – wirelessly.
& BT Home Computing is a leading provider of
computing technology in line with the
Government’s Home Computing Initiative
legislation, which enables companies to provide
employees with the use of computers at rates
signiﬁcantly below high street prices.
ICT for wholesale customers
To further our growth strategy, we aim to be the
network ICT supplier and sales channel of choice,
serving major corporate and government users, and to
serve SME and consumer end-users, building on our
existing intermediate and broadband portfolio.
& We signed wholesale ICT deals including a
contract, estimated at £5.5 million, to provide
Fibernet, the bespoke network service provider,
with a fully managed voice network and a
managed services contract with Intelliplus Group,
a subsidiary of Eckoh Technologies.
Reinvent our traditional business
We face continued challenges in our traditional
markets as a result of regulatory intervention,
competition and a shift in our customers’ buying
patterns, as we provide them with higher-speciﬁcation,
high-value, new wave products.
Private circuit volumes fell, due to the switch into
lower-priced partial private circuits (as a result of
regulatory intervention).
Total ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed voice call minutes in the UK
market declined by an estimated two percentage
points in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. This was driven by
customers making use of alternatives such as mobile
calls, e-mail, instant messaging, corporate IPVPNs and
VOIP.
However, call minutes are less important to BT as
customer take-up of pricing packages continues and
we actively migrate customers to new wave services
such as broadband.
Traditional services for consumers
& The BT Together pricing packages, which offer a
range of competitive call prices and ﬁxed-fee
pricing options, are an important part of our
traditional revenue defence strategy, and had
around nine million customers as at 31 March
2004. During the year, we announced we would
abolish the standard rate on 1 July 2004 to give
more value for money. Existing standard rate
customers will move to join those already on BT
Together Option 1, which will become the
benchmark for our ﬁxed-line call prices.
& We transformed more than 1,300 payphones in
UK high streets, shopping centres, airports and
stations into internet kiosks, offering internet
access, e-mail, text messaging and video. These
kiosks give fast access to a range of services, from
news and sport to shopping, games, local maps
and information about shops and restaurants. We
also continued to offer space in our payphone
kiosks for mobile antennas, Wi-Fi hotspots and
CCTV (closed-circuit television).
& During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we launched new
calling card products to serve the needs of
businesses and international travellers, including a
virtual card for data-only users.
& The immediate impact of the opening up to
competition of the directory enquiries market in
the UK in August 2003 was signiﬁcantly to reduce
the overall size of the market. Volumes of calls
have continued to decline since deregulation.
According to the latest ﬁgures from Ofcom, calls
to all 118 service providers from the BT network in
the April 2004 sample were 23% down on
September 2003. However, since deregulation,
calls to BT Directories 118 services have
performed far better than the total market. Calls
to 118 500 are 30% up on the level experienced
immediately following the 192 switch-off.
& We successfully re-entered the classiﬁed
directories market with The BT Phone Book. 62,300
advertisers have signed up and 116 directories
have been published, achieving market
penetration of 5% in the ﬁrst year. Our online
directory enquiries service, www.bt.com/
directoryenquiries, is the leading online player in
the market, with almost 1.5 million searches
(business name, residential and classiﬁed) a week.
The classiﬁed service is currently generating more
than one million searches a month.
Traditional services for business customers
& During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we introduced an
enhanced version of BT Business Plan offering a
ten pence price cap on calls to the US and a
20 pence cap on calls to Europe and certain
countries in the Asia Paciﬁc region. We also
reduced the annual spend commitment to £250.
As at 31 March 2004, BT Business Plan had over
175,000 customers, compared with 20,000 as at
31 March 2003.
& Our innovative BT Local Business initiative helped
us gain traction in the SME market by building
closer relationships with smaller business
customers, who are often more comfortable
dealing with other small companies rather than
large corporations. At the end of the 2004
ﬁnancial year, BT Local Business was active in
73 locations around the country and managing
£1.1 billion of annual billed turnover.
& BT remains the largest supplier of public and
managed payphones, strengthening our market
position during the year by securing a ﬁve-year
deal with BAA to supply traditional and new
multimedia payphones.
Traditional services for wholesale customers
Our strategy in the UK traditional wholesale market
has been to stem the decline in traditional revenues
while seeking areas for revenue growth. Our traditional
UK wholesale business has been under pressure from
several directions over the year. As 77% of our
15 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 traditional revenue is regulated, the impact of
regulatory changes served to reduce UK wholesale
revenues. The impact of the mobile termination rate
price cuts reduced our external UK wholesale revenue
by £126 million (4%) in the year. The reductions from
the regulatory network charge control pricing formulae
resulted in weighted average price reductions of
around 7% across the basket of relevant products.
New regulatory-driven products, such as carrier
pre-selection and wholesale access lines, necessitated
investment to create and introduce systems and
processes – all of which are at a cost. However, we
achieved a 1% increase in our UK external revenues
(excluding the impact of mobile termination rate cuts).
We have further developed our product portfolio,
launching products such as wholesale calls and ISDN
30 Service Provider. We have continued with our cost
reduction programmes across the business and
reduced our UK operating cost base by 4% over the
ﬁnancial year.
In May 2004, we announced we will be introducing
a new wholesale calls product for carrier pre-selection
(CPS) operators that will allow them to use BT directly
for certain calls at a price such that their overall costs
can be considerably reduced. This will be developed in
consultation with Ofcom and the industry, with interim
arrangements to be put in place from July 2004.
Motivate our people and live the BT values
Our people
As at 31 March 2004, we had a diverse workforce of
99,900 people, 91,600 of whom were employed in the
UK. To support our international operations, we
employ 8,300 people in 37 countries outside the UK.
Workforce ﬂexibility
The changing nature of the markets in which we
operate, our focus on cost leadership and our
investment in new services have impacted the shape of
our permanent workforce. During the 2004 ﬁnancial
year, 2,287 people joined BT, natural attrition was
running at 2.5% and, in the UK, 4,514 people left BT
under our voluntary paid leaver package.
The composition of our workforce is regularly
reviewed and, at the end of the 2004 ﬁnancial year,
managers and professionals represented 31% of our
workforce.
We supplemented our long-term customer contact
centre workforce in the UK with an additional
workforce of 4.6% outside the UK. This workforce is
under our direction and control.
We also instigated a review of our procurement
contracts for the employment of temporary and agency
workers. At 31 March 2004, we were working with ten
agencies, with costs for contingency workers (agency
and contractors) reducing year on year by 17%.
Shares and pensions
Since privatisation, we have been committed to
providing our employees with a stake in the company.
Under the BT Employee Share Investment Plan
(ESIP), employees can purchase shares in the company
from their pre-tax salaries. In addition, they can buy
shares at a discount under our savings-related share
option plans. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, £20 million
was allocated to provide free shares to employees
under the ESIP. (Employees outside the UK receive a
cash payment equivalent to the value of the shares.)
This allocation was linked to corporate performance
measures determined by the Board. 98% of eligible
employees participate in one or more of these plans.
Most of our employees are members of the BT
Pension Scheme or the BT Retirement Plan, both of
which are controlled by independent trustees. The BT
Pension Scheme was closed to new members on
31 March 2001. The majority of new employees are
eligible to join the BT Retirement Plan.
Listening to our people
Our annual employee attitude survey, most recently
conducted in early 2004, gives employees the chance
to express their opinions about the company, their
managers and the work they do. It encourages
managers and their teams to work together to
implement action plans to address speciﬁc issues. 80%
of people participated in the survey and the results
showed, for example, that 95% of employees are
committed to our customers and 90% feel that their
actions align with our brand and people values.
Employees are informed about our business
through a wide range of communications channels,
including our online news service, monthly newspaper,
regular e-mail bulletins and senior management web
chats and web cast brieﬁngs. This ensures that key
messages are available for everyone, with additional
information sourced on an ‘‘as needs’’ basis.
In the UK two main trade unions are recognised by
the company. In continental Europe, we have strong
relationships with the works councils, with which we
work closely, both on an operational basis and as
strategic stakeholders.
Health and safety
We have zero tolerance of workplace accidents and
have set rigorous targets to effect signiﬁcant
improvements across the company. During the 2004
ﬁnancial year, we beat our three-year targets set in
2000/01. Over the three years, we have reduced
workplace injuries by 40% and the number of cases of
occupational ill-health referred to our occupational
health service by 36%.
Diversity in our workforce
A work environment that actively supports all our
employees is central to BT’s culture. We champion
equality of opportunity – regardless of gender, race,
sexual orientation, disability or age – throughout the
company. Internal networks include the Womens’
Network (gender equality) and Kaleidoscope (sexual
orientation).
During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we were awarded
the platinum standard by Opportunity Now for our
work on gender equality, the gold standard by Race for
Opportunity for our work on race equality, and the
Business in the Community Diversity Award –
recognising our forward-thinking and diverse approach
16 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 to equal opportunities. We also work closely with the
Employers’ Forum on Disability.
Learning and ﬂexibility
In addition to culture change programmes, such as my
customer, during the year we spent over £61 million
(excluding staff and other direct costs) on the training
and development of our employees.
We have also increased the emphasis on
broadband, e-learning and self-teach opportunities.
This is particularly important as we extend our
practices of ﬂexible working. At 31 March 2004, we
had around 500 job sharers, 5,570 people working
part time and more than 7,900 people working from
home.
Research and development and IT support
BT Exact is BT’s research, technology and IT
operations business. It offers expertise and experience
in ICT, backed by a team of over 6,000 technologists
and one of the world’s largest communications
research and development facilities. The work
undertaken by BT Exact is part of an investment of
£334 million in research and development made by BT
in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. This compares with
£380 million and £362 million invested in the 2003
and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
At BT Exact’s core are our world-renowned
laboratories at Adastral Park near Ipswich, which have
been responsible for some of the world’s most
far-reaching advances in telecommunications
technology, including the advancement of single-mode
optical ﬁbre and of the technology and worldwide
standards behind passenger phones on aircraft and
videoconferencing.
Brightstar – BT’s business ‘‘incubator’’ with the
goal of commercialising our patent portfolio – was
created in January 2000. In March 2003, BT Exact
teamed up with Coller Capital and New Venture
Partners (NVP) to create a new, independent corporate
venturing partnership – NVP Brightstar.
BT remains a limited partner and NVP Brightstar
remains closely associated with BT Exact through
exclusive rights to continue to spin-out companies
from its R&D, professional and computing services
base. This venturing unit complements our existing
patent licensing programme, for which we have an
exclusive long-term arrangement with Silicon Valley-
based IPValue Management Inc.
Regulation, competition and prices
The commercial environment in the UK and in the
countries in which BT operates is increasingly
competitive and dynamic. However, we remain subject
to extensive regulation, particularly in the UK, which
can materially affect the way in which we carry out our
business. We also use inputs, such as networks and
services from other regulated operators, largely outside
the UK, and the availability and price of these inputs
may change from time to time, which in turn affects
our business.
Regulation in the UK
It is our policy to be fully compliant with the regulatory
framework in which we operate. During the 2004
ﬁnancial year, we reviewed our compliance activities
because we want to ensure that we continue to meet
the obligations imposed by the UK’s Communications
Act (previously the Telecommunications Act) and the
Competition Act while competing fairly and vigorously
within the rules. We have published an annual
compliance report which can be found in our social and
environment report at www.bt.com/betterworld.
Ofcom
The UK regulatory environment changed materially in
2003. On 25 July 2003, the Communications Act
2003 (‘‘the Communications Act’’) came into force,
bringing in a new regulator, the Ofﬁce of
Communications (Ofcom), and a new regulatory
framework for electronic communications networks and
services. Ofcom did not, however, assume its
regulatory functions until 29 December 2003 and, in
the transitional period, the existing regulators
continued to carry out Ofcom’s functions relating to
networks and services, and spectrum.
Ofcom was set up, as a result of the increasing
convergence between telecommunications,
broadcasting and radio, to provide a single, seamless
approach to regulation across the whole converging
marketplace. It amalgamates the roles of ﬁve former
regulatory agencies: the Director General of
Telecommunications (Oftel), the Independent
Television Commission, the Broadcasting Standards
Commission, the Radio Authority and the
Radiocommunications Agency.
Ofcom is headed by a board consisting of a
chairman and executive and non-executive members.
Currently, the chairman is Lord Currie and the chief
executive is Stephen Carter.
The main regulatory changes for providers of
electronic communications networks and services are:
& the regulator’s ability to impose conditions
without agreement
& the possibility of ﬁnes being imposed for breach of
regulatory obligations
& the availability of appeals against regulatory
decisions, based on their merits
& the creation of a new regulatory regime which,
among other things, implements the requirements
of the new EU Directives for general
authorisations, instead of individual licences, and
bases economic regulation on dominance, or
‘‘signiﬁcant market power’’ (SMP).
Ofcom’s duties and powers
Ofcom has a wide range of general and speciﬁc duties
laid down in the Communications Act. Below is a
summary of those duties and functions of particular
relevance to BT’s activities:
& the principal duty to further the interests of
citizens in relation to communications matters
and, secondly, to further the interests of
consumers, where appropriate, by promoting
competition. In doing so, Ofcom must secure,
17 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 among other things, the availability in the UK of a
wide range of electronic communications services.
& the duty to have regard to the principles under
which its regulatory activities should be
transparent, accountable, proportionate,
consistent and appropriately targeted.
& the duty to review regulatory burdens on a regular
basis and ensure that they do not involve the
imposition or maintenance of unnecessary
burdens.
& the functions of setting conditions of entitlement
(see Regulatory conditions), and enforcing those
conditions (see Enforcement). Ofcom’s decisions
are subject to appeal on the merits (see Appeals).
In carrying out its duties, Ofcom must consider
promoting competition and the use of effective
self-regulation; encouraging investment and
innovation; and encouraging the availability and use of
high-speed data services (including broadband).
Regulatory conditions
Under the new framework, based on 2003 EU
Directives, providers are no longer required to obtain
licences before offering telecommunications services.
Individual licences, such as that granted to BT in 1984,
no longer exist. Instead, there is a general
authorisation for anybody who wishes to provide
electronic communications networks and services.
Regulation is applied through separate sets of
conditions made by Ofcom, of which some apply to all
relevant communications providers and others are
imposed individually on particular providers which,
following a review of the relevant markets, are found to
have SMP, or which are designated as ‘‘universal
service providers’’. Other general obligations are set
out in the Communications Act. The general and
speciﬁc obligations that form BT’s regulatory
environment are described below.
Conditions applying to all providers of electronic
communications networks or services
General conditions
The foundation of the new regulatory framework is the
set of general obligations referred to in the
Communications Act as ‘‘general conditions’’. These
apply to all providers of electronic communications
networks or services, including ‘‘systemless’’ service
providers and internet service providers. These general
conditions are mainly concerned with consumer
protection, but also address matters such as general
access and interconnection obligations, standards,
emergency planning and numbering. In addition, a
separate condition has been set regulating the
provision of premium rate services.
Electronic Communications Code conditions
The Electronic Communications Code deals with
powers to carry out streetworks and similar activities
for the purposes of providing networks and its
application is subject to conditions made by the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
Other general obligations
Other obligations corresponding to licence conditions
under the old framework now apply directly through
provisions of the Communications Act. These are:
& payment of administrative charges (broadly the
equivalent of licence fees under the old
framework)
& provision of information to Ofcom when required
to do so.
Conditions applying to BT only
USO (universal service obligation) conditions
BT has been designated as the supplier of universal
service for the UK excluding the Hull area, where
Kingston Communications is the designated provider.
The services covered by the USO are deﬁned in an
Order issued by the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry. Our basic obligation is to provide a single
narrowband connection to the ﬁxed telephone
network, but additional USO conditions relate to issues
such as schemes for consumers with special social
needs and the provision of call box services.
Ofcom is to carry out a fundamental review of the
USO with a consultation expected in summer 2004
and a statement towards the end of the year. All
aspects of the USO will be reviewed, including schemes
for consumers with special social needs,
disconnections, payphone provision, minimum data
speeds, scope of USO and funding.
Signiﬁcant market power (SMP) conditions and market
reviews
The EU Directives on which the regulatory framework
is based require member state national regulatory
authorities (in the case of the UK, Ofcom) to deﬁne
and analyse markets (‘‘market review’’) and to
determine whether any communications provider has
SMP, which is aligned with the competition law
concept of dominance. Economic regulation can only
be imposed following a market review and ﬁnding of
SMP.
In markets where Ofcom ﬁnds that a provider has
SMP, it must impose appropriate additional obligations
in the form of SMP conditions as speciﬁed in the
Communications Act. These may include obligations to
meet reasonable requests to supply certain services to
other communications providers, not to unduly
discriminate, and to notify price changes. In some
cases, additional obligations relating to, for example,
price control and regulatory accounting have also
been, or will be, imposed.
Under provisions in the Communications Act,
conditions of BT’s former licence are kept in force as
necessary pending the making of new signiﬁcant
market power conditions following reviews of the
relevant markets. Where market reviews have not yet
been completed in relation to services for which BT
was formerly regulated, BT is accordingly still
regulated under conditions of the former licence.
In the UK, the majority of market reviews have
been completed, although some are still in hand, and
the local loop unbundling review has only recently
commenced (see Other market reviews). The current
18 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 status of the UK market review programme and its
implications for and effects on BT are summarised
below.
Narrowband market reviews
Five reviews of narrowband markets were concluded in
November 2003. In four of these reviews, BT was
found to have SMP in some or all of the markets
concerned, and conditions were imposed accordingly,
including price controls (see Pricing regulation), non-
discrimination, publication of charges, terms and
conditions, and the publication of a ‘‘Reference Offer’’
in relation to access services. While many of these
obligations are similar in scope of application and
severity to those which applied under the old
regulatory regime, a number of changes have been
introduced. Some of these are favourable to BT. For
example, BT is no longer subject to SMP conditions in
retail international calls made by business customers or
in wholesale international services on country routes
accounting for 95% of call volumes. In addition, BT
was found not to have SMP in markets for wholesale
unmetered narrowband internet termination. However,
these reviews also produced some outcomes less
favourable to BT: for example, Oftel’s proposal to
require us to provide digital wholesale line rental
products was conﬁrmed.
Leased lines market review
In December 2003, Oftel published its second draft
Leased Lines Market Review (LLMR). Among other
things, this continued the obligation to provide cost-
oriented partial private circuits (PPCs) as a wholesale
alternative to retail private circuits, or leased lines. The
draft LLMR also required a further effective price
reduction of RPI-7%, to take effect from August 2003.
We are working with Ofcom to agree a forward-looking
price control for PPCs.
The LLMR included a new requirement to provide
a wholesale variant of BT’s retail ethernet-interface
leased line services. We were already in negotiation
with wholesale customers for provision of a wholesale
product and these commercial negotiations will be
guided by our regulatory obligations.
Wholesale broadband access market review
The consultation period on this market review closed
on 6 February 2004, and the publication of Ofcom’s
ﬁnal decisions is awaited. In the consultation
document, Ofcom proposed that BT has SMP in
markets for wholesale broadband origination and
conveyance, and set out plans to impose a full range of
SMP obligations.
BT is required to pass margin squeeze tests in
advance of any price change on some of the wholesale
products in our broadband portfolio. Margin squeeze
tests are designed to address a particular risk where a
company with market power upstream is vertically
integrated and sells an upstream input both to its own
downstream operation and also to its downstream
competitors. The test is to determine whether the
company would be proﬁtable in the downstream
market if it had to pay the same price for the upstream
input as its downstream competitors. This Direction
has been continued pending completion of the market
review, and margin squeeze tests are likely to appear
as regulatory remedies in the event that BT is found to
have SMP in broadband access.
On 3 April 2003, Oftel began an investigation into
BT’s proposed price change of the IPStream products,
on the grounds that there might be a margin squeeze
on the Datastream products (regarded by Ofcom as
the upstream product). We agreed voluntarily to
reduce the corresponding Datastream prices and, in
May 2004, announced our intention to further adjust
the prices to ensure there are adequate margins
between Datastream and IPStream Home 500 (see
Traditional services for wholesale customers).
Other market reviews
Ofcom is conducting a market review of local loop
unbundling (LLU) and, in May 2004, published the ﬁrst
consultation. A second will take place during the
summer, with completion anticipated for December
2004.
On the mobile front, Oftel concluded a market
review of mobile access and origination in November
2003, and a ﬁnal statement is awaited from Ofcom on
the review of mobile voice termination.
Ofcom published a consultation document on
ﬁnancial reporting in April 2004. This makes proposals
for SMP obligations relating to accounting separation
and cost accounting systems across all markets where
SMP designations have been made.
SMP apparatus conditions
The Government has made provision in the
Communications Act for Ofcom to review markets for
terminal apparatus (eg telephones) and impose
conditions on accounting methods, systems and
separation, and to impose price controls in relation to
hard-wired phones on any provider designated with
SMP. Ofcom is considering whether to conduct a
review of hard-wired telephones.
Enforcement
The Communications Act sets out the enforcement
process to be followed in relation to breaches of
conditions. Where a breach is not remedied following
notiﬁcation by Ofcom, Ofcom may take legally
enforceable enforcement action and/or impose a
penalty of up to 10% of relevant turnover. In addition,
a person who suffers loss or damage as a result of the
breach may, with Ofcom’s consent, sue for damages,
and, in the case of serious and repeated
contraventions, Ofcom may restrict or suspend the
provider’s entitlement to provide electronic
communications networks or services.
The Communications Act contains similar
enforcement procedures (though with much smaller
penalties) for matters such as non-compliance with a
request for information or non-payment of an
administrative charge.
19 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 Appeals
One of the main features of the new regulatory
framework is that full appeals on the merits are now
available against regulatory decisions. Consequently,
appeals can be made against matters such as:
& SMP, SMP apparatus (see above) and USO
designations
& the setting, modiﬁcation and revocation of
conditions
& enforcement actions, including the imposition of a
penalty.
Any person affected by a decision may appeal to
the Competition Appeal Tribunal. However, the
Tribunal must refer on to the Competition Commission
for determination any matters in any appeal which
relates to price controls.
In an appeal by BT, the Competition Appeal
Tribunal has ruled that it was wrong for Oftel to force
us to supply mobile companies with the private circuits
that connect their cell sites to their main networks
more cheaply, on the basis that such circuits were
interconnection, than we had done historically.
Competition
The competitive environment
The UK telecommunications market is fully open and
highly competitive.
Although it is some years since the
Telecommunications Act abolished the monopoly of
the former statutory corporation, British
Telecommunications, obligations placed on BT,
including pricing regulation, network access, non-
discrimination obligations and the requirement to
provide universal service, are generally more onerous
than for other providers of electronic communications
networks and services.
Competition and the UK economy
The growth of mobile over the last decade has been a
major factor in shaping the UK’s telecommunications
landscape. Mobile now accounts for approximately
30% of the total UK voice minutes. BT’s market share
of the total UK voice market including mobile is
estimated to be approximately 40%.
BT’s share of the residential ﬁxed-voice market, as
measured by the volume of ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed voice
minutes, declined to an estimated 70% in the 2004
ﬁnancial year, compared with an estimated 73% in the
2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years. CPS has been one of
the contributors to the loss of share in the ﬁxed-voice
market. We estimate that BT had 42% of the market
for business ﬁxed-voice calls in the 2004 ﬁnancial year,
compared with an estimated 45% and 49% in the
2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The estimated market shares are based on our
actual minutes, market data provided by Ofcom and
an extrapolation of the historical market trends.
We also estimate that BT has supplied
approximately 80% of exchange lines in the UK during
the three years under review.
The growth in cable operators’ networks in the UK
has historically had an adverse effect on BT’s share of
the residential market as a result of increasing
competition from these cable operators. However, in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year, BT grew its residential
customer base by 190,000. Current and future
wholesale line rental arrangements will allow BT’s
ﬁxed-line customers to move PSTN lines to other
operators which are expected to be the source of more
competition in future.
Since 2000, we have been required to provide
other operators with the use of the lines connecting
BT’s local exchanges to our customers and to other
operators to install equipment in our exchanges (local
loop unbundling) (see Other market reviews).
Competition Act
In addition to telecommunications industry regulation,
BT is subject to general competition law.
By virtue of provisions in the Competition Act
1998, UK competition law is in line with European
Community law in prohibiting anti-competitive
agreements, concerted practices and the abuse of a
dominant market position. In the case of electronic
communications, Ofcom has concurrent investigatory
and enforcement powers with the Ofﬁce of Fair
Trading. Breach of the relevant prohibitions could lead
to ﬁnes of up to 10% of relevant turnover in the UK for
each year of infringement (up to a maximum of three
years) and/or result in claims for damages in the civil
courts. A company may also be ordered to cease an
infringing activity. There is an independent mechanism
for appeals to the Competition Appeal Tribunal against
decisions under the Competition Act.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal is hearing
Freeserve’s appeal against Ofcom’s decision in which
BT was found not to have infringed the prohibition on
abuse of a dominant position in relation to
BT Openworld’s consumer broadband products.
Enterprise Act
The Enterprise Act 2002 aims to give more
independence to the competition authorities, to reform
insolvency and bankruptcy laws and to tackle trading
practices that harm consumers.
The key provisions of the Enterprise Act, including
the new cartel offence and the section on director
disqualiﬁcation, entered into force on 20 June 2003.
It is now a criminal offence, punishable by
imprisonment or a ﬁne, or both, to engage in cartel
activity. In addition, where companies infringe UK or
EC competition law, company directors can be
disqualiﬁed from acting as such for a maximum period
of 15 years.
Pricing regulation
Fixed network
We are subject to price controls on our ﬁxed network
services in the UK at two levels: retail and network.
Fixed network competitors are generally not subject to
direct price controls, although there are some controls
on mobile network operators.
Retail price controls
We are subject to two sets of UK retail price controls,
one on certain public-switched telephony call charges

circuits. Each price control is based on a formula
calculated by reference to the UK Retail Prices Index
(RPI) and a factor, X.
For services covered by the controls, the weighted
average of base prices cannot increase in each year
beginning 1 August by more than the annual change in
RPI minus X. The current retail price control for public-
switched telephony, applying from August 2002 to July
2006, is RPI minus RPI (ie the value of X is RPI and
prices cannot increase). It is measured on services used
by the lowest 80% of our residential customers
classiﬁed by bill size. From August 2002, the services
covered by the control were extended to include BT’s
share of the revenue for calls to all four mobile
networks, replacing the previous separate control on
BT for calls to Vodafone and O
2
. The price control
formula and our performance against the formula are
set out in the table above.
Under the new controls, we have also given an
assurance that increases in line rental for business
customers will be no more than the annual change in
RPI. Under the price controls for private circuits that
applied from August 1997 to July 2001, prices for
domestic analogue and low-speed digital private
circuits could not increase by more than the change in
the RPI in any year. For all retail analogue private
circuits and 8 Mbit/s digital private circuits, we have
voluntarily given an assurance to adhere to a RPI+0%
price cap from 30 June 2003 (ie applied
retrospectively) until 30 June 2006.
As part of the review of price controls in 2002, BT
was required to provide a cost-based wholesale line
rental product to other service providers at a regulated
price and in a way that does not discriminate between
BT’s retail business and service providers. This product
(Wholesale Access) has been available from BT since
1 September 2002. Further consultation by Ofcom has
resulted in an enhanced wholesale access product
being available from 29 March 2004.
Network charge control
We operate under interconnection agreements with
most other operators. The current network charge
control period began on 1 October 2001 and will last
for four years from that date. It requires us to set
reasonable charges based on long-run incremental
costs for our standard interconnection services.
Depending on the degree of competition for these
services, charges are cap-controlled each year by RPI
minus X (where X ranges from 7.5% to 13%) for
services Ofcom considers unlikely to become
competitive in the near future; and safeguard cap
controlled (ie no increases above RPI during any
relevant year of the overall control period) for services
likely to become competitive. Those services
considered fully competitive are not subject to direct
charge controls. Later in 2004, Ofcom will begin a
review of the network charge control to determine
what control should apply from 1 October 2005.
The main network price caps are listed below:
Basket
X Factor in
RPI – X formula Duration
Call termination 10 30 Sept 2005
Call origination 10 30 Sept 2005
Tandem layer 13 30 Sept 2005
Safeguard cap 0 30 Sept 2005
Interconnect speciﬁc 8.25 30 Sept 2005
Local exchange FRIACO 7.5 30 Sept 2005
Number portability 5 31 July 2006
The number portability charge control runs from
1 August 2002 until 31 July 2006. The charges are
controlled by a RPI minus X formula, with X set at 5%.
Under the new regime, General Condition 18 requires
all providers to offer number portability, among other
things, on reasonable terms and for charges to be
cost-orientated. Ofcom is currently consulting on
proposals for Condition 69A, presently maintaining the
number portability charge control, to be replaced by a
non-binding undertaking from BT that we will continue
to comply with its terms, including the RPI-5 charge
control as though the provision was still operative until
31 August 2006.
BT must publish a notiﬁcation to Ofcom and other
operators if we intend to amend existing charges or to
offer new services. Notice periods range from 28 to
90 days for regulated services, depending on the
degree to which they are judged to be competitive.
FRIACO
FRIACO (ﬂat-rate internet access call origination) is a
service that provides ﬂat-rate charges for internet
dialled access. On 21 July 2003, Oftel issued a
Direction on the intelligent network component of the
FRIACO price that required BT to delete this
component from the charge retrospectively to 1 June
2002. BT incurred rebate payments in the 2004
ﬁnancial year of around £16 million.
21 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 Wholesale access charge control
The charges for wholesale access services are also
subject to price control. The charges for the line rental
(residential and business products), line transfer and
new line installations have been set by Ofcom and are
subject to a price control of RPI minus 2%, effective
from 1 September 2002 for four years. The control
applies to the aggregate of all charges (rental, transfer
and installation) as well as to line transfers separately.
We are also under an obligation to notify Ofcom and
service providers if we intend to amend existing
charges. Notice periods range from 28 to 90 days,
depending on the speciﬁc service.
On 28 November 2003 Oftel published its
statement on the ﬁxed narrowband wholesale
exchange line market. This statement contained new
obligations on BT to provide business ISDN2 wholesale
line rentals with cost-oriented prices. We must also
provide residential ISDN2 and ISDN30 wholesale line
rentals at retail minus prices. Furthermore, the
wholesale ISDN2 business and ISDN30 products have
to be provided in accordance with a functional
speciﬁcation deﬁned by Ofcom. Ofcom is conducting
an investigation into the prices of business ISDN2
wholesale line rental.
Non-UK regulation
BT must comply with the regulatory regimes in the
countries in which we operate or wish to operate. The
obligations placed on BT and our suppliers continue to
be relevant to our business models and have cost
implications for our end-user services. These rules are
generally applied by national regulatory authorities
operating under a government mandate. The impact of
the decisions of these bodies can have a material
impact on our business models from time to time.
European Union
The degree to which the European directives have
been implemented varies by country. While 2004
should see a general move towards the new regime, in
some countries the directives may not be fully
implemented until 2005. In most, but not all, member
states the primary legislation that will enable the
introduction of the new regulatory regime is going
through, or has been through, the legislative process.
The processes of identiﬁcation of operators with SMP
and the subsequent setting of regulatory obligations
on those operators are mostly in progress. The
implementation process in Germany is notably behind
that in other major member states.
BT will not have universal service obligations
outside the UK, although in certain member states we
may be required to contribute towards an industry
fund to pay for the cost of meeting universal service
obligations in those countries. Any ﬁndings that BT has
SMP in any non-UK market are not expected to have a
material impact. We are lobbying the European
Commission and other EU bodies with responsibility for
electronic communications for consistent and timely
implementation of the new directives and associated
regulation.
The availability of cost-oriented access products from
regulated incumbents remains an important element of
our strategy around the world and we continue to
press these incumbents, their national regulatory
authorities and at EU level for such access. Their
availability varies by country.
Rest of the world
The vast majority of the markets in which we operate
around the world are regulated, and in the majority of
these we have to obtain licences or other
authorisations and to comply with the conditions of
these. The degree to which these markets are
liberalised varies widely: while many are fully open to
competition, others place restrictions on market
entrants, such as the extent to which foreign
ownership is permitted, or restrictions on the services
which may be provided. The extent to which the
national incumbent operator is effectively regulated
also varies considerably. BT’s ability to compete fully in
some countries is therefore constrained.
Other signiﬁcant changes and issues
Mobile call termination
In early 2003, the Competition Commission ruled that
mobile termination rates were against the public
interest and recommended one-off cuts of 15% in real
terms before 25 July 2003 and RPI minus X cuts for
the following two years (X = 15% for Vodafone and O
2
and X = 14% for T-Mobile and Orange).
(There are two types of mobile termination charge.
& When a BT ﬁxed-line customer makes a call to a
mobile phone, we incur a termination charge
payable to the mobile operator. This charge is
incorporated in the cost of the call.
& When a customer of any mobile operator makes a
call to another mobile network, this can pass
through BT’s ﬁxed network. In this case, BT passes
the termination charge on behalf of the calling
mobile network to the receiving mobile network.)
Oftel introduced changes to the mobile operators’
licences to implement the one-off 15% cut by 25 July
2003 and Ofcom is currently undertaking a market
review of mobile termination rates to evaluate what, if
any, controls should exist going forward. Ofcom’s
latest proposals seek to implement the Competition
Commission’s original ﬁndings.
The ﬁnancial effect has been to reduce group
revenues by over £200 million during the 2004
ﬁnancial year. However, payments to mobile operators
have reduced by exactly the same amount, leaving a
neutral effect on proﬁts.
Strategic Review of Telecommunications
During 2004, Ofcom will be carrying out a strategic
review of the UK telecommunications sector and
published its ﬁrst consultation in April 2004. The
review will be comprehensive, wide ranging and will
assess the options for enhancing value and choice in
the UK telecommunications sector while having regard
to investment and innovation. Ofcom’s proposals will
be set out in a report to be published before the end of
2004.
22 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 The review focuses on ﬁve fundamental issues, relating
respectively to: the key attributes of a well-functioning
telecoms market for citizen-consumers; the
achievement of sustainable competition; the possibility
of a signiﬁcant reduction in regulation; incentivising
efﬁcient and timely investment in next-generation
networks; and the relevance of the issue of structural
or operational separation of BT.
Funds for liabilities
Under conditions relating to the Electronic
Communications Code, an electronic communications
provider which has apparatus on or in the public
highway is required to make ﬁnancial provision to
cover damage suffered by highway or other relevant
authorities, resulting from works carried out by the
communications provider, for the removal of its
network, if necessary, in the event of the liquidation or
bankruptcy of the company.
The conditions require the company to provide
Ofcom annually with a certiﬁcate that, in the company
board’s opinion, the company has fulﬁlled its
obligations to ensure the availability of the required
funds.
Relationship with HM Government
The UK Government, collectively, is our largest
customer, but the provision of services to any one
department or agency of the UK Government does not
comprise a material proportion of our revenues. Except
as described below, the commercial relationship between
BT as a supplier and the UK Government as customer has
been on a normal customer and supplier basis.
We can, however, be required by law to do certain
things and provide certain services for the UK
Government. General conditions made under the
Communications Act 2003 require all providers of
public telephone networks and/or publicly available
telephone services, including BT, on the request of and
in consultation with the authorities, to make, and if
necessary implement, plans for the provision or
restoration of services in connection with disasters.
Furthermore, the Civil Contingencies Bill, currently
before Parliament, contains provision enabling
obligations to be imposed on providers of public
electronic communications networks, including BT, in
connection with civil contingency planning. In addition,
the Secretary of State has statutory powers to require
us to take certain actions in the interests of national
security and international relations.
Legal proceedings
The company does not believe that there are any
pending legal proceedings which would have a material
adverse effect on the ﬁnancial position or operations of
the group.
Proceedings have been initiated in Italy against
21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in
connection with the Italian UMTS auction. Blu, in
which BT held a minority interest, participated in that
auction process. The evidential hearings are continuing
in Rome. If the proceedings are successful, BT could
be held liable, with others, for any damages. The
company has concluded that it would not be
appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such
potential claim.

Introduction
The 2004 ﬁnancial year was marked by the continuing
transformation of our business operations and
markets, where the pace of change is accelerating. We
are driving the change by providing our customers with
new technology and services with greater capabilities
and lower cost. The focus on delivering the strategy
continued and the group’s performance beneﬁted from
the growth in new wave activities such as Information
and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions,
broadband, mobility and managed services and
continued cost efﬁciency programmes.
The 2003 ﬁnancial year was characterised by a
focus on implementing and delivering the strategy
announced in April 2002 and further corporate
transactions in the continued restructuring of the
group and reduction of net debt. The corporate
transactions included the unwind of the Concert joint
venture on 1 April 2002 and the disposal of our
interest in Cegetel for £2.6 billion.
The 2002 ﬁnancial year was dominated by a series
of corporate transactions designed to focus and
transform the group and reduce its net debt position.
Those corporate transactions included raising
£5.9 billion through the rights issue in June 2001, selling
our Japanese telecom and Spanish mobile investments
for £4.8 billion, selling the Yell directories business for
approximately £2 billion, the demerger of mmO
2
and
the sale and leaseback of properties for £2.4 billion.
As a result of the major restructuring of the group
and the signiﬁcant level of corporate transactions
completed during the period under review, we believe
it is difﬁcult for investors to meaningfully compare the
ﬁnancial performance of the group between the
ﬁnancial years under review. In this Financial review
the commentary is therefore focused principally on the
trading results of the continuing activities of BT Group
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. In
comparing the continuing activities of the group, the
results of our discontinued activities, namely our
Japanese telecom and Spanish mobile investments,
Yell and mmO
2
are excluded. Goodwill amortisation is
excluded because the annual charge has varied
signiﬁcantly during the period under review as a result
of the corporate transactions noted above and the
exceptional impairment charges. The exceptional
items, by virtue of their size or nature, are excluded
because they predominantly relate to corporate
transactions rather than the trading activities of the
group. This is also consistent with the way that
ﬁnancial performance is measured by management
and we believe allows a meaningful comparison to be
made of the trading results of the group during the
period under review.
The goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
are therefore analysed and discussed separately from
the line of business results in this Financial review
because they are considered to be a reﬂection of the
corporate activity rather than the trading activity of the
lines of business.
The following table shows the summarised proﬁt
and loss account which includes a reconciliation of the
key performance measures before and after goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items and is discussed
further in this Financial review. The operating results
by line of business are discussed in addition to the
overall group results as we believe the activities and
markets they serve are distinct and this analysis
provides a greater degree of insight to investors.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 27 Operating and financial review Group results
All references in this section to the 2002 ﬁnancial year
results or performance against the 2002 ﬁnancial year
are in relation to the results from continuing activities.
Whilst driving a signiﬁcant transformation in the
business, the group continued to make further
progress with earnings per share before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items at 16.9 pence
which were 19% ahead of the 2003 ﬁnancial year and
92% ahead of the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
The acceleration of our transformation is
demonstrated by the 30% growth of new wave
turnover to £3,387 million compared to an increase of
20% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. New wave turnover
represented 18% of group turnover in the 2004
ﬁnancial year compared to 14% and 12% in the 2003
and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively. New wave
turnover is mainly generated from ICT solutions,
broadband, mobility and managed services.

In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, performance was driven by
particularly strong growth in the ICT solutions business
and broadband. However, this growth was more than
offset by a 6% decline in turnover from the group’s
traditional businesses. The decline reﬂects regulatory
intervention, price reductions and competitive and
technological changes that are being used to drive
customers from traditional services to better value and
more ﬂexible new wave services, such as broadband
and IPVPN’s. Mobile operators were required to reduce
their fees for terminating calls and these regulatory
reductions were passed on to BT customers resulting in
lower revenues but are proﬁt neutral as payments to
mobile operators were reduced by the same amount.
Group turnover was maintained after excluding the
£219 million impact of these regulatory reductions to
mobile termination rates.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year performance in new
wave services was also driven by strong growth in ICT
solutions and broadband. This growth was partly offset
by the 1% decline in traditional revenues.
The table below analyses the group turnover by
customer segment. Consumer includes the external
turnover of BT Retail from consumer customers.
Business includes the external turnover of BT Retail
from smaller and medium sized enterprise (SME)
customers. Major Corporate includes the external
turnover of BT Retail Major Corporate customers, and
the external turnover of BT Global Services, excluding
global carrier. Wholesale includes the external turnover
of BT Wholesale and BT Global Services’ global carrier
business.

Consumer turnover in 2004 was 2% lower (1%
excluding the impact of regulatory reductions in mobile
termination rates) at £5,974 million when compared to
the 2003 ﬁnancial year. In the consumer ﬁxed voice
market, Carrier Pre Selection (CPS) had some impact
with BT’s estimated residential market share, as
measured by the volume of ﬁxed to ﬁxed voice
minutes, declining by 3 percentage points to 70%
compared to the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The estimated
market share, as measured by the volume of ﬁxed to
ﬁxed voice minutes, is based on our actual minutes,
market data provided by Ofcom and an extrapolation
of the historical market trends.
The proportion of contracted revenues has been
increasing, now approaching 60% of total revenues,
with the success of the BT Together packages and
broadband. The underlying 12 months rolling average
revenue per customer household (net of mobile
termination charges) of £268 in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
was 1% lower than the 2003 ﬁnancial year. Consumer
turnover in the 2003 ﬁnancial year was 3% higher at
£6,067 million when compared to the 2002 ﬁnancial
year. The number of BT Together packages increased by
304,000 packages during the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
The aggregate Business and Major Corporate
turnover in the 2004 ﬁnancial year was maintained
when compared to the 2003 ﬁnancial year after an
increase of 10% from the 2002 ﬁnancial year. BT’s
estimated business market share of ﬁxed to ﬁxed voice
minutes declined to an estimated 42% in the 2004
ﬁnancial year compared to an estimated 45% and 49%
in the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
Turnover from smaller and medium sized enterprise
customers in the 2004 ﬁnancial year reduced by 4% to
£2,600 million compared to the 2003 ﬁnancial year,
reﬂecting the continued penetration of CPS and the
impact of customers switching from traditional
telephony services to new wave services such as
broadband. However, BT Business Plan, launched in
January 2003, had successfully attracted more than
267,000 business locations (175,000 customers) by
31 March 2004, helping to mitigate the rate of market
share decline. Revenues from smaller and medium sized
businesses in the 2003 ﬁnancial year decreased by 1%
compared to the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 28 Operating and financial review Major Corporate turnover increased by 2% to
£5,909 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year with the
growing new wave turnover offsetting the decline in
traditional UK services. This reﬂects the continued
migration of traditional voice only services to managed
ICT contracts from which turnover grew by 19% to
£2,564 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year conﬁrming
BT’s status as a major ICT provider in this market.
Contract wins from ICT solutions amounted to more
than £7 billion in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The highest
proﬁle of these were three NHS contracts expected to
be worth more than £2.1 billion and forming an
integral part of the National Programme for
Information Technology in the NHS. In the 2003
ﬁnancial year Major Corporate revenues increased by
17% to £5,794 million with part of this increase
reﬂecting the re-integration of Concert. Contract wins
from ICT solutions in the 2003 ﬁnancial year amounted
to more than £4.4 billion compared to more than
£3.3 billion in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
Wholesale (UK and Global Carrier) turnover in the
2004 ﬁnancial year fell by 3% (maintained excluding
the impact of regulatory reductions to mobile
termination rates) to £4,002 million when compared to
the 2003 ﬁnancial year. New wave turnover in the UK
Wholesale business increased by 54% driven by
broadband and managed services after growing by
110% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The Global Carrier
business turnover declined by 5% in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, Wholesale (UK and
Global Carrier) turnover decreased by 7% when
compared to the 2002 ﬁnancial year partly reﬂecting
the re-integration of Concert.
Group operating costs before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items reduced by 2% to
£15,804 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year when
compared to the prior year. The group continued to
focus on operational efﬁciency and effectiveness
initiatives which were offset by investment in new wave
activities and the adverse impact of currency
movements of £80 million. Group operating costs
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year of £16,152 million increased
by 1% compared to the 2002 ﬁnancial year. Net staff
costs in the 2004 ﬁnancial year, excluding leaver costs
of £202 million, increased by £138 million to £3,533
million due to the impact of increased pay and national
insurance rates and the higher SSAP 24 pension
charge, offset by improved efﬁciency. In the 2003
ﬁnancial year, net staff costs excluding leaver costs of
£276 million declined by 2%. Payments to other
telecommunications operators were £3,963 million, an
increase of 1% on the 2003 ﬁnancial year as both UK
and overseas payments increased. In the 2003
ﬁnancial year payments to other telecommunication
operators reduced by 8% to £3,940 million. The
payments in the 2002 ﬁnancial year include those
made to the Concert global venture for the delivery of
BT’s outgoing international calls, which accounts for
most of the reduction in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. Other
operating costs before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items reduced by 6% in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year largely due to efﬁciency cost savings offset by the
adverse impact of currency movements. Other
operating costs in the 2003 ﬁnancial year include the
costs associated with the re-integrated activities of the
former Concert global venture.
Group operating proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items at £2,892 million
for the 2004 ﬁnancial year was 4% higher than the
prior year. This reﬂects cost efﬁciencies achieved
during the year, the improved performance of
BT Global Services and a £74 million decrease in leaver
costs offset by the decline in turnover. In the 2003
ﬁnancial year, group operating proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items at £2,790 million
was £19 million higher than the prior year. The cost
efﬁciencies achieved during the year were offset by a
£90 million increase in leaver costs, the negative group
operating proﬁt effects of unwinding the Concert
global venture and the Telereal property sale and
leaseback transaction. In total, these effects reduced
group operating proﬁts by over £400 million, although
this was compensated for at the proﬁt before tax level
by a corresponding improvement in our share of the
operating proﬁts of associates and joint ventures and
net interest payable.
BT’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’
operating losses before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items was £8 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year, compared to a £181 million proﬁt in the 2003
ﬁnancial year and a £108 million loss in the 2002
ﬁnancial year. The 2003 ﬁnancial year includes the
results of our interest in Cegetel which was sold in
January 2003. The improvement in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year mainly reﬂected the beneﬁt of the unwind of the
Concert global venture.
Net interest payable before exceptional items was
£886 million for the 2004 ﬁnancial year, an
improvement of £260 million against the 2003
ﬁnancial year following an improvement of
£271 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects
the reduction in net debt in both years.
The above factors resulted in the group achieving
a proﬁt before taxation, goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items of £2,016 million in the 2004
ﬁnancial year, an increase of 10% compared to the
2003 ﬁnancial year, reﬂecting the underlying operating
performance of the group and lower net interest costs.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year the proﬁt before taxation,
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of
£1,829 million was £556 million higher than the 2002
ﬁnancial year. The improvement in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year was principally due to the exit from loss making
businesses, improved operating proﬁts and lower
interest charges.
The taxation charge for the 2004 ﬁnancial year
was £568 million on the proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, an effective rate of
28.2% compared to 32.7% and 41.5% in the 2003
and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively. The high
effective rate in the 2002 ﬁnancial year was mainly due
to the impact of loss making subsidiaries outside the
UK for which tax relief was not available.
Basic earnings per share before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items were 16.9 pence
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 29 Operating and financial review for the 2004 ﬁnancial year, an increase of 19% from
14.2 pence in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, and were
8.8 pence in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. The 2002
ﬁnancial year reﬂected the higher operating costs and
net interest payable which have continued to improve
during the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years.
Line of business results
In the following commentary, we discuss the operating
results of the group for the 2004, 2003 and 2002
ﬁnancial years in terms of the lines of business.
There is extensive trading between the lines of
business and their proﬁtability is dependent on the
transfer price levels. The intra-group trading
arrangements and operating assets are subject to
review and have changed in certain circumstances.
Where that is the case the comparative ﬁgures have
been restated to reﬂect those changes.
The table below analyses the trading relationships
between each of the lines of business for the 2004
ﬁnancial year. The majority of the internal trading is
performed by BT Wholesale with BT Retail, reﬂecting
sales of calls and access lines and network charges for
other products. This trading relationship also reﬂects
the pass through of termination charges on other
telecom operator networks and the sale of wholesale
broadband ISP products. BT Retail also trades with BT
Wholesale, selling calls and lines products, private
circuits, apparatus and conferencing for onward sale to
other telecom operators. BT Global Services’ turnover
with BT Retail mainly reﬂects the sales of Global
Services products in the UK. BT Global Services trades
with BT Wholesale mainly for use of the IP/ATM
network, International Direct Dial trafﬁc settlements
and certain dial IP revenue share arrangements. BT
Wholesale’s turnover with BT Global Services reﬂects
the use of the network infrastructure for BT Global
Services’ products.

The line of business results are presented and
discussed before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, for the reasons set out above, to provide a
meaningful comparison of the trading results between
the ﬁnancial years under review. Goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items are discussed separately in a
group context in this Financial review.
In addition to measuring ﬁnancial performance of
the lines of business based on the operating proﬁt
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items,
management also measure the operating ﬁnancial
performance of the lines of business based upon the
EBITDA before exceptional items. EBITDA is deﬁned as
the group operating proﬁt (loss) before depreciation
and amortisation. This may not be directly comparable
to the EBITDA of other companies as they may deﬁne
it differently. EBITDA excludes depreciation and
amortisation, both being non cash items, from group
operating proﬁt and is a common measure, particularly
in the telecommunications sector, used by investors
and analysts in evaluating the operating ﬁnancial
performance of companies.
EBITDA before exceptional items is considered to
be a good measure of the operating performance
because it reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs,
by eliminating depreciation and amortisation, and
excludes non-recurring exceptional items that are
predominantly related to corporate transactions.
EBITDA is not a direct measure of the group’s
liquidity, which is shown by the group’s cash ﬂow
statement and needs to be considered in the context of
the group’s ﬁnancial commitments. A reconciliation of
EBITDA before exceptional items to group operating
proﬁts (losses) by line of business and for the group is
provided in the table across the page above. Trends in
EBITDA before exceptional items are discussed for
each line of business in the following commentary.

focus of defending traditional turnover and gross
margins, cost reductions through a series of cost
transformation programmes and focusing on turnover
growth through new wave initiatives in the ICT,
broadband and mobility markets. In the 2004 and
2003 ﬁnancial years, the results include those of the
re-integrated Concert business relating to UK
multinational customer accounts, including the
associated sales force and account management
functions.
BT Retail’s turnover decreased by 3% in the 2004
ﬁnancial year to £13,534 million after rising by 5% in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The growth in new wave
turnover of 29% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year was more
than offset by the decline in traditional turnover driven
by the increased impact of regulation and competition.
After adjusting for the regulatory impact of the
reduction in mobile termination rates, turnover
declined by 2% compared to the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
The increase in the 2003 ﬁnancial year included
turnover from the UK multinational customers
re-integrated into BT Retail from the Concert global
venture. Turnover for the three years is summarised as
follows:

Voice services comprise calls made by customers on
the BT ﬁxed line network in the UK, analogue lines,
equipment sales and rentals and other business voice
products. Overall turnover from voice services was 7%
lower in the 2004 ﬁnancial year after an increase of 1%
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
The overall market for ﬁxed to ﬁxed voice call
minutes in the 2004 ﬁnancial year was estimated to
have declined by 2%, partly reﬂecting the migration to
new wave products and services such as IPVPN’s and
substitution by e-mail, instant messaging and mobile
services. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, the estimated
overall market for ﬁxed to ﬁxed voice call minutes
declined by 3%.
BT Retail’s total originating measured call volumes
declined by 10% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year (2003 –
5%) with geographic (local, national and international)
calls declining by 8% (2003 – 4%), reﬂecting the
decline in the market and some loss of market share
due to CPS. Fixed to mobile call volumes were ﬂat in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year after a 6% increase in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. BT Retail’s internet and data related call
volumes declined by 16% reﬂecting the move to
wholesale ﬂat rate internet access products in the
2004 ﬁnancial year. Total BT Group internet and data
related call volumes increased by 1% (2003 – 30%),
with the decline in the year on year rate of growth
driven by the migration to broadband which is not
measured in minutes and a slow down in the growth of
ﬂat rate internet access minutes. As a result, BT
Group’s total originating measured call volumes
declined by 2% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year (2003 – 13%
increase).
The directory services market was deregulated
following an announcement in September 2001 which
resulted in the introduction of the new 118 XXX
number range in December 2002 and the termination
of the 192 and 153 services in August 2003. BT’s
market share of the deregulated directory enquiries
market through the 118 500 service has increased
during the year as the beneﬁts and awareness of the
quality of service and pricing, supported by a
marketing campaign became apparent. However,
revenues reduced signiﬁcantly year on year due to a
contraction in the market.
Turnover from intermediate products in the 2004
ﬁnancial year of £2,356 million decreased by 7% in the
2004 ﬁnancial year after increasing by 11% in the
2003 ﬁnancial year. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, the
change was mainly driven by a decline in retail private
circuits and ISDN as customers migrate to cheaper
partial private circuits and new wave products such as
broadband and IPVPN. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year
growth was achieved, which included the beneﬁt of the
re-integration of Concert, despite the migration of
customers from retail private circuits to partial private
circuits. As a result of changes required by Ofcom,

provided as a BT Wholesale product. Private circuit
revenues declined by £228 million in the 2004
ﬁnancial year and by £109 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year.
The total number of BT Retail lines, which includes
voice, digital and broadband, were ﬂat at 29.6 million
at 31 March 2004 following an increase of 1% in the
2003 ﬁnancial year, reﬂecting the continued growth in
broadband offset by the declining PSTN lines. The
movement in the 2003 ﬁnancial year mainly reﬂected
the growth of high speed ISDN lines and broadband.
New wave turnover grew by 29% to £2,166 million
in the 2004 ﬁnancial year compared to growth of 19%
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. ICT turnover increased by
15% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year to £1,734 million after
an increase of 9% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting
the growth in new IP based services and solutions
contracts, offset by the decline in business telephony
equipment. Broadband turnover grew by 134% to
£307 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year after an
increase of 322% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. This
reﬂects the increased take up of broadband, with
928,000 BT Retail customers at 31 March 2004 and
429,000 customers at 31 March 2003, reﬂecting
increases of 116% and 298% on the respective prior
years. In November 2003, BT entered the consumer
mobile market with the launch of BT Mobile Home
Plan through on-line, voice and retail store outlets. BT
now has a consumer and corporate mobile customer
base of 144,000. Total turnover from mobile services
increased by 100% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year to
£84 million.
The gross margin percentage decreased by
1 percentage point in the 2004 ﬁnancial year after an
increase of 1 percentage point in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year. The decline in the 2004 ﬁnancial year reﬂects
lower prices and changes in the revenue mix, partly
offset by lower charges from BT Wholesale, in line with
market and regulatory prices. The improvements in the
2003 ﬁnancial year were driven by the success of BT
Together packages, improved product mix and lower
wholesale prices which more than offset the impact of
the decline in call volumes.
Gross margin is turnover less costs directly
attributable to the provision of the products and
services reﬂected in turnover in the period. Selling,
general and administration costs are those costs that
are ancillary to the business processes of providing
products and services and are the general business
operating costs. BT Retail analyses its costs in this
manner for management purposes in common with
other retail organisations and it has set target savings
for selling, general and administration costs.
Cost transformation programmes in the 2004
ﬁnancial year generated selling, general and
administration cost savings of £228 million before
leaver costs in the traditional business compared to the
2003 ﬁnancial year (£154 million net of new wave
investment). The savings in the year were driven by a
reduction in people related expenses such as travel,
accommodation and communications, lower service
costs resulting from improvements in service quality,
billing initiatives and cost reduction programmes
focusing on customer contact centres, improving the
billing platform, and optimising processes across
BT Retail.
Excluding leaver costs and investment in new wave
activities, BT Retail has achieved its target of
£800 million savings almost a year early in the
traditional business, achieving savings of £228 million,
£275 million and £290 million in the 2004, 2003 and
2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The number of employees in BT Retail at 31 March
2004 and 31 March 2003 was 41,500 and 50,400,
respectively.
BT Retail’s EBITDA before exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation declined by 8% to £1,596
million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year after showing strong
growth in the 2003 ﬁnancial year of 42% to
£1,729 million. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, cost savings
were more than offset by the decline in turnover and
the impact on margins of the product mix. In the 2003
ﬁnancial year, the cost savings and improved gross
margins contributed towards BT Retail’s strong
EBITDA growth before exceptional items.

BT Wholesale is the line of business within BT that
provides network services and solutions within the UK.
Its customers include communications companies,
ﬁxed and mobile network operators and service
providers. The customer base includes BT’s lines of
business, BT Retail and BT Global Services. The
majority of BT Wholesale’s turnover is internal (2004 –
68%, 2003 – 69%, 2002 – 68%) and mainly
represents trading with BT Retail. External turnover is
derived from providing wholesale products and
solutions to other operators interconnecting with BT’s
UK ﬁxed network, including mmO
2
since the
demerger. Internal turnover and costs with mmO
2
for
the 2002 ﬁnancial year have been reclassiﬁed as
external in this section to enable a meaningful year on
year comparison.
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, turnover totalled
£10,859 million, a decline of 3% following a decrease
of 9% to £11,247 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
The reduction in the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years is
primarily due to lower sales volumes and prices to BT
Retail. The results for the 2002 ﬁnancial year included
turnover of £770 million relating to the former Concert
global venture, which was re-integrated from 1 April
2002. Excluding this Concert turnover in the 2002
ﬁnancial year, the underlying turnover declined by 3%
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
External turnover declined by 2% in the 2004
ﬁnancial year to £3,445 million which is fully
accounted for by regulatory price reductions on mobile
termination rates which have reduced external turnover
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 32 Operating and financial review by £126 million, although this has no impact on
proﬁtability. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year external
turnover declined by 11% to £3,525 million, although
excluding sales to Concert in the 2002 ﬁnancial year,
the underlying external turnover increased by 3%.
The decline in external turnover from traditional
products in the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years is due to
the mobile termination rate impact and price
reductions, Network Charge Control (NCC) and other
Oftel price determinations, coupled with unfavourable
market conditions. Turnover from retail private circuits
at £207million reduced by 36% in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year and in the 2003 ﬁnancial year at £325 million
reduced by 9%. The decline is due to the migration of
customers from retail private circuits to lower priced
partial private circuits, introduced in August 2001.
Turnover from partial private circuits showed an
increase of 43% to £152 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year and an increase of 89% to £106 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. FRIACO generated turnover of
£78 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year (2003 –
£84 million, 2002 – £68 million) and the trend follows
the move to ﬂat rate packages by internet service
providers in 2003 and their subsequent substitution by
broadband in 2004. Conveyance and low margin transit
revenues of £2,054 million decreased compared to the
2003 ﬁnancial year and at £2,075 million increased
marginally compared to the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
New wave turnover, including broadband and
managed services, at £361 million, showed strong
growth of 54% following growth of 110% in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. This growth in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
completely offsets the reduction in external traditional
turnover after excluding the impact of mobile
termination rate cuts. Wholesale broadband lines had
an installed base of 2.2 million at 31 March 2004
representing growth of 177% on the number of lines as
at 31 March 2003 which had grown 380% on the
previous year. At 14 May 2004 the installed base was
2.45 million, with net additions growing at more than
35,000 connections per week since January 2004.
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, internal turnover
decreased by 4% to £7,414 million after a decrease of
8% to £7,722 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. Lower
call and retail private circuit volumes, reductions on
mobile termination rates and price reductions reﬂected
most of the decline in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The
unwind of the Concert global venture resulted in a
reduction of internal revenues in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year. Excluding the Concert related revenues in the
2002 ﬁnancial year, the reduction in internal turnover
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year was 5%. This reduction was
primarily due to a reduction in prices on sales to
BT Retail, partly offset by the increased sales to BT
Global Services.
Despite network volume increases in the 2004
ﬁnancial year, operating costs, excluding depreciation
and exceptional items, decreased by 4% to
£7,351 million (10% to £7,691 million in 2003). The
movement in the 2003 ﬁnancial year was mainly due
to £905 million of Concert related costs in the 2002
ﬁnancial year offset by an increase in leaver costs of
£108 million.
Interconnect payments to other network operators
remained broadly ﬂat in the 2004 ﬁnancial year at
£3,165 million. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, these
payments decreased by 18% to £3,143 million and the
unwind of the Concert global venture accounted for
the majority of this reduction as interconnect
payments to Concert were no longer made. These
costs are mainly recharged to BT Retail with no margin
or reﬂect external transit revenues with a minimal
margin.
Net staff costs in the 2004 ﬁnancial year, at
£805 million, decreased by 1% after increasing by
19% to £816 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The
increase in the 2003 ﬁnancial year reﬂects an increase
in leaver costs compared to the prior year of
£108 million.
Payments to other BT lines of business declined by
8% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year to £2,933 million after
declining by 12% to £3,175 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. The reduction in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
reﬂects the decline in private circuits purchased from
BT Retail. The reduction in the 2003 ﬁnancial year was
principally due to the unwind of the Concert global
venture which reduced the cost of sales of BT Retail
products, and a reduction in service costs.
EBITDA before exceptional items at £3,600 million
in the 2004 ﬁnancial year was 2% lower than in the
2003 ﬁnancial year following a reduction of 9% to
£3,681 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. EBITDA
margins before exceptional items were maintained at
33% across all three ﬁnancial years.
Depreciation costs were broadly ﬂat at
£1,919 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year and
£1,923 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Operating proﬁt before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items at £1,681 million decreased by 4%
in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. This was after a reduction
of 18% to £1,758 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
The operating proﬁt margin, before exceptional items,
remained broadly ﬂat in the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial
years.
Capital expenditure on plant and equipment at
£1,809 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year was 10%
higher than the 2003 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting the
focused expenditure on transformational projects. In
the 2003 ﬁnancial year capital expenditure declined by
16% to £1,652 million which reﬂected cost control,
tight governance and the alignment of capital spend
with the development of the future network strategy.
Managed cash costs are used to measure the
controllable operating and capital cash costs of the BT
Wholesale business. Accordingly it is based on
operating costs excluding payments to other network
operators and depreciation, plus capital expenditure.
Targets have been set for achieving managed cash cost
savings and accordingly performance against those
targets is reported. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year,
managed cash costs at £5,995 million decreased by
3%, despite a 10% increase in capital expenditure. In
the 2003 ﬁnancial year, after adjusting for the unwind
of Concert, managed cash costs at £6,200 million
decreased by 1% despite the extra leaver payments of
£108 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. After allowing
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 33 Operating and financial review for price changes and volume effects, the efﬁciency
cost savings were £280 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year and £237 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. This
brings the two year efﬁciency cost savings total to
£517 million, which is above our two year target of
£500 million.

BT Global Services is at the forefront of two areas of
the group’s growth, being ICT solutions and servicing
the needs of global multi-site corporations and
European multi-site organisations. The product
portfolio covers a number of key ICT related areas
including IP infrastructure, Customer Relationship
Management (CRM), outsourcing and system
integration. These are provided to customers through
BT Syntegra and BT Global Solutions. The 2004
ﬁnancial year results demonstrate the success of the
re-integration of Concert and delivery of customer
orientated ICT based services and solutions. In the
2003 ﬁnancial year, the ﬁnancial performance of
Global Products and Global Carrier reﬂects the
re-integration of the returning businesses as a result of
the unwind of Concert.
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year BT Global Services’
turnover was £5,782 million, representing an increase
of 7% compared to the prior year following an increase
of 16% to £5,417 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
reﬂecting the returning Concert businesses. BT Global
Solutions’ turnover grew by 14% in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year to £2,802 million. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, BT
Global Solutions’ turnover grew by 10% to
£2,455 million. BT Syntegra performed strongly with
turnover of £721 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year, an
increase of 16%, and turnover of £623 million in the
2003 ﬁnancial year, an increase of 3%. In the 2004
ﬁnancial year, contract wins from ICT solutions
amounted to more than £7 billion. The highest proﬁle
of these were three NHS contracts expected to be
worth over £2.1 billion and forming an integral part of
the National Programme for Information Technology in
the NHS. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, contract wins
from ICT solutions amounted to more than
£4.4 billion. BT Global Products’ turnover grew by 9%
in the 2004 ﬁnancial year to £1,831 million reﬂecting
the growth of Multi Protocol Label Switching. In the
2003 ﬁnancial year, BT Global Products’ turnover
increased by 33% to £1,674 million and was mainly
due to the re-integration of Concert and the growth in
IPVPN products. The Global Carrier division turnover
decreased by 1% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year to
£962 million (2003 – £974 million, 2002 – £292
million). The increase in 2003 was principally due to
the re-integration of the international carrier business
of the former Concert global venture.
Continued cost reductions, in network costs as well as
selling, general and administration costs, helped
generate improvements in EBITDA before exceptional
items in the 2004 ﬁnancial year of 113% to £508
million, following an improvement of 12% in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. The re-integration of the former Concert
business had an adverse impact on the growth in
EBITDA before exceptional items in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year. The 2004, 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years include
leaver costs of £33 million, £65 million and
£55 million, respectively. Headcount increased by 23%
to 21,200 in the 2004 ﬁnancial year which includes
transfers of operations from other lines of business and
an increase in BT Global Solutions’ headcount due to
increased outsourcing contracts. Headcount increased
by 3% to 17,200 in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. All major
European operations achieved their target of becoming
EBITDA positive during the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
The group operating loss before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items decreased by
£270 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year to a loss of
£105 million after increasing by £81 million to a loss of
£375 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The loss in the
2003 ﬁnancial year includes the adverse impact of the
former Concert business.
Capital expenditure for the 2004 ﬁnancial year was
£479 million, an increase of 8%, and £445 million in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year, a reduction of 28%.
Other operating income
Other operating income for the group decreased by
£38 million to £177 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
and by £146 million to £215 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. As part of the arrangements for the
establishment of Concert, BT had been seconding staff
and providing administrative and other services from
its launch in early January 2000. The income from
these services before the re-integration of Concert was
£135 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
Operating costs
Total operating costs from continuing activities were
reduced by 3% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year to
£15,823 million after reducing by 13% in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. As a percentage of group turnover from
continuing activities, operating costs from continuing
activities, excluding goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items, reduced from 87% in the 2002
ﬁnancial year, to 86% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year and
85% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. Operating costs in the
2003 ﬁnancial year include the costs associated with
the re-integrated activities of the former Concert
global venture. Because these activities have been fully
integrated into the lines of business it is not possible to
separately identify those speciﬁc costs associated with
the activities of the former Concert global venture. In
all three ﬁnancial years, net exceptional costs from
continuing activities were incurred. These amounted to
£7 million, £198 million and £2,696 million in the
2004, 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
These exceptional costs are considered separately in
the discussion which follows.

Staff costs from continuing activities increased by 4%
to £4,412 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year after being
broadly ﬂat in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. In the 2004
ﬁnancial year, the number of staff employed in the
continuing activities decreased by 4,800 to 99,900 at
31 March 2004 after decreasing by 3,900 in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. Increased pay rates and national
insurance and a £141 million increase in the pension
charge offset the impact of the lower headcount and
leaver costs in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The increased
leaver costs and salary increases offset the impact of
lower headcount in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
The allocation for the employee proﬁt share
scheme, included within staff costs, was £20 million in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The allocation for the 2003
and 2002 ﬁnancial years was £36 million and
£25 million, respectively.
Early leaver costs from continuing activities before
exceptional items of £202 million were incurred in the
2004 ﬁnancial year, compared with £276 million in the
2003 ﬁnancial year and £186 million in the 2002
ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects BT’s continued focus on
reducing headcount and improving operational
efﬁciencies. Leaver costs include the cost of enhanced
pension beneﬁts provided to leavers which amounted
to £1 million, £60 million and £21 million in the 2004,
2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively. In the
2002 ﬁnancial year this did not reﬂect the full cash
cost because there was a pension fund accounting
surplus, which for accounting purposes includes any
provision for pensions on the group’s balance sheet,
and in accordance with BT’s accounting policies, the
accounting surplus was utilised before making a charge
to the proﬁt and loss account. The cost of enhanced
pension beneﬁts charged against the accounting
surplus in the 2002 ﬁnancial year amounted to
£140 million.
The depreciation charge from continuing activities
decreased by 3% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year to
£2,921 million after increasing by 1% in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. The decrease in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
reﬂects more efﬁcient capital expenditure over recent
years. The increase in the 2003 ﬁnancial year is
despite the reduction in property depreciation as a
result of the property sale and leaseback in December
2001. The increase in the 2003 ﬁnancial year also
reﬂects a reduction in the estimated asset lives, due to
BT’s continuing investment in its networks and
broadband.
Goodwill amortisation in respect of subsidiaries
and businesses acquired since 1 April 1998, when BT
adopted Financial Reporting Standard No. 10, and
amortisation of other intangibles totalled £15 million in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year compared with £24 million in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year and £124 million in the 2002
ﬁnancial year. The low charge in the 2004 and 2003
ﬁnancial years reﬂect the impact of the demerger of
mmO
2
and the impairment of goodwill in the 2002
ﬁnancial year which signiﬁcantly reduced the carrying
value of goodwill. Goodwill on acquisitions before
1 April 1998 was written off directly to reserves.
Payments to other telecommunications operators
from continuing activities increased by 1% in the 2004
ﬁnancial year to £3,963 million after reducing by 8%
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The increase in the
payments for the 2004 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the
increase in both UK and overseas payments. The
payments in the 2002 ﬁnancial year include those
made to the Concert global venture for the delivery of
BT’s outgoing international calls, which accounts for
most of the reduction in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
following the re-integration of Concert.
Other operating costs before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items, which reduced by 6% in the
2004 ﬁnancial year to £5,182 million after increasing
by 8% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, include the
maintenance and support of the networks,
accommodation and marketing costs, the cost of sales
of customer premises equipment and non pay related
leaver costs. The decrease in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
was largely due to efﬁciency cost savings offset by the
adverse impact of currency movements. The increase
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year includes the property rental
costs of around £190 million following the sale and
leaseback transaction in December 2001 and the costs
associated with the re-integrated activities of the
former Concert global venture.

costs are the estimated rectiﬁcation costs relating to a

surplus exceptional bad debt provisions made in the
2002 ﬁnancial year.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year a property
rationalisation charge of £198 million was recognised
in relation to the rationalisation of the group’s London
ofﬁce portfolio. The rationalisation involves the exit
from a number of ofﬁce properties.
The most signiﬁcant item in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year was the impairment of goodwill and tangible ﬁxed
assets in the European activities of BT Global Services.
In the light of our announcement that BT Global
Services was streamlining its activities to focus on
multi-site corporate customers with European activities
and the assimilation of BT’s share of Concert’s
activities, an impairment review of the investment in
its European activities was performed. As a result, a
goodwill impairment charge of £1,939 million and a
tangible ﬁxed asset impairment charge of £263 million
was recognised. The goodwill in the European activities
was fully written down as a result of the charge.
Other exceptional items in the 2002 ﬁnancial year
included:
& costs of £172 million associated with the unwind
of the Concert global venture, discussed further on
page 37
& charges of £68 million in relation to BT Retail’s
call centre rationalisation programme, reducing
the number of call centres from 104 to 30 over
two years
& bad debt charges of £79 million, in BT Wholesale,
as a result of severe liquidity problems in the TMT
sector during the latter part of the year
& costs of £98 million associated with the demerger
of mmO

& other charges of £77 million including impairment
of payphone assets.
Group operating proﬁt (loss)
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, group operating proﬁt from
continuing activities before goodwill amortisation and
the exceptional items described above, of £2,892
million was 4% higher than in the 2003 ﬁnancial year,
which in turn was 1% higher than in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year.

year was £2,873 million compared to a proﬁt of
£2,572 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year and a loss of
£479 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. The 2002
ﬁnancial year loss reﬂects the losses generated by the
discontinued activities and the exceptional charges of
£2,707 million.

The group’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’
turnover reduced by £1,060 million during the 2004
ﬁnancial year mainly reﬂecting the disposal of the
group’s interest in Cegetel in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
During the 2003 ﬁnancial year there was a
signiﬁcant rationalisation of the group’s investments in
associates and joint ventures. On 1 April 2002 the
unwind of the Concert global venture was completed
and on 22 January 2003 the sale of the group’s stake
in Cegetel was completed. As a result BT’s share of its
ventures’ turnover fell to £1,455 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year from £4,764 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, £386 million of the
total arose from ventures located outside the UK,
compared with £1,447 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year and £4,618 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
The principal contributors to turnover in the 2004
ﬁnancial year were LG Telecom in Korea (£196 million)
and Albacom in Italy (£147 million). The principal
contributors to turnover in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
were Cegetel in France (£956 million) up to the date of
disposal and LG Telecom (£198 million). The principal
contributors to turnover from continuing activities in
the 2002 ﬁnancial year were Concert (£2,158 million),
Cegetel (£1,068 million) and LG Telecom
(£240 million).
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 36 Operating and financial review The principal contributors to turnover from
discontinued activities in the 2002 ﬁnancial year were
Japan Telecom and J-Phone (£559 million to June
2001) and Airtel (£76 million to June 2001).
The group’s share of its ventures’ operating losses
from continuing activities before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items totalled £8 million in the 2004
ﬁnancial year. This compares to a proﬁt of
£181 million and a loss of £108 million in the 2003
and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The principal contributor to the group’s share of
operating proﬁts from continuing activities before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items in the
2003 ﬁnancial year was Cegetel (£198 million) and in
the 2002 ﬁnancial year the principal contributor to the
loss was Concert (£225 million) offset by proﬁts from
Cegetel (£168 million).

Total exceptional operating

In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, BT charged its share of an
exceptional goodwill impairment made by Albacom,
amounting to £26 million.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year BT completed the exit
from its investment in Blu on more favourable terms
than anticipated and accordingly exit cost provisions of
£150 million were released.
Concert’s performance was a cause of concern in
2001 and in October 2001 BT and AT&T announced
the unwind of Concert which was subsequently
completed on 1 April 2002. On completion, the
businesses, customer accounts and networks returned
to the two parent companies with BT and AT&T each
taking ownership of substantially those parts of
Concert originally contributed by them. As part of the
settlement with AT&T for the unwind of the Concert
global venture, BT received net cash of US$72 million
(£56 million). This net settlement includes the receipt
of US$350 million reﬂecting the allocation of the
businesses and the payment of US$278 million to
achieve the equal division of speciﬁed working capital
and other liability balances.
BT and AT&T also terminated their Canadian joint
venture agreement under which BT was committed to
participate in AT&T’s future obligation to acquire all of
the publicly traded shares of AT&T Canada. AT&T has
taken full ownership of BT’s interest in the Canadian
joint venture and in AT&T Canada, and has now
assumed full responsibility for all future obligations of
the joint venture. BT has now ceased to have any
interest in AT&T Canada, and has been released from
its future expenditure commitment associated with
AT&T Canada.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year BT wrote down the
carrying value of its investments in both Concert and
AT&T Canada. The exceptional impairment charge of
£1,153 million against these investments comprises
Concert goodwill impairment of £260 million, Concert
tangible ﬁxed asset write-downs of £546 million and
the write off of BT’s £347 million interest in AT&T
Canada (included within amounts written off
investments).
BT also recognised exceptional restructuring
charges of £81 million for its share of redundancy and
other unwind costs in Concert and BT’s own unwind
costs of £172 million have been charged against group
operating costs in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year exceptional impairment
charges and related exit costs totalling £407 million,
principally relating to goodwill and asset impairments
in Blu and SmarTone, were recognised in the light of
the rapidly changing global telecoms market
conditions.
Goodwill amortisation in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
amounted to £nil, compared to £2 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year and £53 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year. The reduction in the 2003 ﬁnancial year reﬂects
the disposals and the goodwill impairment charges
referred to above.
Total operating proﬁt (loss)
Total operating proﬁt from continuing activities before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items for the
2004 ﬁnancial year of £2,884 million was 3% lower
than in the 2003 ﬁnancial year which in turn was 12%
higher than the previous ﬁnancial year. The movement
in the underlying total operating proﬁt was due to the
factors explained above.
Total operating proﬁt for the 2004 ﬁnancial year
was £2,839 million, including BT’s share of the
operating results of its associates and joint ventures.
This compared to £2,901 million for the 2003 ﬁnancial
year and a loss of £1,860 million for the 2002 ﬁnancial
year. The reduction in total operating proﬁt in the
2004 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the reduction in group
turnover and associates’ and joint ventures’ proﬁts
offset by cost efﬁciency savings, the strong
performance of BT Global Services and lower leaver
costs. The improved performance in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year reﬂects the group’s exit from certain loss making
activities and the lower level of goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items.
Proﬁt on sale of group undertakings and ﬁxed
asset investments
During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, the consideration for
disposals totalled £133 million and the proﬁt before
tax from disposals totalled £36 million. This was
principally in relation to the disposal of the group’s
7.8% interest in Inmarsat which was sold for
US$118 million (£67 million) realising a proﬁt on
disposal of £32 million.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 37 Operating and financial review In the 2003 ﬁnancial year a number of non-core
investments were sold. The consideration for the
disposals totalled £3,028 million and the proﬁt before
taxation from disposals totalled £1,691 million. This
was principally in relation to the disposal of our 26%
interest in Cegetel, a French telecommunications
operator, on 22 January 2003. The total proceeds
were £2,603 million, received in cash, and the proﬁt
was £1,509 million before the recognition of an
exceptional interest charge of £293 million on closing
out ﬁxed interest rate swaps following receipt of the
sale proceeds.
A major feature of the 2002 ﬁnancial year was the
successful disposal of many non-core businesses. The
consideration for these disposals totalled £8.0 billion
as shown in the table below.

BT completed the sale to Vodafone of its 20%
economic interest in Japan Telecom and its 20%
interest in J-Phone Communications on 1 June 2001
and subsequently its interest in J-Phone group
companies. The total proceeds of sale were
£3,709 million received in cash, and the proﬁt was
£2,358 million.
The sale of Yell, BT’s classiﬁed advertising
directory businesses in the UK and the USA, was
completed on 22 June 2001 for a consideration of
£1,960 million, giving a proﬁt of £1,128 million. In
May 2001, the UK Ofﬁce of Fair Trading announced
that the price controls over the UK Yellow Pages
advertising rates were to be tightened signiﬁcantly.
The price we achieved for the sale of Yell, which was
announced on 26 May 2001, reﬂected the impact of
these controls on Yell’s prospects.
BT completed the sale of its 18% interest in Airtel,
a major Spanish wireless operator, to Vodafone for
£1,084 million on 29 June 2001. The proﬁt of
£844 million on the sale compares with BT’s
investment in the company of £223 million, built up
during the 1990s.
In November 2001, BT completed the sale of its
33% interest in Maxis Communications of Malaysia for
£350 million, which broadly equated with its carrying
value. We completed the sale of our interest in Rogers
Wireless to AT&T for £267 million on 29 June 2001
and recognised a loss of £23 million.
BT’s interest in BiB was diluted in July 2000 when
BSkyB gained control and in May 2001 we agreed to
exchange our residual interest in BiB for tranches of
shares in BSkyB. We received the ﬁrst tranche of
19 million BSkyB shares with an initial value of
£128 million on 28 June 2001. We were required to
hold 50% of this tranche until May 2002 and
recognised a proﬁt on these shares when they were
sold in May 2002. We also received the second tranche
of BSkyB shares with a similar value in November
2002, and they were sold at that time. The proﬁt of
£120 million recognised in the 2002 ﬁnancial year
relates to the BSkyB shares which we were permitted
to sell on receipt. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year a proﬁt on
disposal of BSkyB shares of £131 million was
recognised.
In December 2001, BT completed the sale of its
wholly owned subsidiary company, Clear
Communications Limited, which operates a
communications network in New Zealand, for
consideration of £119 million. A loss of £126 million
has been recognised on this sale of which £45 million
relates to goodwill taken directly to reserves before
April 1998.
In February 2002, we completed the sale of our
50% interest in e-peopleserve, a major human
resource outsourcing activity, to our joint-venture
partner, Accenture, for an initial consideration of
£50 million. BT is entitled to receive additional
payments from an earn-out arrangement based on
e-peopleserve’s revenues from customers other than
BT and Accenture over the ﬁve years to 2007. These
additional earn-out payments will total between
£27 million and approximately £167 million. A proﬁt of
£61 million on this transaction has been recognised in
the 2002 ﬁnancial year based on the initial
consideration and the discounted value of the
additional minimum payments of £20 million.
In addition, in the 2002 ﬁnancial year we
recognised an impairment charge of £347 million in
relation to the ﬁxed asset investment in AT&T Canada,
as noted above, and £157 million in relation to Impsat.
Proﬁt on sale of property ﬁxed assets
In December 2001, as part of a wider property
outsourcing arrangement, BT completed the sale and
leaseback of the majority of its UK properties to
Telereal, a 50/50 joint venture partnership formed by
Land Securities Trillium and The William Pears Group.
Around 6,700 properties – ofﬁces, telephone
exchanges, vehicle depots, warehouses, call centres
and computer centres – were transferred totalling
some 5.5 million square metres. Under these
arrangements, Telereal is responsible for providing
accommodation and estate management services to
BT. The consideration received amounted to £2,380
million. BT has leased the properties back at a total
annual rental commencing at around £190 million for
the 2003 ﬁnancial year and subject to a 3% annual
increase. This charge was offset by reduced
depreciation and interest charges. In addition, BT has
transferred the economic risk on a large portion of its
leased properties to Telereal in return for an annual
rental commencing at approximately £90 million per
annum. This was broadly equivalent to the existing
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 38 Operating and financial review level of rentals. In February 2002, BT outsourced its
property management unit to Telereal.
The proﬁt on the sale of the properties amounted to
£1,019 million and was determined after allowing
£129 million for BT’s actual and future obligations
under the terms of the legal agreement with Telereal
and for the cost of advisors’ fees. The obligations
include expenditure of £34 million to be incurred on
completing nearly ﬁnished new properties and
remedial work to be undertaken on several properties.
Part of the proceeds of sale were used in novating
ﬁxed interest rate obligations to support Telereal’s
ﬁnancing. An exceptional cost of £162 million was
incurred in unwinding this position and was included in
the interest charge for the year.
In summary, the property transaction beneﬁted
the results for the 2002 ﬁnancial year by £857 million
as shown below:
Proﬁt on sale and leaseback of properties £m
Sales proceeds 2,380
Net book value of assets disposed (1,232)
Estimated cost of BT’s future obligations (129)
Proﬁt on properties sold 1,019
Interest rate swap novation costs (162)
Net proﬁt on sale and leaseback of properties 857
Following this transaction, we retained direct
ownership of approximately 220 properties – including
certain telephone exchanges, computer centres and
high radio towers – totalling some 800,000 square
metres. We also retained BT Centre, our headquarters
building, Adastral Park, our major research facility near
Ipswich, Madley and Goonhilly earth satellite stations
and the BT Tower in central London.
In advance of the property transaction being
completed with Telereal, BT also completed the sale of
one of its major properties in London at a proﬁt of
£43 million.
Interest charge
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, the total net interest
charge, including BT’s share of its ventures’ charges,
at £941 million was £498 million lower than in the
preceding year, which in turn was £183 million lower
than in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. Of the total net
charge, £924 million arises in the BT group for the
2004 ﬁnancial year, compared with £1,420 million and
£1,540 million in the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years,
respectively.
The reduction in the net interest charge in the
2004 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the continued reduction in
the level of net debt and lower net exceptional charges
in the current year. The net exceptional charge
represents the premium on buying back e1.1 billion of
7.125% bonds due in 2011 and US$195 million of the
group’s US dollar bonds, partially offset by a credit
from the one off interest recognised on full repayment
of loan notes received as part of the original
consideration from the disposal of Yell.
The reduction in the net interest charge in the
2003 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the reduction in the level of
net debt and is partly offset by the £293 million
exceptional cost of terminating ﬁxed interest rate
swaps as a consequence of the receipt of the Cegetel
sale proceeds.
The substantially higher charge in the 2002
ﬁnancial year is mainly due to the cost of funding the
acquisition of mmO
2
’s third-generation mobile
licences, principally in the UK and Germany. In the
2002 ﬁnancial year, the group’s net interest charge
included the £162 million exceptional cost of novating
interest swaps as a consequence of the property sale
and leaseback transaction.
Interest cover in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
represented 3.3 times total operating proﬁt before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, and
compares with interest cover of 2.6 in the 2003
ﬁnancial year and 1.9 for continuing activities in the
2002 ﬁnancial year. The improvement in cover in the
2004 ﬁnancial year is due to the reduction in the
interest charge mainly arising from the reduction in net
debt. The improvement in cover in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year is due to the reduction in the interest charge and
improvement in the operating proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items. We expect the net
interest charge to decrease and interest cover to
continue to improve in the 2005 ﬁnancial year
following the continued reduction in net debt during
the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
Proﬁt (loss) before taxation
The group’s proﬁt before taxation for the 2004
ﬁnancial year was £1,948 million, compared with a
proﬁt of £3,157 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year and
a proﬁt of £1,461 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
The proﬁt in the 2003 ﬁnancial year included the
exceptional proﬁts from the sale of investments and
businesses totalling £1,691 million. The proﬁt in the
2002 ﬁnancial year included net exceptional gains of
£753 million.
The group’s proﬁt before taxation from continuing
activities before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items for the 2004 ﬁnancial year was £2,016 million,
compared with £1,829 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year and £1,273 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. The
improvement in the 2004 underlying proﬁt was due to
cost efﬁciency savings, the strong performance of
BT Global Services, lower leaver costs and lower
interest charges explained above. The improvement in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year was principally due to the exit
from loss making businesses, improved operating
proﬁts and lower interest charges explained above.
The proﬁt before taxation from discontinued
activities in the 2002 ﬁnancial year amounted to
£3,954 million. The 2002 ﬁnancial year included gains
on disposals from discontinued activities of
£4,368 million.
Taxation
The tax charge for the 2004 ﬁnancial year was
£539 million and comprises £568 million on the proﬁt
before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, offset by tax relief of £29 million on certain
exceptional charges. The tax charge on the proﬁt
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 39 Operating and financial review before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items is at an effective rate of 28.2%.
The tax charge for the 2003 ﬁnancial year was
£459 million and comprises £598 million on the proﬁt
before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, offset by tax relief of £139 million on certain
exceptional charges. The tax charge on the proﬁt
before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items is at an effective rate of 32.7%.
The tax charge for the 2002 ﬁnancial year was
£443 million. The effective rate was 41.5% of the
proﬁt from continuing activities before taxation,
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. This was
in excess of the standard UK tax rate of 30% due to
the impact of loss making subsidiaries outside the UK
for which tax relief is not immediately available and
associate company taxation.
Earnings (loss) per share
The basic earnings per share of 16.4 pence per share
for the 2004 ﬁnancial year compares with 31.2 pence
for the 2003 ﬁnancial year and 12.0 pence for the
2002 ﬁnancial year. The following table illustrates the
impact of the group’s discontinued activities up to the
date of demerger or sale for the 2002 ﬁnancial year, as
well as signiﬁcant exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation on the basic earnings per share for the

an equivalent of 14.2 pence and 8.8 pence for the
2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share were not materially
different in all three years.
Dividends
In line with the policy announced in November 2003,
the board recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 5.3 pence
per share to shareholders, amounting to £454 million.
This will be paid, subject to shareholder approval, on
6 September 2004 to shareholders on the register on
6 August 2004. This takes the dividend for the full year
to 8.5 pence per share, compared to 6.5 pence in the
2003 ﬁnancial year, an increase of 31%. This year’s
dividend pay out ratio is 50% of earnings before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items and we
expect this to increase to around 60% for the 2006
ﬁnancial year.
The interim and ﬁnal dividend in the 2003
ﬁnancial year was 2.25 pence per share and
4.25 pence per share, respectively. This gave a full
dividend for the year of 6.5 pence per share,
amounting to £560 million.
The ﬁnal and full dividend for the 2002 ﬁnancial
year was 2.0 pence per share, which absorbed
£173 million. As part of BT’s debt reduction and
restructuring plans, the Board decided in May 2001
that there was to be no interim dividend for the 2002
ﬁnancial year.
Financing
Net cash inﬂow from operating activities of
£5,389 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year compares
with £6,023 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year and
£5,257 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. Net cash
inﬂow from continuing operating activities amounted
to £5,023 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. Special

consequently reducing the net cash inﬂow by these
amounts. The pension payments in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year include early payment of £380 million deﬁciency
contributions to the BT Pension Scheme, which
represents most of the deﬁciency contributions for the
2005 and 2006 ﬁnancial years.
The net cash outﬂow for returns on investments
and servicing of ﬁnance amounted to £527 million,
£1,506 million and £1,695 million in the 2004, 2003
and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively. The reduction
in the 2004 ﬁnancial year outﬂow of £979 million
reﬂects the receipt of £420 million of funds on
restructuring some of the group’s swap portfolio.
There will be offsetting higher interest payments in
future years as a result of restructuring the swaps. The
2003 ﬁnancial year included the payment of a
£293 million premium on closing out £2.6 billion of
ﬁxed interest rate swaps, following receipt of the
Cegetel sale proceeds.
Tax paid in the 2004 ﬁnancial year totalled
£317 million compared with £434 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year and £562 million paid in the 2002
ﬁnancial year. The lower tax paid in the 2004 and
2003 ﬁnancial years reﬂects the lower current tax
charge and the level of payments made on account.
The net cash outﬂow of £2,477 million for capital
expenditure and ﬁnancial investment in the 2004
ﬁnancial year included £2,684 million of capital
expenditure on property, plant and equipment, offset
by £208 million received on the sale of ﬁxed assets. In
the 2003 ﬁnancial year the net cash outﬂow of
£2,381 million for capital expenditure and ﬁnancial
investment included £2,580 million of capital
expenditure on plant and equipment, offset by
£200 million received on the sale of ﬁxed assets. In the
2002 ﬁnancial year the net cash outﬂow of
£1,354 million for capital expenditure and ﬁnancial
investment included £4,069 million of capital
expenditure on plant and equipment, offset by
£2,752 million received on the sale of ﬁxed assets.
These proceeds included £2,380 million from the
property sale and leaseback transaction completed in
December 2001, described above.
The net cash outﬂow from acquisitions less
disposals in the 2004 ﬁnancial year totalled
£60 million. The principal cash outﬂow for acquisitions
was due to the purchase of a controlling interest in BT
Expedite Limited (formerly NSB Retail plc) and
Transcomm plc. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year the net cash
inﬂow from disposals less acquisitions totalled
£2,842 million. Cash proceeds from disposals
amounted to £2,919 million and principally comprised
£2,603 million from the sale of the investment in
Cegetel. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year the net cash inﬂow
from disposals less acquisitions totalled £5,785 million.
Cash proceeds from disposals amounted to
£6,916 million and principally comprised
£3,075 million from the sale of the investment in
Japan Telecom and J-Phone, £1,838 million from the
sale of the Yell directories business and £1,084 million
from the sale of our investment in Airtel. The principal
cash outﬂow for acquisitions was the completion of the
purchase of a minority interest in Esat Digifone in April
2001 for £869 million.
Equity dividends paid in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
totalled £645 million whilst those paid in the 2003
ﬁnancial year totalled £367 million. There were no
equity dividends paid in the 2002 ﬁnancial year as
explained above.
The resulting cash inﬂow for the 2004 ﬁnancial
year, before management of liquid resources and
ﬁnancing, of £1,366 million was mainly applied in
repaying long-term borrowings and short-term
investments with total borrowings of £3,627 million
being repaid. In addition, the group issued new loans
of £1,326 million. The new loans included a
US$172 million 0.75% exchangeable bond due in
2008, exchangeable into ordinary shares of
LG Telecom, BT’s Korean based associate and a sale
and leaseback of circuit switches which had no effect
on net debt but increased gross debt and cash by
around £1 billion. The cash inﬂow for the 2003
ﬁnancial year of £4,183 million was applied in repaying
short-term borrowings and investing in short-term
investments, with total borrowings of £2,535 million
being repaid. The cash inﬂow for the 2002 ﬁnancial
year of £7,433 million was also applied in repaying
short-term borrowings and investing in short-term
investments. This was in part due to the success of the
company’s rights issue which closed in June 2001.
1,976 million new shares were issued for a total
consideration of £5,876 million, net of expenses. As
part of the demerger arrangements, £440 million was
received from mmO
2
, additionally mmO
2
assumed
£60 million of the group’s external net debt.
The cash inﬂow for the 2004 ﬁnancial year
resulted in net debt reducing by a further
£1,148 million to £8,425 million having reduced by
£4,128 million to £9,573 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year the cash inﬂow
resulted in net debt reducing to £13,701 million at
31 March 2002.
During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, as noted earlier,
the group restructured some of its swaps portfolio to
mitigate credit risk to certain counterparties. As a
result, the group terminated £7 billion of cross-
currency interest rate swaps and replaced these with
new swaps which had the same economic hedging
effect. This resulted in the group paying £445 million
in reducing gross debt and receiving £420 million of
interest receipts. The interest receipts have been
included within deferred income on the balance sheet
and will be amortised to the proﬁt and loss account
over the term of the underlying hedged debt.
During the 2004 ﬁnancial year the group
commenced a share buyback programme,
repurchasing 81 million shares during the year for
consideration of £144 million. The buyback
programme will be funded from cash generated over
and above that required to meet our net debt target of
around £7 billion in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, after
paying dividends and taking into account acquisitions
or disposals.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 41 Operating and financial review Treasury policy
The group has a centralised treasury operation whose
primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investment
and the group’s ﬁnancial risk, including risk from
volatility in currency and interest rates and counterparty
credit risk. The treasury operation is not a proﬁt centre
and the objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The Board sets the treasury department’s policy
and its activities are subject to a set of controls
commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowings
and investments under its management. Counterparty
credit risk is closely monitored and managed within
controls set by the Board. Derivative instruments,
including forward foreign exchange contracts, are
entered into for hedging purposes only.
We have set out further details on this topic and
on our capital resources and foreign currency exposure
in note 36 to the ﬁnancial statements in compliance
with FRS 13.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
As disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements there are no
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future material
effect on the group’s ﬁnancial condition, changes in
ﬁnancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital
resources, with the exception of the following:
& Operating leases (note 30)
& Capital commitments and guarantees (note 30)
& Derivative contracts (note 36)
Capital resources
During the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years the group
has reduced its level of borrowings so that its net debt
was £8.4 billion at 31 March 2004 compared with
£9.6 billion at 31 March 2003 and £13.7 billion at
31 March 2002. The debt reduction in the 2003
ﬁnancial year was principally achieved by the disposal
of our stake in Cegetel.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that
the group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future and
therefore they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
There has been no signiﬁcant change in the
ﬁnancial or trading position of the group since
31 March 2004.
The following table sets out the group’s
contractual obligations and commitments as they fall
due for payment, as at 31 March 2004.

At 31 March 2004, the group had cash and short-term
investments of £5,272 million. At that date,
£1,271 million of debt fell due for repayment in the
2005 ﬁnancial year. The group had unused short-term
bank facilities, amounting to approximately
£145 million at 31 March 2004. These resources will
allow the group to settle its obligations as they fall
due.
At 31 March 2003, the group had cash and
short-term investments of £6,431 million. The group
had unused short-term bank facilities, amounting to
approximately £575 million at 31 March 2003.
Foreign currency and interest rate exposure
Most of the group’s current turnover is invoiced in
pounds sterling, and most of its operations and costs
arise within the UK. The group’s foreign currency
borrowings, which totalled £9.4 billion at 31 March
2004, are used to ﬁnance its operations. These
borrowings have been predominantly swapped into
sterling. Cross currency swaps and forward foreign
exchange contracts have been entered into to reduce
the foreign currency exposure on the group’s
operations and the group’s net assets. The group also
enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to
hedge investment, interest expense and purchase and
sale commitments. The commitments hedged are
principally US dollar and euro denominated. As a result
of these policies, the group’s exposure to foreign
currency arises mainly on the residual currency
exposure on its non-UK investments in its subsidiaries
and ventures and on any imbalances between the value
of outgoing and incoming international calls.
The group’s exposure to changes in currency
movements decreased signiﬁcantly following the
demerger of the mmO
2
business and its European
operations in November 2001. A 10% strengthening in
sterling against major currencies would cause the
group’s net assets at 31 March 2004 to fall by less
than £120 million, with insigniﬁcant effect on the
group’s proﬁt. This compares with a fall of less than
£100 million and £150 million in the years ended
31 March 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Foreign exchange contracts are entered into as a
hedge of sales and purchases, accordingly a change in
the fair value of the hedge is offset by a corresponding
change in the value of the underlying sale or purchase.
The majority of the group’s long-term borrowings
have been, and are, subject to ﬁxed interest rates. The
group has entered into interest rate swap agreements
with commercial banks and other institutions to vary
the amounts and period for which interest rates are
ﬁxed. At 31 March 2004, the group had outstanding
interest rate swap agreements with notional principal
amounts totalling £5,210 million compared to
£5,170 million at 31 March 2003.
The long-term debt instruments which BT issued in
December 2000 and February 2001 both contained
covenants that if the BT group credit rating were
downgraded below A3 in the case of Moody’s or below
A minus in the case of Standard & Poor’s (S&P),
additional interest would accrue from the next interest
coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 42 Operating and financial review for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings
agency. In May 2001, Moody’s downgraded BT’s
credit rating to Baa1, which increased BT’s annual
interest charge by approximately £32 million. BT’s
credit rating from S&P is A minus. Based upon the
total amount of debt of £9 billion outstanding on these
instruments at 31 March 2004, BT’s annual interest
charge would increase by approximately £45 million if
BT’s credit rating were to be downgraded by one credit
rating category by both agencies below a long-term
debt rating of Baa1/ A minus. If BT’s credit rating with
Moody’s was to be upgraded by one credit rating
category the annual interest charge would be reduced
by approximately £23 million.
Based upon the composition of net debt at
31 March 2004, a one percentage point increase in
interest rates would increase the group’s annual net
interest expense by less than £15 million. This
compares with an increase of less than £10 million and
less than £20 million in the years ended 31 March
2003 and 2002, respectively.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure on plant, equipment and property
(excluding the movement on capital accruals) totalled
£2,673 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year, compared
with £2,445 million and £3,908 million in the 2003
and 2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively. Of the total
capital expenditure in the 2002 ﬁnancial year,
£3,100 million was in relation to the group’s
continuing activities. Work continues on enhancing the
intelligence of the network to enable customers to
beneﬁt from advanced services and improving the
network’s capacity to carry high-speed data. Capital
expenditure is expected to rise, but remain within its
£3 billion annual target, in the 2005 ﬁnancial year as
the group invests in its 21st century network (21CN)
programme.
Capital expenditure in relation to the group’s
discontinued activities amounted to £808 million in
the 2002 ﬁnancial year. Prior to the demerger, mmO
2
continued improving the quality and capacity of its
digital GSM network.
Of the capital expenditure, £86 million was in
Europe, outside the UK, in the 2004 ﬁnancial year and
£138 million was spent there in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year.
Contracts placed for ongoing capital expenditure
totalled £879 million at 31 March 2004. We plan to
develop the 21CN using stringent capital return criteria
and a rigorous approach to any investment in the
narrowband network. 21CN aims to deliver long term,
structural cost reduction, as we progressively migrate
onto a simpler, lower cost network architecture.
BT expects that future capital expenditure will be
funded from net cash inﬂows from operating activities,
and, if required, by external ﬁnancing.
Acquisitions
The total amount invested in the 2004 ﬁnancial year,
including further funding of existing ventures, was
£61 million. The total amount invested in the 2003
ﬁnancial year, including further funding of existing
ventures, was £77 million, signiﬁcantly lower than the
£1,131 million invested in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. In
the 2002 ﬁnancial year the signiﬁcant acquisition
made in April 2001 was of the 49.5% interest in Esat
Digifone that we did not already own, from Telenor,
for £869 million under an agreement made in early
2000.
Demerger and capital reduction
The demerger of mmO
2
, the group’s former mobile
phone business, was completed in November 2001.
The demerger, scheme of arrangement and associated
reduction in capital were approved by shareholders in
October 2001 and the High Court in November 2001.
The demerger of mmO
2
created two new listed
companies and dealings in BT Group and mmO
2
shares commenced on 19 November 2001. BT
shareholders on record on 16 November 2001,
received one BT Group plc share and one mmO
2
plc
share for each existing British Telecommunications plc
share held. Based on the ﬁrst day’s dealings on the
London Stock Exchange, BT Group represented
approximately 78% of the equity value of the former
BT group and mmO
2
represented approximately 22%.
On the demerger, net assets of £19,490 million
attributable to mmO
2
were distributed to shareholders
in the form of a demerger distribution. mmO
2
assumed approximately £500 million of debt, with the
bulk of the outstanding debt remaining with the
continuing BT Group. The reduction of capital had the
effect of increasing distributable reserves in BT Group
plc by £9,537 million.
Balance sheet
Net assets at 31 March 2004 amounted to
£3,094 million compared to £2,642 million at
31 March 2003, with the increase due to the retained
proﬁts of £685 million offset by the £144 million
buyback of shares and currency movements.
BT Group plc, the parent company, has reserves of
£9,585 million at 31 March 2004 and £9,537 million
at 31 March 2003.
BT’s ﬁxed assets totalled £16,068 million at
31 March 2004 of which £15,487 million were tangible
assets, principally forming the UK ﬁxed network. At
31 March 2003 ﬁxed assets were £16,661 million and
tangible assets were £15,888 million.
Return on capital employed
The return before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items on the average capital employed
(total assets, excluding goodwill, less current liabilities,
excluding corporate taxes and dividends payable, and
provisions other than those for deferred taxation) was
15.3% for the 2004 ﬁnancial year. In the 2003
ﬁnancial year the group made a return from continuing
activities before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items of 15.7%. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year the group
made a return from continuing activities before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of 15.7%
on the average capital employed in its business
excluding mmO
2
and goodwill.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 43 Operating and financial review Pensions
The most recently completed triennial actuarial
valuation of the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS), BT’s main
pension fund, performed by the BTPS independent
actuary for the trustees of the scheme, was carried out
as at 31 December 2002. This valuation showed the
fund to be in deﬁcit to an amount of £2.1 billion.
Assets of the fund of £22.8 billion at that date covered
92% of the fund’s liabilities. The previous valuation
was carried out as at 31 December 1999. The result of
this valuation was that the fund was in deﬁcit by
£1.0 billion. Assets of the fund of £29.7 billion at that
date covered 97% of the fund’s liabilities. The
deterioration in the funding position was principally the
result of lower equity returns over the three years and
improved life expectancy of BTPS members and was in
spite of the additional deﬁciency funding payments
totalling £600 million that were paid over the previous
three years. The valuation under the prescribed
Minimum Funding Requirement approach showed the
assets to cover 101% of the liabilities at 31 December
2002.
The group’s ordinary contribution rate increased to
12.2% of employees’ pensionable pay with effect from
April 2003. The contribution rate was 11.6% for the
2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years. In addition, the
company agreed to make annual deﬁciency
contributions to the BTPS of £232 million with effect
from the 2004 ﬁnancial year. In the 2004 ﬁnancial
year total deﬁciency contributions of £612 million were
made, including early payment of £380 million
scheduled for payment in subsequent years. This
compares to the £200 million annual deﬁciency
payments made in the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years.
The group is also required to pay special contributions
to cover costs arising from enhanced pension beneﬁts
provided to leavers. The special contributions paid in
the 2004, 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years amounted to
£130 million, £129 million and £400 million,
respectively, in respect of early leavers. The payment
expected to be made in the 2005 ﬁnancial year is
£5 million in relation to leavers in the calendar year
ended 31 December 2003.
The group continues to account for pension costs
in accordance with UK Statement of Standard
Accounting Practice No. 24 (SSAP 24). The group’s
total annual pension charges, including discontinued
activities, for the 2004, 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years
were £404 million, £322 million and £382 million,
respectively. This includes £376 million, £306 million
and £373 million, respectively, in relation to the BTPS.
The increase in the pension charge in the 2004
ﬁnancial year reﬂects the £154 million amortisation
charge for the pension deﬁcit partly offset by a
reduction in the number of active members and the
interest credit related to the balance sheet
prepayment.
The reduction in the pension charge in the 2003
ﬁnancial year reﬂects the lower membership of the
BTPS and the interest credit on the balance sheet
prepayment.
The costs of providing incremental pension
beneﬁts for leavers amounted to £1 million,
£60 million and £46 million in the 2004, 2003 and
2002 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The pension charge for the 2004 ﬁnancial year is
based upon the SSAP 24 valuation as at 31 March
2003. This valuation is based on the December 2002
funding valuation, rolled forward to 31 March 2003,
and uses a slightly higher investment return
assumption than was used for the trustees’ funding
valuation, a lower inﬂation rate and lower salary
increase assumptions. The resulting SSAP 24 deﬁcit
amounts to £1.4 billion. The regular pension cost is
charged at 11.3% of pensionable salaries compared to
the 11.6% rate applied in the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial
years.
The full FRS 17 disclosures are provided in the
notes to the ﬁnancial statements. At 31 March 2004
the FRS 17 deﬁcit was £3.6 billion, net of tax, being a
reduction of 43% from £6.3 billion at 31 March 2003.
The number of retired members and other current
beneﬁciaries in the pension fund has been increasing in
recent years and, at 31 December 2003, was
approximately 104% higher than the number of active
members. Consequently, BT’s future pension costs and
contributions will depend on the investment returns of
the pension fund and could ﬂuctuate in the medium
term.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March
2001 and we launched a new deﬁned contribution
pension scheme for people joining BT after that date
which is to provide beneﬁts based on the employees’
and the employing company’s contributions. This
change is in line with the practice increasingly adopted
by major UK groups and is designed to be more
ﬂexible for employees and enable the group to
determine its pension costs more precisely than is the
case for deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. The ﬁnancial impact
of this change was not signiﬁcant in the ﬁnancial years
under review and is not expected to be signiﬁcant in
the next few years but it should reduce pension costs
in the longer term.
Geographical information
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, approximately 93% of the
group’s turnover was generated by operations in the
UK, compared with 94% in the 2003 and 89% in the
2002 ﬁnancial years. Of its continuing activities,
approximately 92% of the group’s turnover was
generated by operations in the UK in the 2002
ﬁnancial year. BT’s operating proﬁts have been derived
from its UK operations with losses being incurred
outside the UK in each of the last three ﬁnancial years.
Economic and Monetary Union
The euro is established as the single currency spanning
the 12 EU member countries participating in Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU). Most of the group’s
business in Europe is conducted in the UK, which is not
one of the 12 participants.
Following the June 2003 announcement by the UK
Government detailed planning and preparation for
euro conversion has been put on hold until a
Government decision to recommend UK entry. After
any such decision the issue will be put to a vote in
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 44 Operating and financial review Parliament and then to a referendum. BT has
completed outline planning, participated in by
representatives from across each of the BT lines of
business and supporting group functions, for adoption
of the euro. BT policy will ensure consistency of
approach across the group and will be in line with
Government plans for a phased transition.
Regulatory ﬁnancial information
BT is required under the continuation notice issued by
Oftel on 25 July 2003, which extends the applicability
of certain conditions previously included in its main
licence, to publish disaggregated ﬁnancial information
for various activities of the group, which have been
used as the basis of charges paid by other
telecommunication operators in the UK for the use of
BT’s network. The activities presented separately in
the regulatory ﬁnancial statements do not necessarily
correspond with any businesses separately managed,
funded or operated within the group. The results set
out in regulatory ﬁnancial statements for the 2003 and
2002 ﬁnancial years showed that the group’s
operating proﬁt is derived predominantly from ﬁxed-
network calls.

Critical accounting policies
The group’s principal accounting policies are set out
on pages 75 to 77 of the Consolidated ﬁnancial
statements and conform with UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). In accordance with
the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard
No. 18, these policies and applicable estimation
techniques have been reviewed by the directors who
have conﬁrmed them to be the most appropriate for
the preparation of the 2004 ﬁnancial statements.
We, in common with virtually all other companies,
need to use estimates in the preparation of our
ﬁnancial statements. The most sensitive estimates
affecting our ﬁnancial statements are in the areas of
assessing the level of interconnect income with and
payments to other telecommunications operators,
providing for doubtful debts, establishing ﬁxed asset
lives for depreciation purposes, assessing the stage of
completion and likely outcome under long term
contracts, making appropriate long-term assumptions
in calculating pension liabilities and costs, making
appropriate medium-term assumptions on asset
impairment reviews and calculating current tax
liabilities on our proﬁts.
We are required to interconnect our networks with
other telecommunications operators. In certain
instances we rely on other operators to measure the
trafﬁc ﬂows interconnecting with our networks. We use
estimates in these cases to determine the amount of
income receivable from or payments we need to make
to these other operators. The prices at which these
services are charged are often regulated and are
subject to retrospective adjustment. We use estimates
in assessing the likely effect of these adjustments.
We provide services to over 20 million individuals and
businesses, mainly on credit terms. We know that
certain debts due to us will not be paid through the
default of a small number of our customers. We use
estimates, based on our historical experience, in
determining the level of debts that we believe will not
be collected. These estimates include such factors as
the current state of the UK economy and particular
industry issues.
The plant and equipment used in our networks is
long-lived with cables and switching equipment
operating for over ten years and underground ducts
being used for decades. The annual depreciation
charge is sensitive to the estimated service lives we
allocate to each type of asset. We regularly review
these asset lives and change them when necessary to
reﬂect current thinking on their remaining lives in light
of technological change, prospective economic
utilisation and physical condition of the assets
concerned.
As part of the property rationalisation programme
we have identiﬁed a number of properties that are
surplus to requirements. Although efforts are being
made to sub-let this space it is recognised by
management that this may not be possible
immediately in the current economic environment.
Estimates have been made of the cost of vacant
possession and any shortfall arising from the sub lease
rental income being lower than the lease costs being
borne by BT.
We enter into long term customer contracts which
can extend over a number of ﬁnancial years. During
the contractual period, turnover, cost and proﬁts may
be impacted by estimates of the ultimate proﬁtability
of each contract. If, at any time, these estimates
indicate the contract will be unproﬁtable, the entire
estimated loss for the contract is recognised
immediately. The company performs ongoing
proﬁtability analyses of its contracts in order to
determine whether the latest estimates require
updating. Key factors reviewed include future staff and
third party costs and potential productivity efﬁciencies.
We have a commitment, mainly through the BT
Pension Scheme, to pay pension beneﬁts to
approximately 362,000 people over more than
60 years. The cost of these beneﬁts and the present
value of our pension liabilities depend on such factors
as the life expectancy of the members, the salary
progression of our current employees, the return that
the pension fund assets will generate in the time
before they are used to fund the pension payments
and the discount rate at which the future pension
payments are discounted. We use estimates for all
these factors in determining the pension costs and
liabilities incorporated in our ﬁnancial statements.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year, we made charges for
the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill,
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 45 Operating and financial review investments and tangible ﬁxed assets in our balance
sheet. The amount of the charges are in most cases
based on the discounted present value of the future
cash ﬂows that we expected to be derived from these
assets. We use estimates in determining these future
cash ﬂows and the discount rate.
The actual tax we pay on our proﬁts is determined
according to complex tax laws and regulations. Where
the effect of these laws and regulations is unclear, we
use estimates in determining the liability for the tax to
be paid on our past proﬁts which we recognise in our
ﬁnancial statements.
International accounting standards
The Council of the European Union (EU) announced in
June 2002 that all European listed companies will be
required to adopt EU endorsed International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and International
Accounting Standards (IASs) in the preparation of
ﬁnancial statements from 2005 onwards. This means
the group will prepare its ﬁrst ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with endorsed IFRSs and IASs for the year
ending 31 March 2006. The international standard
setter, the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB), has undertaken an extensive exercise to
develop new standards and improve existing ones. The
work on those standards that are applicable is now
substantially complete. In addition, the IASB may issue
non-mandatory standards up to the date of transition.
Our project to manage the transition of ﬁnancial
reporting from UK GAAP to international accounting is
progressing well. The group has completed initial high
level assessments of the impact on our results and net
assets and rolled out the initial phase of detailed
quantiﬁcations of comparative information.
The IFRSs which will be mandatory in the 2006
ﬁnancial year are now substantially complete and, in
addition, certain IFRSs may be issued before the 2006
ﬁnancial year which we may decide to adopt early. The
effects of such early adoptions, if any, cannot be
quantiﬁed at present. However, we believe that the
major areas of impact on our net proﬁt and
shareholders’ funds will be due to the standards
regarding ﬁnancial instruments, pensions, leases and
share based payments. Details of the required
adjustments for the restated periods will be provided at
the appropriate time.
US GAAP
The group’s net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per
share for the three ﬁnancial years ended 31 March
2004 and shareholders’ equity at 31 March 2004 and
2003 under US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (US GAAP) are shown further in the United
States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
Section (see Consolidated ﬁnancial statements).
Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP include
results of the differing accounting treatment of leasing
transactions, pension costs, redundancy costs,
intangible assets, goodwill, deferred taxation,
capitalisation of interest, ﬁnancial instruments,
contributing assets to joint ventures, stock
compensation, and dividends. Cash ﬂow information
under the US GAAP presentation is also shown further
in this document.
In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation
No. 46 (FIN 46), ‘‘Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities’’ and in December 2003 issued a revised
interpretation, FIN 46R. The interpretation requires
the primary beneﬁciary to consolidate a variable
interest entity if it has a variable interest that will
absorb a majority of the entity’s losses if they occur, or
receive a majority of the entity’s expected returns or
both. BT had adopted FIN 46 in June 2003, and the
further adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material
effect on the results or statement of ﬁnancial position
of the group.
In May 2003 the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,
‘‘Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity’’. SFAS
No. 150 establishes standards for how to classify and
measure certain ﬁnancial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires
that an issuer classify a ﬁnancial instrument that is
within its scope as a liability, or an asset in some
circumstances. On adoption, SFAS No. 150 did not
have a material effect on the results or statement of
ﬁnancial position of the group.
In November 2002 the Emerging Issues Task Force
reached a consensus on EITF 00-21 ‘‘Revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables’’. BT adopted
this consensus for contracts entered into after 15 June
2003. Adoption of the consensus did not have a
material impact on the results of the group.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 46 Operating and financial review Corporate social responsibility (CSR)
Our challenge is to manage social, ethical and
environmental issues in ways that grow shareholder
value and help make sustainable development happen.
The Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes rank
companies for their success in meeting this challenge.
During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, BT was ranked as the
top telecommunications company in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index for the third year running.
We also hold the Queen’s Award for Enterprise in
recognition of our contribution to sustainable
development.
This section of the report, together with the broad
statement on social, environmental and ethical matters
included in the section on Corporate governance,
provides information in response to the Association of
British Insurers’ disclosure guidelines on social
responsibility.
More detailed disclosures on BT’s implementation
of social, ethical and environmental policies and
procedures are available online in our independently-
veriﬁed social and environmental report, which has
been prepared in accordance with the 2002 Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting
guidelines.
CSR governance
The Board is kept informed of BT’s main CSR risks and
opportunities and any new developments which may
impact on its duties and reviews annually our CSR
strategy. In addition, social, ethical and environmental
matters have been incorporated into the directors’
induction programme.
A Board committee – the Community Support
Committee – oversees community, charitable and arts
expenditure and establishes the strategy for
maximising our contribution to society. The
committee, chaired by Sir Christopher Bland, consists
of representatives from BT businesses, two non-
executive directors and two external independent
members, who have a reputation for excellence in this
ﬁeld.
An executive committee, the Corporate Social
Responsibility Steering Group (CSRSG), oversees the
implementation of our CSR programme. This includes
risk assessment, target and objective setting,
ISO14001 certiﬁcation – the international standard for
environmental management systems – and public
accountability.
The CSRSG consists of CSR champions nominated
by the lines of business and six support functions
(human resources, corporate governance, health and
safety, ﬁnance, communications and procurement).
The CSRSG is chaired by BT’s overall CSR
champion, Alison Ritchie, Chief Broadband Ofﬁcer and
a member of the Operating Committee. It is supported
by advice from an independent panel of CSR experts.
To ensure that CSR is embedded into BT’s
commercial operations, we undertake CSR ‘‘health
checks’’ of our main commercial initiatives.
These health checks identify speciﬁc social,
economic and environmental impacts (both positive
and negative) and particular CSR risks and
opportunities. A report is then compiled, including
recommended actions.
We have important relationships with a wide range
of stakeholders, including employees, customers and
suppliers. We engage with these stakeholders in a
number of ways, including consumer liaison panels, an
annual employee survey and a supplier relationship
management programme.
We also employ a number of CSR experts who
investigate long-term societal trends, identify potential
issues that might affect the business and support BT’s
commercial activities.
We have identiﬁed 11 non-ﬁnancial KPIs (key
performance indicators) in this context to provide a
quick overview of BT’s social and environmental
performance.
These KPIs have also been used to establish ten
strategic social and environmental targets and are
published in our social and environmental report.
Social, environmental and ethical risks
During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we developed a
separate CSR risk register that sets out our important
social, ethical and environmental risks. It identiﬁes the
following risks as the most signiﬁcant in the context of
CSR:
& supply chain working conditions
& health and safety
& climate change
& diversity
& geography of jobs (‘‘offshoring’’)
& breach of the code of business ethics.
Each of these CSR risks has a risk owner and
mitigation strategy in place (more detail can be found
in our social and environmental report).
CSR business opportunities
Following a detailed statistical analysis of customer
opinion data going back up to 80 months and based
on tens of thousands of interviews, we have been able
to show that a 1% improvement in the public’s
perception of our CSR activities results in a 0.1%
increase in our retail customer satisfaction ﬁgures.
This is a critical correlation and shows how
important it is not only to protect our reputation
through appropriate risk management activities, but
also to enhance it through our community activities.
Long-term sustainability trends are creating
market opportunities for us, such as the use of
teleconferencing and ﬂexible working to reduce the
need to travel and provide more ﬂexible lifestyles.
Increasingly, BT has to address social and
environmental matters when bidding for business. In
the 2004 ﬁnancial year, bids to the value of almost
£900 million required us to demonstrate expertise in
managing these issues.
Environment
BT is one of the largest consumers of industrial and
commercial electricity in the UK, and the growth of
broadband is likely to increase our electricity use.
However, during the 2004 ﬁnancial year, a £675,000
investment in our energy conservation programme
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 47 Operating and financial review
Our commitment to society enabled us to reduce our electricity consumption by
1.5%.
The use of renewable energy and combined heat
and power – together with energy and transport
efﬁciency measures – has enabled us to reduce our
global-warming CO
2
emissions by 42% since 1996. We
have set a target to cap our 2010 CO
2
emissions at
25% below those of 1996.

During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we received an income
of £4 million from our recycling activities, offset
against the £10 million we spent managing our waste
contracts, recycling our waste and sending waste to
landﬁll.

Digital inclusion
Digital inclusion is a key public policy issue and we are
working with the UK Government and the voluntary
sector to ﬁnd effective ways to use communications
technology to tackle social exclusion.
In particular, we launched a digital inclusion
campaign to support the Government’s aim to give all
citizens online access within the next few years and
demonstrate how communications can help improve
society.
A key element of the campaign is the
‘‘Everybodyonline’’ programme, established in
partnership with charity campaign group, Citizens
Online. The campaign is currently focused on eight
deprived communities and aims to increase skills and
access to communications technology in
underprivileged areas and to deepen the
understanding of the causes and effects of the digital
divide and how they may be addressed nationally.
Disability services
Our Age and Disability Action team promotes equal
access to a wide range of products and services. We
work directly with older and disabled people and their
representatives to raise awareness of BT’s inclusive
approach.
For people with hearing or speech impairments, for
example, our textphone offers easy access to BT
TextDirect – the service that enables users to dial
direct to other text or voice users. Customers with
visual or mobility impairments beneﬁt from products
with large clear keypads and cordless or hands-free
options. A variety of new products and network
services with mixed-ability appeal will be launched
during the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
We continue to offer services to protect the
telephone lines of people who need support. This
includes free directory enquiries for those unable to
use the printed directory and billing, service and
product information in a variety of formats, such as
Braille and large print.
We are committed to increasing the accessibility of
our internet pages. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, our Age
and Disability Action website (www.btplc.com/
age_disability) was awarded the RNIB See it Right logo.
Community
We commit a minimum of 0.5% of our UK pre-tax
proﬁts to direct activities in support of society. This
has ranged from £10 million in 1987, peaking at
£16 million in 2001 and was £5.6 million (including
£1.2 million to charities) in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. BT
operations also provided a further £12.4 million in
funding and support in kind over the past ﬁnancial
year.
The focus of our community programmes is on big
issues where better communication can make a real
difference to society.
For example, more than 9,500 schools and over
two million young people have taken part in the BT
Education Programme – a drama-based campaign
helping children to improve their communication skills.
This activity is supported by our volunteering
programme which, at 31 March 2004, had 3,000
registered volunteers working with schools.
We are working with ChildLine on a major new
campaign to raise funds to ensure that every one of
the 4,000 children who call ChildLine every day has
his/her call answered.
In addition, BT people gave £2 million directly to
charities during the 2004 ﬁnancial year through Give
as you Earn, to which BT added a direct contribution of
£1 million.

ﬁnancial statements of the company, BT Group plc,
and the group, which includes its subsidiary
undertakings, for the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
Introduction
BT Group plc is the listed holding company for
the BT group of companies and was formed when
the mmO
2
business (comprising what had been British
Telecommunications plc’s mobile activities in the UK,
the Netherlands, Germany and the Republic of Ireland)
was demerged on 19 November 2001.

46, the discussion on Corporate governance on
pages 52 to 57, the Report on directors’
remuneration on pages 58 to 71 and Risk Factors on
pages 138 and 139 form part of this report. The
audited ﬁnancial statements are presented on
pages 74 to 134.
Principal activity
The group’s principal activity is the supply
of communications services and equipment. In
the 2004 ﬁnancial year, approximately 93% of group
turnover arose from operations in the UK.
Directors
The names and biographical details of the directors
of the company are given on pages 49 and 50. All
served throughout the ﬁnancial year.
In accordance with the articles of association,
Sir Christopher Bland retires by rotation at the
forthcoming annual general meeting and will be
proposed for re-election. Andy Green, Ian Livingston and
John Nelson also retire by rotation and will be proposed
for re-election. Details of these directors’ contracts
of appointment are included in theReportondirectors’
remuneration on pages 58 to 71 and the discussion on
Corporategovernance on pages 52 to 57.
Substantial shareholdings
At 19 May 2004, the company had received
notiﬁcations from Legal & General Investment
Management Limited, Barclays PLC and Brandes
Investment Partners LLC, under Part VI of the
Companies Act 1985, in respect of holdings
of 289,727,496 shares, 347,436,030 shares and
347,201,310 shares respectively, representing
holdings of 3.37%, 4.04% and 4.04% of the
company’s issued ordinary share capital.
Interest of management in certain transactions
During and at the end of the 2004 ﬁnancial year, none
of the company’s directors was materially interested in
any material transaction in relation to the group’s
business and none is materially interested in any
presently proposed material transactions.
Policy on the payment of suppliers
BT’s policy is to use its purchasing power fairly and
to pay promptly and as agreed.
BT has a variety of payment terms with its suppliers.
The terms for payments for purchases under major
contracts are settled when agreeing the other terms
negotiated with the individual suppliers. It is BT’s policy
to make payments for other purchases within 30 working
days of the invoice date, provided that the relevant
invoice is presented to the company in a timely fashion
and is complete. BT’s payment terms are printed on the
company’s standard purchase order forms or, where
appropriate, speciﬁed in individual contracts agreed with
the supplier. The ratio, expressed in days, between the
amounts invoiced to the company by its suppliers in the
2004 ﬁnancial year and the amounts owed to its trade
creditors at the end of the year was 35 calendar days.
Political donations
The company’s continuing policy is not to make
political donations in the everyday sense of those
words. This is explained in the Corporate governance
section on pages 52 to 57. However, during the 2004
ﬁnancial year British Telecommunications plc made the
following payments to cover the cost of hosting
brieﬁng meetings about the company’s activities with
MPs and MEPs: Labour Party £8,882; Conservative
Party £8,366; Liberal Democrat Party £5,942; Scottish
National Party £2,500.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
as auditors of the company and authorise the directors

AGM.
Authority to purchase shares
The authority given at last year’s AGM of the company
held on 16 July 2003 for the company to purchase in
the market 867 million of its shares, representing 10%
of the issued share capital, expires on 15 October
2004. Shareholders will be asked to give a similar
authority at the AGM.
During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, 81 million shares of
5 pence each were purchased under this authority (1%
of the share capital) for a total consideration of £144
million, at an average price of £1.77 per share. The
shares were purchased in an on-market programme of
buying back the company’s shares, initiated in
November 2003, as part of the company’s shareholder
distribution strategy. 36 million shares were cancelled
and 44 million shares have been retained as treasury
shares. At 14 May 2004, 0.2 million treasury shares
had been transferred to meet the company’s
obligations under its employee share plans.
AGM resolutions
The resolutions to be proposed at the AGM to be held
on 14 July 2004, together with explanatory notes,
appear in the separate Notice of Annual General Meeting
sent to all shareholders.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 51
Report of the directors BT’s policy is to achieve best practice in our standards
of business integrity in all our operations. This includes
a commitment to maintaining the highest standards of
corporate governance and ethics throughout the
group.
The company took part in the consultations
leading up to the publication in July 2003 of the UK’s
new Combined Code on Corporate Governance. BT is
obliged this year to report on how it has applied the
previous version of the Combined Code. The directors
consider that BT has, throughout the year, complied
with the provisions of that version of the Code. This
section also reports on BT’s position in respect of the
provisions introduced by the new Combined Code. The
company will report fully on its compliance with the
new Code next year.
The Board
Composition and role
The Board, which operates as a single team, is
currently made up of the part-time Chairman, the
Chief Executive, four other executive directors and
seven non-executive directors. All of the non-executive
directors meet the criteria for independence set out in
the new Combined Code and are therefore considered
by the Board to be independent. It is BT’s policy that
the Board will comprise a majority of independent non-
executive directors. The directors’ biographies are set
out on pages 49 and 50.
The Board’s principal focus is the overall strategic
direction, development and control of the group. In
support of this the Board approves the group’s values,
business practice policies, strategic plans, annual
budget, capital expenditure and investments budgets,
larger capital expenditure proposals and the group’s
overall system of internal controls, governance and
compliance authorities. It also has oversight and
control of the group’s operating and ﬁnancial
performance. These responsibilities are set out in a
formal statement of the Board’s role which is available
on the company’s website. The Board has agreed the
group’s corporate governance framework, as part of
which it has empowered the company’s key
management committee, the Operating Committee,to
make decisions on operational and other matters. The
roles and powers of these committees are set out later
in this report under Principal Board committees. Their
powers and the authorities delegated to individual
members of the Operating Committee are available to
everyone in the group on the group’s intranet site.
The Board meets every month, except in August.
Additionally, it meets on an ad hoc basis to consider
matters which are time critical. The Board met 11
times during the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive
are set out in written job descriptions. In addition to
chairing the Board, the Chairman is responsible for
consulting the non-executive directors, particularly the
Deputy Chairman, on corporate governance issues,
matters considered by the Nominating Committee,
which the Chairman chairs, and the individual
performances of the non-executive directors. With the
Chief Executive and the Secretary, he ensures the
Board is kept properly informed, is consulted on all
issues reserved to it and that its decisions are made in
a timely and considered way that enables the directors
to fulﬁl their ﬁduciary duties. The Chairman ensures
that the views of the shareholders are known to the
Board and considered appropriately. He represents the
company in speciﬁed strategic and Government
relationships, as agreed with the Chief Executive, and
generally acts as the bridge between the Board and the
Company’s executive team, particularly on the Group’s
broad strategic direction. The Chief Executive has ﬁnal
executive responsibility to the Board for the success of
the group.
The Secretary manages the provision of timely,
accurate and considered information to the Board for
its meetings and, in consultation with the Chairman
and Chief Executive, at other appropriate times. He
recommends to the Chairman and the Chief Executive,
for Board consideration where appropriate, the
company’s corporate governance policies and practices
and is responsible for their communication and
implementation.
BT’s non-executive directors
The desired combination of experience, skills and other
attributes that the non-executive directors as a whole
are to bring to the Board is agreed and reviewed by
the Nominating Committee. This proﬁle is used by the
Committee to assess the suitability as non-executive
directors of candidates put forward by the directors
and outside consultants before the Committee meets
short-listed candidates and goes on to recommend to
the Board a candidate for appointment.
The non-executive directors provide a strong,
independent element on the Board. Between them,
they bring experience and independent judgement,
gained at the most senior levels, of international
business operations and strategy, marketing,
technology, communications and political and
international affairs. The Chairman and the non-
executive directors hold regular dinners at which they
discuss matters without the executive directors being
present. At least annually, these provide an occasion
for the non-executive directors, led by the Deputy
Chairman, Sir Anthony Greener, to meet, without the
Chairman present to review the Chairman’s
performance.
Sir Anthony Greener, the Deputy Chairman, is the
senior independent director. He chairs the Audit and
Remuneration committees. In his capacity as the
chairman of the Remuneration Committee,he meets
with BT’s major institutional shareholders. The Deputy
Chairman also continues to be available to discuss
matters with institutional shareholders where it would
be inappropriate for those discussions to take place
with either the Chairman or the Chief Executive. He
will also attend, at his discretion and in consultation
with the Chairman and the Chief Executive, other
meetings with shareholders during the year. The other
non-executive directors may attend, at their request,
meetings with the company’s major shareholders and
others.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 52
Corporate governance Non-executive directors are appointed initially for three
years, subject to three months’ termination notice
from either BT or the director. At the end of the ﬁrst
three years the appointment may be continued by
mutual agreement. Each non-executive director is
provided, upon appointment, with a letter setting out
the terms of his or her appointment, including
membership of Board committees, the fees to be paid,
the time commitment expected from the director and
covering such matters as the conﬁdentiality of
information and the company’s share dealing code.
The appointment letter was reviewed by the
Nominating Committee following the publication of the
new Combined Code and new letters sent to all
non-executive directors which align the company’s
letter, as appropriate, to the sample letter annexed to
the new Code.
Election and re-election
All directors are required by the company’s articles of
association to be elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst
AGM after their appointment, if appointed by the
Board. A director must subsequently retire by rotation
at an AGM at intervals of not more than three years.
The director may seek re-election.
Service agreements
The Chairman and executive directors have service
agreements, which are approved by the Remuneration
Committee. Information about the periods of these
contracts is in the Report on directors’ remuneration.
Independent advice
The Board has a procedure for directors, in furtherance
of their duties, to take independent professional advice
if necessary, at the company’s expense. In addition, all
directors have access to the advice and services of the
Secretary, the appointment and removal of whom is a
matter for the whole Board. He advises the Board on
appropriate procedures for the management of its
meetings and duties (and the meetings of the
company’s principal committees), as well as the
implementation of corporate governance and
compliance within the group.
Training and information
On appointment, the directors take part in an
induction programme when they receive information
about BT, the role of the Board and the matters
reserved for its decision, the terms of reference and
membership of the principal Board and management
committees, and the powers delegated to those
committees, the company’s corporate governance
practices and procedures, including the powers
reserved to the group’s most senior executives, and
the latest ﬁnancial information about the group. This is
supplemented by visits to key BT locations and
meetings with members of the Operating Committee
and other key senior executives. Throughout their
period in ofﬁce the directors are continually updated
on BT’s business, the competitive and regulatory
environments in which it operates, technology and
corporate social responsibility matters and other
changes affecting BT and the communications industry
as a whole, by written brieﬁngs and meetings with
senior BT executives. Directors are also advised on
appointment of their legal and other duties and
obligations as a director of a listed company, both in
writing and in face-to-face meetings with the
Secretary. They are reminded of these duties each year
and they are also updated on changes to the legal and
governance requirements upon the company and
themselves as directors. During the 2004 ﬁnancial
year, for example, they have been advised on the
changes to UK corporate governance brought about by
the new Combined Code, continued to receive
brieﬁngs on the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which
affects BT because its securities are registered with the
US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and
various corporate proposals from the European
Commission. They also received an updated brieﬁng
on UK, US and international ﬁnancial reporting
developments.
Guidelines are in place concerning the content,
presentation and delivery of papers for each Board
meeting, so that the directors have enough
information to be properly briefed sufﬁciently far ahead
of each Board meeting and at other appropriate times.
Board evaluation
During summer 2003 the Board carried out, through a
questionnaire and discussion with directors, an
evaluation of its performance and the quality of board
processes. The results of that exercise were considered
by the Board in July 2003 and a number of actions
agreed. A further evaluation, including on the
performance of directors and the Board’s committees,
will be carried out during 2004.
Directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance and
indemnity
For some years the company has purchased insurance
to cover its directors and ofﬁcers against their costs in
defending themselves in civil legal proceedings taken
against them in that capacity and in respect of
damages resulting from the unsuccessful defence of
any proceedings. To the extent permitted by UK law,
the company also indemniﬁes its directors and ofﬁcers.
Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provide cover
where the director has acted fraudulently or
dishonestly.
Principal Board committees
To meet best corporate governance practice, Audit,
Remuneration and Nominating Committees have long
been an established part of BT’s system of governance.
Each committee has written terms of reference, which
are available on the company’s website. The minutes
of Audit and Nominating Committee meetings are
sent, at their request, to directors who are not a
member of a committee. In the case of the
Remuneration Committee, minutes are circulated, on
request, to other non-executive directors as well as to
members of the committee.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 53 Corporate governance Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Sir Anthony Greener,
the Deputy Chairman and senior independent director.
The other members are Maarten van den Bergh, Clay
Brendish, Lou Hughes, John Nelson and Carl Symon.
They are all independent non-executive directors. They
were members of the committee throughout the 2004
ﬁnancial year. The Board considers that the
Committee’s members have broad commercial
experience and extensive business leadership, having
held various roles in accountancy, ﬁnancial
management and supervision, treasury and corporate
ﬁnance and that there is a broad and suitable mix of
business, ﬁnancial and IT experience on the
Committee. The Board has reviewed membership of
the Committee and is satisﬁed, for the purposes of the
new Combined Code, that collectively the Committee
has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
The Committee recommends the appointment and
reappointment of the company’s external auditors and
considers their resignation or dismissal, recommending
to the Board appropriate action to appoint new
auditors. It ensures that key partners are rotated at
appropriate intervals. It discusses with the auditors the
scope of their audits before they commence, reviews
the results and considers the formal reports of the
auditors and reports the results of those reviews to the
Board. It reviews the auditors’ performance, including
the scope of the audit, and recommends to the Board
appropriate remuneration.
As a result of regulatory or similar requirements, it
may be necessary to employ the company’s external
auditors for certain non-audit work. In order to
safeguard the independence and objectivity of the
external auditors, the Board has determined policies as
to what non-audit services can be provided by the
company’s external auditors and the approval
processes related to them. Under those policies work
of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the
external auditors unless there are clear efﬁciencies and
value added beneﬁts to the company. The overall
policies and the processes to implement them were
reviewed and appropriately modiﬁed in the light of the
provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
relating to non-audit services that external auditors
may not perform. The Audit Committee monitors the
extent of non-audit work being performed by the
company’s auditors and approves such work before it
is undertaken. It also monitors the level of non-audit
fees paid to the external auditors.
The Audit Committee reviews the company’s
published ﬁnancial results, the Annual Report and
Form 20-F and other published information for
statutory and regulatory compliance. It also reviews
the disclosure made by the Chief Executive and Group
Finance Director during the certiﬁcation process for
the annual report about the design or operation of
internal controls or material weaknesses in the
controls, including any fraud involving management or
other employees who have a signiﬁcant role in the
company’s ﬁnancial controls. The Board, as required
by UK law, takes responsibility for all disclosures in the
annual report.
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the
standards of risk management and internal control, the
effectiveness of internal control, ﬁnancial reporting,
accounting policies and procedures, and the
company’s statements on internal controls before they
are agreed by the Board for each year’s annual report.
It also reviews the company’s internal audit function
and its relationship with the external auditors,
including internal audit’s plans and performance. It
reviews the arrangements for dealing, in conﬁdence,
with complaints from employees about accounting or
ﬁnancial management impropriety, fraud, poor
business practices and other matters. At each of its
meetings, the Committee sets aside time to seek the
views of the company’s internal and external auditors
in the absence of executives.
The Group Finance Director, the Secretary, the
group’s chief internal auditor and the company’s
external auditors attend the Committee’s meetings.
The Committee met four times during the 2004
ﬁnancial year. At its meetings the Committee has
reviewed the company’s full year and quarterly results
and its Annual Report and Form 20-F and considered
the adequacy of the ﬁnancial systems that have
produced those results. It has reported its views to the
Board so it has been able to approve the results
announcements and the annual report for publication.
It has also during the 2004 ﬁnancial year considered
the group’s risk register, as submitted to it by the
Management Council, and reviewed the company’s
internal control, accounting systems, IT security and
related matters. It also approved the arrangements for
employees to make conﬁdential complaints about
accounting and other issues and adopted, for the
purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a code of ethics
for the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and
Director Group Financial Control and Treasury, which
is consistent with BT’s overall statement of business
ethics.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises solely
independent non-executive directors and is chaired by
Sir Anthony Greener. It met four times during the
2004 ﬁnancial year. Further details about the
Committee are included in the Report on directors’
remuneration.
Nominating Committee
The Nominating Committee consists of the Chairman,
the Deputy Chairman, John Nelson and Maarten van
den Bergh. Its members have not changed during the
2004 ﬁnancial year. It ensures an appropriate balance
of experience and abilities on the Board, using this
evaluation to review the size and composition of the
Board and to recommend any proposed changes to the
Board. It keeps under review the need for
appointments to the Board, prepares a description of
the speciﬁc experience and skills needed for an
appointment, considers candidates who are put
forward by the directors and external consultants, and
recommends to the Board the appointments of all
directors after having met short-listed candidates. It
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 54 Corporate governance also reviews the time required from the Deputy
Chairman and other non-executive directors to carry
out their duties and advises the Board on succession
planning for the positions of the Chairman, Deputy
Chairman, Chief Executive and all other Board
appointments. The Committee met once during the
2004 ﬁnancial year at which time it reviewed the
current structure proﬁle and balance of the Board,
reviewed and recommended to the Board the
continued appointments as non-executive directors of
Sir Anthony Greener and Maarten van den Bergh
(neither of whom took part in the review of his own
position) and agreed changes to the non-executive
directors’ letter of appointment to align it to
recommended best practice.

Operating Committee and Management Council
The Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen, chairs the
Operating Committee, which meets weekly. The other
members are the Group Finance Director, the Chief
Executives of BT Retail, BT Wholesale and BT Global
Services and the Chief Broadband Ofﬁcer. The
Secretary attends all meetings. The Committee has
collective responsibility for running the group’s
business end-to-end. To do that, it develops the
group’s strategy and budget for Board approval,
recommends to the Board the group’s capital
expenditure and investments budgets, monitors the
ﬁnancial, operational and customer quality of service
performance of the whole group, allocates resources
across the group within plans agreed by the Board,
plans and delivers major cross-business programmes
and reviews the senior talent base and succession plans
of the group. Within the group’s corporate governance
framework, approved by the Board, the Operating
Committee is empowered to approve up to limits after
which Board approval is required, capital expenditure,
disposals of ﬁxed assets, the making of investments by
the group and divestments. It is authorised to delegate
these approvals, up to its own limits, to senior
executives.
A sub-committee of the Operating Committee, the
Management Council, meets monthly. It consists of the
Operating Committee members plus a number of other
senior executives. It is an advisory forum supporting
the Chief Executive and the Operating Committee in
policy formulation, in areas such as cultural change,
public policy, reputation and business practices
policies, human resources, pensions matters and
employment policies.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the group’s systems of
internal control and risk management and for
reviewing the effectiveness of those systems. Such
systems are designed to manage, rather than
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives; any system can provide only reasonable and
not absolute assurance against material misstatement
or loss.
The Board also takes account of signiﬁcant social,
environmental and ethical matters that relate to BT’s
businesses and reviews annually BT’s corporate social
responsibility. The company’s workplace practices,
speciﬁc environmental, social and ethical risks and
opportunities and details of underlying governance
processes are dealt with in the Our people and Our
commitment to society sections of this report.
BT has processes for identifying, evaluating and
managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the group.
These processes have been in place for the whole of
the 2004 ﬁnancial year and have continued up to the
date on which this document was approved. The
processes are in accordance with the guidance for
directors published in the UK in September 1999.
Risk assessment and evaluation takes place as an
integral part of the group’s annual strategic planning
cycle. The group has a detailed risk management
process, culminating in a Board review, which
identiﬁes the key risks facing the group and each
business unit. This information is reviewed by senior
management as part of the strategic review. The
group’s current key risks are summarised in Risk
factors of this document.
The key features of the risk management process
comprise the following procedures:
& senior executives, led by the Secretary, review the
group’s key risks and have created a group risk
register, describing the risks, owners and
mitigation strategies. This is reviewed by the
Management Council before being reviewed and
approved by the Board.
& the lines of business carry out risk assessments of
their operations, have created registers relating to
those risks, and ensure that the key risks are
addressed.
& senior management report regularly to the Group
Finance Director on the operation of internal
controls in their area of responsibility.
& the Chief Executive receives annual reports from
senior executives with responsibilities for major
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 55 Corporate governance group operations with their opinion on the
effectiveness of the operation of internal controls
during the ﬁnancial year.
& the group’s internal auditors carry out continuing
assessments of the quality of risk management
and control. Internal Audit reports to the
management and the Audit Committee on the
status of speciﬁc areas identiﬁed for improvement.
They also promote effective risk management in
the lines of business operations.
& the Audit Committee,on behalf of the Board,
considers the effectiveness of the operation of
internal control procedures in the group during the
ﬁnancial year. This follows consideration of the
matter by the Management Council. The Audit
Committee reviews reports from the internal
auditors and from the external auditors and
reports its conclusions to the Board. The Audit
Committee has carried out these actions for the
2004 ﬁnancial year.
Material joint ventures and associates, which BT
does not control, outside the UK have not been dealt
with as part of the group for the purposes of this
internal control assessment.
The Board has approved the formal statement of
matters which are reserved to it for consideration,
approval or oversight. It has also approved the group’s
corporate governance framework, which sets out the
high level principles by which the group is managed
and the responsibilities and powers of the Operating
Committee, Management Council and the group’s senior
executives. As part of this framework the development
and implementation of certain powers relating to
group-wide policies and practices are reserved to
identiﬁed senior executives.
Relations with shareholders
Senior executives, led by the Chief Executive and the
Group Finance Director and including, as appropriate,
the other executive directors, hold meetings with the
company’s principal institutional shareholders to
discuss the company’s strategy, ﬁnancial performance
and speciﬁc major investment activities. The Deputy
Chairman also attends, at his discretion and in
consultation with the Chairman and the Chief
Executive, meetings with shareholders during the year.
As explained in the Report on directors’
remuneration,we also maintain contact, when
appropriate, through the chairman of the Remuneration
Committee and other senior executives to discuss
overall remuneration policies and plans. Contact with
institutional shareholders (and with ﬁnancial analysts,
brokers and the media) is controlled by written
guidelines to ensure the protection of share price
sensitive information that has not already been made
generally available to the company’s shareholders. The
directors are provided with reports and other written
brieﬁngs from the company’s major shareholders and
analysts, either in full or through summaries from the
company’s brokers and are regularly informed by the
Secretary about the holdings of its principal
shareholders. The Secretary also surveys the
company’s retail shareholders about the quality of the
company’s shareholder communications and share
registration services.
We are continuing our policy that shareholders
vote on the annual report at the AGM. Shareholders
will also again be asked to vote on the Report on
directors’ remuneration.
It is part of our policy to involve shareholders fully
in the affairs of the company and to give them the
opportunity at the AGM to ask questions about the
company’s activities and prospects. We also give the
shareholders the opportunity to vote on every
substantially different issue by proposing a separate
resolution for each issue. The Board’s opinion is that
the re-election and the fees of the auditors are inter-
related matters and should therefore be dealt with in
one resolution.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as
well as abstentions, will be counted before the AGM
and the results will be made available at the meeting
after the shareholders have voted on each resolution
on a show of hands and at the end of the meeting.
It is our policy for all directors to attend the AGM if at
all possible. Whilst, because of ill health or other
pressing reasons, this may not always be possible, in
normal circumstances this means that the chairman of
the Audit, Nominating and Remuneration committees is
at the AGM and is available to answer relevant
questions.
The Annual Review and, if requested, the Annual
Report and Form 20-F, together with the Notice of the
AGM, are sent to shareholders in the most cost-
effective fashion, given the large number of
shareholders. We aim to give as much notice as
possible and at least 21 clear days, as required by the
company’s articles of association. In practice, these
documents are being sent to shareholders more than
20 working days before the AGM.
Established procedures ensure the timely release of
share price sensitive information and the publication of
the company’s ﬁnancial results and regulatory ﬁnancial
statements.
Statement of business practice
To reinforce our commitment to achieve best practice
in our standards of business integrity and ethics, BT
has a written statement of business practice (The Way
We Work). The statement covers all our operations and
reﬂects the expectations in the area of corporate
governance and business practice standards. A copy of
the statement has been sent to every employee and is
also available on the company’s intranet site.
These high-level principles are supported by a
continuing and comprehensive communications
programme and online training. A conﬁdential helpline
and e-mail facility are also available to employees who
have questions about the application of these
principles. We also continue to require our agents and
contractors to apply these principles when representing
BT.
Political donations
It has always been BT’s policy that no company in the
group shall make cash contributions to any political
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 56 Corporate governance party. This policy continues and appropriate
arrangements are in place to implement it throughout
the group. However, the Companies Act 1985 requires
companies to obtain shareholder authority before they
can make donations to EU political organisations
(which includes UK political parties). The deﬁnition of
political donations used in the Act is very much
broader than the sense in which these words are
ordinarily used. As a result, it covers activities which
form part of normal relationships between BT,
individual politicians and the principal political parties.
These activities are not designed to provide support to
or to inﬂuence public support for any political party.
They would not be thought of as political donations in
the everyday sense of these words. They are entirely
non-political in nature and are designed so that BT can
make MPs and others aware of key industry issues and
matters affecting the company.
The authority we are requesting from shareholders
at the AGM is not designed to change the company’s
stated policy of not making cash contributions. It will,
however, ensure that BT acts within the provisions of
the current UK law when carrying out the above
activities. They are carried out on an even-handed
basis related broadly to the major UK political parties’
electoral strength and the company believes that they
make an important contribution to the success of BT.
The level of political donations split as between the
major UK political parties is shown in the Report of
the directors.
Pension funds
BT’s two main pension funds – the BT Pension Scheme
and the BT Retirement Plan – are not controlled by the
Board but by separate trustees who are company and
union nominees, under independent chairmen. The
trustees look after the assets of the funds, which are
held separately from those of the company. The
pension funds’ assets can only be used in accordance
with their respective rules and for no other purpose.
Financial
A statement by the directors of their responsibilities for
preparing the ﬁnancial statements is included in the
Statement of directors’ responsibility. The directors
report on page 72 that the company is a going
concern.
US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
BT has securities registered with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, BT is obliged
to comply with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act (the Act) applicable to foreign issuers. BT will
comply with the legal and regulatory requirements
introduced pursuant to this legislation, in so far as they
are applicable to the group.
Given the narrow and prescriptive deﬁnition under
the relevant SEC rules, it is the opinion of the Board
that the Audit Committee does not include a member
who is an ‘audit committee ﬁnancial expert’. However,
the Board considers that the Committee’s members
have broad commercial experience and extensive
business leadership, having held various roles in
accountancy, ﬁnancial management and supervision,
treasury and corporate ﬁnance and that there is a
broad and suitable mix of business, ﬁnancial and IT
experience on the Committee. The Board and its
committees will keep under active review the ﬁnancial
expert matter during the 2005 ﬁnancial year as part of
their nomination and succession planning activities.
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director,
after evaluating the effectiveness of BT’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this Annual Report and Form 20-F, have
concluded that, as of such date, BT’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
material information relating to BT was made known to
them by others within the group. The Chief Executive
and Group Finance Director have also provided the
certiﬁcations required by the Act.
There were no changes in BT’s internal control
over ﬁnancial reporting that occurred during the year
ended 31 March 2004 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, BT’s internal
control over ﬁnancial reporting.
The code of ethics for the Chief Executive, Group
Finance Director and Director Group Financial Control
and Treasury, adopted for the purposes of the Act, is
posted on the company’s website at

Ourcodesofethics/CodeofethicsCEO.htm
The New York Stock Exchange
In November 2003, the SEC approved the new
corporate governance listing standards of the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company, as a
foreign issuer with American Depositary Shares listed
on the NYSE, is obliged to disclose any signiﬁcant ways
in which its corporate governance practices differ from
these standards.
The company has reviewed the NYSE’s new listing
standards and believes that its corporate governance
practices are consistent with them, with one exception
where the company does not meet the strict
requirements set out in the standards. The standards
state that companies must have a nominating/
corporate governance committee composed entirely of
independent directors and with written terms of
reference which, in addition to identifying individuals
qualiﬁed to become board members, develops and
recommends to the Board a set of corporate
governance principles applicable to the company. BT
has a Nominating Committee. Information about it is set
out on pages 54 and 55. It does not develop corporate
governance principles for the Board’s approval. The
Board approves the group’s overall system of
governance internal controls, governance and
compliance authorities. The Board and the Nominating
Committee are made up of a majority of independent,
non-executive directors.

Operating Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up wholly of
independent non-executive directors. Throughout the
year, the company has applied the principles in
Section 1 of the 1998 version of the Combined Code
on Corporate Governance (the Code) and complied
with the Code. The Committee also adopted the main
principles set out in the Higgs Report, reviewing the
role and effectiveness of non-executive directors, and
this report explains how the company has complied
with the principles and provisions of the new Combined
Code on Corporate Governance which will begin to
apply for the company in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Shareholders will be invited to approve this report at
the company’s 2004 AGM.
The Board is ultimately responsible for both the
structure and amount of executive remuneration, but it
has delegated prime responsibility for executive
remuneration to the Committee. The terms of
reference of the Committee are available on the
company’s website at www.bt.com. The Committee’s
role is to set the remuneration policy and individual
remuneration packages for the Chairman and the
senior management team, comprising the executive
directors, members of the Operating Committee (OC)
and other senior executives reporting to the Chief
Executive. This includes approving changes to the
company’s long-term incentive plans, recommending
to the Board those plans which require shareholder
approval and overseeing their operation. In this role
the Committee also monitors the structure of reward
for executives reporting to the senior management
team and determines the basis on which awards are
granted under the company’s executive share plans.
The Committee met four times during the 2004
ﬁnancial year. Sir Anthony Greener has chaired the
Committee since 18 July 2001. Other members of the
Committee who served during the ﬁnancial year were:
& Maarten van den Bergh
& Louis Hughes
& Margaret Jay
& Carl Symon
The Chairman and Chief Executive are invited to
attend meetings. They are not present when matters
affecting their own remuneration arrangements are
considered. No director is involved in any decision
relating to his or her remuneration.
Non-executive directors who are not members of
the Committee are entitled to receive papers and
minutes of the Committee.
The Committee has access to professional
advisers, both from within the company and externally.
Towers Perrin (HR consultants); Ben Verwaayen, Chief
Executive; Ian Livingston, Group Finance Director; Alex
Wilson, Group HR Director and Larry Stone, Company
Secretary, provided advice that materially assisted the
Committee in relation to the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The
Committee has agreed that Towers Perrin may advise
both the Committee and BT, and should be invited to
attend meetings when major remuneration policy
issues are being discussed. Towers Perrin provides BT
with a range of data and advisory services covering all
aspects of executive pay, bonus arrangements, shares
and beneﬁts.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 58
Report on directors’ remuneration Remuneration policy
This part of the Report on directors’ remuneration
is not subject to audit.
BT’s executive remuneration policy is to reward
employees competitively, taking into account
individual performance, company performance, market
comparisons and the competitive pressures in the
information and communications technology industry.
Base salaries are positioned around the mid-market,
with total direct compensation (basic salary, annual
bonus and the value of any long-term incentives) to be
at the upper quartile only for sustained and excellent
performance. There are no plans to change this policy.
A signiﬁcant proportion of the total executive
remuneration package is linked to line of business and
corporate performance. Remuneration arrangements
and performance targets are kept under regular review
to achieve this. The Committee has decided to review
during the 2005 ﬁnancial year the company’s current
arrangements for executive remuneration, including
the structure of the remuneration packages, their
constituent parts and their mix.
Where any signiﬁcant changes are proposed to
executive remuneration, these will be discussed with
BT’s principal shareholders and the main
representative groups of the institutional shareholders.
(i) Packages
The remuneration package is made up of some or all of
the following:
Basic salary
Salaries are reviewed annually. Salary increases are
made only where the Committee believes that
adjustments are appropriate to reﬂect contribution,
increased responsibilities and/or market pressures.
Performance-related remuneration
Annual bonus and deferred bonus
The annual bonus plan is designed to reward the
achievement of results against set objectives.
For the 2004 ﬁnancial year, on-target and
maximum (requiring truly exceptional performance)
bonus levels for executive directors and OC members,
as a percentage of salary, were 50% and 100%
(increased from 75% at the beginning of the 2003
ﬁnancial year to reward the achievement of
increasingly stretching targets). The on-target and
maximum bonus levels for the Chief Executive were
85% and 130%, respectively, under his service
agreement. Under his contract, the Chairman is not
entitled to a bonus.
Targets set at the beginning of the 2004 ﬁnancial
year for each objective, to which speciﬁc weights were
attached, were based on earnings per share and free
cash ﬂow, each representing 40% of the potential
bonus, and customer satisfaction representing 20% of
the potential bonus. For the three line of business
CEO’s, 75% of the potential bonus was linked to BT’s
corporate performance and 25% to the performance of
their respective line of business. For all other relevant
executives, bonuses are based solely on corporate
performance.
The Committee retains the ﬂexibility to enhance or
reduce bonus awards in exceptional circumstances.
Awards in the form of BT shares, granted under
the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP), are directly linked to
the value of annual bonuses and hence to
performance. The shares are held in trust and
transferred to the executive if still employed by the
company in three years’ time. There are no additional
performance measures for the vesting of DBP awards.
The DBP rewards performance and acts as a retention
measure.
Awards for the senior management team are
equivalent in value to 50% of gross annual bonus.
The awards under the DBP held by Ben
Verwaayen, Pierre Danon, Andy Green, Ian Livingston
and Paul Reynolds at the end of the 2004 ﬁnancial
year are contained in the table on page 69. The
amounts are in note e on page 65.
Long-term incentives
The BT Equity Incentive Portfolio (the Portfolio) is
designed to ensure that equity participation is a
signiﬁcant part of overall remuneration. It comprises
three elements: share options, incentive shares and
retention shares. Share options were the main element
of equity participation in the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
Retention shares are used as a recruitment and
retention tool.
Under his service agreement, the Chairman is not
entitled to participate in the annual operation of the
Portfolio.
Generally, awards vest and options become
exercisable only if a predetermined performance target
has been achieved. Normally, the performance
measure for outstanding awards and options is TSR
(total shareholder return) compared with the FTSE 100
companies. TSR links the reward given to directors
with the performance of BT against the shares of other
major UK companies.
For 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2003 awards, the base
price at the beginning of the performance period has
been calculated by averaging the BT share price over
the six months to 31 March in the year of award. For
the 2002 awards, the period was from 19 November
2001 (the date of the mmO
2
demerger) to 31 March
2002. The end price is the average of the share price
over the six months to the end of the performance
period. The end price is adjusted for all capital actions
and dividend payments that occur during the
performance periods.
Share options
The price at which shares may be acquired under the
Global Share Option Plan (GSOP) is the market price at
the date of grant. Other than for new recruits, the size
of option grant is based on corporate and individual
performance, and market relativity.
Options granted will be exercisable in three years,
subject to the performance target being met. The
Committee would not normally expect the initial value
of annual grants of options, based on the market price
of a BT share, to exceed three times salary.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 59 Report on directors’ remuneration For options granted subject to a TSR measure, BT’s
TSR at the end of the three-year period must be in the
upper quartile for all of the options to be exercisable.
At median, 30% of the options will be exercisable.
Below that point, none of the options may be
exercised. If the performance measure is not met at
the ﬁrst measurement, it may be re-tested against a
ﬁxed base in years four and ﬁve for options granted in
2002. If TSR has not reached the median at the end of
the ﬁfth year, previously unexercisable options will
lapse. This was reduced to one re-testing in year ﬁve
for options granted in 2003.
The one-off grant of options in 2002 to the seven
senior executives most responsible for delivering BT’s
strategic plan is subject to an earnings per share test.
The Committee believes that earnings per share was
the most appropriate measure for this grant as BT
embarked on a radical business transformation that will
require exceptional performance in exceeding business
goals. For these options to become exercisable, there
must be a 35% compound annual growth in BT’s
earnings per share over three years (equivalent to
22 pence per share at the end of the 2005 ﬁnancial
year). There will be no opportunity to re-test. Earnings
per share is calculated as basic earnings per share
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
The option granted to Sir Christopher Bland on
22 June 2001 as part of his recruitment package is not
subject to a performance measure as it matched a
personal investment in BT shares of £1 million.
The details of the options held by Sir Christopher
Bland, Ben Verwaayen, Pierre Danon, Andy Green, Ian
Livingston and Paul Reynolds at the end of the 2004
ﬁnancial year are contained in the table on page 67.
Incentive shares
There were no awards under the Incentive Share Plan
(ISP) in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. A number of awards
made in previous years were, however, still
outstanding at the beginning of the 2004 ﬁnancial
year, and are contained in the table on page 68.
Participants are entitled to shares at the end of a
three-year performance period if the company has met
the relevant predetermined performance target and
participants are still employed by the group. At the
end of the three-year period, BT’s TSR must be in the
upper quartile for all the shares to vest. At median,
25% of the shares under award vest. Below that point,
none of the shares vest.
None of the awards of incentive shares granted in
2001 vested as BT’s TSR was at 83rd position on
31 March 2004, the end of the performance period.
Retention shares
Retention shares are granted under the Retention
Share Plan (RSP) to individuals with critical skills, as a
recruitment or retention tool. As a result, shares
currently under award are not linked to a corporate
performance target. The length of the retention period
before awards vest is ﬂexible. The shares are
transferred at the end of the speciﬁed period if the
individual is still employed by BT.
Retention shares are used only in exceptional
circumstances and, in the 2004 ﬁnancial year, ﬁve
awards were made for recruitment purposes and a
further two were made for retention purposes, one of
which was to Sir Christopher Bland under his new
contract securing his services for the company until
2007.
The awards under the RSP held by Sir Christopher
Bland, Ben Verwaayen and Ian Livingston at the end of
the 2004 ﬁnancial year are contained in the table on
page 68.
Executive Share Plan (ESP)
The last awards under the ESP were granted in 1999.
Participants are generally only entitled to the shares at
the end of a ﬁve-year performance period if the
company has met the relevant predetermined
performance target and participants are still employed
by the group. At the end of the ﬁve-year period, if BT’s
TSR reaches 30th position, all the shares vest. If BT is
at 70th position starting from the top of the list, none
of the shares vest. Between those points, the shares
vest on a straight line pro rata basis.
None of the awards of shares granted under the
ESP in 1999 vested as BT’s TSR was at 90th position
on 31 March 2004, the end of the performance period.
Other share plans
The executive directors and the Chairman may
participate in BT’s Inland Revenue approved all-
employee share plans, the Employee Sharesave
Scheme and Employee Share Investment Plan (which
replaced the Employee Share Ownership Scheme), on
the same basis as other employees. There are further
details of these plans in note 34 to the accounts.
(ii) Annual package – 2005 ﬁnancial year
The Remuneration Committee has decided that there
should be no increase in base pay for executive
directors in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, which reﬂects the
restraint being exercised across the company. Salaries
have now been held ﬂat for three years. There is no
change either to on-target and maximum bonus levels
(see page 59). The annual bonus plan will continue to
focus on annual objectives and to reward the
achievement of results against those objectives.
Performance will again be against earnings per share,
free cash ﬂow and customer satisfaction measures.
Performance targets for the 2005 ﬁnancial year are
more challenging than the outturn of the 2004
ﬁnancial year, as BT continues its transformation.
For the achievement of target, performance-
related remuneration is approximately 63% of total
remuneration (excluding pension) for the Chief
Executive and 55% for the other executive directors.
Total remuneration comprises base salary, annual
bonus and awards under the DBP, and the expected
value of share options and awards under BT’s
long-term incentive plans.
The Committee has decided that a combination of
performance-linked share options and incentive shares
will be granted in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. For the last
two years, only share options have been granted. The
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 60 Report on directors’ remuneration combination of share options and share awards
creates, in the Committee’s view, a better balance of
remuneration in the light of BT’s business strategy,
including the development of new wave business and
the achievement of operating efﬁciencies. In the 2005
ﬁnancial year, the maximum grant of options will
reduce from three times base salary to 1.5 times base
salary, and the maximum share award will be
equivalent to two-thirds of salary. The overall value of
long-term incentive awards will not change as a result
of these proposals, which were determined by the
Committee with advice from Towers Perrin.
The performance measure will be relative TSR for
both elements but the FTSE 100 is being replaced by
the FTSE E300 Telecommunication Services index as
the comparator group. Performance against an
appropriate industry sector is considered a more
appropriate test of executive capability in driving
absolute performance.
At 1 April 2004, the index contained the following
companies, excluding BT:
Cable & Wireless
Cosmote Mobile
Telecommunications
Deutsche Telekom
France Telecom
Hellenic
Telecommunications
mmO
2
Portugal Telecom
KPN
Swisscom
TDC
Tele2
Telecom Italia
Telecom Italia Mobile
Telefonica
Telekom Austria
Telenor
TeliaSonera
Vodafone Group
For awards made last year subject to TSR, there
was provision for re-testing in year ﬁve against a ﬁxed
base. The Committee has decided that there will be no
re-testing in respect of the share awards or options to
be granted in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
(iii) Other matters
Executive share ownership
A shareholding programme encourages executive
directors and OC members to build up a shareholding
in the company by retaining shares received as a result
of participating in a BT employee share plan (other
than the shares sold to pay a National Insurance or
income tax liability). The programme, which is not
mandatory, is designed to encourage executive
directors and members of the OC to build up a
shareholding with a value of 100% of their annual
salary. Given that a large part of an executive’s
remuneration is already variable, the proposal
speciﬁcally excludes the need to make a personal
investment should awards not vest.
Pensions
Those executive directors and most other senior
executives who joined the company prior to 1 April
2001, have their pension beneﬁts based on service and
salary (known as deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements). Those
with longer BT service are entitled to pensions at
normal retirement age of two-thirds of ﬁnal salary,
including any cash lump sum entitlement. Those with
shorter BT service are entitled to a pension of one-
thirtieth of salary for each year of service. In both
cases, a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the
executive’s pension is provided in the event of death
after retirement. Should the executive die in service, a
lump sum equal to four times annual salary is payable
together with a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the
executive’s anticipated pension at normal retirement
age. BT closed its deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements to
new employees with effect from 1 April 2001. From
this date retirement provision is made on a deﬁned
contribution basis. The company agrees to pay a ﬁxed
percentage of the executive’s salary each year towards
the provision of retirement beneﬁts, typically this is
20-30% of salary. Additionally, a lump sum equal to
four times annual salary is payable on death in service.
Pension provision for all executives is based on salary
alone – bonuses, other elements of pay and long-term
incentives are excluded.
Other beneﬁts
Other beneﬁts for the Chairman and the senior
management team include some or all of the following:
company car, fuel and driver, personal
telecommunications facilities and home security,
medical and dental cover for the director and
immediate family, professional subscriptions and
personal tax and ﬁnancial counselling. The company
has a permanent health insurance policy to provide
cover for the Chairman and executive directors and
members of the OC who may become permanently
incapacitated.
Service agreements
It is the policy for the Chairman and executive directors
to have service agreements providing for one year’s
notice. It may be necessary on recruitment to offer
longer initial periods to new directors from outside BT,
or circumstances may make it appropriate to offer a
longer ﬁxed term. All the service agreements contain
provisions dealing with the removal of a director
through poor performance, including in the event of
early termination of the contract by BT.
Termination payments
Sir Christopher Bland’s contract expires at the
conclusion of the AGM in 2007. On termination of his
contract by BT before that date, he is entitled to
payment of salary and the value of beneﬁts for the
period of 12 months from date of termination, or until
the conclusion of the company’s AGM in 2007, if that
period is shorter. Ben Verwaayen’s contract entitles
him on termination of his contract by BT to payment of
£700,000. The contracts of Pierre Danon, Andy Green,
Ian Livingston and Paul Reynolds entitle them on
termination of their contract by BT to payment of
salary and the value of beneﬁts until the earlier of
12 months from notice of termination or the director
obtaining full-time employment.
If the contract of a director (but not the Chairman)
is terminated by BT within one year of BT entering into
a scheme of arrangement or becoming a subsidiary of
another company, he will be entitled to receive the
higher of that current year’s on-target bonus or the
previous year’s bonus, the market value of shares
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 61 Report on directors’ remuneration awarded under an employee share ownership plan or
deferred bonus plan that have not vested, together
with a year’s salary and the value of any beneﬁts.
The Committee has reviewed contracts taking into
account the joint statement of best practice on
executive contracts and severance, published in
December 2002 by the Association of British Insurers
and the National Association of Pension Funds, and
other relevant guidelines, and believes contract terms
are generally in line with best practice. The clause
dealing with termination following BT entering into a
scheme of arrangement or becoming a subsidiary of
another company will be reviewed for future
appointments and in any contract renegotiations.
Outside appointments
The Committee believes that there are signiﬁcant
beneﬁts, to both the company and the individual, from
executive directors accepting non-executive
directorships of companies outside BT. The Committee
will consider up to two external appointments (of which
only one may be to the Board of a major company), for
which a director may retain the fees. Pierre Danon
receives fees of £35,000 per year as a non-executive
director of Emap plc and Ian Livingston fees of
£35,000 per year as a non-executive director of Hilton
Group plc. Pierre Danon has resigned from the Board
of Hays plc where he received fees of £45,000 per
year.
Non-executive directors’ letters of appointment
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment.
They are appointed for an initial period of three years.
During that period, either party can give the other at
least three months’ notice. At the end of the period
the appointment may be continued by mutual
agreement. Further details of appointment
arrangements for non-executive directors are set out
on page 53 in the section dealing with corporate
governance issues.
The letters of appointment of non-executive
directors are terminable on notice by the company
without compensation.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
Seven of the directors on the Board are non-executive
directors who, in accordance with BT’s articles of
association, cannot individually vote on their own
remuneration. Non-executive remuneration is reviewed
by the Chairman and the Chief Executive and discussed
and agreed by the Board. Non-executive directors may
attend the Board discussion but may not participate
in it.
The fees paid to non-executive directors were
increased with effect from 1 January 2004 to reﬂect
their increasing responsibilities and time
commitments. Non-executive directors’ fees were last
changed ﬁve years ago, on 1 January 1999.
The basic fee for non-executive directors is
£40,000 per year. An additional fee for membership of
Board committees is £5,000 per year, other than for
the Pensions Performance Review Group for which no
fee is paid. Sir Anthony Greener, Deputy Chairman and
senior non-executive director, who also chairs both the
Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee,
receives total fees of £115,000 per year.
To align further the interests of the non-executive
directors with those of shareholders, the company’s
policy is to encourage these directors to purchase, on a
voluntary basis, £5,000 of BT shares each year. The
directors are asked to hold these shares until they
retire from the Board. This policy is not mandatory.
No element of non-executive remuneration is
performance-related. Non-executive directors do not
participate in BT’s bonus or employee share plans and
are not members of any of the company pension
schemes.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 63 Report on directors’ remuneration Performance graph
This graph illustrates, as required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the performance of
BT Group plc measured by TSR (adjusted for the rights issue and the demerger of BT’s mobile business in the
2002 ﬁnancial year) relative to a broad equity market index over the past ﬁve years. The FTSE 100 is considered
to be the most appropriate index against which to measure performance for these purposes, as BT has been a
constituent of the FTSE 100 throughout the ﬁve-year period and the index is widely used. TSR is the measure of
the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reﬂecting share price movements and assuming
reinvestment of dividends.

each had interest-free loans from the company to
assist with relocation of £375,000 and £300,000,
respectively. At 31 March 2004, Pierre Danon owed

ﬁnancial year, the maximum amount outstanding was
£571,250. There are no outstanding loans granted by
any member of the BT group to any other of the
directors or guarantees provided by any member of the
BT group for their beneﬁt.
Pensions
Sir Christopher Bland is not a member of any of the
company pension schemes, but the company matches
his contributions, up to 10% of the earnings cap, to a
personal pension plan. Company contributions of
£9,900 were payable in respect of the 2004 ﬁnancial
year. The earnings cap is a restriction on the amount
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 65 Report on directors’ remuneration of pay which can be used to calculate contributions
and beneﬁts due to a tax approved pension scheme.
Ben Verwaayen is not a member of any of the
company pension schemes, but the company has
agreed to pay an annual amount equal to 20% of his
salary towards pension provision. The company paid
£29,700 into his personal pension plan plus a cash
payment of £110,300 representing the balance of the
pension allowance for the 2004 ﬁnancial year. BT also
provides him with a lump sum death in service beneﬁt
of four times his salary.
Ian Livingston is not a member of any of the
company pension schemes, but the company has
agreed to pay an annual amount equal to 30% of his
salary towards pension provision. The company paid
£19,800 into his personal pension plan plus a cash
payment of £115,200 representing the balance of the
pension allowance for the 2004 ﬁnancial year. BT also
provides him with a lump sum death in service beneﬁt
of four times his salary.
Pierre Danon’s pension accrues at the rate of
one-thirtieth of his ﬁnal salary for each year of service.
In addition, a two-thirds widow’s pension would be
payable on his death. He is a member of the BT
Pension Scheme, but as he is subject to the earnings
cap the company has agreed to increase his beneﬁts to
the target level by means of a non-approved, unfunded
arrangement.
Andy Green is a member of the BT Pension
Scheme. From 31 December 1997 the company has
been purchasing an additional 203 days of pensionable
service each year to bring his pensionable service at
age 60 up to 40 years. A two-thirds widow’s pension
would be payable on his death.
Paul Reynolds is a member of the BT Pension
Scheme. From 1 July 1996 the company has been
purchasing an additional 109 days of pensionable
service each year to bring his pensionable service at
age 60 up to 40 years. A two-thirds widow’s pension
would be payable on his death.

All of the above options were granted for nil consideration. No options were exercised during the year.
a
Options granted under the GSOP on 22 June 2001. The option is not subject to a performance measure. It was a term of Sir Christopher Bland’s initial
service contract that (i) he purchased BT shares to the value of at least £1 million; and (ii) as soon as practicable after the purchase of the shares
(‘invested shares’), the company would grant a share option over shares to the value of at least £1 million. Sir Christopher Bland was the legal and
beneﬁcial owner of the invested shares on 1 May 2004, so the option became exercisable on that date.
b
Options granted under the GSOP on 11 February 2002. The exercise of options is subject to a performance measure being met. The performance
measure is relative TSR compared with the FTSE 100. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all of the options to become exercisable. At median,
40% of the options will be exercisable. Below that point, none of the options may be exercised.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 71 Report on directors’ remuneration The directors are required by law to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and
the group as at the end of the ﬁnancial year and
of the proﬁt or loss and cash ﬂows of the group for
that period.
The directors consider that, in preparing
the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 March
2004, on pages 74 to 134 the company has used
appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied
and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements
and estimates. The directors also consider that all
applicable accounting standards have been followed
and conﬁrm that the ﬁnancial statements have been
prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for ensuring
that the company keeps accounting records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the ﬁnancial position of the company and which enable
them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are also responsible for taking such
steps that are reasonably open to them to safeguard
the assets of the group and to prevent and detect
fraud and other irregularities.
The auditors’ responsibilities are stated in their
report to the shareholders.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 72
Statement of directors’ responsibility
for preparing the financial statements United Kingdom Opinion
Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of
BT Group plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements which comprise the
group proﬁt and loss account, group and company balance
sheets, group cash ﬂow statement, group statement of total
recognised gains and losses and the related notes which have
been prepared under the historical cost convention and the
accounting policies set out in the Accounting Policies section.
We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the
directors’ remuneration report (‘‘the audited part’’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report
and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the
statement of directors’ responsibilities. The directors are also
responsible for preparing the directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements
and the audited part of the directors’ remuneration report in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion,
has been prepared for and only for the company’s members
as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies
Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial
statements and the audited part of the directors’
remuneration report have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent
with the ﬁnancial statements, if the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual
Report and Form 20-F and consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. The
other information comprises only those sections set out in the
table of contents including Financial headlines, Chairman’s
message, Chief Executive’s statement, Operating and
ﬁnancial review, Report of the directors, Corporate
governance and Risk factors.
We review whether the corporate governance statement
reﬂects the company’s compliance with the seven provisions
of the Combined Code issued in June 1998 speciﬁed for our
review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required
to consider whether the board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the company’s or group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to
the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and
the audited part of the directors’ remuneration report. It also
includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to
give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and
the audited part of the directors’ remuneration report are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion: the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company and the group at
31 March 2004 and of the proﬁt and cash ﬂows of the group
for the year then ended; the ﬁnancial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985; and those parts of the directors’ remuneration report
required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act
1985 have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

United States Opinion
To the board of directors and shareholders of
BT Group plc
In our opinion, the accompanying group proﬁt and loss
account, group balance sheet, group cash ﬂow statement,
group statement of total recognised gains and losses and the
related notes present fairly, in all material respects, the
ﬁnancial position of BT Group plc and its subsidiaries at 31
March 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations
and their cash ﬂows for each of the three years in the period
ended 31 March 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom. These
ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the group’s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these ﬁnancial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
ﬁnancial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
Kingdom vary in certain important respects from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Information relating to the nature and effect of such
differences is presented in the United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles section.

Consolidated financial statements i Basis of preparation of the ﬁnancial statements
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared under
the historical cost convention and in accordance with
applicable accounting standards and the provisions
of the Companies Act 1985. The group ﬁnancial
statements consolidate those of the company and
all of its subsidiary undertakings. Where the ﬁnancial
statements of subsidiary undertakings, associates
and joint ventures do not conform with the group’s
accounting policies, appropriate adjustments are made
on consolidation in order to present the group ﬁnancial
statements on a consistent basis. The principal
subsidiary undertakings’ ﬁnancial years are all
coterminous with those of the company.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and
the reported amounts of income and expenditure
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Estimates are used principally
when accounting for interconnect income, provision
for doubtful debts, payments to telecommunication
operators, long-term contracts, depreciation, goodwill
amortisation and impairment, employee pension
schemes, provisions for liabilities and charges and
taxes.
ii Turnover
Group turnover net of discounts, which excludes value
added tax and other sales taxes, comprises the value
of services provided and equipment sales by group
undertakings, excluding those between them.
Total turnover is group turnover together with
the group’s share of its associates’ and joint ventures’
turnover, excluding the group’s share of transactions
between the group and its principal joint venture,
Concert BV in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
Turnover from calls is recognised in the group
proﬁt and loss account at the time the call is made
over the group’s networks. Turnover from rentals is
recognised evenly over the period to which the charges
relate. Turnover from equipment sales is recognised
at the point of sale. Prepaid call card sales are deferred
until the customer uses the stored value in the card
to pay for the relevant calls. Turnover arising from
the provision of other services, including maintenance
contracts, is recognised evenly over the periods in
which the service is provided to the customer.
Turnover from installation and connection activities is
recognised in the period in which its is earned.
Turnover from long term contracts is recognised
throughout the duration of the contract, to the extent
that the outcome of the contract can be assessed with
reasonable certainty and in accordance with the stage
of completion of contractual obligations. Turnover
from classiﬁed directories, mainly comprising
advertising revenue, is recognised in the group proﬁt
and loss account upon completion of delivery.
iii Research and development
Expenditure on research and development is written
off as incurred.
iv Leases
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are capitalised and
depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future obligations under ﬁnance leases are
recognised as liabilities. The interest element of rental
obligations are charged over the period of the ﬁnance
lease and represent a constant proportion of the
balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged against
the proﬁt and loss account on a straight-line basis over
the lease period except where the contractual payment
terms are considered to be a more systematic and
appropriate basis.
v Interest
Interest payable, including that related to ﬁnancing
the construction of tangible ﬁxed assets, is written off
as incurred. Discounts or premiums and expenses on
the issue of debt securities are amortised over
the term of the related security and included within
interest payable. Premiums payable on early
redemptions of debt securities, in lieu of future interest
costs, are written off when paid.
vi Foreign currencies
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign
undertakings are translated into sterling at year end
exchange rates. The results of foreign undertakings are
translated into sterling at average rates of exchange
for the year.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation
at year end exchange rates of the net investment in
foreign undertakings, less exchange differences on
borrowings which ﬁnance or provide a hedge against
those undertakings, are taken to reserves and are
reported in the statement of total recognised gains
and losses.
All other exchange gains or losses are dealt with
through the proﬁt and loss account.
vii Intangibles
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill, arising from the purchase of subsidiary
undertakings and interests in associates and joint
ventures, represents the excess of the fair value
of the purchase consideration over the fair value
of the net assets acquired.
For acquisitions completed on or after 1 April
1998, the goodwill arising is capitalised as an
intangible asset or, if arising in respect of an associate
or joint venture, recorded as part of the related
investment. Goodwill is amortised on a straight line
basis from the time of acquisition over its useful
economic life. The economic life is normally presumed
to be a maximum of 20 years.
For acquisitions on or before 31 March 1998,
the goodwill is written off on acquisition against
group reserves.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 75
Accounting policies If an undertaking is subsequently divested,
the appropriate unamortised goodwill or goodwill
written off to reserves is dealt with through the proﬁt
and loss account in the period of disposal as part
of the gain or loss on divestment.
(b) Other intangibles
Licence fees paid to governments, which permit
telecommunication activities to be operated for
deﬁned periods, are amortised from the latter
of the start of the licence period or launch of service to
the end of the licence period on a straight-line basis.
viii Tangible ﬁxed assets
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at historical cost
less depreciation.
(a) Cost
Cost in the case of network services includes
contractors’ charges and payments on account,
materials, direct labour and directly
attributable overheads.
(b) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on tangible ﬁxed assets on
a straight line basis from the time they are available for
use, so as to write off their costs over their estimated
useful lives taking into account any expected residual
values. No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
The lives assigned to other signiﬁcant tangible ﬁxed
assets are:
Freehold buildings – 40 years
Leasehold land and buildings – Unexpired portion
of lease or
40 years,
whichever is
the shorter
Transmission equipment:
duct – 25 years
cable – 3 to 25 years
radio and repeater equipment – 2 to 25 years
Exchange equipment – 2 to 13 years
Computers and ofﬁce equipment – 2 to 6 years
Payphones, other network equipment,
motor vehicles and cableships – 2 to 20 years
Software – 2 to 5 years
ix Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings, associates
and joint ventures are stated in the balance sheet
of the company at cost less amounts written off.
Amounts denominated in foreign currency are
translated into sterling at year end exchange rates.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are
stated in the group balance sheet at the group’s share
of their net assets, together with any attributable
unamortised goodwill on acquisitions arising on or
after 1 April 1998.
The group’s share of proﬁts less losses
of associates and joint ventures is included in
the group proﬁt and loss account.
Investments in other participating interests and other
investments are stated at cost less amounts written
off.
x Asset impairment
Intangible and tangible ﬁxed assets are tested for
impairment when an event that might affect asset
values has occurred. Goodwill is also reviewed for
impairment at the end of the ﬁrst ﬁnancial year
after acquisition.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent
that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either
by selling the asset or by the discounted future cash
ﬂows from operating the assets.
xi Stocks
Stocks mainly comprise items of equipment, held for
sale or rental, consumable items and work in progress
on long-term contracts.
Equipment held and consumable items are stated
at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value,
after provisions for obsolescence.
Work in progress on long-term contracts is stated
at cost, after deducting payments on account,
less provisions for any foreseeable losses.
xii Debtors
Debtors are stated in the balance sheet at estimated
net realisable value. Net realisable value is the invoiced
amount less provisions for bad and doubtful debtors.
Provisions are made speciﬁcally against debtors where
there is evidence of a dispute or an inability to pay.
An additional provision is made based on an analysis
of balances by age, previous losses experienced
and general economic conditions.
xiii Redundancy costs
Redundancy or leaver costs arising from periodic
reviews of staff levels are charged against proﬁt in
the year in which the group is demonstrably committed
to the employees leaving the group.
If the estimated cost of providing incremental
pension beneﬁts in respect of employees leaving
the group exceeds any total accounting surplus based
on the latest actuarial valuation of the group’s pension
scheme and the amount of the provision for pension
liabilities on the balance sheet, then the excess
estimated cost is charged against proﬁt in the year in
which the employees agree to leave the group, within
redundancy or leaver costs.
xiv Pension schemes
The group operates a funded deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme, which is independent of the group’s ﬁnances,
for the substantial majority of its employees. Actuarial
valuations of the main scheme are carried out by an
independent actuary as determined by the trustees
at intervals of not more than three years, to determine
the rates of contribution payable. The pension cost is
determined on the advice of the company’s actuary,
having regard to the results of these valuations. In any
intervening years, the actuaries review the continuing
appropriateness of the contribution rates.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 76 Accounting policies The cost of providing pensions is charged against
proﬁts over employees’ working lives with the group
using the projected unit method. Variations from this
regular cost are allocated on a straight-line basis over
the average remaining service lives of current
employees to the extent that these variations do not
relate to the estimated cost of providing incremental
pension beneﬁts in the circumstances described
in xiii above.
Interest is accounted for on the provision or
prepayment in the balance sheet which results from
differences between amounts recognised as pension
costs and amounts funded. The regular pension cost,
variations from the regular pension cost, described
above, and interest are all charged within staff costs.
The group also operates deﬁned contribution pension
schemes and the proﬁt and loss account is charged
with the contributions payable.
xv Taxation
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all
timing differences which have arisen but have not
reversed at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets
are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more
likely than not that there will be taxable proﬁts from
which the underlying timing differences can be
deducted. No deferred tax is provided in respect of any
future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries
or associates where no commitment has been made
to remit such earnings. The deferred tax balances
are not discounted.
xvi Financial instruments
(a) Debt instruments
Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net
proceeds adjusted to amortise any discount evenly
over the term of the debt, and further adjusted
for the effect of currency swaps acting as hedges.
(b) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments
to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks and
interest rate movements. The group does not hold
or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments for ﬁnancial
trading purposes.
Criteria to qualify for hedge accounting
The group considers its derivative ﬁnancial instruments
to be hedges when certain criteria are met. For foreign
currency derivatives, the instrument must be related to
actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or
a probable commitment and whose characteristics
have been identiﬁed. It must involve the same currency
or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also
reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange
movements on the group’s operations. For interest
rate derivatives, the instrument must be related to
assets or liabilities or a probable commitment, such as
a future bond issue, and must also change the interest
rate or the nature of the interest rate by converting
a ﬁxed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Accounting for derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Principal amounts underlying currency swaps are
revalued at exchange rates ruling at the date
of the group balance sheet and, to the extent
that they are not related to debt instruments, are
included in debtors or creditors.
Interest differentials, under interest rate swap
agreements used to vary the amounts and periods
for which interest rates on borrowings are ﬁxed,
are recognised by adjustment of interest payable.
The forward exchange contracts used to change
the currency mix of net debt are revalued to balance
sheet rates with net unrealised gains and losses being
shown as part of debtors, creditors, or as part of net
debt. The difference between spot and forward rate
for these contracts is recognised as part of net interest
payable over the term of the contract.
The forward exchange contracts hedging
transaction exposures are revalued at the prevailing
forward rate on the balance sheet date with net
unrealised gains and losses being shown as debtors
and creditors.
Instruments that form hedges against future
ﬁxed-rate bond issues are marked to market. Gains or
losses are deferred until the bond is issued when they
are recognised evenly over the term of the bond.

Group balance sheet
as at 31 March 2004 1. Changes in accounting policy and presentation and discontinued activities
(a) Changes in accounting policy and presentation
There have been no changes to accounting policies in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. A small number of changes in the
presentation of the notes to the ﬁnancial statements have been made and comparative ﬁgures have been
restated accordingly as explained in the notes where material.
(b) Discontinued activities
On 1 June 2001, BT disposed of its interests in Japan Telecom and J-Phone Communications and, on 29 June
2001, its interest in Airtel. On 22 June 2001, BT sold Yell, its classiﬁed advertising directory businesses in the
UK and the USA. These activities, together with mmO
2
which was demerged on 19 November 2001, are shown
as discontinued operations in the proﬁt and loss accounts. The eliminations are intra-group eliminations. The
interest charge allocated to mmO
2
up to the date of the demerger has been calculated assuming that mmO
2
’s
net debt at the date of the demerger of £500 million, had been in existence for the whole of the period, and had
been bearing an interest charge of 8% per annum.
The interest charge allocated to Yell up to the date of disposal represents amounts payable on intercompany
loans charged at an arm’s length rate of interest. The taxation charge allocated to discontinued activities, up to
the date of demerger or disposal, represents amounts charged to these entities before recognising credit for
group relief surrendered to entities within continuing activities.
2. Segmental analysis
The group provides telecommunication services, principally in the UK, and essentially operates as a unitary
business. Its main services and products are ﬁxed voice and data calls, the provision of ﬁxed exchange lines
to homes and businesses, the provision of communication services to other operators, the provision of private
services to businesses and the supply of telecommunication equipment for customers’ premises.
The turnover of each line of business is derived as follows:
& BT Retail derives its turnover from the supply of exchange lines and from the calls made over these lines, the
provision of ICT products and services, the leasing of private circuits and other private services, the sale and
rental of customer premises equipment to the group’s UK customers and other lines of business and from its
narrowband and broadband internet access products.
& BT Wholesale derives its turnover from providing network services to other BT lines of business, and from
interconnecting the group’s UK network to other operators.
& BT Global Services mainly generates its turnover from the provision of ICT products and services,
outsourcing and systems integration work and from the ﬁxed network operations of the group’s European
subsidiaries. The business also derives revenues from providing web hosting facilities to end customers and
through BT lines of business.
Segmented information on the lines of business is given below for the years ended 31 March 2004, 31 March
2003 and 31 March 2002 as required by the UK accounting standard SSAP 25 and the US accounting standard
SFAS No. 131 (SFAS 131).
There is extensive trading between the lines of business and proﬁtability is dependent on the transfer price
levels. These intra-group trading arrangements and operating assets are subject to periodic review and have
changed in some instances. In addition, the group moved management responsibility of BT Openworld to
BT Retail. Comparative ﬁgures have been restated for these and other changes and in certain instances have
been determined using apportionments and allocations.

The directors believe that the nature of the group’s business is such that the analysis of operating costs

adapted the prescribed format so that operating costs are disclosed in a manner appropriate to the group’s
principal activity.

employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.
In calculating the diluted earnings (loss) per share, share options outstanding and other potential ordinary
shares have been taken into account.
The weighted average number of shares in the years were: 2004

The interest rate payable on these notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody’s or Standard and Poor’s (S&P) reduces the
rating ascribed to the group’s senior unsecured debt below A3 in the case of Moody’s or below A minus in the case of S&P. In this event, the interest rate
payable on the notes and the spread applicable to the ﬂoating notes will be increased by 0.25% for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings
agency. In addition, if Moody’s or S&P subsequently increase the rating ascribed to the group’s senior unsecured debt, then the interest rate then
payable on notes and the spread applicable to the ﬂoating notes will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency, but
in no event will the interest rate be reduced below the minimum interest rate reﬂected in the table above.

2
business from the rest of the former British

plc and BT Group Investments Limited (BTGI) became the immediate
parent company of BT on 16 November 2001. On 19 November 2001, mmO
2
plc transferred the shares in BTGI
to BT Group, as consideration for the issue to former BT shareholders of one ordinary share of 115 pence in
the company, credited as fully paid, for each ordinary share in BT held on 16 November 2001.
On 21 November 2001, following the approval of the Court, the nominal value of BT Group shares was
reduced from 115 pence per ordinary share to 5 pence per ordinary share by way of a reduction of capital under
section 135 of the Companies Act 1985. The surplus of £9,537 million arising from this capital reduction has
been credited to the group proﬁt and loss reserve.
The transfer of BTGI to the company has been accounted for as a group reconstruction in accordance with
the principles of merger accounting set out in Financial Reporting Standard 6 (FRS 6) and Schedule 4A to
the Companies Act 1985. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are therefore presented as if the company had
been the parent company of the group throughout the year ended 31 March 2001 and up to the date of the
demerger. The results of mmO
2
have been included in discontinued activities in all three years.
The transfer of BT to BTGI on 16 November 2001 was a group reorganisation effected for non-equity
consideration. This transaction has been accounted for in these ﬁnancial statements using the principles of
merger accounting as if BT had been owned and controlled by BTGI throughout the year ended 31 March 2001
and up to 16 November 2001. This is not in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 since the group
reorganisation does not meet all the conditions for merger accounting. If acquisition accounting had been
applied to account for the reorganisation whereby BTGI became the parent company of BT, this would have
resulted in all the separable assets and liabilities of the BT Group as at 16 November 2001 being recorded at
their fair values, substantial goodwill and goodwill amortisation charges arising and only the post demerger
results being reﬂected within the BT Group consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The directors consider that to have
applied acquisition accounting in preparing these ﬁnancial statements would have failed to give a true and fair
view of the group’s state of affairs and results. This is because, in substance, BT Group is the successor to BT
and its shareholders have had a continuing interest in the BT business both before and after the demerger. The
directors consider that it is not practicable to quantify the effects of this departure from the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985.
In the company’s ﬁnancial statements, its investment in BTGI is stated at the nominal value of shares issued.
In accordance with sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985, no premium was recorded on the ordinary
shares issued (see note 37). On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued and
the aggregate share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserve of BT at the date of the demerger
(the merger difference), has been debited to the other reserves.
29. Related party transactions
In the year ended 31 March 2004, the group’s turnover with its associates and joint ventures amounted to
£1 million (2003 – £3 million, 2002 – £15 million) and the group purchased £60 million (2003 – £69 million,
2002 – £99 million) in services and products from these undertakings. Interest for the year of £nil (2003 – £nil,
2002 – £1 million) was receivable on debt due from these undertakings. The amount of debt outstanding with
these undertakings, at 31 March 2004, was £28 million (2003 – £20 million). The maximum debt outstanding
during the year was £43 million (2003 – £92 million). As at the latest practicable date, 14 May 2004, the
amount of debt outstanding was £28 million.
There were a number of transactions during the year between the company and its subsidiary undertakings,
which are eliminated on consolidation and therefore not disclosed.

future lease obligations. The guarantee lasts until O
2
UK Ltd has discharged all its obligations, which is expected
to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The group has guaranteed part of the bank borrowings of its joint venture Albacom SpA under the terms of
the joint venture’s reﬁnancing in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. This expires on the earlier of the loan being repaid or
31 October 2011. The guarantee is triggered if Albacom fails to meet the repayment schedule under the terms
of the loan and is effectively capped at e34.5 million.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse
effect on the ﬁnancial position or results of operations of the group.
Proceedings have been initiated in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee,
in connection with the Italian UMTS auction. Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that
auction process. The evidential hearings are continuing, in Rome. If the proceedings are successful, BT could be
held liable, with others, for any damages. The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a
provision in respect of any such potential claim.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 107 Notes to the financial statements 31. Pension costs
Background
The group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice No. 24 ‘‘Pension Costs’’ (SSAP 24). In addition, disclosures have been presented in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard No. 17 ‘‘Retirement Beneﬁts’’ (FRS 17).
The group offers retirement plans to its employees. The group’s main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme
(BTPS), is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme where the beneﬁts are based on employees’ length of service and ﬁnal
pensionable pay. The BTPS is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund. This scheme has
been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a deﬁned contribution scheme. Under this
deﬁned contribution scheme the proﬁt and loss charge represents the contribution payable by the group based
upon a ﬁxed percentage of employees’ pay.
The total pension costs of the group (including discontinued activities) expensed within staff costs in the year
was £404 million (2003 – £322 million, 2002 – £382 million), of which £376 million (2003 – £306 million,
2002 – £373 million) related to the group’s main deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the BTPS. The increase in
the pension cost reﬂects the amortisation charge for the pension deﬁcit partly offset by a reduction in the
number of active members of the BTPS and the interest credit relating to the balance sheet prepayment. This
total pension cost includes the cost of providing enhanced pension beneﬁts to leavers, which amounted to
£1 million (2003 – £60 million, 2002 – £46 million). In the year ended 31 March 2002 this proﬁt and loss charge
of £46 million was not the full cash cost of £186 million because there was a pension fund accounting surplus,
including the provision on the balance sheet of £140 million, that was fully utilised before making a charge to the
proﬁt and loss account.
The pension cost applicable to the group’s main deﬁned contribution schemes in the year ended 31 March
2004 was £7 million, (2003 – £4 million, 2002 – £5 million), and £0.7 million (2003 – £0.4 million, 2002 – £0.3
million) of contributions to the schemes were outstanding at 31 March 2004.
The group occupies four properties owned by the scheme on which an annual rental of £3 million is payable.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, ﬁxed interest and index
linked securities, deposits and short-term investments. At 31 March 2004, the UK equities included 33 million
(2003 – 37 million, 2002 – 55 million) ordinary shares of the company with a market value of £58 million
(2003 – £58 million, 2002 – £154 million).
BT Pension Scheme
Funding valuation
A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualiﬁed independent
actuary, using the projected unit method. The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that
present and future contributions should be sufﬁcient to meet future liabilities. The triennial valuation as at
31 December 2002 forms the basis of determining the group’s pension fund contributions for the year ending
31 March 2004 and future periods until the next valuation is completed. The funding valuation is performed
at 31 December because this is the ﬁnancial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows:
& scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date; and
& scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of
return reﬂecting the assets of the scheme.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions:

*There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the ﬁrst three years.
The mortality assumption reﬂects improvements in life expectancy since the 1999 valuation and incorporates
further future improvements.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 108 Notes to the financial statements 31. Pension costs continued
The assumed rate of investment return, salary increases and mortality all have a signiﬁcant effect on the funding
valuation. A 0.25 percentage point change in these assumptions would have the following effects on the funding
deﬁcit:

0.25 percentage point change in:
Investment return (0.9) 0.9
Wage and salary increases 0.2 (0.2)
An additional year of life expectancy would result in a £0.7 billion increase in the deﬁcit.
At 31 December 2002, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of £22.8 billion (1999 – £29.7 billion) and
were sufﬁcient to cover 91.6% (1999 – 96.8%) of the beneﬁts accrued by that date, after allowing for expected
future increases in wages and salaries but not taking into account the costs of providing incremental pension
beneﬁts for employees leaving under release schemes since that date. This represents a funding deﬁcit of
£2.1 billion compared to £1.0 billion at 31 December 1999. The funding valuation uses conservative
assumptions whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuary’s view of the median estimate basis, the
funding deﬁcit would have been reduced to £0.4 billion. Although the market value of equity investments had
fallen, the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the beneﬁts paid by
£0.3 billion in the year ended 31 December 2002. As a result of the triennial funding valuation the group agreed
to make employer’s contributions at a rate of 12.2% of pensionable pay from April 2003 and annual deﬁciency
payments of £232 million. This compared to the employer’s contribution rate of 11.6% and annual deﬁciency
payments of £200 million that were determined under the 1999 funding valuation. In the year ended 31 March
2004, the group made regular contributions of £284 million (2003 – £278 million, 2002 – £303 million) and
additional special contributions for enhanced pension beneﬁts to leavers in the year ended 31 December 2002 of
£130 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year (2003 – £129 million, 2002 – £400 million) and deﬁciency contributions
of £612 million (2003 – £200 million, 2002 – £200 million) which includes the early payment of £380 million
scheduled for payment in subsequent years.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS the group is required to have a funding plan
that should address the deﬁcit over a maximum period of 20 years whilst the agreed funding plan addresses
the deﬁcit over a period of 15 years. The group will continue to make deﬁciency payments until the deﬁcit is
made good.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age proﬁle of active members will
consequently increase. Under the projected unit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active
members’ pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment proﬁle extends over more than
60 years.
SSAP 24 accounting valuation
The SSAP 24 valuation is broadly on the following basis:
& scheme assets are valued at market value; and
& scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate
of return reﬂecting the assets of the scheme.
The pension costs for the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years were based on the SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March
2000. At 31 March 2000 there was a SSAP 24 deﬁcit of £0.2 billion and the regular cost for the 2003 and 2002
ﬁnancial years was 11.6% of pensionable salaries. The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2000 was based on the
same assumptions as the December 1999 funding valuation, with the exception that, over the long term, it has
been assumed that the return on the existing assets of the scheme, relative to market values, would be a nominal
5.6% per annum which equates to a real return of 2.5% per annum.
The pension cost for the 2004 ﬁnancial year was based upon the SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003.
At 31 March 2003 there was a SSAP 24 deﬁcit of £1.4 billion, before taking account of the balance sheet
prepayment and the regular cost is 11.3% of pensionable salaries. The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003 is
based on the 31 December 2002 funding valuation rolled forward, and uses the same assumptions as set out
above, with the following exceptions:
& return on existing assets is assumed to be a nominal 7.1% per annum, which equates to a real return
of 4.7%;
& average increase in retail price index is assumed to be 2.25% per annum; and
& the average future increases in wages and salaries is assumed to include a short term reduction in the real
salary growth assumption to 0.75% for the ﬁrst three years, before returning to 1.5%.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 109 Notes to the financial statements 31. Pension costs continued
The cumulative difference since the adoption of SSAP 24 between the cash contributions paid by the group
to the pension scheme and the proﬁt and loss charge is reﬂected on the balance sheet. The cumulative cash
contributions exceed the proﬁt and loss charge and the resulting difference is shown as a prepayment on the
balance sheet. At 31 March 2004 the prepayment was £1,172 million (2003 – £630 million) with the increase
being principally due to the additional special and deﬁciency contributions in the year.
The pension charge to the proﬁt and loss account will also include the amortisation of the combined pension
fund position and pension prepayment over the average remaining service lives of scheme members, which
amounts to 13 years, and the cost of enhanced pension beneﬁts provided to leavers.
FRS 17 – Retirement beneﬁts
The group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24. Full implementation of FRS 17 has
been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board and would apply to the group for the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
However, in the 2006 ﬁnancial year the group will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The
requirements for disclosure under FRS 17 remain in force between its issue and adoption of IFRS, and the
required information is set out below. FRS 17 speciﬁes how key assumptions should be derived and applied.
These assumptions are often different to the assumptions adopted by the pension scheme actuary and trustees
in determining the funding position of pension schemes. The accounting requirements under FRS 17 are broadly
as follows:
& scheme assets are valued at market value at the balance sheet date;
& scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return
on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability; and
& movement in the scheme surplus/deﬁcit is split between operating charges and ﬁnancing items in the proﬁt
and loss account and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
The ﬁnancial assumptions used to calculate the BTPS liabilities under FRS 17 at 31 March 2004 are:

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 110 Notes to the financial statements 31. Pension costs continued
The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the deﬁcit but does affect
the level of the expected return on assets within the net ﬁnance cost charged to the proﬁt and loss account
under FRS 17.
The net pension deﬁcit set out below under FRS 17 is as if this standard was fully applied. The fair value
of the BTPS assets, the present value of the BTPS liabilities based on the ﬁnancial assumptions set out above,
and the resulting deﬁcit, together with those of unfunded pension liabilities at 31 March 2004 and 31 March
2003 are shown below. The fair value of the BTPS assets is not intended to be realised in the short term and may
be subject to signiﬁcant change before it is realised. The present value of the liabilities is derived from long-term
cash ﬂow projections and is thus inherently uncertain.

The company has a share ownership scheme used for employee share allocations (proﬁt sharing), an employee
share investment plan, savings-related share option schemes for its employees and those of participating
subsidiaries, further share option schemes for selected group employees and an employee stock purchase plan
for employees in the United States. It also has several share plans for executives.
Share option schemes
The major share option scheme, the BT Group Employee Sharesave Scheme, is savings related and the share
options are normally exercisable on completion of a three or ﬁve year Save As You Earn contract. A similar
savings related scheme exists for group employees based outside the UK.
Following the scheme of arrangement and demerger in November 2001, all options under the savings related
schemes became exercisable for a period of six months. On expiry of this period, these options lapsed to the
extent to which they had not been exercised. Shortly before the scheme of arrangement, 57 million shares were
allotted to a special purpose trust to satisfy options which were likely to be exercised during that six
month period.
Participants in the BT Share Option Scheme, the BT US Stock Option Plan, the BT Worldwide Share Option
Scheme, and the BT Global Share Option Plan (the Executive Option Plans) were given the opportunity to
(i) conditionally on the scheme of arrangement being sanctioned by the Court, release their options over British
Telecommunications plc shares in consideration for the grant of options in their employer’s new holding company
(BT Group plc or mmO
2
plc); or (ii) if their options were already exercisable, exercise their options over ordinary
shares irrespective of whether the scheme of arrangement was sanctioned by the Court; or (iii) if their options
were not already exercisable, conditionally on the scheme of arrangement being sanctioned by the Court,
exercise their options immediately following that time but prior to the reduction of BT Group’s share capital.
To the extent that they had not already been exercised, these options lapsed on 16 November 2001,
the effective date of the scheme of arrangement.
The BT Group Legacy Option Plan was operated on 17 December 2001 following the scheme of
arrangement and demerger in November 2001. Replacement unapproved options over BT Group shares were
granted to all participants in the Executive Option Plans who had released their options over British
Telecommunications plc shares. The value of the replacement options was determined by averaging the
combined prices of BT Group plc and mmO
2
plc shares over the 20 dealing days following the demerger
on 19 November 2001. This resulted in a factor of 1.3198 being applied to the former option over British
Telecommunications plc shares in order to give the number of BT Group shares under the new option. The
option prices of the original options were also adjusted to take account of the different number of shares under
option.
On the demerger of mmO
2
, BT’s share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar
BT Group Employee Sharesave schemes and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, options over 55 million shares were granted under the BT Group Share Option
Plan. The options will be exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance
targets, on the third anniversary of the date of grant. A second award of options over 64 million shares was also
granted. This second award will vest in three equal tranches, on each of the ﬁrst three anniversaries of the date
of grant, subject to continued employment.

The option prices of shares under the BT Group Legacy Option Plan were adjusted at the time of the demerger as detailed on page 113.
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year ended 31 March 2004 has been
estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model. The following weighted average
assumptions were used in that model: an expected life extending one month later than the ﬁrst exercise date;
estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5% (2003 – 5%, 2002 – 5%); risk free interest rates
of approximately 4% (2003 – 5%, 2002 – 6%); and expected volatility of approximately 25% (2003 – 40%,
2002 – 34%).
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 March 2004 was 42p
(2003 – 55p, 2002 – 55p) for options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 51p
(2003 – 72p, 2002 – 55p) for options exercisable ﬁve years after the date of grant. The weighted average fair
value of options granted under the BT Group Global Share Option Plan has been estimated as 41p. The weighted
average fair value of options granted under the Special Incentive Award has been estimated as 42p. The total
value of share options granted by BT in the year ended 31 March 2004 was £22 million (2003 – £41 million,
2002 – £88 million).
In accordance with UK accounting practices, no compensation expense is recognised for the fair value
of options granted where the exercise price equals the market price at date of grant or options granted under
approved Sharesave schemes. See United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles – IV Accounting for
share options for the treatment under US GAAP.

The BT Employee Sharesave schemes.
Incentive Share Plan and Retention Share Plan
The BT Incentive Share Plan (ISP) and the BT Retention Share Plan (RSP) were introduced for employees of
the group in 2000. Under the plans, company shares are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and are
conditionally awarded to participants. Under the ISP participants are normally only entitled to these shares in full
at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance
measure and if the participants are still employed by the group. If the company has exceeded the pre-determined
corporate performance measure the participants may be awarded up to double the shares conditionally awarded.
The corporate performance measure is BT’s total shareholder return (TSR) measure against those top 100
companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, as rated by the Financial Times (the FTSE 100 index), at the
beginning of the relevant performance period. Awards made under the ISP in 2000 and 2001 did not vest as the
company did not meet the corporate performance measure. Under the RSP the length of retention period before
awards vest is ﬂexible. Awards may vest in annual tranches. The shares are transferred at the end of a speciﬁed
period, only if the individual is still employed by the group. During the 2004 ﬁnancial year 720,472 (2003 –
374,039) shares vested in 7 (2003 – 11) participants in the RSP.
Executive Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan
The BT Executive Share Plan (ESP) was introduced for employees of the group in 1994. Under the ESP, company
shares are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and are conditionally awarded to participants.
Participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a ﬁve-year period under the ESP if, at the end
of the period, the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure. Awards of
shares were granted in each of the years from 1994 to 1999 under the ESP.
The corporate performance measure is BT’s total shareholder return (TSR) measure against those top 100
companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, as rated by the FTSE 100 index, at the beginning of the
relevant performance period.
The sixth ﬁve-year performance cycle of the ESP ended on 31 March 2004 and on the basis of the corporate
performance measure, the company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target relative to other companies in the
FTSE 100, no shares vested. The ﬁfth ﬁve-year performance cycle of the ESP ended on 31 March 2003 and on
the basis of the corporate performance measure, no shares vested. The fourth ﬁve-year performance cycle of the
ESP ended on 31 July 2002 and on the basis of the corporate performance measure, 32.5% of the shares vested
on 1 August 2002 in 65 participants and 1.0 million shares were transferred to those participants.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 115 Notes to the financial statements 34. Employee share schemes continued
The BT Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) was established in 1998 and awards are granted annually to employees of the
group. Under this plan, shares in the company are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and
transferred to participants at the end of three years if he or she has continued to be employed by the group
throughout that period. On 1 August 2003, 653,899 shares (1 August 2002 – 657,592) were transferred to
225 participants (1 August 2002 – 223) at the end of the three-year deferred period.
At 31 March 2004, 30.5 million shares (2003 – 31.7 million shares) in the company were held in trust for
employee share schemes, of which no shares (2003 – 15.5 million shares) were held for the ISP, 3.0 million shares
(2003 – 2.9 million shares) were held for the RSP, no shares (2003 – 2.3 million shares) were held for the ESP and
6.5 million shares (2003 – 4.2 million shares) were held for the DBP. Dividends or dividend equivalents earned on the
shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential beneﬁt of the participants.

Of the total BT Group plc shares held, 21.0 million shares were held at 31 March 2004 in trust for future awards
under employee share schemes. These shares had a nominal value of £1 million and a market value of
£37.2 million at 31 March 2004.
The values of possible future transfers of shares under the plans were based on the BT Group plc share price
at 31 March 2004 of 177p (2003 – 157p). The provisions for the costs of the ISP, RSP and ESP were based on
best estimates of the company’s performance over the plans’ conditional periods, relating to those portions of
the plan conditional periods from commencement up to the ﬁnancial year end.
Employee Share Investment Plan
From December 2001 the BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan (ESIP) was in operation. The ESIP,
which has been approved by the Inland Revenue, gives UK employees an opportunity to purchase shares
(partnership shares) monthly out of pre-tax salary up to a maximum value of £1,500 per year. During the 2004
ﬁnancial year, 6.0 million shares (2003 – 5.3 million shares) were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf
of 13,974 (2003 – 12,092) employees at a total cost of £11.1 million (2003 – £10.6 million). The free shares
element of the ESIP allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for at least three
years. A phantom plan, which delivers cash awards equivalent to the value of the free shares, operates for
employees outside the UK. In 2004, 1% of pre-tax proﬁts, amounting to £20 million, was set aside for the ESIP
and the phantom plan for employees outside the UK (2003 – £36 million). The allocation of this sum was subject
to two performance targets, one of increasing earnings per share by 15% and the other of reducing customer
dissatisfaction by 25%, with only the ﬁrst target being achieved. The ESIP replaced the BT Employee Share
Ownership Scheme which operated for employee proﬁt sharing until 2001.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) for employees in the US enables participants to purchase
ADSs quarterly at a price (the Base Option Price) which is 85% of the market price of an ADS at the start of the
offer (and in the case of employees who have joined the ESPP after the start of the offer, 85% of the market price
on the date of joining, whichever is higher). Up to 15 May 2004, 69,164 new shares have been issued and
226,218 shares have been transferred to participants out of treasury under the ESPP. As the ADS price was less
than the Base Option Price of US$31.72 from July 2002 to April 2003, the ESPP was suspended in accordance
with the rules of the ESPP from April 2003 until the end of the ﬁrst offer in December 2003. A second offer was
launched in December 2003, with a Base Option Price of US$25.61 and will run until December 2004.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 116 Notes to the financial statements 35. Auditors
The auditors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2004 for the group was £3,790,000 (2003 –
£2,943,000, 2002 – £2,702,000). The audit fees payable to the company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, for the company and UK subsidiary undertakings’ statutory accounts were £2,482,000 (2003 –
£1,910,000, 2002 – £1,656,000). The audit fee of the company was £32,000 (2003 – £31,000, 2002 –

Total fees paid or payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in the UK for non audit services in the year ended
31 March 2004 were £4,545,000 (2003 – £8,980,000, 2002 – £22,683,000).
In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what
non audit services can be provided by the company’s external auditors and the approval processes related to
them. Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there
are clear efﬁciencies and value added beneﬁts to the company.
Under the terms of BT’s main licence the group is required to publish audited regulatory ﬁnancial
statements. The fees for regulatory work principally reﬂect the audit fees associated with those regulatory
ﬁnancial statements. The fees for tax services include tax compliance and tax advisory services. The fees for
systems advice in the year ended 31 March 2003 related to advisory services provided in connection with the
implementation of certain billing systems. These services, which were provided by PwC Consulting, the
consulting business of PricewaterhouseCoopers that was sold to IBM in October 2002, commenced in 2002 and
were completed in 2003.
36. Financial instruments and risk management
The group holds or issues ﬁnancial instruments mainly to ﬁnance its operations; for the temporary investment
of short-term funds; and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its
sources of ﬁnance. In addition, various ﬁnancial instruments – for example trade debtors and trade creditors –
arise directly from the group’s operations.
The group ﬁnances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained proﬁts, deferred
taxation, long-term loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes.
The group borrows in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies. Typically, but not exclusively,
the bond markets provide the most cost-effective means of long-term borrowing. The group uses derivative
ﬁnancial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in interest and foreign
exchange rates. The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, gilt locks, currency
swaps and forward currency contracts.
The types of ﬁnancial instrument used for investment of short-term funds are prescribed in group treasury
policies with limits on the exposure to any one organisation. Short-term investing in ﬁnancial instruments is
undertaken on behalf of the group by substantial external fund managers who are limited to dealing in debt
instruments and certain deﬁned derivative instruments and are given strict guidelines on credit, diversiﬁcation
and maturity proﬁles.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 117 Notes to the financial statements 36. Financial instruments and risk management continued
During the year ended 31 March 2004, the group’s net debt reduced from £9.6 billion to £8.4 billion due to
working capital inﬂows. During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, the group restructured some of its swaps portfolio to
mitigate credit risk to certain counter parties. As a result, the group terminated £7 billion of cross-currency
interest rate swaps and replaced these with new swaps which had the same economic hedging effect. This
resulted in the group paying £445 million in reducing gross debt and receiving £420 million of interest. The
interest receipt has been included in deferred income and will be amortised to the proﬁt and loss account over
the term of the underlying debt. The group’s ﬁxed:ﬂoating interest rate proﬁle is 76:24 at 31 March 2004.
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the group’s net debt reduced from £13.7 billion to £9.6 billion.
£2.6 billion was realised from the disposal of the group’s interest in Cegetel Groupe SA in the year, and the
group has closed out £2.6 billion of associated ﬁxed interest rate swaps. The group’s ﬁxed:ﬂoating interest rate
proﬁle therefore remained at 88:12 at 31 March 2003.
During the year ended 31 March 2002, net debt was reduced from £27.9 billion to £13.7 billion mainly by
the group’s rights issue, disposal of its Yell business, its Japanese and Spanish interests, and the property sale
and leaseback transaction. The proceeds of the rights issue and sale of assets were applied mainly in reducing
short-term borrowings. The group repaid substantially all of its medium-term notes and commercial paper in that
year. As a result of the demerger of the mmO
2
business including its European operations, the group swapped an
additional e7 billion into ﬂoating rate sterling debt. This, in conjunction with the novation of £1 billion ﬁxed rate
swaps to Telereal for the property transaction, enabled the group to maintain its ﬁxed:ﬂoating ratio
at approximately 88:12 at 31 March 2002.
The group uses ﬁnancial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from its non-UK assets,
liabilities and forward purchase commitments. The group also hedges some of its interest liabilities. The ﬁnancial
instruments used comprise borrowings in foreign currencies, forward foreign currency exchange contracts,
gilt locks and interest and currency swaps.
There has been no change in the nature of the group’s risk proﬁle between 31 March 2004 and the date
of these ﬁnancial statements.
The notional amounts of derivatives summarised below do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by
the parties and, thus, are not necessarily a measure of the exposure of the group through its use of derivatives.
The amounts exchanged are calculated on the notional amounts and other terms of the derivatives which relate
to interest and exchange rates.
(a) Interest rate risk management
The group has entered into interest rate swap agreements with banks and other institutions to vary the amounts
and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are ﬁxed. Under interest rate swaps, the group agrees with
other parties to exchange, at speciﬁed intervals, the differences between ﬁxed rate and ﬂoating rate interest
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. Under gilt locks, forward sales of UK
government long-dated treasury stock were entered into for periods of up to one year. This hedge effectively
ﬁxed in the interest on part of the group’s then future borrowings, all of which have now been taken on.
At 31 March 2004, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements having a total notional
principal amount of £5,210 million (2003 – £5,170 million).
(b) Foreign exchange risk management
Cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign
currency exposure on the group’s operations and the group’s net assets. The group also enters into forward
foreign exchange contracts to hedge investments, interest expense and purchase and sale commitments
denominated in foreign currencies (principally US dollars and the euro). The remaining terms of the currency
swaps are up to 30 years and the terms of currency forward exchange contracts are typically less than one year.
The purpose of the group’s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that
the eventual net inﬂows and net outﬂows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
At 31 March 2004, the group had outstanding foreign currency swap agreements and forward exchange
contracts having a total notional principal amount of £11,367 million (2003 – £14,545 million).
The fair values of forward foreign currency contracts at 31 March 2004 were £301 million (2003 –
£673 million) for purchases of currency and £1,223 million (2003 – £1,041 million) for sales of currency. These
fair values have been estimated by calculating their present values using the market discount rates, appropriate
to the terms of the contracts, in effect at the balance sheet dates.
At 31 March 2004, the group had deferred unrealised gains of £nil (2003 – £2 million) and losses of
£5 million (2003 – £nil), based on dealer-quoted prices, from hedging purchase and sale commitments, and in
addition had deferred realised net gains of £3 million (2003 – £10 million). These are included in the proﬁt and
loss account as part of the hedged purchase or sale transaction when it is recognised, or as gains or losses when
a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 118 Notes to the financial statements 36. Financial instruments and risk management continued
(c) Concentrations of credit risk and credit exposures of ﬁnancial instruments
The group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk. The group, however, is exposed
to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to ﬁnancial instruments, but does not
expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The group limits the amount of credit exposure to any
one counterparty. The group does not normally see the need to seek collateral or other security.
The long-term debt instruments issued in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants that
if the group credit rating was downgraded below A3 in the case of Moody’s or below A minus in the case of S&P,
additional interest would accrue from the next interest coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points for
each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency. In May 2001, Moody’s downgraded BT’s credit rating
to Baa1, which increased BT’s interest charge by approximately £32 million per annum. BT’s current credit
rating from S&P is A minus. Based upon the total debt of £9 billion outstanding on these instruments at
31 March 2004, BT’s annual interest charge would increase by approximately £45 million if BT’s credit ratings
were to be downgraded by one credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa1/A
minus. If BT’s credit rating with Moody’s was to be upgraded by one credit rating category the annual interest
charge would be reduced by approximately £23 million.
(d) Fair value of ﬁnancial instruments
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the group’s ﬁnancial instruments at 31 March
2004 and 2003. The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings,
with the exception of derivative amounts, which are included in debtors or other creditors or as part of net debt
as appropriate. The fair values of the ﬁnancial instruments are the amount at which the instruments could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in forced or liquidation sale.

The fair values of listed ﬁxed asset investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.
c
The fair value of the group’s bonds, debentures, notes and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for
the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ﬂows using the
appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
d
The fair value of the group’s outstanding foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements was estimated by calculating the present value, using
appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, of affected future cash ﬂows translated, where appropriate, into pounds sterling at
the market rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.

Currency exposures
The table below shows the currency exposures of the group’s net monetary assets (liabilities), in terms of those
transactional exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the proﬁt and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the group that are not denominated in
the operating (or ‘‘functional’’) currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling
borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in non-UK operations. At 31 March, these exposures were as

During the year ended 31 March 2003, the group entered into two derivatives contracts as an investment in a
UK listed equity, with limited net overall exposure. At 31 March 2003, the two contracts had a net value of £nil,
consisting of a futures purchase contract with a fair value of £68 million and a futures sales contract with a fair
value of £68 million. These contracts were closed out in April 2003.
Unused committed lines of credit
Unused committed lines of credit for short-term ﬁnancing available at 31 March 2004 totalled approximately
£145 million (2003 – £575 million), which was in support of a commercial paper programme or other
borrowings. These lines of credit are available for up to one year.

United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles The group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the UK (UK GAAP), which differ in certain respects from those applicable in the US (US GAAP).
i Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles
The following are the main differences between UK and US GAAP which are relevant to the group’s
ﬁnancial statements.
(a) Sale and leaseback of properties
Under UK GAAP, the sale of BT’s property portfolio is treated as a ﬁxed asset disposal and the subsequent
leaseback is an operating lease. Under US GAAP, the transaction is regarded as ﬁnancing and the land and
buildings are recorded on the balance sheet at their net book value, an obligation equivalent to the cash
proceeds is recognised and the gain on disposal is deferred until the properties are vacated by BT. Rental
payments made by BT are reversed and replaced by a ﬁnance lease interest charge and a depreciation charge.
(b) Pension costs
Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice No. 24, with costs being charged against proﬁts over employees’ working lives. Under US GAAP,
pension costs are determined in accordance with the requirements of US Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) Nos. 87 and 88. Differences between the UK and US GAAP ﬁgures arise from the requirement
to use different actuarial methods and assumptions and a different method of amortising surpluses or deﬁcits.
(c) Accounting for redundancies
Under UK GAAP, the cost of providing incremental pension beneﬁts in respect of workforce reductions is taken
into account when determining current and future pension costs, unless the most recent actuarial valuation,
combined with the provision for pension costs in the group balance sheet, under UK actuarial conventions, shows
a deﬁcit. In this case, the cost of providing incremental pension beneﬁts is included in redundancy charges in
the year in which the employees agree to leave the group.
Under US GAAP, the associated costs of providing incremental pension beneﬁts are charged against proﬁts
in the period in which the termination terms are agreed with the employees. The fair value of termination
beneﬁts for employees who are to be retained beyond their minimum contractual retention period is recognised
on a straight line basis over the future service period.
(d) Capitalisation of interest
Under UK GAAP, the group does not capitalise interest. To comply with US GAAP, the estimated amount of
interest incurred whilst constructing major capital projects is included in ﬁxed assets, and depreciated over the
lives of the related assets. This included capitalisation of interest incurred on funding the 3G licences up to the
date of the mmO
2
demerger. The amount of interest capitalised is determined by reference to the
average interest rates on outstanding borrowings. At 31 March 2004 under US GAAP, gross capitalised interest
of £358 million (2003 – £461 million) with regard to the company and its subsidiary companies was subject to
depreciation generally over periods of 3 to 25 years.
(e) Goodwill
Under UK GAAP, in respect of acquisitions completed prior to 1 April 1998, the group wrote off goodwill arising
from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures on acquisition against retained
earnings. The goodwill is reﬂected in the net income of the period of disposal, as part of the calculation of
the gain or loss on divestment. All unamortised and pre-April 1998 goodwill will be brought back to the proﬁt
and loss account on disposal. Following the implementation of UK Financial Reporting Standard No. 10 (FRS 10),
goodwill arising on acquisitions completed after 1 April 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis
over its useful economic life.
Under US GAAP up to 31 March 2002, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and
joint ventures was capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful life. With effect from 1 April
2002 BT has adopted SFAS No. 142, and goodwill is no longer amortised but tested annually for impairment.
In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 transitional and annual impairment reviews were performed.
There was no transitional impairment charge recorded. As a result of the annual impairment review, no goodwill
impairment charge was recognised in the year ended 31 March 2004 (2003 – £54 million). Goodwill of
£12 million (2003 – £20 million) amortised under UK GAAP is written back through the income statement.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 125 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Had the cessation of goodwill amortisation requirement of SFAS No. 142 been applied in prior periods, results of
operations would have been as follows:
2003

2002
£m
Net income (loss) as adjusted for US GAAP 4,134 (732)
Add back: goodwill amortisation –34
Adjusted net income (loss) 4,134 (698)
Adjusted basic earnings per American Depositary Share £4.80 £(0.84)
Adjusted diluted earnings per American Depositary Share £4.80 £(0.84)
(f) Mobile cellular telephone licences, software and other intangible assets
Certain intangible ﬁxed assets recognised under US GAAP purchase accounting requirements are subsumed
within goodwill under UK GAAP. Under US GAAP these separately identiﬁed intangible assets are valued and
amortised over their useful lives of 20 years.
(g) Financial instruments
Under UK GAAP, investments are held on the balance sheet at historical cost, and own shares held in trust for
share schemes are recorded in ﬁxed asset investments. Gains and losses on instruments used for hedges are not
recognised until the exposure being hedged is recognised. Under US GAAP, trading securities and available-for-
sale securities are carried at market value with appropriate valuation adjustments recorded in proﬁt and loss and
shareholders’ equity, respectively.
Certain derivative ﬁnancial instruments which qualify for hedge accounting under UK GAAP do not qualify for
hedge accounting under US GAAP. Under US GAAP, ﬁnancial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting
due to the extensive documentation requirements. These ﬁnancial instruments, under US GAAP, are carried
at market value with valuation adjustments recorded in the proﬁt and loss account. The reassessment and
purchase of derivatives in the year ended 31 March 2004 gave rise to an adjustment reducing net income by
£133 million net of tax (2003 – increase £610 million). The net unrealised holding gain on equity investments
held as available-for-sale securities for the year ended 31 March 2004 was £5 million (2003 – £22 million,
2002 – £271 million). SFAS 133 became effective for BT on 1 April 2001 and the unamortised transitional
adjustment of £9 million net of tax remains in shareholders’ equity at 31 March 2004.
(h) Deferred gain
Under UK GAAP, assets contributed to a joint venture by the group’s partners are measured at their net
replacement cost. Any difference between the group’s share of the joint venture’s resulting net assets and the
net book value of assets contributed by the group to the joint venture, including certain accrued start up costs, is
immediately reﬂected by adjusting the group’s investment in the joint venture and recording a deferred
difference in shareholders’ equity. Under US GAAP, the assets contributed by all joint venture partners are
carried at their historical net book value and any difference between the group’s share of the joint venture’s
resulting net assets and the net book value of assets contributed by the group to the joint venture is amortised
over the life of the items giving rise to the difference.
(i) Employee share plans
Certain share options have been granted under BT save-as-you-earn plans at a 20% discount. Under UK GAAP,
the share issues are recorded at their discounted price when the options are exercised. Under US GAAP, a plan
is considered compensatory when the discount to market price is in excess of 15%. Compensation cost is
recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market
price of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
Under UK GAAP, shares held by employee share ownership trusts are recorded as ﬁxed asset investments
at cost less amounts written off. Under US GAAP, those shares not fully vested are regarded as treasury stock
and recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity.
(j) Investments in associates
Under UK GAAP, the economic interest in the associates’ operating proﬁts before minority interest is reported as
part of the total operating proﬁt. For those associates in which a minority interest is recognised in their
respective statements of proﬁt and loss, such minority interest is reported as minority interest in the consolidated
proﬁt and loss account. Under US GAAP, the minority interest in the associates is reclassiﬁed from minority
interest and reported within the share of results of associates.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 126 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (k) Deferred taxation
Under UK GAAP, provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability or asset arose as a result of transactions
that had occurred by the balance sheet date and give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a
right to pay less tax in the future. Under US GAAP, deferred taxation is provided for on a full liability basis.
Future tax beneﬁts are recognised as deferred tax assets to the extent that their realisation is more likely than
not. As a result of changes in circumstances, previously recognised deferred tax liabilities were released in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year. At 31 March 2004 total deferred tax liabilities were £2,780 million primarily in respect
of accelerated capital allowances and total deferred tax assets were £2,240 million, primarily in respect of
pension obligations.
(l) Dividends
Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the year in respect of which they are declared (in the case of interim
or any special dividends) or proposed by the board of directors to the shareholders (in the case of ﬁnal dividends).
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which dividends are declared.
(m) Impairment
Under UK GAAP, if there is an indication of impairment the assets should be tested for impairment and,
if necessary written down to the value in use, calculated based on discounted future pre-tax cash ﬂows related
to the asset or the income generating unit to which the asset belongs.
US GAAP requires that an entity assess whether impairment has occurred based on the undiscounted future
cash ﬂows. An impairment loss exists if the sum of these cash ﬂows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.
The impairment loss recognised in the income statement is based on the asset’s fair value, being either market
value or the sum of discounted future cash ﬂows.
(n) Discontinued operations
Under UK GAAP, the disposal of certain lines of business and joint ventures and associates are shown as
discontinued activities. Under US GAAP, only the disposals of lines of business under SFAS No. 144 would be
reported as discontinued operations.
(o) Disposals of businesses
There are timing differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP for recognition of gains on the sale of certain
businesses. Foreign exchange movements taken to reserves under UK GAAP are reported in the income
statement under US GAAP. Historical GAAP differences on disposed businesses are also shown under this
line item.
(p) Property rationalisation provision
Under UK GAAP in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, a provision in connection with the rationalisation of the group’s
London ofﬁce property portfolio was recorded. Under US GAAP, in accordance with SFAS No 146, these costs are
not recognised until the group fully exits and therefore ceases to use the affected properties.
(q) Software
Under UK GAAP long-term contracts to design, build and operate software solutions are accounted for under
SSAP 9 ‘‘Stocks and long-term contracts’’ and FRS 5 ‘‘Reporting the substance of transactions’’, under which
turnover is recognised as earned over the contract period.
Under US GAAP revenue of £77 million under these contracts is deferred in the 2004 ﬁnancial year under
SOP 97-2 ‘‘Software revenue recognition’’, which requires vendor speciﬁc objective evidence to support the fair
value of the separate elements to be delivered. There was no impact on net income.

Under US GAAP, the income to minority interests would have been unchanged (2003 – £27 million reduction,
2002 – £26 million reduction) after adjusting for goodwill amortisation and accounting for associates and joint
ventures. Net assets attributable to minority interests would have been unchanged (2003 – unchanged) after
adjusting for ﬁnancial instruments.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 128 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles iv Accounting for share options
Under UK GAAP, the company does not recognise compensation expense for the fair value, at the date of grant,
of share options granted under the employee share option schemes. Under US GAAP, the company adopted
the disclosure-only provisions in SFAS No. 123 ‘‘Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation’’. Accordingly,
the company accounts for share options in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 ‘‘Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees’’, under which no compensation expense is recognised. Had the group expensed recognised
compensation cost for options granted in accordance with SFAS No. 123, the group’s pro forma net income
(loss), basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share under US GAAP would have been
£862 million (2003 – £4,127 million, 2002 – £792 million loss), 10.0p (2003 – 47.9p, 2002 – 9.5p loss) and
9.9p (2003 – 47.6p, 2002 – 9.5p loss), respectively. See note 34 for the SFAS No. 123 disclosures of the fair
value of options granted under employee schemes at date of grant.
v Consolidated statements of cash ﬂows
Under UK GAAP, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented in accordance with UK Financial
Reporting Standard No. 1 (FRS 1). The statements prepared under FRS 1 present substantially the same
information as that required under SFAS No. 95.
Under SFAS No. 95, cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term investments with maturities
of three months or less at the date of purchase. Under FRS 1 cash comprises cash in hand and at bank and
overnight deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
Under FRS 1, cash ﬂows are presented for operating activities; returns on investments and servicing
of ﬁnance; taxation; capital expenditure and ﬁnancial investments; acquisitions and disposals; dividends paid to
the company’s shareholders; management of liquid resources and ﬁnancing. SFAS No. 95 requires a
classiﬁcation of cash ﬂows as resulting from operating, investing and ﬁnancing activities.
Cash ﬂows under FRS 1 in respect of interest received, interest paid (net of that capitalised under US GAAP)
and taxation would be included within operating activities under SFAS No. 95. Cash ﬂows from purchases, sales
and maturities of trading securities, while not separately identiﬁed under UK GAAP, would be included within
operating activities under US GAAP. Capitalised interest, while not recognised under UK GAAP, is included in
investing activities under US GAAP. Dividends paid are included within ﬁnancing activities under US GAAP.
The following statements summarise the statements of cash ﬂows as if they had been presented in
accordance with US GAAP, and include the adjustments which reconcile cash and cash equivalents under US
GAAP to cash at bank and in hand reported under UK GAAP.

vi Current asset investments
Under US GAAP, investments in debt securities would be classiﬁed as either trading, available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity. Trading investments would be stated at fair values and the unrealised gains and losses would
be included in income. Securities classiﬁed as available-for-sale would be stated at fair values, with unrealised
gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reported in shareholders’ equity. Debt securities classiﬁed as held-to-
maturity would be stated at amortised cost. The following analyses do not include securities with original
maturities of less than three months.

vii Pension costs
The following position for the main pension scheme is computed in accordance with US GAAP pension
accounting rules under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 88, the effect of which is shown in the above reconciliation
statements.
The pension cost determined under SFAS No. 87 was calculated by reference to an expected long-term rate
of return on scheme assets of 7.35% (2003 – 6.9%, 2002 – 6.5%). The components of the pension cost for
the main pension scheme comprised:

Asset allocation
The Trustees of the main pension scheme approve the target asset allocation as well as deviation limits. The
objective of the investment activities is to maximise investment return within an acceptable level of risk, taking
into consideration the liabilities of the main pension scheme.

The assumption for the expected return in scheme assets is a weighted average based on an assumed expected
return for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year. The
expected returns on bonds are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year. Expected returns on
equities and property are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above, yields on
government bonds and consensus economic forecasts of future returns. The expected return of 7.27% per
annum used for the calculation of pension costs for the year ending 31 March 2005 is consistent with that
adopted for FRS 17.
viii Income statement in US GAAP format
The group proﬁt and loss accounts on pages 78 to 80 comply with UK GAAP and the directors believe they are in
the most appropriate format for shareholders to understand the results of our business. We believe that it is
important to show our results before deducting goodwill amortisation and exceptional items because these items
predominantly relate to corporate transactions rather than the trading activities of the group. For SEC reporting
purposes this presentation would be considered ‘‘non GAAP’’ and therefore the group has also prepared the
following income statement which meets the SEC reporting format set forth in Item 10 of Regulation S-X. The
ﬁnancial numbers disclosed in the following income statement are prepared under UK GAAP.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 132 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ix US GAAP developments
In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. 46
(FIN 46), ‘‘Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities’’ and in December 2003 issued a revised interpretation,
FIN 46R. The interpretation requires the primary beneﬁciary to consolidate a variable interest entity if it has a
variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity’s losses if they occur, or receive a majority of the entity’s
expected returns or both. BT had adopted FIN 46 in June 2003, and the further adoption of FIN 46R did not
have a material effect on the results or statement of ﬁnancial position of the group.
In May 2003 the FASB issued SFAS No. 150 ‘‘Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity’’. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how to classify and
measure certain ﬁnancial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer
classify a ﬁnancial instrument that is within its scope as a liability, or an asset in some circumstances. On
adoption, SFAS No. 150 did not have a material effect on the results or statement of ﬁnancial position of the
group.
In November 2002 the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on EITF 00-21 ‘‘Revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables’’. BT adopted this consensus for contracts entered into after 15 June
2003. Adoption of the consensus did not have a material impact on the results of the group.

The ratio is based on proﬁt before tax, goodwill amortisation and interest on long-term borrowings, to average capital employed. Capital employed
is represented by total assets, excluding goodwill, less current liabilities, excluding corporate taxes and dividends payable, and provisions other than
those for deferred taxation. Year-end ﬁgures are used in the computation of the average, except in the case of short-term investments and borrowings
where average daily balances are used in their place.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 137
Operational statistics
Years ended 31 March The business of BT is affected by a number of factors,
not all of which are wholly within BT’s control.
Although many of the factors inﬂuencing BT’s
performance are macro economic and likely to affect
the performance of businesses generally, some aspects
of BT’s business make it particularly sensitive to
certain areas of business risk. This section highlights
some of those speciﬁc areas. However, it does not
purport to be an extensive analysis of the factors
affecting the business and some risks may be unknown
to us and other risks, currently believed to be
immaterial, could turn out to be material. All of these
could materially adversely affect our business,
turnover, proﬁts, assets, liquidity and capital
resources. They should also be considered in
connection with the forward looking statements in this
document and the cautionary statement regarding
forward-looking statements on page 141 of this
document.
If BT’s activities are subject to signiﬁcant price and
other regulatory controls, its market share,
competitive position and future proﬁtability may be
affected
Most of BT’s ﬁxed network activities in the UK are
subject to signiﬁcant regulatory controls. The controls
regulate, among other things, the prices BT may
charge for many of its services and the extent to which
it has to provide services to its competitors. In recent
years, the effect of these controls has been to cause
BT to reduce its prices. BT cannot assure its
shareholders that the regulatory authorities will not
increase the severity of the price controls, nor extend
the services to which controls apply (including any new
services that BT may offer in the future), nor extend
the services which it has to provide its competitors.
These controls may adversely affect BT’s market share,
the severity of competition and its future proﬁtability.
During 2004 Ofcom is undertaking a strategic review
of the UK telecommunications market in order to
formulate the principles on which it can base its
regulatory decisions in the future. This review is
scheduled to be completed before the end of 2004. It
is not possible to predict the outcome or implications
for BT of Ofcom’s review. Further details on the
regulatory framework in which BT operates can be
found in ‘‘Business Review – regulation, competition
and prices’’ on pages 17 to 23 of this document.
BT faces strong competition in UK ﬁxed network
services
BT continues to have a signiﬁcant market share in
some aspects of UK ﬁxed network services. In
particular, in the 2004 ﬁnancial year we estimate we
had a market share of 70% of consumer calls and 42%
of business calls in the UK. Regulators have promoted
competition in this area by allowing BT’s competitors
to site equipment in or adjacent to its exchanges (local
loop unbundling), to make it easier for BT’s customers
to route some or all of their calls over competitors’
networks (carrier pre-selection) and by the introduction
of a wholesale access product (wholesale line rental).
Reduction in BT’s market share in the ﬁxed network
may lead to a fall in BT’s turnover and an adverse
effect on proﬁtability. Unlike its competitors, BT
continues to be obliged by the current regulatory
regime to serve customers in the United Kingdom,
whether or not such provision of service is economic,
and the competitive measures described above may
have the effect of accelerating the diversion of its more
proﬁtable existing customers without it being able to
reduce its costs commensurately. These changes in the
regulatory environment and ensuing increased
competition on its ﬁxed network may cause adverse
effects on its business, results of operations, ﬁnancial
condition and prospects.
BT’s business is dependent on the ability to exploit
technological advances quickly and successfully
BT operates in an industry with a recent history of
fast technological changes. It expects that new
products and technologies will emerge and that
existing products and technologies will develop
further. BT needs to continually develop its services
and products to exploit those next generation
technologies. However, BT cannot predict the actual
effect of these technological changes on its business
or on its ability to provide competitive services. For
example there is evidence of substitution by
customers using mobile phones for day-to-day voice
calls in place of making such calls over the ﬁxed
network. Additionally, some calls are now being
routed over the internet in place of the traditional
switched network. If these trends accelerate, BT’s
ﬁxed network assets may be used uneconomically
and its investment in these assets may not be
recovered through proﬁts on ﬁxed-network calls and
line rentals. Impairment write-downs may be incurred
and margins may decline if ﬁxed costs cannot be
reduced in line with falling turnover.
BT is carrying out a transformation strategy,
including the targeting of signiﬁcant growth in new
business areas
BT has a strategy to transform its business. This may
result in changes to its products, services, markets and
culture. If the group’s transformation strategy is
unsuccessful there is a risk that the future turnover and
proﬁtability will decline. In particular BT has targeted
signiﬁcant growth in new business areas, such as
broadband, mobility and Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) solutions. In view of
the likely level of competition and uncertainties
regarding the level of economic activity, there can be
no certainty that BT will meet its growth targets in
these areas, with a consequential impact on future
turnover and proﬁtability.
BT’s businesses may be adversely affected if they
fail to perform on major contracts
BT has entered into a number of complex and high
value services contracts with customers. Failure to
manage and meet BT’s commitments under these
contracts may lead to a reduction in BT’s future
turnover, proﬁtability and cash generation.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 138
Risk factors BT’s businesses may be adversely affected if their
networks or systems experience any signiﬁcant
failures or interruptions
BT’s businesses are dependent on their ability to
transfer substantial volumes of data speedily and without
interruption. Any signiﬁcant failure or interruption of
such data transfer due to factors outside their control
could have a material adverse effect on the businesses
and their results from operations. BT has a business
continuity strategy designed to deal with such
catastrophic events, including for example major
terrorist action, industrial action, extreme virus attack,
hurricane or ﬂooding, that may impact the ability to
maintain an effective service to customers. A failure to
deliver that strategy may result in a material loss and
there can be no assurance that material adverse events
will not occur.
Declining investment returns and longer life
expectancy may result in the funding cost of the
deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme becoming a
signiﬁcant burden on the ﬁnancial resources of BT
The deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the BT Pension
Scheme (BTPS), was closed to new members on
31 March 2001 and has been replaced by a deﬁned
contribution scheme (BTRP). The latest full triennial
actuarial valuation of the BTPS was completed as at
31 December 2002. As a result, BT agreed to make
normal contributions of 12.2% of pensionable pay and
annual deﬁciency payments of £232 million. This will
apply until the next triennial actuarial valuation is
completed as at 31 December 2005. In March 2004 a
£380 million prepayment of deﬁciency contributions
was made, representing most of the deﬁciency
contributions for the 2005 and 2006 ﬁnancial years.
The results of future scheme valuations will be
impacted by the future investment market
performance, interest rates and the general trend
towards longer life expectancy, all of which are outside
the control of BT. In the event that investment returns
decline or life expectancy increases, the cash funding
cost to BT may increase and may have a signiﬁcant
effect on the ﬁnancial resources of BT.

The pre-19 November 2001 prices shown have been adjusted for the rights issue and demerger that occurred in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
The prices are the highest and lowest closing middle market prices for BT ordinary shares, as derived from the
Daily Ofﬁcial List of the London Stock Exchange and the highest and lowest sales prices of ADSs, as reported
on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar affect the dollar equivalent
of the pound sterling price of the company’s ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange and, as a result,
are likely to affect the market price of the ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange.
Capital gains tax (CGT)

The conﬁrmed ofﬁcial opening prices for BT Group and mmO
2
shares on 19 November 2001 following the
demerger were 285.75p and 82.75p, respectively. This means that, of the total (combined) value of 368.50p,
77.544% is attributable to BT Group and 22.456% to mmO
2
. Accordingly, for CGT calculations, the base cost
of your BT Group shares and mmO
2
shares is calculated by multiplying the acquisition cost of your
BT shareholding by 77.544% and 22.456%, respectively.

shares, or approximately 2.5% of the total number of ordinary shares outstanding on that date) were outstanding
and were held by 2,461 record holders of ADRs. At 31 March 2004, there were 3,577 shareholders with a US
address on the register of shareholders.
Dividends
Since shortly after its incorporation in 1984, British Telecommunications plc paid interim dividends annually
in February and ﬁnal dividends in September. However, as part of BT’s debt reduction and restructuring plans,
neither a ﬁnal dividend for the year ended 31 March 2001 nor an interim dividend for the year ended 31 March
2002 was paid to shareholders.
A ﬁnal dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2003, was paid on 8 September 2003 to shareholders
on the register on 8 August 2003, and an interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2004 was paid
on 9 February 2004 to shareholders on the register on 30 December 2003.
The dividends paid or payable on BT shares and ADSs for the last ﬁve years are shown in the following table.
The dividends on the ordinary shares exclude the associated tax credit. The amounts shown are not those that
were actually paid to holders of ADSs. For the tax treatment of dividends paid on or after 6 April 1999 see
Taxation of dividends below. The dividends on the ADSs paid before 5 April 1999 include the associated UK
tax credit available to certain beneﬁcial owners who are resident in the United States or Canada for tax purposes,
but before deduction of UK withholding taxes. Dividends have been translated from pounds sterling into
US dollars using exchange rates prevailing on the date the ordinary dividends were paid.

Qualifying holders of ADSs on record as of 6 August 2004 are entitled to receive the ﬁnal dividend which will be paid on 14 September 2004, subject
to approval at the annual general meeting. The US dollar amount of the ﬁnal dividend of 53 pence per ADS to be paid to holders of ADSs will be based
on the exchange rate in effect on 6 September 2004, the date of payment to holders of ordinary shares.
As dividends paid by the company are in pounds sterling, exchange rate ﬂuctuations will affect the US dollar
amounts received by holders of ADSs on conversion by the Depositary of such cash dividends.
Dividend mandate
Any shareholder wishing dividends to be paid directly into a bank or building society account should contact
the Shareholder Helpline (see page 153). Dividends paid in this way will be paid through the Bankers Automated
Clearing System (BACS). Alternatively, a form may be downloaded from the internet at www.bt.com/aboutbt.
Dividend investment plan
The dividend investment plan replaced the share dividend plan for shareholders following the 1999 interim
dividend. Under the dividend investment plan, cash from participants’ dividends is used to buy further BT Group
shares in the market.
Shareholders could elect to receive additional shares in lieu of a cash dividend for the following dividends:

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 144 Additional information for shareholders Total Shareholder Return
Total shareholder return (TSR) is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders,
reﬂecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. It is, therefore, a good indicator of a
company’s overall performance.
Over the past ﬁve years (as shown in the TSR chart below), BT after performing very strongly in the ﬁrst year,
has suffered falls in its share price like many stocks in the telecoms, media and technology (TMT) sector. BT’s
TSR (as adjusted for the rights issue and demerger) over the last ﬁve years was negative 72% compared to a
FTSE 100 TSR fall of negative 20%. However, over the past year both BT and the FTSE 100 have delivered a very
positive performance (BT positive 18% and the FTSE 100 positive 26%).
In the period between the demerger on 19 November 2001 and 31 March 2004, BT’s share price
outperformed the European Telecoms sector for most of the period. However, BT shares have not matched the
sector recovery in the most recent months resulting in an underperformance versus the European Telecom sector
by around 8% (as shown in the share price performance chart), over the 28 month period.

Memorandum and Articles of Association
The following is a summary of the principal provisions of BT’s memorandum and articles of association
(‘‘Memorandum’’ and ‘‘Articles’’), a copy of which has been ﬁled with the Registrar of Companies.
Memorandum
The Memorandum provides that its principal objects are, among other things, to carry on any business of
running, operating, managing and supplying telecommunication systems and systems of any kind for conveying,
receiving, storing, processing or transmitting sounds, visual images, signals, messages and communications of
any kind.
Articles
In the following description of the rights attaching to the shares in the company, a ‘‘holder of shares’’ and a
‘‘shareholder’’ is, in either case, the person entered on the company’s register of members as the holder
of the relevant shares. Shareholders can choose whether their shares are to be evidenced by share certiﬁcates
(i.e. in certiﬁcated form) or held in electronic (i.e. uncertiﬁcated) form in CREST (the electronic settlement
system in the UK).
(a) Voting rights
Subject to the restrictions described below, on a show of hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy
at any general meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote
for each share which they hold.
Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman
of the meeting or by at least ﬁve shareholders at the meeting who are entitled to vote (or their proxies), or by
one or more shareholders at the meeting who are entitled to vote (or their proxies) and who have, between them,
at least 10% of the total votes of all shareholders who have the right to vote at the meeting.
No person is, unless the Board decide otherwise, entitled to attend or vote at any general meeting or to
exercise any other right conferred by being a shareholder if he or any person appearing to be interested in
those shares has been sent a notice under section 212 of the Companies Act 1985 (which confers upon public
companies the power to require information with respect to interests in their voting shares) and he or any
interested person has failed to supply to the company the information requested within 14 days after delivery
of that notice. These restrictions end seven days after the earlier of the date the shareholder complies with
the request satisfactorily or the company receives notice that there has been an approved transfer of the shares.
(b) Variation of rights
Whenever the share capital of the company is split into different classes of shares, the special rights attached to
any of those classes can be varied or withdrawn either:
(i) with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares
of that class; or
(ii) with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class.
At any separate meeting, the necessary quorum is two persons holding or representing by proxy not less than
one-third in nominal amount of the issued shares of the class in question (but at any adjourned meeting, any
person holding shares of the class or his proxy is a quorum).
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 146 Additional information for shareholders The company can issue new shares and attach any rights and restrictions to them, as long as this is not restricted
by special rights previously given to holders of any existing shares. Subject to this, the rights of new shares can
take priority over the rights of existing shares, or existing shares can take priority over them, or the new shares
and the existing shares can rank equally.
(c) Changes in capital
The company may by ordinary resolution:
(i) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger amount;
(ii) divide all or part of its share capital into shares of a smaller amount;
(iii) cancel any shares which have not, at the date of the ordinary resolution, been taken or agreed to be taken
by any person and reduce the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares cancelled; and
(iv) increase its share capital.
The company may also:
(i) buy back its own shares; and
(ii) by special resolution reduce its share capital, any capital redemption reserve and any share premium
account.
(d) Dividends
The company’s shareholders can declare dividends by passing an ordinary resolution provided that no dividend
can exceed the amount recommended by the directors. Dividends must be paid out of proﬁts available for
distribution. If the directors consider that the proﬁts of the company justify such payments, they can pay interim
dividends on any class of shares of the amounts and on the dates and for the periods they decide. Fixed
dividends will be paid on any class of shares on the dates stated for the payments of those dividends.
The directors can offer ordinary shareholders the right to choose to receive new ordinary shares, which are
credited as fully paid, instead of some or all of their cash dividend. Before they can do this, the company’s
shareholders must have passed an ordinary resolution authorising the directors to make this offer.
Any dividend which has not been claimed for 10 years after it was declared or became due for payment will
be forfeited and will belong to the company unless the directors decide otherwise.
(e) Distribution of assets on winding up
If the company is wound up (whether the liquidation is voluntary, under supervision of the court or by the court)
the liquidator can, with the authority of an extraordinary resolution passed by the shareholders, divide among the
shareholders all or any part of the assets of the company. This applies whether the assets consist of property
of one kind or different kinds. For this purpose, the liquidator can place whatever value the liquidator considers
fair on any property and decide how the division is carried out between shareholders or different groups of
shareholders. The liquidator can also, with the same authority, transfer any assets to trustees upon any trusts for
the beneﬁt of shareholders which the liquidator decides. The liquidation of the company can then be ﬁnalised
and the company dissolved. No past or present shareholder can be compelled to accept any shares or other
property under the Articles which could give them a liability.
(f) Transfer of shares
Certiﬁcated shares of the company may be transferred in writing either by an instrument of transfer in the usual
standard form or in another form approved by the Board. The transfer form must be signed or made effective by
or on behalf of the person making the transfer. The person making the transfer will be treated as continuing to
be the holder of the shares transferred until the name of the person to whom the shares are being transferred is
entered in the register of members of the company.
The Board may refuse to register any transfer of any share held in certiﬁcated form:
& which is in favour of more than four joint holders; or
& unless the transfer form to be registered is properly stamped to show payment of any applicable stamp duty
and delivered to the company’s registered ofﬁce or any other place the Board decide. The transfer must
have with it the share certiﬁcate for the shares to be transferred; any other evidence which the Board ask for
to prove that the person wanting to make the transfer is entitled to do this; and if the transfer form is
executed by another person on behalf of the person making the transfer, evidence of the authority of that
person to do so.
Transfers of uncertiﬁcated shares must be carried out using a relevant system (as deﬁned in the
Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 1995 (the Regulations)). The Board can refuse to register a transfer of an
uncertiﬁcated share in the circumstances stated in the Regulations.
If the Board decide not to register a transfer of a share, they must notify the person to whom that share was
to be transferred no later than two months after the company receives the transfer or instruction from the
operator of the relevant system.
The Board can decide to suspend the registration of transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the
register of shareholders. The register must not be closed without the consent of the operator of a relevant system
(as deﬁned in the Regulations) in the case of uncertiﬁcated shares.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 147 Additional information for shareholders (g) Untraced shareholders
BT may sell any shares after advertising its intention and waiting for three months if the shares have been in
issue for at least 10 years, during that period at least three dividends have become payable on them and have
not been claimed and BT has not heard from the shareholder or any person entitled to the dividends by
transmission. The net sale proceeds belong to BT, but it must pay those proceeds to the former shareholder or
the person entitled to them by transmission if that shareholder, or that other person, asks for them.
(h) General meetings of shareholders
Every year the company must hold an annual general meeting. The Board can call an extraordinary general
meeting at any time and, under general law, must call one on a shareholders’ requisition.
(i) Limitations on rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders
The only limitation imposed by the Articles on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders is that
a shareholder whose registered address is outside the UK and who wishes to receive notices of meetings of
shareholders or documents from BT must give the company an address within the UK to which they may be sent.
(j) Directors
Directors’ remuneration
Excluding remuneration referred to below, each director will be paid such fees for his services as the Board
decide, not exceeding £50,000 a year and increasing by the percentage increase of the UK Retail Prices Index
(as deﬁned by Section 833(2) Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) for any 12-month period beginning
1 April 1999 or an anniversary of that date. The company may by ordinary resolution decide on a higher sum.
This resolution can increase the fee paid to all or any directors either permanently or for a particular period.
The directors may be paid their expenses properly incurred in connection with the business of the company.
The Board can award extra fees to a director who holds an executive position; acts as chairman or deputy
chairman; serves on a Board committee at the request of the Board; or performs any other services which
the Board consider extend beyond the ordinary duties of a director.
The directors may grant pensions or other beneﬁts to, among others, any director or former director
or persons connected with them. However, BT can only provide these beneﬁts to any director or former director
who has not been an employee or held any other ofﬁce or executive position in the company or any of its
subsidiary undertakings, or to relations or dependants of, or people connected to, those directors or former
directors, if the shareholders approve this by passing an ordinary resolution.
Directors’ votes
A director need not be a shareholder, but a director who is not a shareholder can still attend and speak
at shareholders’ meetings.
Unless the Articles say otherwise, a director cannot vote on a resolution about a contract in which the
director has a material interest (this will also apply to interests of a person connected with the director). The
director can vote if the interest is only an interest in BT shares, debentures or other securities. A director can,
however, vote and be counted in a quorum in respect of certain matters in which he is interested as set out in
the Articles.
Subject to the relevant legislation, the shareholders can by passing an ordinary resolution suspend or relax,
among other things, the provisions relating to the interest of a director in any contract or arrangement or
relating to a director’s right to vote and be counted in a quorum on resolutions in which he is interested to any
extent or ratify any particular contract carried out in breach of those provisions.
Directors’ interests
If the legislation allows and the director has disclosed the nature and extent of the interest to the Board,
the director can:
(i) have any kind of interest in a contract with or involving BT (or in which BT has an interest or with or involving
another company in which BT has an interest);
(ii) have any kind of interest in a company in which BT has an interest (including holding a position in that
company or being a shareholder of that company);
(iii) hold a position (other than auditor) in BT or another company in which BT has an interest on terms and
conditions decided by the Board; and
(iv) alone (or through some ﬁrm with which the director is associated) do paid professional work (other than
as auditor) for BT or another company in which BT has an interest on terms and conditions decided
by the Board.
A director does not have to hand over to BT any beneﬁt received or proﬁt made as a result of anything
permitted to be done under the Articles.
When a director knows that they are interested in a contract with BT they must tell the other directors.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 148 Additional information for shareholders Retirement of directors
Provisions of the legislation which, read with the Articles, would prevent a person from being or becoming
a director because that person has reached the age of 70 do not apply to the company.
At every annual general meeting any director who was elected or last re-elected a director at or before
the annual general meeting held in the third year before the current year, shall retire by rotation. Any director
appointed by the directors automatically retires at the next following annual general meeting. A retiring
director is eligible for re-election.
Directors’ borrowing powers
To the extent that the legislation and the Articles allow, the Board can exercise all the powers of the company
to borrow money, to mortgage or charge its business, property and assets (present and future) and to issue
debentures and other securities, and give security either outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability
or obligation of the company or another person. The Board must limit the borrowings of the company and
exercise all the company’s voting and other rights or powers of control exercisable by the company in relation to
its subsidiary undertakings so as to ensure that the aggregate amount of all borrowings by the group
outstanding, net of amounts borrowed intra-group among other things, at any time does not exceed £35 billion.
Material contracts
The following contracts (not being contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business) have been entered
into in the two years preceding the date of this document by BT or another member of the group and are, or
may be, material to the group or have been entered into by BT or another member of the group and contain
a provision under which a member of the group has an obligation or entitlement which is, or may be, material
to BT or such other member of the group.
Cegetel
On 5 December 2002, Vivendi Universal (‘‘Vivendi’’) served a notice exercising its pre-emption rights under
the Shareholders’ Agreement in respect of Cegetel Groupe SA (‘‘Cegetel’’) to acquire BT’s entire shareholding –
a 26% interest – in Cegetel from Cegetel Holdings I BV Sarl (‘‘Cegetel Holdings’’), a BT group company for
e4.0 billion (£2.6 billion) in cash. This pre-emption right became exercisable as a result of Cegetel Holdings
having entered into a share purchase agreement for the sale of its shareholding in Cegetel to Vodafone AG for
e4.0 billion in cash, in October 2002.
Vivendi paid e2.7 billion of the consideration to Cegetel Holdings on 17 January 2003 and the transaction
was completed when Vivendi paid the balance of e1.3 billion on 22 January 2003.
Taxation (US Holders)
This is a summary only of the principal US federal income tax and UK tax consequences of the ownership and
disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs by US Holders (as deﬁned below) who hold their ordinary shares or ADSs
as capital assets. It does not address all aspects of US federal income taxation and does not address aspects
that may be relevant to persons who are subject to special provisions of US federal income tax law, including
US expatriates, insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, ﬁnancial institutions, securities broker-dealers,
traders in securities who elect a mark-to-market method of accounting, persons subject to alternative minimum
tax, investors that directly, indirectly or by attribution own 10% or more of the outstanding share capital or
voting power of BT, persons holding their ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle, hedging transaction or
conversion transaction, persons who acquired their ordinary shares or ADSs pursuant to the exercise of options or
otherwise as compensation, or persons whose functional currency is not the US dollar, amongst others. Those
holders may be subject to US federal income tax consequences different from those set forth below.
For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘US Holder’’ is a beneﬁcial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that, for US
federal income tax purposes, is: an individual citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation (or other
entity taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organised in or under the laws of
the United States or any state thereof, an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation
regardless of its source, or a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the
trust and one or more US persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust. If a partnership
holds ordinary shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner in a partnership that holds ordinary shares or ADSs is
urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding the speciﬁc tax consequences of owning and disposing of the
ordinary shares or ADSs.
In particular, this summary is based on (i) current UK tax law and UK Inland Revenue practice and US law and
US Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) practice, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
Treasury regulations, rulings, judicial decisions and administrative practice, all as currently in effect, (ii) the
United Kingdom–United States Income Tax Convention that entered into force on 25 April 1980 as in effect on
1 January 2003 (the ‘‘1980 Convention’’), (iii) the United Kingdom–United States Convention relating to estate
and gift taxes, and (iv) the new United Kingdom–United States Tax Convention that entered into force on
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 149 Additional information for shareholders 31 March 2003 (the ‘‘New Convention’’), all as in effect on the date of this Annual Report, all of which are
subject to change or changes in interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.
US Holders should be aware that the New Convention generally will have effect in respect of dividends paid
on or after 1 May 2003. However, a US Holder entitled to beneﬁts under the 1980 Convention may elect to have
the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue for an additional twelve months if the election to apply the 1980
Convention would result in greater beneﬁts to the Holder. If a US Holder were to make an effective election,
the discussion below with respect to dividend payments made pursuant to the 1980 Convention would continue
to apply to dividends paid by BT prior to 1 May 2004. The discussion below notes instances where the relevant
provisions of the New Convention will produce a materially different result for a US Holder. US Holders should
note that certain articles in the New Convention limit or restrict the ability of a US Holder to claim beneﬁts under
the New Convention and that similar provisions were not contained in the 1980 Convention.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of the Conventions and the
consequences under UK, US federal, state and local, and other laws, of the ownership and disposition of ordinary
shares or ADSs.
Taxation of dividends
The UK currently does not apply a withholding tax on dividends under its internal tax laws.
For US federal income tax purposes, a distribution (including any additional dividend income arising from a
foreign tax credit claim as described below) will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent paid out
of the current or accumulated earnings and proﬁts, as determined for US tax purposes, based on the US dollar
value of the distribution calculated by reference to the spot rate in effect on the date the distribution is actually
or constructively received by a US Holder of ordinary shares, or by the Depositary, in the case of ADSs.
Distributions by BT in excess of its current and accumulated earnings and proﬁts will be treated ﬁrst as a tax-free
return of capital to the extent of the US Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs, and
thereafter taxable as capital gain. Dividends paid by BT will not be eligible for the US dividends received
deduction.
For dividends paid on or before 5 April 1999, US Holders were generally entitled to receive the cash dividend
plus a Treaty payment from the Inland Revenue of one quarter of the dividend, subject to a UK withholding tax of
15% of the aggregate amount paid. As an example for illustration purposes only, a US Holder who was entitled
to a dividend of £80 was also entitled to a Treaty payment of £20, reduced by the withholding tax of 15% on
the gross amount of £100, i.e. £15, leaving a net cash payment of £85. The full dividend plus the full Treaty
payment including the UK tax withheld was taxable income for US purposes, and the UK tax withheld generally
was available as a US credit or deduction.
For dividends paid on or after 6 April 1999 and subject to the 1980 Convention as described above, the
Treaty payment reduces to one ninth of the dividend (i.e. one tenth of the gross payment). As a result of the UK
withholding tax (which cannot exceed the amount of the hypothetical Treaty payment), US Holders will no longer
receive any Treaty payment. In the above example, the cash dividend would be £80, and the hypothetical Treaty
payment would be £8.89 (one ninth of £80). However, since the UK withholding tax (15% of £88.89), would
exceed the amount of the hypothetical Treaty payment, no Treaty payment will be made and the US Holder will
receive only the cash dividend (here, £80). A US Holder will be taxable in the US on the full dividend and full
hypothetical Treaty payment (£88.89), and will be treated as having paid a foreign tax equal to the hypothetical
Treaty payment (here, £8.89). The effect on each US Holder will depend on circumstances that are particular to
that Holder.
The foreign tax deemed paid generally will be available as a US credit or deduction. A US Holder could elect
to receive a foreign tax credit or deduction with respect to any UK withholding tax on IRS Form 8833 (Treaty-
Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701(b)). For purposes of calculating the foreign tax
credit, dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as income from sources outside the United
States and generally will constitute ‘‘passive income’’ or, for certain Holders, ‘‘ﬁnancial services income’’. The
rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit are very complex. US Holders who do not elect to
claim a credit with respect to any foreign taxes paid in a given taxable year may instead claim a deduction for
foreign taxes paid. A deduction does not reduce US federal income tax on a dollar for dollar basis like a tax
credit. The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign credits.
There will be no hypothetical Treaty payment and no notional UK withholding tax applied to a dividend
payment made under the New Convention. Therefore, it will not be possible for US Holders to claim a foreign tax
credit in respect of any dividend payment made by BT on or after 1 May 2003 (or 1 May 2004 in the case of a
US Holder who effectively elects to extend the applicability of the 1980 Convention as described above).
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether the US Holder is eligible for beneﬁts
under the 1980 Convention and the New Convention, whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be
available with respect to dividends received from BT, whether it may be advisable in light of the Holder’s
particular circumstances to elect to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue in force until 1 May
2004, and the treatment of any foreign currency gain or loss on any pounds sterling received with respect to
ordinary shares that are not converted into US dollars on the date the pounds sterling are actually or
constructively received.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 150 Additional information for shareholders Recent US tax law changes applicable to individuals
Under 2003 US tax legislation, some US Holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of US
federal income tax (currently a maximum of 15%) in respect of ‘‘qualiﬁed dividend income’’ received in taxable
years beginning after 31 December 2002 and beginning before 1 January 2009. For this purpose, qualiﬁed
dividend income generally includes dividends paid by non-US corporations if, among other things, certain
minimum holding periods are met and either (i) the shares (or ADSs) with respect to which the dividend has been
paid are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the United States, or (ii) the non-US corporation
is eligible for the beneﬁts of a comprehensive US income tax treaty (such as both Conventions) which provides for
the exchange of information. BT currently believes that dividends paid with respect to its ordinary shares and
ADSs will constitute qualiﬁed dividend income for US federal income tax purposes, provided the individual US
Holders of its ordinary shares and ADSs meet certain requirements. Some of the eligibility requirements for non-
US corporations are not entirely certain, however, and further guidance from the IRS is anticipated. In addition,
the IRS is expected to issue certiﬁcation procedures in 2004 whereby a non-US corporation will be required to
certify as to the eligibility of its dividends for the reduced US federal income tax rates.
Taxation of capital gains
Unless a US resident carries on a trade through a branch or agency in the UK, and the disposal of ordinary shares
and/or ADSs is related to the activities of that trade, UK capital gains tax is not charged on US residents who
dispose of ordinary shares and/or ADSs.
For US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder generally will recognise capital gain or loss on the sale or
other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value
of the amount realised on the disposition and the US Holder’s adjusted tax basis (determined in US dollars)
in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Such gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss, and will be treated
as long-term capital gain or loss if the ordinary shares have been held for more than one year at the time
of disposition. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to signiﬁcant limitations. Capital gains recognised by
an individual US Holder generally are subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates if speciﬁed holdings
periods are met.
Passive foreign investment company status
A non-US corporation will be classiﬁed as a Passive Foreign Investment Company (a ‘‘PFIC’’) for any taxable year
if at least 75% of its gross income consists of passive income or at least 50% of the average value of its assets
consist of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. BT currently believes that it did
not qualify as a PFIC for the taxable year ending 31 March 2004 for US federal income tax purposes. If BT were
to become a PFIC for any taxable year, US Holders would suffer adverse tax consequences. These consequences
may include having gains realised on the disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs treated as ordinary income rather
than capital gains and being subject to punitive interest charges on certain dividends and on the proceeds of the
sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs. Furthermore, dividends paid by BT would not be
‘‘qualiﬁed dividend income’’ and would be subject to the higher rates applicable to other items of ordinary
income. US Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules
to BT.
US information reporting and backup withholding
Dividends paid on and proceeds received from the sale or disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject
to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a current rate of 28%. Certain exempt recipients
(such as corporations) are not subject to these information reporting requirements. Backup withholding will not
apply, however, to a Holder who provides a correct taxpayer identiﬁcation number or certiﬁcate of foreign status
and makes any other required certiﬁcation or who is otherwise exempt. US persons who are required to establish
their exempt status generally must furnish IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identiﬁcation Number and
Certiﬁcation). Non-US Holders generally will not be subject to US information reporting or backup withholding.
However, such Holders may be required to provide certiﬁcation of non-US status in connection with payments
received in the United States or through certain US-related ﬁnancial intermediaries.
Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a Holder’s US federal income tax liability.
A Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely ﬁling
the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.
UK stamp duty
A transfer of an ordinary share will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5%
of the amount or value of any consideration provided. A transfer of an ordinary share into a clearance service
or American depository system gives rise to a 1.5% charge of either the amount of the consideration provided
or the value of the share issued. No UK stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of an ADS (assuming it is not
registered in the UK), provided that the transfer documents are executed and always retained outside the UK.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 151 Additional information for shareholders UK inheritance and gift taxes in connection with ordinary shares and/or ADSs
Where an individual holder, who is not a UK national, of ordinary shares and/or ADSs falls within the scope
of the UK/US Estate and Gift Tax Convention, US-domiciled holders of ordinary shares and/or ADSs will not
generally be subject to UK inheritance tax on a gift of ordinary shares and/or ADSs if the gift is subject to US
federal gift tax. Similarly, ordinary shares and/or ADSs passing on the death of a US-domiciled shareholder, who
is not a UK national, will not generally be subject to UK inheritance tax if the estate is subject to US estate tax.
The rules and scope of domicile are complex and action should not be taken without advice speciﬁc to the
individual’s circumstances.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders
There are currently no government laws, decrees or regulations in the United Kingdom that restrict the export
or import of capital, including, but not limited to, UK foreign exchange control restrictions, or that affect
the remittances of dividends or other payments to non-resident holders of the company’s ordinary shares, except
as otherwise described in Taxation (US Holders) above. There are no limitations under the laws of the United
Kingdom restricting the right of non-residents to hold or to vote shares in the company.
