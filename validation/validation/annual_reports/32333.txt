 The Group uses adjusted operating profit, EBITDA, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share as its primary 
performance measures. These are non-IFRS measures which exclude the impact of the amortisation of acquisition intangible assets 
(FY17: £14.1m, FY16: £10.4m). Acquisition intangible assets principally arise as a result of the past actions of the former owners of 
businesses in respect of marketing and business development activity. Therefore, the adjusted measures reflect the post acquisition 
revenue attributable to, and operating costs incurred by, the Group.  A reconciliation between the adjusted and statutory equivalent is 
included in the Financial review. Overview

Finally, opening new countries, via a joint 
venture, remains a key priority and we have 
made good progress in FY17, with discussions 
in progress with multiple prospects.  
Dividend 
Given the Group’s performance this year 
and the Board’s confidence in its future 
prospects, the Board is proposing an increase 
in the final dividend to 11.2p a share, bringing 
the total ordinary dividend for the year to 
15.3p (FY16: 12.7p), an increase of 24%, which 
is 1.76x covered by the FY17 adjusted earnings 
per share compared to 1.72x in FY16. 
Board changes
During the year David Bower was appointed 
as Chief Financial Officer and Johnathan 
Ford as Chief Operating Officer. We have 
also strengthened the Board with the 
appointment of three new Directors with 
effect from 23 May 2017. Tom Rusin has 
been appointed as an Executive Director 
and Katrina Cliffe and Edward Fitzmaurice 
have both been appointed as Non-Executive 
Directors. Katrina will also join the Audit 
& Risk Committee. Tom has been Chief 
Executive Officer of HomeServe USA since 
July 2011 and is currently a member of the 
HomeServe plc Executive Committee. 
People 
HomeServe’s success is driven by the 
commitment of its people. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank all our people for 
their contribution to another set of very good 
results.

Chairman 
23 May 2017
Chairman’s statement
I am delighted that the Group had 
another very good year delivering 
customer and profit growth, with 
continued investment to deliver our 
strategy. We have a clear vision “to 
be the world’s most trusted provider 
of home repairs and improvements” 
and we have agreed the strategic 
priorities (see page 12 for our 
strategic framework) to ensure we 
achieve it. 
There are four areas of progress in the 
year that I would like to specifically 
address in this statement. 
Firstly, the rate of progress in North 
America has been very positive. Through 
the strength of the existing business, 
enhanced with the acquisition of Utility 
Service Partners we have achieved the 
3m customer milestone and 50m affinity 
partner households – great progress 
toward our 80m household target. 
Secondly, the strength of affinity 
partnerships is the bedrock of our 
business and I am delighted with the 
launch of Aviva Response in the UK and 
the new joint venture with Edison Energia 
in Italy. Digital marketing is already live 
with both partners, a demonstration of 
our mutual commitment.
At the Capital Markets Day in June 
last year, we said we wanted to offer 
a compelling on demand service to 
homeowners. We have accelerated  
our plans with the investment in 
Checkatrade in the UK and the  
acquisition of Habitissimo in Spain.

Chief Executive’s review
HomeServe has had another very 
good year with strong underlying 
performance enhanced by foreign 
exchange tailwinds. Affinity partner 
households increased by 10m to 
102m, with a significant increase in 
North America. This is in addition 
to 11% Group customer growth, 
with customer numbers now at 
7.8m. Statutory operating profit was 
up 20% to £104.7m, and adjusted 
operating profit increased 22% to 
£118.8m, both included a £10.3m 
foreign exchange benefit.  
A solid performance in the UK delivered 
over half of the Group’s operating profit, 
while we also continued to invest in new 
partnerships, network capability, LeakBot 
and heating services. 
The business in North America had 
a transformational year, completing 
the acquisition and integration of 
Utility Service Partners Inc. (USP) 
while continuing to sign new partners 
organically. As a result, we made rapid 
progress towards the targeted 80m 
affinity partner households, where 18m 
households were added during FY17, 
taking total access to 50m households. 
Organic customer growth was 10% and, 
together with USP, customer numbers 
increased to 3.0m, up 28% on the prior 
year. 
We have seen good customer growth 
and profit progression in our established 
businesses in France and Spain with 
customer numbers increasing 4% to  
1.0m and 7% to 1.3m respectively. The 
Group retention rate was strong at 82% 
(FY16: 83%).
We invested £6.0m in the New Markets 
segment, as planned (FY16: £5.9m). Our 
Italian business established a joint venture 
with Edison Energia and we progressed 
our expansion into new countries and 
development of an online on demand 
home repair and improvement offering  
– our “Home Experts” platform. 
Our investment in Checkatrade and 
acquisition of Habitissimo are a major 
step forward and position us at the fore  
of the online revolution we are seeing  
in home services. The Home Experts 
online platform will connect a wider 
consumer demographic to a broader 
range of expert tradespeople. 9

Our business model
Value added
We secure long-term affinity partnerships 
with global brands that are relevant to our 
home assistance and improvement products. 
Our partnerships include utilities, heating 
manufacturers and specialist service providers. 
Our home assistance products are underwritten 
by third party underwriters, independent 
of HomeServe. We act as an insurance 
intermediary and do not take any material 
insurance risk.
Our local call centres are available to handle 
customers’ claims and our extensive network 
of engineers and Home Experts are on hand 
to solve our customers’ home assistance, 
repairs, improvements and installations 
problems throughout the year. We achieve 
this by engaging great people in all of our 
businesses and providing them with the best 
technology and systems to do a great job.

Value added
Customers pay an annual premium for their  
home assistance products which funds the  
product underwriting, partner commission  
payments, and other direct and indirect costs of  
providing the service. Typically, on completing a  
customer claim the underwriter funds the job cost.  
We invest in business development and marketing  
to deliver future customer growth. As the Home Experts  
platform is developed, the customer will pay a price for 
each job through a digital platform. Home Experts will pay a 
recurring fee for using the platform.  
Our range of comprehensive water, heating and  
electrical-related home assistance and repair products 
provide peace of mind to our customers. Our  
developing Home Experts on demand services  
offer home improvements and installations. Ongoing 
innovation ensures we are at the forefront of the  
smart home movement with smart thermostat  
and our water leak detector. We use our  
expertise in data analytics to optimise our  
direct marketing across a number of channels,  
including direct mail, call centres, and  
digital channels.

Our strategic framework 
Strategic priority Progress in FY17
Investing to deliver great  
customer service 
Great customer service results in increased 
customer loyalty and higher levels of retention. 
Our market-leading customer service is delivered 
by the hard work and dedication of all our people.
Customers are moving to more online 
interactions and we are developing our 
technology to address this.
Extend long-term  
affinity partnerships  
HomeServe is built on developing long-term 
affinity partnerships with brands that complement 
our home assistance products. We work with 
over 500 affinity partners and invest in business 
development to establish and expand new 
partnerships. 
During FY17, rapid progress was made through 
signing 100 new partners in North America; 
renewing a significant partnership in the UK; and 
signing a joint venture with Edison Energia in Italy.
During FY17, HomeServe completed a job every 
14 seconds, demonstrating our commitment to 
our customers when they need us most. Globally, 
HomeServe has been recognised for customer 
service excellence and in FY17 won a number of 
customer service and employee engagement 
awards in the UK, North America and France. 
We continued to invest in our core customer 
system to ensure our call centres can have good 
conversations with our customers. The investment 
in our claims and deployment systems ensures our 
engineers can get to our customers at their time 
of need. 
Expanding New Markets 
Driving relentless innovation 
We offer a range of insured home assistance 
products covering plumbing, heating and 
electrical services and continually innovate to 
align our product range to changing customer 
preferences. Demand for digital engagement at 
every stage of the customer journey continues, 
while more customers seek “smart home” 
products to enhance their experience.
Entering new geographies 
Utilities around the world recognise that providing 
home assistance services is proven to increase 
customer loyalty and drive higher retention rates 
in their core energy businesses.
Developing a digital on demand service  
In line with our ambition to offer a complete 
home repair and improvement service to 
a broader customer demographic we are 
developing our on-demand offering. 
 
During the year we launched LeakBot, a smart 
home water leak detector that enables early 
leak detection preventing or limiting damage to 
customers’ homes. We have test relationships 
with Aviva and RSA with promising results. We are 
developing a heating installation business.
During FY17, HomeServe’s Italian business agreed a 
joint venture with Edison Energia. We are prospecting 
in a number of countries and intend to form joint 
ventures with utilities, replicating our success with 
South Staffordshire Water in the UK and Veolia in 
France. 
We have started to develop an online platform 
offering on demand services, which we call Home 
Experts. As part of this development, we purchased 
a 40% stake in Checkatrade (UK), and acquired a 
70% interest in Habitissimo (Spain). Combined, 
these businesses bring over 45,000 approved local 
tradesmen to our network. 13

customer service to all of our customers – a result 
of the hard work of our engaged people. 
We will continue to invest in the testing and 
roll our of LeakBot and our heating installation 
services.
We will continue to progress our international 
development plans and developing our on

We will roll out the core customer system and 
replace the claims handling and job deployment 
systems in the UK and improve the claims 
management systems in Spain and North America. 
We will continue to introduce self-serve functionality 
to meet customers’ expectations.

international development.  15
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The Group uses adjusted operating 
profit, EBITDA, adjusted profit before tax 
and adjusted earnings per share as its 
primary performance measures. These 
are non-IFRS measures which exclude the 
impact of the amortisation of acquisition 
intangible assets (FY17: £14.1m, FY16: 
£10.4m). Acquisition intangible assets 
principally arise as a result of the 
past actions of the former owners of 
businesses in respect of marketing and 
business development activity. Therefore, 
the adjusted measures reflect the post 
acquisition revenue attributable to, and 
operating costs incurred by, the Group. 
A reconciliation between the adjusted 
and statutory equivalent is included in the 
Financial review.
As at 31 March 2017, the net book value 
of the acquisition intangible asset was 
£114.0m (FY16: £75.3m) and the related 
amortisation charge in FY17 was £14.1m 
(FY16: £10.4m).

cover for heating, plumbing, electrics 
and security. This exciting opportunity 
enables HomeServe to market heating-led 
products under the widely-recognised 
Aviva brand.
Our multi-channel marketing activity 
added 0.4m gross new customers in the 
year (FY16: 0.4m) and we are pleased that 
new customers joining us do so on fuller 
products, enjoying the benefits of higher 
usage and increasing our average net 
income per customer. 
The policy retention rate was good at 80% 
(FY16: 82%) with more Year 1 customers 
choosing to renew with us than in the 
prior year.  New customers typically enrol 
on an introductory offer and so we expect 
our policy retention rate in year 1 to be 
lower than subsequent years. Customer 
retention also continues to perform well, 
with the overall rate maintained at 82% 
(FY16: 82%).
The strength of our affinity 
partnerships and continued investment 
in networks, heating services and 
product innovation, provided the base 
for a solid and profitable performance 
in FY17 and ensures good medium-
term prospects. Staff engagement 
remains high and is continuing to drive 
high levels of customer service and 
satisfaction. 
Operational performance 
Through affinity partner relationships, 
HomeServe offers home assistance 
products, under a utility brand, to around 
90% of the addressable UK market. One 
of our largest affinity partnerships was 
successfully renewed in the year and 
we were also pleased to sign a new 
partnership in July 2016 with Dee Valley 
Water, which provides water services to 
over 250,000 customers. 
In February, our partnership with Aviva, 
the UK’s largest general insurer, was 
expanded as we jointly launched Aviva 
Home Response, a range of products, 
powered by HomeServe and sold through 
Aviva’s marketing channels, offering 
• Solid performance with 2.2m customers 
• Expanded partnership with Aviva, launching a range of new home assistance 
products
• Strengthened heating capability with the acquisition of npower’s service 
contracts business
• Voted 3rd on Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work, with a highly-engaged and 
focused team 18
In February 2017, we were recognised 
by the Institute of Customer Service as 
the only company to have consistently 
improved customer service since January 
2014. Our satisfaction rating of 79.9 
placed us in the top three UK “Services” 
companies for customer satisfaction  
in 2017.
This great customer service is due to the 
hard work and dedication of our people 
across all areas of the business, so we were 
delighted to receive the accolade of 3rd on 
Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work in 2017. 
Our investment in innovation resulted 
in the launch of LeakBot, a smart home 
water leak detector that enables early 
leak detection, preventing or limiting 
damage to customers’ homes. The 
product appeals to the home insurance 
market, with escape of water the biggest 
expense incurred by home insurers. We 
have launched tests with home insurers 
including Aviva and, more recently, RSA 
and its More Than brand. Results are 
encouraging and support our focus on 
innovation.
We continue to invest in our network of 
contractors and engineers and during 
December 2016 we extended the directly-
employed heating network with the 
acquisition of npower’s ‘domestic care and 
maintenance’ contracts business together 
with its 76 heating engineers. Combined 
with our plumbing engineers and the 
successful integration of the Home Energy 
Services Limited (HESL) business that 
was acquired in FY16, our network now 
comprises over 850 directly-employed 
engineers, up from 700 last year.
Our heating business previously focused 
on boiler repairs and services; but we have 
now expanded our services to include 
boiler and smart thermostat installations. 
Although early days, this installation 
business is growing month-on-month 
and we aim to expand it nationally, 
through both organic growth and further 
appropriate bolt-on opportunities.
During the year, we completed 0.9m 
jobs, up from 0.7m in the prior year while 
still retaining high levels of customer 
service. Internally we measure customer 
satisfaction at different contact points 
along the customer journey (e.g. when 
the customer buys the policy / when 
the customer makes a claim), and this 
increased in the year. Our ratings on 
TrustPilot (the leading third party review 
provider in the UK) and Reevoo (an 
independent customer ratings provider) 
remain high at 8.3 and 93% (FY16: 8.3 and 
93%) respectively.

Strategic report Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Financial performance 
Revenue in the year was 12% higher than 
the prior year at £326.5m (FY16: £291.8m), 
principally reflecting an increase in net 
policy income and repair network revenue. 
Net policy income benefited from a 
slightly higher number of customers and 
higher income from each customer. Net 
income per customer was up £2 to £96, 
reflecting the mix of customers holding 
fuller cover products, and we expect 
further progression in net income per 
customer in FY18.
Repair network revenue increased by 23% 
to £100.3m (FY16: £81.0m), reflecting an 
increase in the number of jobs completed. 
Other income of £12.8m (FY16: £10.6m) 
includes transactions with other Group 
companies, on demand repairs, smart 
thermostat and boiler installations. 
Adjusted operating costs increased 13% to 
£263.3m (FY16: £233.8m), reflecting the 
first full year of ownership of HESL and 
the integration of the engineer network 
of npower’s service contracts business. 
Adjusted operating margin was 19% (FY16: 
20%), principally due to the increase in 
repair revenue. With continued high levels 
of repair revenue, we expect margins to 
remain at this level going forward. 
  
Technology plays an increasingly 
important role in how we operate and in 
our interaction with customers. We are 
investing in upgrading our technology 
and are pleased with the implementation 
of our new Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) system, which will be 
rolled out during FY18. The system is in 
live test with a small number of customer 
records, where agents are now presented 
with a single view of the customer, a 
system generated “next best customer 
action” and more intuitive screens. This is 
leading to better conversations between 
our agents and customers, and is expected 
to drive sales and efficiency benefits in 
the medium term. We are also investing in 
our extended network of engineers and 
plan to upgrade our claims management 
and deployment systems to deliver further 
operational efficiencies.  North America

our approach for these prospects with 
a resulting increase in the number 
of municipals signed in the year. The 
operational integration of USP is largely 
complete and we are pleased to have 
retained the Canonsburg facility together 
with key personnel.
Our acquisition of USP advanced our 
expansion into Canada, a country with 
13m households, and offers further 
good growth prospects for our business. 
USP made a strategic investment in 
Canada working with the Association 
of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO), an 
endorsing partner across Canada’s largest 
province. We have started marketing in 
Ontario, and now have 30 partnerships in 
this region. 
We now offer our products to 50m 
utility households (FY16: 32m) and we 
are confident of reaching our stated goal 
of 80m utility households across North 
America. During the year, we signed 100 
new utility partnerships and entered into a 
relationship with the American Public Gas 
Association (APGA) which is an endorsing 
body that works with 700 municipal gas 
distributors across the USA.  
This was a transformational year for 
HomeServe in North America, with 
good underlying organic growth 
enhanced by the acquisition of Utility 
Service Partners Inc. (USP). We have 
achieved the milestone of 3.0m 
customers, added 100 new partners 
and reached 50m affinity partner 
households, making good progress 
towards our 80m household target.
Operational performance 
North America achieved record partner 
signings, increase in households and 
gross new customers. We delivered a 50% 
increase in adjusted operating profit to 
$26.2m, driven by the continued success 
of our underlying business. 
On 1 July 2016, we completed the 
acquisition of USP, a leading provider 
of home assistance services, for a net 
cash outflow of $72.6m (£54.5m). Like 
our existing business, USP operates an 
affinity partner model and it is also the 
exclusive home warranty partner of 
the National League of Cities (NLC), an 
organisation that advocates to around 
19,000 towns and cities, covering 66m 
municipal households in the USA. The NLC 
relationship is a strong endorsement with 
smaller municipals. We have streamlined 
• Rapid progress adding 18m affinity partner households to reach 50m
• Record new partner signings adding 100 partners 
• Significant customer growth up 28% to 3.0m
• Integration of USP on track to deliver $15m EBITDA in FY18. Strategic report

marketing, with a 55% increase in the 
number of new customers joining

(FY16: 82%). 
Good customer service is central to 
the business and we have invested in 
technology across the claims process to 
improve the customer journey. We now 
deploy over 80% of all contractor jobs 
directly to technician’s mobile devices. 
Going forward we expect to make further 
investment in claims technology to 
enhance the customer experience and to 
drive operational efficiency. 
Our network of 151 directly-employed 
engineers (FY16: 152) and almost 1,100 
sub-contractors (FY16: 1,000) carried out 
Our strategic plan is focused on our core 
policy business – developing, marketing 
and selling policies in partnership with 
utilities, municipals and membership 
organisations. We have invested in building 
an experienced business development 
capability, focused on driving new 
partnership signings. Our pipeline of 
potential partner opportunities is strong, 
with negotiations at all stages of the 
process. 
Customer numbers increased 28% 
to 3.0m customers (FY16: 2.3m), with 
0.4m customers acquired with the USP 
acquisition and a further 0.8m gross new 
customers added during the year (FY16:

most significant marketing channel, with 
continued progress in sales through our 
partner channels. We re-launched our

Adjusted operating costs in North 
America were $266.8m (FY16: $210.9m), 
up 26% on the prior year, due principally 
to continued investment in business 
development, marketing and the impact 
of USP. USP incurred a loss of $0.9m in 
the period post acquisition reflecting 
related transaction and integration costs. 
We continue to expect USP to add $15m 
incremental EBITDA in FY18, our first full 
year of ownership. Adjusted operating 
profit increased 50% to $26.2m, resulting 
in an adjusted operating margin of 9%, up 
from 8% in FY16. We remain confident of 
a longer-term adjusted operating profit 
margin of 20%.
 
0.4m jobs during the year (FY16: 0.4m).  
In line with our strategy, we have 
progressed our HVAC (heating, ventilation 
and air conditioning) installation business, 
with a 15% increase in the number of  
units installed in FY17 compared to the 
prior year. 
We were delighted to win a recognised 
‘Top Places to Work’ award for the third 
year in a row together with a Grand Stevie 
Award for our high levels of customer 
satisfaction.
Financial performance 
Revenue was up 28% to $293.0m  
(FY16: $228.4m), driven by a 30% increase 
in policy income, reflecting an increase 
in renewal income and $27.7m post-
acquisition revenue from USP. Our 
growing installation volumes are reflected 
in the 12% increase in other income to 
$19.5m (FY16: $17.4m).
Income per customer was up 7% to $97 
(FY16: $91), principally reflecting the higher 
proportion of renewals and a reduced 
cost to serve as we realised operational 
efficiencies in our network. Income per 
customer excludes USP customers who 
have yet to go through a full renewal cycle 
with HomeServe. Typically income per 
customer is lower in USP, reflecting the 
product mix, and as a result we expect to 
see a small reduction in net income per 
customer in FY18. €million 2017 2016 Change

Our business development team has 
a good pipeline of partner prospects, 
with some initial testing in progress. We 
have also signed a new partnership with 
SARP, part of the Veolia Group, to offer a 
new plumbing, drainage and septic tank 
product to its 0.6m customers. 
We have enhanced the digital functionality 
across the customer journey from sale 
through to claim, which we believe has 
improved our relationship with both 
customers and contractors. We were 
proud to win a nationally-renowned 
award - Service Client de l’Annee 2017, 
Home Services sector - for the first 
time, reflecting our focus on delivering 
exceptional customer service.
All our repairs in France are completed 
by our network of over 900 contractors 
(FY16: 700). We now deploy over 50% of 
jobs direct to contractors’ mobile devices 
driving improved customer service, 
operational efficiencies and an enhanced 
relationship with these contractors. 
 
HomeServe France demonstrated a 
solid performance this year via its 
two major partnerships with Veolia 
and Suez, while continuing to invest 
in business development, product 
development and digital initiatives.
Operational performance 
Our strong partnership with Veolia, 
France’s largest water provider, continues 
to deliver customer growth and during the 
year we saw an increase in the number of 
customers joining through Veolia’s own 
sales channels. We continue to develop 
our relationship with Suez (formerly 
Lyonnaise des Eaux), which offers 
HomeServe products through its sales 
channel, and accounted for a third of all 
new sales during the year.
Across all of our marketing channels we 
added 0.2m gross new customers (FY16: 
0.2m). This sales activity combined with a 
continued strong retention performance at 
89% (FY16: 89%) resulted in a 4% increase 
in customer numbers to 1.0m (FY16: 1.0m). 
• Good sales momentum delivered a 4% increase in customer numbers  
to 1.0m
• Outstanding customer loyalty reflected in 89% retention rate, the highest  
in the Group
• Maintained strong adjusted operating profit margin of 30%. Strategic report

Financial performance 
Total revenue increased 2% to €107.4m 
(FY16: €105.0m), principally reflecting an 
increase in renewal income generated 
by Suez. Adjusted operating costs were 
up 3% to €75.9m (FY16: €73.6m), due to 
an increase in amortisation and further 
investment in business and product 
development. In line with the prior  
year, income per customer was €101  
(FY16: €101).
Chief Executive’s review (continued)
In accordance with Group policy, where 
a partner originates customers on our 
behalf, the cost of acquisition is capitalised, 
held as an intangible asset and amortised 
as an operating expense. During FY17, 
we paid €3.0m (FY16: €4.2m) in respect 
of customers acquired by Suez, and as 
at March 2017, the net book value of the 
intangible asset was €5.9m (FY16: €4.3m). 
The associated amortisation during the 
year was €1.0m (FY16: €0.4m).
Adjusted operating profit increased to 
€31.5m, (FY16: €31.4m), maintaining a 
strong adjusted operating margin of 30%

This year our Spanish business, 
Reparalia, rebranded as HomeServe 
Spain. We have achieved good growth 
in both our Membership and Claims 
businesses as we saw confidence 
returning to the Spanish market.  
Performance in the claims handling 
business was particularly strong, as we 
continued to gain market share and 
increased claims volumes across our 
third-party insurance network.  
Operational performance 
Endesa, our largest partner in Spain, 
continued to successfully offer our 
products through its sales channels and 
this will continue throughout FY18. We 
were unable to make the progress we 
wanted with Agbar, a water utility with 3m 
households and so, following a period of 
limited marketing activity, we agreed to 
end the partnership and removed it from 
our affinity partner household count. 
We have retained the 39,000 customers 
previously acquired and will look to renew 
them under our brand going forward. Our 
business development team is in active 
discussions with other potential partners. 
Customer numbers increased 7% to 1.3m, 
reflecting continued good sales and 
retention. During the year, we developed 
new products to appeal to a broader 
market, including water products and 
“Tech Angel”, a 24/7 home technology 
support product, which has been well 
received. Retention in the year was 78%, 
marginally higher than the prior year  
(FY16: 77%). 
Our claims business works with 16 Spanish 
insurance companies managing home 
insurance claims across 26 trades. During 
the year it completed 19% more jobs 
than in the prior year, closing a record 
0.8m jobs (FY16: 0.7m), which reflects 
an increase in our market share together 
with our diversification into new channels. 
Our network comprises over 2,000 sub-
contractors and 197 franchised engineers. 
• Continued customer growth, up 7% to 1.3m
• Strong adjusted operating profit growth, up 13% to €15.8m
• Record number of jobs completed – up 19% across the network. Strategic report

 In line with our ambition to offer our 
services to more homeowners, we are 
developing a compelling online on 
demand service which we are calling 
Home Experts. This platform will 
connect customers to a range of expert 
tradespeople, enabling an end-to-end 
digital experience. 
Our investment in Checkatrade, which is 
treated as an associate and acquisition of 
Habitissimo, which is fully consolidated, 
will accelerate the development of 
this proposition. Both businesses are 
established market leaders in home repairs 
and improvements. Combined, they have 
45,000 local Home Experts carrying out 
an estimated £3.5 billion of home repairs 
and improvements annually. 
Checkatrade is the UK’s most recognised 
and trusted online directory of high-
quality, customer-recommended 
tradespeople with nearly 1m unique 
customer visits a month, resulting in 
approximately 1.3m jobs per annum.  
Our recent research indicates that around 
50% of consumers go online to find a 
tradesman and of these, around 47% go 
directly to Checkatrade, making it a market 
leader in online home services. 
Our New Markets segment comprises 
our business in Italy, investment in 
innovation and digital initiatives, 
together with international 
development. 
In Italy, we have 0.3m customers acquired 
through a test agreement with Enel. There 
continues to be good customer demand 
for our products but due to a change in 
Enel’s approach to home services, the 
test agreement was not extended. During 
March 2017, we established a joint venture 
with Edison Energia, Italy’s third-largest 
energy supplier and a member of the EDF 
Group, through its purchase of 51% of our 
Italian business (we retain a 49% share). 
We have commenced marketing a range 
of home assistance products, principally 
through Edison Energia’s sales channels, 
including television advertising. 
We continue to progress our international 
development plans where we are targeting 
multiple countries under our preferred 
joint venture model. 
We have invested in technology to drive 
enhanced performance across the Group. 
Consistent platforms across all of our 
businesses will deliver more effective 
product sales and efficiencies. During the 
year, we launched new customer-facing 
websites in the USA, France and Spain.

Outlook
All our businesses are performing well and 
have good prospects.  Looking ahead, 
we expect further strong growth in FY18, 
principally driven by our rapidly-expanding 
business in North America. This reflects 
the increase in customer numbers, 
combined with the benefit of the USP

around $15m EBITDA this coming year.
We are excited about the future for all of

Based in Mallorca, Habitissimo receives 
more than 3.6 million unique customer 
visits a month, resulting in approximately 
0.25m jobs a year across four countries in 
Europe (Spain, Portugal, Italy and France), 
and also in Latin America. 
Financial performance 
Reported revenue was £16.6m, down 
£3.5m compared to the prior year 
(FY16: £20.1m), reflecting a reduction in 
customers due to the cessation of activity 
with Enel in June 2016. Following the 
formation of a joint venture with Edison 
Energia in March 2017, our business in 
Italy is treated as an associate and going 
forward we will not report annual revenue 
in respect of this business.
Our investment in New Markets resulted in 
a loss of £6.0m (FY16: £5.9m). We expect 
a similar level of investment in FY18, 
covering our continued investment in Italy, 
innovation and digital initiatives, together 
with international development.

Financial review (continued)
Tax charge and effective tax rate
The Group’s tax charge in the financial 
year was £23.9m (FY16: £21.0m). The 
corporate income tax rates in the 
overseas countries in which we operate 
are currently higher than the  
UK corporate income tax rate of 20% 
(FY16: 20%), i.e. the US at 40% (FY16: 40%), 
France at 33% (FY16: 33%), Spain at 25% 
(FY16: 27%) and Italy at 28% (FY16: 28%). 
The UK corporation tax rate is 19% in FY18 
and expected to remain at this level in 
FY19 and FY20, with a further reduction 
to 17% in FY21 onwards. To the extent our 
profits are more weighted towards our 
overseas countries we would expect the 
effective tax rate of 24% (FY16: 25%) to 
increase in future years.
Cash flow and financing
Our business model continues to 
be highly cash generative with cash 
generated by operations in FY17 
amounting to £139.9m (FY16: £121.7m), 
representing a cash conversion ratio 
against adjusted operating profit of 118% 
(FY16: 125%). 
Working capital increased by £21.1m in 
FY17 reflecting continued growth in all 
of our businesses. As the business grows 
further, we expect additional working 
capital absorption, though we continue to 
expect the cash conversion ratio to be in 
excess of 100%. 
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles
The amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles of £14.1m (FY16: £10.4m) 
relates to customer and other contracts, 
held by businesses, which were acquired 
as part of business combinations and has 
increased this year principally due to the 
acquisition of USP in July 2016, where 
£34.8m acquired intangible assets were 
identified.
Tax strategy 
The Group has a tax strategy that was 
approved by the Board during the year 
and which reflects our status as a plc, 
which requires strong governance and 
consideration of our reputation. Our tax 
strategy also reflects the regulated nature 
of our business which requires further 
compliance with local laws, regulations 
and guidance. We made the UK elements 
of our tax strategy document publicly 
available in April 2017 as required by  
UK legislation. 
Our Group tax strategy covers the 
following matters: (i) how we maintain 
ongoing application of tax governance 
with strong internal controls in order to 
substantially reduce tax risk to materially 
acceptable levels; (ii) how we will not 
engage in artificial transactions the sole 
purpose of which is to reduce tax; (iii) our 
strategic aim to maintain the Group’s low 
UK tax risk rating as determined by the 
UK Tax Authorities Business Risk Review 
process; and (iv) to continue to work with

contingent consideration of £4.0m that is 
payable subject to financial performance 
conditions being met by the business, the 
present value of which is £2.7m. There 
were also legal costs associated with the 
transaction that were added to the cost of 
the investment amounting to £0.7m.
On 9 March 2017 the Group disposed 
of 51% of Assistenza Casa Srl, a wholly 
owned Group company. The remaining 
49% has been accounted for as an 
associate using the equity method. The 
Group realised a gain of £0.1m as a result 
of this transaction.
Acquisitions
The Group has incurred a net cash 
outflow in respect of business 
combinations of £74.2m in the year.
There were three material acquisitions in 
the year ended 31 March 2017.
On 1 July 2016 Homeserve USA Corp, a 
Group company, acquired 100% of the 
issued share capital and obtained control 
of Utility Service Partners Inc (USP). 
On 1 December 2016 HomeServe 
Membership Limited, a Group company, 
purchased npower’s ‘domestic care and 
maintenance’ contracts business. The 
acquisition included 76 heating engineers.
On 27 January 2017 HomeServe 
International Limited, a Group company, 
acquired 70% of the issued share capital 
and obtained control of Habitissimo S.L., a 
specialist online lead generation business 
operating across Southern Europe and 
South America.
During the year, we invested capital 
expenditure of £58.5m (FY16: £63.7m), 
which was £6.5m lower than planned 
principally due to the timing of partner 
payments, which we now expect to 
incur in FY18. Expenditure during FY17 
included partner payments of £14.1m 
(FY16: £17.9m) in respect of the acquisition 
of customers that Endesa and Suez 
originated and payments to certain US 
partners. 
Technology plays an increasingly 
important role throughout our business. 
We have continued to invest in the 
replacement of our core customer 
system, together with normal investment, 
principally technology-related, across all 
the businesses. As we roll out the core 
customer system in FY18, we are also 
planning to replace the claims handling 
and job deployment systems in the UK, 
improve the claims management systems 
in Spain and North America, while also 
investing in the development of our 
Home Experts platform. We expect these 
investments will make us more efficient, 
improve our customer service and will 
be an ‘enabler’ for our online on demand 
business. As a result of these investments, 
together with ongoing partner payments, 
we expect capital expenditure to be 
around £70m in FY18. Going forward we 
expect capital expenditure to normalise at 
around £35m.
Investment in associates
On 13 December 2016 the Group 
acquired a 40% stake in Sherrington 
Mews Limited, the holding company 
of the Checkatrade Group, for cash 
consideration of £24.0m. There is further  39
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
In the prior year, in July 2015, a special 
dividend of £99.4m was also paid to 
shareholders, which was followed by a 
share consolidation. 
Net debt and finance costs
The Group targets net debt in the range 
of 1.0-1.5x EBITDA, measured at 31 March 
each year. With net debt of £261.4m and 
EBITDA of £154.2m, the Group was outside 
this range at 1.7x.
As previously stated, we are prepared to see 
leverage increase for reasonable periods 
of time if circumstances warrant this. 
The opportunity to acquire USP in North 
America in July 2016 together with our 
other investments, principally relating to the 
investment in Checkatrade and acquisition 
of Habitissimo, which we expect to 
accelerate our Home Experts proposition, 
represented such circumstances. Absent 
the M&A activity which took place in the 
year, we would have been at the lower end 
of our target range, while the range itself 
remains subject to periodic review. 
During the year, the Group obtained €50m 
medium-term funding in the form of a term 
loan due for repayment by instalments 
through to 2020. In addition, during March 
2017, the Group obtained a further £60m 
medium-term funding in the form of a 
Private Placement due for repayment in 
2024. 
The Group’s net interest paid was £6.4m 
with an interest accrual of £1.1m as at 
31 March 2017, of which £0.8m was 
subsequently paid in April 2017.  Cash 
finance costs in the prior year were £3.0m 
with an interest accrual of £0.9m as at 31 
March 2016.   
In addition to the net cash outflow on the 
acquisitions above of £71.8m, deferred 
consideration was paid relating to prior 
period business combinations of £3.1m 
(FY16: £1.1m) and net cash was acquired 
as part of an immaterial acquisition in 
Spain of £0.7m.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share for the year increased 
from 19.6p to 24.0p, an increase of 22%. 
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share 
increased 24% from 21.8p to 27.0p. The 
weighted average number of shares 
decreased from 313.9m to 309.9m due to 
the impact of the share consolidation in 
the prior year, offset in part by new shares 
issued in fulfilment of a number of share 
schemes in the year.
Dividends
Given the Group’s good performance 
and the Board’s confidence in its future 
prospects, the Board is proposing to 
increase the final dividend to 11.2p per 
share (FY16: 8.9p) to be paid on 3 August 
2017 to shareholders on the register on  
7 July 2017.
Together with the interim dividend 
declared in November 2016 of 4.1p 
(November 2015: 3.8p), this represents 
a 20% increase in the total ordinary 
dividend payment for the year of 15.3p 
(FY16: 12.7p), which is 1.76x covered by 
the FY17 adjusted earnings per share 
compared to 1.72x cover in FY16. As 
previously indicated, the Board intends to 
adopt a progressive dividend policy and 
targets a dividend cover in the range 1.75x 
- 2x over the medium-term. 40
Strategic report
Financial review (continued)
Specifically, changes in the US Dollar 
and Euro exchange rates between FY16 
and FY17 have resulted in the reported 
revenue of our international businesses 
increasing by £63.3m and adjusted 
operating profit increasing by £10.3m as 
summarised in the table below.
In addition, as the Group holds certain of 
its cash, bank and other loans in foreign 
currencies, the depreciation of sterling 
resulted in an increase in the reported net 
debt of the Group of £0.2m in relation to 
Euro-denominated net debt, and £6.5m 
in relation to US Dollar-denominated net 
debt.
Foreign exchange impact 
HomeServe is well-positioned to 
meet the challenges of the UK’s exit 
from the European Union and our 
growth prospects remain strong. Our 
businesses each operate in their own 
territories, buying goods and services 
from local businesses and supplying 
local consumers within those territories, 
almost exclusively in local currencies. Our 
businesses have also proved resilient to 
economic turmoil over a number  
of years.
The depreciation of sterling against the 
US Dollar and Euro following the UK’s 
decision to leave the European Union has, 
however, had a significant impact  
on our reported results due to the impact 
of translating the results of our overseas 
businesses.

Principal risks and uncertainties
HomeServe has a risk management framework which provides a structured and consistent 
process for identifying, assessing and responding to risks. These risks are assessed in 
relation to the Group’s strategy, business performance and financial condition and a formal 
risk mitigation plan is agreed with clear ownership and accountability. Risk management 
operates at all levels throughout the Group, across geographies and business lines. 
Risks to HomeServe’s business are either specific to HomeServe’s business model, such 
as affinity partner relationships and underwriting, or more general, such as the impact of 
competition and regulatory compliance.
The table opposite sets out what the Board believes to be the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group, the mitigating actions for each, and an update on any 
change in the profile of each risk during the past year. These should be read in conjunction 
with the Chief Executive’s review and the Financial review. Additional risks and uncertainties 
of which we are not currently aware or which we currently believe are not significant may 
also adversely affect our strategy, business performance or financial condition in the future.
The Board believes that all identified risks carry equal importance and weighting as in the 
prior year with updates to the nature of those risks detailed below.  Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Risk 
Description / Impact Mitigation Change since 2016 Annual Report
Commercial relationships 
Underpinning the success in 
our chosen markets are close 
commercial relationships 
(affinity partner relationships) 
principally with utility 
companies, municipals and 
financial institutions. The loss 
of one of these relationships 
could impact our future 
customer and policy growth 
plans and retention rates.
While the majority of these 
partnerships are secured 
under long-term contracts, 
which increase the security 
of these relationships over 
the medium-term, they can 
be terminated in certain 
circumstances. 
 
We have regular contact and reviews 
with the senior management of 
our affinity partners to ensure we 
respond to their needs and deliver 
the service that they expect.
Across the Group we are not 
dependent on any one single 
partnership, which mitigates, in 
part, the impact of losing any single 
relationship.
 
We have continued to sign and renew 
affinity partnerships with utilities 
across the businesses.
In the UK, there were no agreements 
due for renewal in FY17. We renewed 
one utility partner agreement early 
due to renew in FY18 on substantially 
similar terms. We signed an additional 
utility partner (Dee Valley Water) and 
extended our relationship with Aviva. 
In North America, we signed 100 
new partners during the year and in 
France, while continuing to work with 
the two largest water utilities we also 
have a good pipeline of opportunities.
In Spain, we continue to work closely 
with Endesa, though ceased activity 
with Agbar, a water utility. In Italy, 
following the cessation of the test 
agreement with Enel, we entered a 
joint venture with Edison Energia. 
Competition
There are a number of 
businesses that provide 
services that are similar to 
those of the Group and could 
therefore compete in one or 
more of our chosen markets. 
Increased competition could 
affect our ability to meet our 
expectations and objectives 
for the business in terms of 
the number of customers, 
policies or the financial 
returns achieved.
 
The market and the activities of 
other participants are regularly 
reviewed to ensure that the 
strategies and offerings of current 
and potential competitors are fully 
understood. Both qualitative and 
quantitative research is undertaken 
to ensure that our products and 
services continue to meet the needs 
of our customers whilst retaining a 
competitive position in the market.
We believe we have a compelling 
proposition, providing customers 
with real value and helping 
reduce the impact of increased 
competition. 
 
There has been no significant change 
in the competitive landscape in any of 
the countries in which we operate.
In North America, we participate in 
RFPs (“requests for proposal”) that 
are issued by utilities when they seek 
to start a programme. While we see 
some other parties participating in 
these tenders, we win the majority 
and we believe that, overall, the RFP 
process is positive for our business 
as it demonstrates an increased 
awareness of our products and 
services in the North American 
market. 44

Customer loyalty / 
retention
A key element of our 
business model is customer 
loyalty. Any reduction in the 
proportion of customers 
renewing their policies could 
significantly impact our 
revenue.
 
 
Policy retention rate is one of our 
Key Performance Indicators. Any 
significant movement is therefore 
carefully investigated to assess the 
change in customer behaviour and 
to implement corrective action 
where possible.
We have a wide range of tools 
available to manage retention 
rates, including specific retention 
propositions.
There are dedicated retention 
teams, trained and experienced in 
talking to those customers who 
are considering not renewing their 
policy.
We regularly review our products 
ensuring they provide the coverage 
that our customers demand and 
need. We also regularly review the 
methods by which we interact with 
our customers ensuring their needs 
are met and providing them with 
updated tools to purchase, renew 
and review their policy holdings for 
example through our latest digital 
initiatives.
 
 
Policy retention remains high in all 
our countries.
In the UK, the policy retention rate 
decreased by 2 percentage points 
to 80% compared to the prior year, 
principally due to the higher number 
of customers in early renewal cycles.  
In the UK, we also closely monitor the 
customer retention rate, which has 
been maintained at 82%. 
In North America, the policy retention 
rate has been maintained at 82%, the 
same as the prior year. 
In France, we have maintained a 
policy retention rate of 89%. 
In Spain, policy retention increased by 
1 percentage point to 78%.
Marketing effectiveness 
A significant reduction 
in the response rates 
on our marketing could 
have a significant impact 
on customer and policy 
numbers.
 
The performance of each marketing 
campaign and channel is regularly 
reviewed, with any significant 
deviation to the expected response 
rate quickly identified and remedial 
action taken for subsequent 
campaigns. We record and review a 
number of telephone calls across all 
of our businesses.
 
During the year, our marketing 
channels performed as we expected 
with direct mail response rates 
continuing to perform well.
We continue to develop our digital 
channels and work with our partners 
to offer our products in their call 
centres. Development of these two 
channels is serving to reduce our 
reliance on direct mail activity.

Description / Impact Mitigation Change since 2016 Annual Report
Exposure to legislation or 
regulatory requirements
We are subject to a broad 
spectrum of regulatory 
requirements in each of 
the markets in which we 
operate, particularly relating 
to product design, marketing 
materials, sales processes and 
data protection.
Failure to comply with the 
regulatory requirements 
in any of our countries 
could result in us having to 
suspend, either temporarily 
or permanently, certain 
activities.
In addition, legislative 
changes related to our 
partners may change their 
obligations with regard to the 
infrastructure they currently 
manage and hence the 
products and services we can 
offer to customers.
It is possible such legislative 
changes could reduce, or 
even remove, the need for 
some of our products and 
services.
 
 
We have regulatory specialists, 
compliance teams and Non-
Executive Directors in each of our 
businesses to help ensure that all 
aspects of the legislative regime in 
each territory are fully understood 
and adopted as required.
Specifically in the UK, we maintain 
regular dialogue with the FCA, while 
in the USA we have regular dialogue 
with the Attorneys General. In our 
other businesses, we maintain a 
dialogue with local regulators.
We keep up to date with changes 
in government and regulatory 
policy, which ensures that our 
products and services are designed, 
marketed and sold in accordance 
with all relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and that their terms 
and conditions remain appropriate 
and meet the needs of customers.
 
 
All of our businesses have dedicated 
experienced compliance specialists 
including independent Non-Executive 
Directors to chair the compliance 
committees in each of our businesses, 
with regular reporting to the local 
company Board of Directors.
We have maintained appropriate 
dialogue with all relevant regulatory 
bodies that govern or influence 
our businesses and have sought to 
engage, where possible, in regulatory 
and compliance discussions around 
the development of the markets in 
which we operate.
In the UK the primary regulator, the 
Financial Conduct Authority, has 
recognised the risk that we pose to 
their objectives has decreased and 
therefore they have reduced the 
intensity of their supervision. Strategic report

Quality of customer service
Our reputation is heavily 
dependent on the quality of 
our customer service.
Any failure to meet our 
service standards or 
negative media coverage 
of poor service could 
have a detrimental impact 
on customer and policy 
numbers.
 
We monitor customer service 
standards at a number of different 
customer contact points in each of 
our operations, using both internal 
data and an independent third party.
The results of these are reviewed 
on a regular basis and action plans 
produced to address the key issues.
Processes have been established 
to ensure that all directly employed 
engineers and sub-contractors 
meet minimum standards. These 
include criminal record checks 
and minimum qualification 
requirements.
Reflecting the importance of 
customer service to our business, 
all senior managers have customer 
satisfaction as a significant 
component of their annual bonus 
opportunity.
 
In FY17, we continued to monitor 
customer satisfaction across all our 
operations at a number of different 
customer contact points, with 
improvements in all the businesses.
Availability of underwriters
The policies that we market 
and administer are each 
individually underwritten 
by third party underwriters, 
independent of HomeServe.
We act as an insurance 
intermediary and do not take 
on any material insurance 
risk.
If these underwriters were 
unable or unwilling to 
underwrite these risks and 
we were unable to find 
alternative underwriters it 
would require us to insure 
these risks directly, thereby 
exposing the business to 
material insurance risk, which 
is contrary to our preferred 
operating model. In addition, 
it would take time to obtain 
the relevant regulatory 
approvals.
 
We use a number of underwriters, 
with the main provider in the UK 
separate to those in the rest of 
Europe and North America.
We have regular contact and reviews 
with the senior management of the 
underwriters to ensure that claims 
frequencies, repair costs and service 
standards are in line with their 
expectations. 
The principal underwriters 
are subject to medium-term 
agreements, with the rates subject 
to regular review. 
In addition, we maintain 
relationships with a number of 
underwriters who are willing and 
able to underwrite our business 
and regularly review the market 
to ensure we understand current 
market conditions, how these 
apply to our policies and how we 
can mitigate the loss of an existing 
underwriter.
 
We continue to review our 
underwriting relationships on a 
regular basis to ensure they provide 
the best returns for customers and 
shareholders.
In the UK, Aviva continues to be 
our principal underwriter, and 
commenced underwriting new 
business in November 2015.
Having secured a second underwriter 
in North America last year, during 
FY17 we agreed terms with second 
underwriters in France and Spain.  47

Dependence on recruitment 
and retention of skilled 
personnel
Our ability to meet growth 
expectations and compete 
effectively is, in part, 
dependent on the skills, 
experience and performance 
of our personnel. The inability 
to attract, motivate or retain 
key talent could impact 
on our overall business 
performance.
 
 
 
Our employment policies, 
remuneration and benefits 
packages, and long-term incentives 
are regularly reviewed and designed 
to be competitive with other 
companies.
Employee surveys, performance 
reviews and regular communication 
of business activities are just some 
of the methods used to understand 
and respond to employees’ views 
and needs.
Processes are in place to identify 
high performing individuals and 
to ensure that they have fulfilling 
careers, and we are managing 
succession planning effectively.
 
 
 
A “People Committee”, comprised 
of a number of the Non-Executive 
Directors and senior management 
of the Group, has been created 
with a mandate to promote the 
development and recruitment of key 
talent.
We have continued to strengthen our 
management teams across all our 
operations – particularly in the areas 
of IT, Digital, Commercial and M&A.
During the year we completed the 
rollout of our People Promises 
which are now live in each of our 
businesses and an integral part 
of our recruitment, selection and 
development procedures.
Exposure to country and 
regional risk and Brexit risk 
In line with other businesses 
we are subject to economic, 
political and other risks 
associated with operating in 
overseas territories.
A variety of factors, including 
changes in a specific 
country’s political, economic 
or regulatory requirements, 
as well as the potential 
for geographical turmoil 
including terrorism and war, 
could result in the loss of 
service.
Following the UK’s decision 
to leave the European Union 
there may be implications 
for how we operate with our 
overseas businesses. 
 
 
The criteria for entering a new 
country include a full assessment 
of the stability of its economic and 
political situation, together with a 
review of the manner and way in 
which business is conducted.
When entering a new country, we 
generally do so on a small scale test 
basis. This low risk entry strategy 
minimises the likelihood of any 
significant loss.
Our businesses each operate in their 
own territories, buying goods and 
services from local businesses and 
supplying local consumers within 
those territories, almost exclusively 
in local currencies.
 
 
We have recommenced reviewing 
potential new territories and have 
appointed a dedicated team with 
significant experience of working in 
an international environment to lead 
this activity.
We continue to monitor the 
economic, political and regulatory 
environments where we operate.
The Group is well positioned to meet 
the challenges of the UK’s exit from 
the European Union and our growth 
prospects remain strong. Strategic report

Our IT systems become a 
constraint to growth and 
drive inefficiency instead of 
efficiency improvements
The Group’s core IT system 
is used in each of our 
businesses. The system is 
now around 20 years old 
and has had a number of 
‘in house’ developments. 
The system is dependent 
on internal development 
resource and knowledge.
 
 
 
 
The Group reviews its systems 
and processes on a regular basis. 
As part of these reviews we look 
at the future plans of each of the 
businesses in terms of customer 
and policy growth, product and 
process design and development 
requirements and the potential 
impact on IT systems.
All system developments and 
enhancements undergo a rigorous 
financial review and the proposed 
benefits are monitored and subject 
to post implementation reviews.
Our IT developments are subject to 
a prioritisation process, which takes 
into account the availability of both 
internal and external resource and 
the proposed benefits of the project.
 
 
 
 
We are replacing our core customer 
IT system, the development of which 
has progressed well and is expected 
to ‘go-live’ in the UK during FY18.
We have agreed plans to upgrade 
our claims and deployment systems, 
enhancing the customer journey 
and improving interactions with our 
network.
We have continued to invest in other 
new technologies that will allow us 
to improve the products and service 
we offer our customers. These 
have included an innovative leak 
detection device and initial funding of 
a platform-based home repairs and 
improvement model. 
Information security 
(including cyber risk) 
In line with other businesses 
we are subject to the 
increased prevalence and 
sophistication of cyber-
attacks which could result 
in unauthorised access to 
customer and other data that 
we hold or cause business 
disruption to our services. 
This could result in a loss 
of customers, legal liability, 
regulatory action or harm to 
our reputation. 
 
 
We have a number of defensive 
and proactive practices across the 
Group to mitigate this risk.
We have a detailed information 
security policy, which is 
communicated across the Group 
and training provided as required. 
We continue to invest in IT security 
ensuring a secure configuration, 
access controls and data centre 
security.
 
 
Following a detailed review of our 
information policy, practices and 
procedures by a third party in FY16, 
we have now engaged a Group 
Chief Information Security Officer to 
oversee information security across 
the Group. We have a dedicated 
information security officer in each 
business and undertake regular 
reviews and penetration testing at all 
of our businesses. During the year, we 
continued to complete cyber audits 
as part of our annual assurance plan 
and will continue to do so in FY18. 49

Description / Impact Mitigation Change since 2016 Annual Report
Financial strategy and 
treasury risk
The main financial risks are 
the availability of short-term 
and long-term funding to 
meet business needs, the 
risk of policyholders not 
paying monies owed, and 
fluctuations in interest rates 
and exchange rates.
Following the UK’s decision 
to leave the European Union 
the Group could be subject 
to higher exchange rate 
fluctuations 
Interest rate risk
Our policy is to manage our interest 
cost using a mix of fixed and variable 
rate debts. Where necessary, this is 
achieved by entering into interest 
rate swaps for certain periods, in 
which we agree to exchange, at 
specified intervals, the difference 
between fixed and variable rate 
interest amounts calculated by 
reference to an agreed notional 
principal amount. These swaps are 
designated to economically hedge 
underlying debt obligations.
Credit risk
The risk associated with cash and 
cash equivalents is managed by only 
depositing funds with reputable and 
creditworthy banking institutions.
The risk of a policyholder defaulting 
is mitigated as any policy cover will 
cease as and when any premium 
fails to be paid.
Liquidity risk
We manage liquidity risk by 
maintaining adequate reserves and 
banking facilities and continuously 
monitoring forecast and actual cash 
flows. 
Foreign exchange risk 
A clear treasury policy exists to 
address short term risk and this 
works with the natural hedging 
provided by the geographical 
spread of the businesses. While this 
will protect against some of the 
transaction exposure, our reported 
results would still be impacted 
by the translation of our non-UK 
operations.
 
 
During the year, we have obtained 
a four year €50m amortising term 
loan repayable in 2020 and £60m 
of fixed rate medium-term funding 
repayable in 2024. In addition, we 
have continued to build relationships 
with a number of financial institutions 
that wish to provide debt finance to 
the Group.
Following the increase in the 
Group’s leverage we have continued 
to monitor the need to fix the 
interest rate on some element of 
our borrowings. However, given 
the relatively stable interest rate 
environment, combined with the fixed 
rate debt secured during the past two 
years, we have not entered into any 
interest rate swaps during FY17.
Cash and cash equivalents continue 
to be deposited with reputable and 
creditworthy banking institutions.
There has been no significant change 
in the level of mid-term policy 
cancellations.
Our banking facility was renewed in 
July 2014. Our net debt at 31 March 
2017 was £261.4m, well within our 
committed facilities and loans, on 
which all conditions precedent have 
been met. 
During the year, our adjusted 
operating profit benefited from the 
translation benefit on Euro and USA 
Dollar profits by £10.3m. Strategic report

Financial review (continued)
Viability statement
In accordance with provision c.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, the 
Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three year period to 31 March 
2020. The Directors believe that a three year forward looking period is appropriate as it 
is aligned to the timeframe that management focus upon, the performance period in 
respect of the long-term incentive scheme for senior management and it is the period of 
assessment for recoverable values of cash generating units.
The Group has a formalised process of budgeting, reporting and review along with 
procedures to forecast its profitability, capital position, funding requirement and cash flows. 
These plans provide information to the Directors which are used to ensure the adequacy of 
resources available for the Group to meet its business objectives, both on a short-term and 
strategic basis. The plans for the period commencing on 1 April 2017 were reviewed by the 
Executive Committee in February and then approved by the Board in March 2017.
In making this statement, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity as set out in the principal risks and uncertainties. The 
Group has an embedded risk management framework and all major risks are scored based 
on their significance and likelihood and these are reviewed regularly by the Audit & Risk 
Committee.
Various stress tests have also been performed on scenarios such as the impact of losing an 
affinity partnership or a lowering of retention in a given country.
The Directors’ assessment has been made with reference to geographical spread of 
the Group operations and its strong financial position, resulting from a combination of 
commercial partnerships and high customer retention.
The business is geographically spread across the UK, Continental Europe and North 
America. In each established territory, the business has long-term contractual relationships 
with utility businesses providing access to in excess of 102m households under Affinity 
Partner brands. Retention rates are high across all established businesses, resulting in stable 
and recurring cashflows from a large, diverse customer base.
Considering the Group’s current position, the principal risks and the Board’s assessment of 
the Group’s future, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over a period of at least three 
years to 31 March 2020. 51
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are set out in the strategic report.
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budget, forecast and cash flows for 2018 and 
beyond, and concluded that they are in line with their expectations with regards to the 
Group’s strategy and future growth plans. In addition, the directors have reviewed the 
Group’s position in respect of material uncertainties and have concluded that there are no 
items that would affect going concern or that should be separately disclosed.
The Directors have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.

Corporate responsibility
1. Customers
• Implement and maintain ethical, 
sustainable and responsible principles 
throughout the supply chain
• Ensure the customer remains at the 
heart of everything we do
• Treat customers fairly throughout the 
customer experience.
2. Employees
• Embed customer-focused values and 
behaviours

people to ensure our customers enjoy 
a consistently good experience 
• Provide a safe, healthy and inclusive 
environment for our people.
3. Community
• Use our core skills to give something 
back to the community
• Support more vulnerable members  
of the community by helping them  
in their homes.
We are committed to developing and 
implementing a successful corporate 
responsibility programme that 
beneﬁts key stakeholders. We believe 
that a successful business must also 
be a responsible business. 
We aim to:
• Achieve sustainable proﬁts for our 
shareholders
• Build enduring relationships with key 
stakeholders, including our customers, 
partners and the community
• Value our employees
• Respect the environment
• Use our core skills to give something 
back to our local communities.
Our corporate responsibility objectives 
support our vision and values, with a focus 
on four areas:
Corporate responsibility 55
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
• Develop partnerships with charitable 
and community organisations closely 
aligned to our business activities and 
therefore maximise our contribution
• Support and encourage employee 
involvement in charitable giving 
and volunteering, using relevant 
employee skills to support our local 
communities.
4. Environment
• Reduce our carbon emissions per 
employee
• Use resources e‡ciently
• Support and educate customers and 
employees to reduce emissions, 
speciﬁcally in their homes.
These corporate social responsibility 
principles are part of the way we operate 
on a daily basis and reﬂect the way we 
deal with customers, our people, partners 
and the community. 
Customers
We promote a customer-focused 
culture and are proud of our excellent 
reputation for customer service and the 
many outstanding customer service 
awards we have won around the world. 
Our Customer Promises outline our 
commitment to our customers; we make 
things easy for customers and treat them 
fairly, every step of the way. All our people 
are committed to our customer promises 
- from management teams to those on 
the front line.
Before a Customer joins
We’ll make it clear what they’re buying 
and what it will do for them
When a Customer joins
We’ll tell them how much they’re paying, 
what that buys them and how to claim
When a Customer becomes a member
We’ll make life easy for them
When a Customer makes a claim
We’ll solve their problem quickly and easily 
– their emergency is our emergency
If a Customer isn’t happy
We’ll listen, say sorry and put things right 
wherever we can, as soon as we can
Our Customer Promises Corporate responsibility
56
Employees
Our strategy to deliver consistently good 
customer service is embedded in our 
recruitment, selection, development and 
reward arrangements across the Group. 
We aim to attract, motivate and retain the 
best talent we can and this underpins our 
consistently high customer service. 
All of our businesses have adopted People 
Promises and whilst these di’er in each 
territory, they are based on a common 
set of values. They also complement 
our customer promises and align our 
employees’ interests to the delivery of 
excellent customer service.
Our people are considered for 
employment, training, career 
development and promotion on the basis 
of their abilities and aptitudes, regardless 
of physical ability, age, gender, sexual 
orientation, religion or ethnic origin. Our 
gender split in FY17 across the Group was 
55:45 (Male:Female) with a team of over 
5,000, as shown in the table below.

We apply fair and equitable employment 
policies and these ensure that entry into, 
and progression within, the Group is 
determined solely by the fair application 
of relevant job criteria and by personal 
ability and competence. We actively 
promote the international transfer of our 
employees where this is likely to assist 
the development of both employee and 
business, and our senior HR community 
meets regularly to share best practice 
and identify opportunities to develop our 
employees’ careers.
Full and fair consideration (having regard 
to the person’s particular aptitudes and 
abilities) is given to applications for 
employment and the career development 
of disabled persons. We will take all 
practicable steps to ensure that if an 
employee becomes disabled during 
the time they are employed, their 
employment can continue. We continue 
to review both performance and potential 
as a key part of our annual performance 
management, career development and 
succession planning processes. We 
have co-ordinated talent and leadership 
programmes across the business, from 
front-line developing leaders to senior 
executives.
We are developing and implementing a 
succession planning strategy to ensure 
we have the talent available to match 
Group growth. We are also working 
with an external partner to identify 
individuals outside the organisation to join 
HomeServe and ensure that we promote 
an international mindset and experience.  57
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
We ensure all our people beneﬁt 
from e’ective communications and 
engagement, with regular business 
updates, senior management brieﬁng 
sessions and “surgeries”, question  
and answer opportunities and 
constructive relationships with employee 
representatives across the Group. We  
also encourage our management teams 
to hold regular informal update meetings 
and social events to keep our employees 
informed and engaged. In FY17 our overall 
employee engagement level rose to 81% 
from 78% in FY16. 
Community 
Each business is encouraged to develop a 
local strategy to support and give back to 
the communities in which we live and work.
In the UK, there are four di’erent 
programmes that: 
• Incentivise our people for volunteering 
for groups that matter to them. In FY17, 
we made over £11,000 in donations 
to community groups, including 
Scout groups, sports teams, homeless 
centres and hospices. Our people have 
given over 3,000 hours of their own 
time to these groups
• Encourage our people to choose 
a charity that matters to them, and 
raise money for that charity that is 
then matched. Around £25,000 has 
been raised for a wide range of local 
and national charities, which we have 
matched
• Work with the charity, Education 
& Employers, on their ‘Inspire the 
Future’ campaign to place over 40 of 
our People (including engineers and 
marketing managers) as volunteers in 
local schools and colleges speaking 
to students about their own job and 
career path 
• Work on major refurbishment projects 
where we can use our skills to help 
others. Projects have included a team 
of our engineers volunteering their 
time for BBC DIY SOS installing a 
whole new heating system and also a 
team of 40 People who helped one of 
our elderly customers who was having 
di‡culty maintaining his home.
For the thirteenth year, our UK contact 
centres were selected by the Comic 
Relief charity to receive donations from 
the public and over 450 of our people 
volunteered on the evening, taking over 
2,000 calls. We continue to support 
the Midland Langar Seva Society, which 
feeds homeless people in Birmingham 
365 days a year. Support has included 
onsite food and clothing collections and 
our people volunteering every Thursday 
night in Birmingham. Since the start of the 
partnership, over 14,000 meals have been 
served at the open kitchens.
In the US, just over $70,000 has been 
contributed to local community charitable 
organisations and another $77,000 to 
customers in need. Initiatives included: 
• The HomeServe Helping Hands 
programme where charitable 
assistance is provided to employees 
whose personal circumstances present 
signiﬁcant challenges Corporate responsibility
58
Environment, Health & Safety
Health, safety, wellbeing and environmental 
guardianship remain central to everything 
we do. All our businesses comply with 
ten guiding principles for occupational 
health and safety and for environmental 
management. We focus on safe working 
environments, developing motivated and 
supported employees, and we strive for  
zero work-related injuries and illnesses. 
In FY17, we engaged a specialist supplier 
to complete a Group wide audit and a plan 
has been put in place to implement the 
actions arising from that activity. As part of 
this, we intend to enhance our reporting 
and controls in line with recommended 
HSE best practice and to encourage cross 
business learning. 
• The Charitable Pitch Campaign which 
provides HomeServe employees with 
the chance to “pitch” their ideas for 
charities: it gives invaluable insight into 
the personal lives of our employees 
and gives a tremendous pipeline of 
worthy social causes. In FY17, we 
contributed $45,000 to key charities; 
Red Rover Foundation, American 
Cancer Society, Humane Society, Best 
Buddies (Disabled Children) and CT 
Advocates of Southwest Connecticut 
• HomeServe Cares and Goodwill Jobs 
where we assist customers with repairs 
that they could otherwise not a’ord. 
During the year, $38,000 of work has 
been performed
• Supporting our partners in their local 
communities. This charitable work 
totalled just over $17,000 in FY17. 
In France we have continued working 
with Habitat & Humanisme, and activities 
included providing meals for under 
privileged people and supporting residents 
with our contractor network. In FY17 we 
also deployed a number of claims free  
of charge. 
Over 470 employees in Spain have been 
directly involved in community activity. 
Over 230 employees have raised money 
for cancer charities including races across 
Spain and a charity football tournament 
organised by the NGO “Cooperación 
Internacional”. Using the skills of 127 
employees and contractors, we repaired 
and painted seven social centres. 59
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Leadership
Johnathan Ford, Group Chief Operating 
O‡cer, is the Director responsible for 
environmental, health and safety matters. 
HR Directors lead Health & Safety matters 
in each business, except in the UK where 
responsibility has transferred to the Chief 
Risk O‡cer. 
Continuous improvement
Intra-company safety benchmarking 
is strong and accident frequency rates 
are used to compare injury rate, safety 
culture and levels of engagement; and 
in preparation for the new ISO45001 
speciﬁcation gives a leading indicator of 
safety leadership. Across the Group we 
have continued to see a positive trend in 
the reduction of accidents or incidents  
in FY17. 
The UK has promoted the use and 
beneﬁts of the employee assistance 
programme which covers stress 
management. The business has received 
a Gold award from the Royal Society for 
The Prevention of Accidents. The Health 
& Safety framework has been judged as 
continuously improving and this is the 
7th Gold award in a row for the business 
which is a great achievement. 
France has continued to see a signiﬁcant 
reduction in the number of work 
related accidents, and there have been 
considerable improvements to the 
working environment following the  
move to a new modern o‡ce building.  
A support hotline has been implemented 
for all employees in France with a view to 
assisting with stress management.
The US has seen a reduction in the 
number of injuries and has made 
signiﬁcant improvements to the injury 
management process which focuses 
on early medical intervention and early 
access to occupational medical facilities 
where required.
During FY17 the environmental conditions 
of all our locations in Spain were reviewed 
with subsequent investment in lighting, air 
conditioning and reducing noise pollution. 
A key focus through a range of health 
campaigns has been placed on ensuring 
employees are able to check their health 
and get access to expert advice where 
required.
Carbon emissions continue to be 
measured across all Group companies. 
The UK business is not part of the UK 
Government’s monitoring scheme as 
carbon emissions are below the scheme’s 
threshold.
Legal
There have been no prosecutions or other 
enforcement actions taken in respect 
of our businesses by any of the national 
health, safety or environmental regulators. 60

good business performance. As a 
Board we are accountable to our 
shareholders for ensuring that 
governance processes are in place 
and are eˆective and we are fully 
committed to meeting the required

strong proﬁt growth while continuing 
to implement our customer focused 
growth strategy. We have continued to 
seek out new opportunities to grow our 
business, investing in Checkatrade and

the US.
As a Board we regularly discuss and 
review:
• Our business performance and our 
progress towards our strategic goals

ensure that they are at the heart of 
everything we do

and support them to provide the 
service our customers expect

Board composition
The Board is made up of a balance of Executive Directors and independent Non-Executive 
Directors. 
The Directors who held o‡ce during the year were: 
John Michael Barry Gibson
Richard David Harpin 67
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Martin John Bennett 
David Jonathan Bower (appointed 6 February 2017)
Johnathan Richard Ford 
Stella Julie David 
Christopher Havemann 
Benjamin Edward Mingay 
Mark Christopher Morris
The Board is led by the Chairman, Barry Gibson. The Chairman’s responsibilities are clearly 
deﬁned in a written speciﬁcation agreed by the Board and which makes clear the division 
of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. They include the smooth 
running of the Board, e’ective communication between Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors and the general progress and long-term development of the Group. 
During the year, in addition to the Chairman, four independent Non-Executive Directors 
(Messrs Havemann, Mingay and Morris and Mrs David) with extensive business, ﬁnance 
and marketing backgrounds, provided the Board with a breadth of experience and with 
independent judgement. Mark Morris served as the Company’s independent Senior Non-
Executive Director. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, each Director is subject to election by 
the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting immediately following their 
appointment, and is subject to re-election every year thereafter.
Short biographies of each of the Directors including their membership of committees may be 
found on the previous page.
The beneﬁcial interests of the Directors in the shares of the Company and the options held 
as at 31 March 2017 and 23 May 2017 are set out in the Remuneration report. None of the 
Directors serving at the year end had a beneﬁcial interest in the share capital of any subsidiary 
company.
Succession planning
There is a clear need to ensure that there is an appropriate pool of talented and capable 
individuals to ﬁll senior roles and a succession planning process has been established across 
the Group to facilitate this. Each business and corporate function prepares and maintains 
succession plans with the support of local and Group HR and with input from the Group 
Chief Executive. The Executive Committee reviews the plans in detail twice a year and the 
Board reviews the high level plan at least annually. 
The identiﬁcation and development of our people remains a key focus across the Group. Governance

Corporate Governance report (continued)
Diversity
The Board is committed to ensuring that it is appropriately diverse. It is supportive of the 
aspiration of the Davies Report to promote greater female representation on corporate 
boards. Although no target has been set in respect of the percentage of women on the 
Board, when seeking to recruit for Board positions we ensure that ‘long lists’ include women 
candidates.
The Board also believes that a diversity of experience and psychological proﬁle is important 
around the board table. We seek to ensure that there is a balance of skills and experience 
and in respect of non-executive positions we ensure that candidates from a wider pool are 
considered, including those with little or no listed company board experience.
Board meetings
Up to eight regular meetings are held each year to review and monitor current and forecast 
performance. Regular reports on monthly performance and other matters of importance to 
the Group ensure that the Board is supplied in a timely manner with the information necessary 
to make informed judgements. In addition, the Board has an annual strategy meeting, also 
attended by senior operational management, to devise and discuss the Company’s medium 
and long-term strategic focus and management development strategy. 
Regular formal and informal presentations are given and meetings held in order to inform 
Directors of issues of importance a’ecting the Group. Occasionally, meetings of the Board 
are held at the Company’s operating sites other than Walsall, in order to a’ord the Board, 
particularly the Non-Executive Directors, the opportunity to meet with local management. 
During FY17, the annual strategy meeting was held in France which provided the Board with 
an invaluable insight into that business and enabled the Directors to meet the entire senior 
management team.
Attendance at meetings
All Directors are expected to attend all Board and relevant committee meetings. Details of 
attendance by Directors at meetings during the year are set out in the table below.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Directors who were unable to attend speciﬁc meetings reviewed the relevant papers 
and provided their comments to the Chairman of the Board or Committee. Any Director 
who misses a meeting will, as a matter of course, receive the minutes of that meeting for 
reference.
Nomination Committee meetings are held on an ad hoc basis as required. The activities of 
this Committee are described later in this report.
Board development
The Board actively encourages all Directors to deepen their knowledge of their roles and 
responsibilities and to gain a clear understanding of the Group and the environment in 
which it operates and has adopted a formal policy on the induction and training of Directors. 
Newly appointed Board members are required to undergo an induction programme, which 
includes obtaining a thorough understanding of the Group’s various operations. Board 
members also have the opportunity to receive formal training from external providers if they 
wish. 
During the year, the Non-Executive Directors have met with various members of the Group’s 
management teams and external advisers. 
Board evaluation
The Board has implemented a formal process for reviewing its own e’ectiveness, that of 
its Remuneration and Audit & Risk committees and its individual members. In addition, 
it continued to ensure that regular meetings of the Non-Executive Directors were held 
without the Executive Directors, and at least once a year, without the Chairman present,  
in order to evaluate his performance. 
An external Board evaluation process was completed during FY15 by Lintstock Limited. 
Directors completed evaluation questionnaires and these were followed up by individual 
interviews with Lintstock who then compiled a formal written report summarising the 
Directors’ views and containing recommendations to improve the e’ectiveness of the 
Board. This report was followed up in both FY16 and FY17 by an evaluation questionnaire, 
also facilitated by Lintstock Limited. The FY17 output was discussed by the Board in  
February 2017. 
The overall performance of the Board was rated very highly and was broadly seen to have 
improved since the FY16 review. In particular the Non-Executives’ support and challenge 
of management was rated highly as was the relationship between the Board and the Chief 
Executive and the atmosphere at meetings. It was agreed that the Board should continue to 
try to visit di’erent HomeServe operations and to take the opportunity to meet and interact 
with the wider management teams.  Governance
70
Committees
The Board operates a number of committees to which it has delegated certain speciﬁc 
responsibilities, each of which has formally adopted terms of reference. These comprise the 
Nomination, Audit & Risk and Remuneration Committees. The terms of reference of each 
of the Board’s committees are available on request from the Company Secretary and are on 
the Company’s website. The membership and activities of the Audit & Risk Committee and 
Remuneration Committee are detailed in the reports of those committees.
Nomination Committee
Members
JM Barry Gibson (Chairman)
Stella David
Ben Mingay
Mark Morris
Responsibilities
The primary responsibilities of the Committee are to:
• make recommendations to the Board on the appointment of Directors
• review the size, structure and composition of the Board
• consider succession planning arrangements for Directors and other senior managers.
Key issues considered during the year
A specially formed Nomination Committee was used during the year to run the process to 
appoint a new Chief Financial O‡cer. This Committee was headed by Mark Morris who, 
given his role as Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee, was considered to be the most 
appropriate person to lead the process. He was closely supported by Johnathan Ford. This 
Committee met informally on a number of occasions to consider the candidates for the 
role and Directors not on the Committee were given the opportunity to meet with the 
shortlisted candidates. Following this, a recommendation to appoint David Bower was made 
to the Board.
The Committee draws on the advice of such professional advisers as it considers necessary 
and did so during the year in respect of the appointment made.
Succession planning arrangements were considered by the Board as a whole rather than by 
the Nomination Committee.
Corporate Governance report (continued) 71
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Executive Committee
The day to day running of the business rests with the Group Chief Executive, Richard Harpin. 
The Executive Committee assists the Chief Executive in the performance of his duties including:
• the development and implementation of strategy, operational plans, policies, procedure  
and budgets
• the monitoring of operating and ﬁnancial performance
• the prioritisation and allocation of resources and
• the oversight of group wide initiatives and investments.
Other members of the Executive Committee are Martin Bennett, Johnathan Ford, David Bower, 
Tom Rusin, Chief Executive O‡cer of HomeServe USA, Stephen Phillips, Chief Executive O‡cer 
of HomeServe Spain and Guillaume Huser, Chief Executive O‡cer of HomeServe France. 
The Committee has adopted formal terms of reference.
Risk Committee
A Group Risk Committee, comprising the Executive Directors and other representatives of each 
business, operates across the Group and is chaired by the CFO. Its terms of reference have 
been approved by the Board and its purpose is to advise the Audit & Risk Committee in respect 
of the Group’s risk appetite, to evaluate the risk registers compiled by each of its businesses, to 
monitor the e’ectiveness of action plans for the mitigation of those risks, and to report thereon 
to the Audit & Risk Committee and thereafter to the Board, which retains responsibility for the 
overall evaluation of the Group’s risk management processes.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the beneﬁt of its 
Directors which were in place during the year and remain in force at the date of this report.  
The Company maintains directors’ and o‡cers’ liability insurance for its Directors and o‡cers.
Advice for Directors
The Board has established a formal procedure for Directors wishing to seek independent legal 
and other professional advice and all members of the Board have access to the advice, and 
services of the Company Secretary.
Relationships with shareholders
The Board, on the Company’s behalf, recognises the need to maintain an active dialogue with 
its shareholders. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial O‡cer meet regularly with institutional 
investors and analysts to discuss the Company’s performance and all shareholders have access 
to the Chairman and independent Senior Non-Executive Director, who are available to discuss 
any questions which they may have in relation to the running of the Company. Governance
72
The Board encourages shareholders to attend the Annual General Meeting and is always willing 
to answer questions, either in the meeting itself or, more informally, afterwards. In addition, 
shareholders may contact HomeServe direct, either through the website or by telephone.
The Board recognises the need to ensure that all Directors are fully aware of the views of major 
shareholders. Copies of all analysts’ research relating to the Company are circulated to Directors 
upon publication. The Board receives a monthly Investor Relations report which includes 
an analysis of the Company’s shareholder register as well as any feedback received from 
shareholders and analysts.
Viability statement and going concern
The viability statement and going concern are contained within the Strategic report.
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing 
its e’ectiveness. The Audit & Risk Committee has a key role to play in overseeing internal 
controls and advising the Board thereon. More detail in respect of the role of the Audit & Risk 
Committee is provided in the report of that committee.
The Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the Company to the Group Chief 
Executive and the other Executive Directors. The system of internal control is designed to 
manage and mitigate rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Board conﬁrms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the risks faced by the Company. This has been in place for the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts. The process is regularly reviewed by the 
Board and accords with the Turnbull Guidance. The key elements of the control framework and 
review processes in place across the Group are as follows:
• The Group’s strategy is set by the Board and three year business plans, annual budgets and 
investment proposals for each business are formally prepared, reviewed and approved by 
the Board.
• The Group’s management operates a formal process for identifying, managing and 
reporting on operational and ﬁnancial risks faced by each of the Group’s businesses. Risks 
are reviewed in detail at local risk committees and, on an overall basis, by the Group Risk 
Committee and the Audit & Risk Committee. 
• The Group Risk Committee meets three times a year and reviews a register summarising 
the signiﬁcant risks faced by the businesses or the Group as a whole, the likelihood of those 
risks occurring and the steps being taken to minimise or otherwise manage those risks. 
Regular updates are provided to the Audit & Risk Committee and the Board.
• The Audit & Risk Committee meets three times a year and reviews the risk registers in order 
to advise the Board on current risk exposures and future risk strategy. More detail is provided 
in the report of the Audit & Risk Committee.
Corporate Governance report (continued) 73
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
• A clearly deﬁned organisation structure is in place with clear lines of accountability and 
appropriate division of duties. The Group’s ﬁnancial regulations specify authorisation 
limits for individual managers and for local Boards of management, with all material 
transactions being approved by the Board.
• Regular telephone meetings of the Executive Committee monitor day to day 
performance, and full Executive Committee meetings are held at least six times a year at 
which the Directors report on the progress of the companies or discipline for which they 
are responsible and share best practice. 
• Consolidated ﬁnancial results, including a comparison with budgets and forecasts, 
are reported to the Board on a monthly basis, with variances being identiﬁed and 
understood so that mitigating actions can be implemented, where appropriate.
• The consolidated accounts are reviewed by the Executive Directors and veriﬁed by the 
ﬁnance team. The accounts are then considered by the Audit & Risk Committee which 
makes a recommendation in respect of their approval to the Board. The Board then 
reviews and approves the accounts prior to the announcement of the half year and 
annual results.
• At the end of the year, the Executive Directors compile a report identifying the key risks 
faced by the Group. This report is considered by the Audit & Risk Committee and by the 
Board before the Annual Report and Accounts is approved.
• The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit function and a formal audit plan is in place to 
address the key risks across the Group.
• Appropriate treasury policies are in place.
• A whistle blowing policy allows employees, franchisees and sub-contractors who wish 
to raise any issues of concern relating to the Group’s activities to do so on a conﬁdential 
basis by contacting an external hotline. 
• A mechanism exists to extend the Group’s formal risk management processes to any 
signiﬁcant new business acquired or established immediately upon acquisition or 
start-up. In this way, the Board is able to conﬁrm that the necessary process has been 
operated by the Group for the whole of the year.
As required by the Turnbull Guidance, the Board, supported by the Audit & Risk Committee, 
carries out an annual assessment of the e’ectiveness of the system of internal controls.

Members
Mark Morris (Chairman)

Ben Mingay
The Audit & Risk Committee is chaired by Mark Morris who has recent and relevant ﬁnancial 
experience. He worked in audit, business advisory and corporate ﬁnance before becoming a 
plc Finance Director and previously chaired the Audit Committee of LSL Property Services plc.
The internal and external auditors, the Chief Financial O‡cer, the Chief Executive O‡cer 
and the Chairman are invited, but are not entitled, to attend all meetings. Where appropriate, 
other Executive Directors and managers also attend meetings at the Chairman’s invitation. 
The external and internal auditors are provided with the opportunity to raise any matters 
or concerns that they may have, in the absence of the Executive Directors, whether at 
Committee meetings or, more informally, outside of them.
Responsibilities
The primary responsibilities of the Committee are to:
• monitor, on behalf of the Board, compliance with and the e’ectiveness of, the Company’s 
accounting and internal control systems

Summary of meetings in the year
The Committee usually meets three times in the year and did so in FY17. During the year the 
agenda has included the following items:
• Half year results
• Full year results
• Principal judgemental accounting matters
• External audit plans and reports
• Internal audit plans and reports
• Risk assessments and reports
• Updates on regulatory compliance activity
• Updates on certain key risks, in particular, information security 
• Whistleblower reports
• Internal audit e’ectiveness and independence
• External audit e’ectiveness and independence.
Audit & Risk Committee report (continued) 77
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The Committee meets privately, without any of the Executive Directors or management 
present, with the external and internal auditors after each Committee meeting.
The Chairman of the Committee provides an update in respect of the matters discussed to 
the Board after each Committee meeting and the minutes of meetings are circulated to the 
whole Board.
Signiﬁcant issues related to the ﬁnancial statements
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and 
whether management has made appropriate estimates and judgements. Management 
prepares papers providing details on the key judgements and these are reviewed by the 
Committee. 
The Committee also reviews reports from the external auditor on the half year and full year 
results, which provide an overview of the audit work undertaken and highlight any issues for 
discussion.
The signiﬁcant issues considered in the year were:
• revenue recognition, speciﬁcally the timing of when to recognise revenue so that 
su‡cient revenue is deferred to cover future obligations
• the carrying value of intangible assets (speciﬁcally acquisition intangible assets) and 
goodwill arising on the purchase of businesses and books of policies and customers
• accounting in respect of new customers acquired through the Endesa, Suez and Enel 
‘Sales Through Service’ channels
• accounting for the acquisition of USP, including the value of the acquisition intangible 
and deferred tax assets to recognise.
The Committee addressed these matters using reports presented by management which 
set out the basis for the assumptions used. All of the issues were also discussed with the 
external auditor and its views were taken into account. The Committee is satisﬁed that the 
judgements made are reasonable and appropriate disclosures have been included in the 
accounts.
External auditor
The Committee is responsible for assessing the e’ectiveness of the external audit process, 
for monitoring the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and for making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of the external auditor. The 
Committee is also responsible for developing and implementing the Group’s policy on the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor.  Governance
78
The Committee has agreed and implemented a procedure for reviewing and assessing 
its own e’ectiveness and that of the internal and external audit process. The Committee 
reviews the performance of the external auditor annually. 
Deloitte LLP has been the Group’s auditor since 2002, although the lead audit partner 
rotates every ﬁve years.
During the year the external auditor presented its transparency report to the Committee, 
which is intended to demonstrate the steps it takes to ensure audit quality with reference 
to the Audit Quality Framework issued by the Professional Oversight Board of the Financial 
Reporting Council. The Committee also considered whether the auditor’s understanding 
of the Group’s business and its understanding of the sectors in which the Group operates, 
including the regulatory landscape, was appropriate to the Group’s needs. It also assessed 
the performance of the audit, the auditor’s conduct of its relationship with the Group and 
the requirements of the Group’s ﬁnancial control process. On this basis, the Committee 
concluded that the needs of the Group would not be best served by putting the external 
audit out to tender at this time. The Committee has therefore recommended to the Board 
that the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP should be proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
The Committee has noted the recent changes to EU audit legislation and the UK adoption  
of this legislation, which will require mandatory rotation for auditors of public interest entities 
at least every 20 years with a mandatory tender process being undertaken at the 10 year 
point. The transitional rules for this new legislation mean that the Group would be required 
to change its auditor after 2024. A recommended course of action will be proposed to the 
Board in due course. The Committee has not identiﬁed any factors which might restrict its 
choice of external auditor.
The Committee has implemented a policy relating to the use of the external auditors for 
non-audit services and monitors fees paid in respect of such services. This policy provides 
that the total fees payable to the auditor for non-audit related work in any ﬁnancial year 
should not normally be more than 100% of the total fees payable in respect of audit and 
compliance services. In addition, any proposed spend over a predetermined limit must be 
approved by the Committee. 
The policy has been updated in respect of FY18 and beyond to comply with EU audit 
regulation reforms.
The fees payable to the auditor for non-audit related work (excluding audit-related 
assurance services) totalled £366,000 and the fees payable in respect of audit and audit-
related assurance services totalled £704,000 . Further detail on the fees paid is provided in 
Note 6. 
Audit & Risk Committee report (continued) 79
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
In accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) 260 and Ethical 
Statement 1 issued by the Accounting Practices Board, and as a matter of best practice,  
the external auditor has conﬁrmed its independence as auditor of the Company.
Risk management and internal control
As stated in the Corporate Governance report, the Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its e’ectiveness. The Audit & Risk 
Committee supports the Board by advising on the Group’s overall risk appetite, tolerance 
and strategy, current risk exposures and future risk strategy. The Committee reviews risk 
registers produced by the management of each business and the plc function at each of its 
meetings. On a periodic basis, it also reviews action plans in respect of signiﬁcant risks. 
The Committee also monitors, on behalf of the Board, the e’ectiveness of the Company’s 
accounting and internal control systems. In fulﬁlling this responsibility, the Committee 
receives reports from management and the internal and external auditors.
Further details in respect of risk management and controls are set out in the Corporate 
Governance report.
Internal audit 
The Committee considers and approves the internal audit plan which is based on an 
assessment of the key risks faced by the Group. Progress in respect of the plan is monitored 
throughout the year and care is taken to ensure that the internal audit function has su‡cient 
resource to complete the plan. The audit plan may be reviewed during the year as a result of 
the ongoing assessment of the key risks or in response to the needs of the Group. 
The Assurance & Risk Director reports ultimately to the Chairman of the Committee 
although he reports on a day-to-day basis to the Chief Financial O‡cer. He attends all 
meetings of the Committee and reports regularly to the Group Risk Committee. A report 
on completed internal audits is presented to the Committee and, where appropriate, action 
plans are reviewed. In addition, all grade 1 audit reports are circulated to the Committee as 
soon as they are ﬁnalised so any issues can be addressed in a timely manner.
During the year, an external review of the e’ectiveness of the internal audit function was 
completed by PwC. The review concluded that the function was operating e’ectively but a 
number of improvement recommendations were made which will be implemented over the 
coming year.

23 May 2017 Remuneration report
Governance
80
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2017. It is 
three years since we initially sought shareholder approval for our remuneration policy 
so we will be seeking re-approval at the forthcoming AGM. 
Performance and reward
It has been a very good year for the Group. We have delivered strong proﬁt growth and all of 
our established businesses have performed well. In particular, we have seen a rapid period of 
expansion in North America where there have been record partner signings and signiﬁcant 
growth in customer numbers. 
The stretching ﬁnancial and non ﬁnancial targets for the Group have been met with improved 
performance in respect of customer satisfaction. In the UK, the cash target was not met and 
the target in respect of core renewable customers was only partially met. The other UK targets 
were met in full.
In respect of longer-term performance, the LTIP awards granted in 2013 vested in full during 
the year with HomeServe’s TSR at the end of the performance period being 114.1% compared 
to the FTSE 250 Index TSR of 30.1%. Based on TSR performance to 31 March 2017 of 91.9% 
compared to the FTSE 250 Index TSR of 25.7%, it is expected that the awards granted in 2014 
will also vest in full.
Following Johnathan Ford’s appointment as COO, his salary was increased by 6.6% to 
£400,000. This increase reﬂected the change in his responsibilities and the importance of  
the role.
The Committee is satisﬁed that the remuneration paid to the Executive Directors in the year 
fairly reﬂects both corporate and individual performance during the year.
The Committee’s activities during the year are described in more detail later in this report. 81

Remuneration policy FY18
We will be re-submitting the remuneration policy to shareholders for approval at the AGM.  
The policy has been updated for a number of operational changes in respect of how it is 
applied but is largely unchanged from 2014. The key operational changes since 2014 have 
been:
• The addition of a two year post vesting holding period to awards granted under the LTIP 
which provides a 5 year perspective to the incentive programme
• An increase in the shareholding requirement for Directors from 100% of salary or fees  
to 200%
• A rebalancing of the bonus objectives to increase the focus on ﬁnancial measures
• An amendment to Richard Harpin’s contract to remove the entitlement to bonus in any 
payment in lieu of notice.
Recovery and withholding policies are in place and we are comfortable that our approach is 
robust and workable should these provisions ever need to be operated.
Salaries will increase by 1.5% with e’ect from 1 July 2017 in line with the average increase for 
the UK workforce and the maximum bonus opportunity remains unchanged at 100% of salary. 
Bonus remains strongly linked to customer measures in line with the business strategy, subject 
to a’ordability underpins. Details of the performance targets used and performance against 
them will be disclosed in next year’s report.
The FY18 Performance Share award for Executive Directors will be at 150% of salary.
Share awards are granted under the HomeServe 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), 
shareholder approval for which will expire in July 2018.  The Remuneration Committee will 
review the long-term incentive provision during the course of the year and consult with major 
shareholders prior to the introduction of a replacement plan at the 2018 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee is satisﬁed that the remuneration policy continues to work 
e’ectively and supports our strategy as an entrepreneurial, customer focused business.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
 
Remuneration report (continued) 83
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
This report has been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements for directors’ 
pay - Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The report also satisﬁes the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied 
with the provisions relating to directors’ remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Unless otherwise stated, this report is unaudited.
The Directors’ remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and 
as required under the regulations, will be re-submitted to shareholders for approval at the 
2017 AGM. There are no material changes to the policy from that previously approved by 
shareholders. Details of minor operational changes to the policy are set out in the Chairman’s 
letter.
Remuneration policy
The Committee’s policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors and other senior 
Executives is based on the following principles: 
• to align rewards with the Group’s ﬁnancial and operational performance
• to ensure that remuneration, in particular, variable pay, supports the Group’s strategy as a 
customer focused operation
• to promote high levels of executive share ownership to encourage a long-term focus and 
alignment of interest between executives and shareholders
• to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives.
To that end, the Committee structures executive remuneration in two distinct parts: 
ﬁxed remuneration of basic salary, pension and beneﬁts and variable performance-
related remuneration in the form of a cash bonus and long-term incentive arrangements. 
Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that the variable pay element forms a 
signiﬁcant portion of each Director’s package. 
The Committee is satisﬁed that neither the structure of the remuneration packages, with the 
high weighting on variable pay, nor the performance measures targeted under the annual 
bonus and long-term incentive arrangements, encourages inappropriate risk taking. 
The remuneration arrangements are designed so as to provide a strong alignment of interest 
between the Executives and shareholders and to support the growth and performance 
aspirations of the Company. The Committee is satisﬁed that the current arrangements meet 
these objectives. Furthermore there is a clawback provision in respect of annual bonuses and 
long-term incentive awards which helps to guard further against excessive risk-taking. 
A risk review of the remuneration policy has been completed.  Governance

Summary of components of Executive Directors’ remuneration
The table below summarises the Committee’s policy for the remuneration of Executive 
Directors. 
Element Purpose and link to 
strategy
Performance 
Period
Operation (including performance measures and 
maximum limits)
Basic salary To reﬂect the particular 
skills and experience 
of an individual and to 
provide a competitive 
base salary compared 
with similar roles in 
similar companies.
Usually 
reviewed 
annually, with 
any changes 
normally 
taking e’ect 
from 1 July 
each year.
Individual pay is determined by the Committee 
taking into account the role, responsibilities, 
performance and experience of the individual and 
market data on comparable roles.
The Committee has not set a cap on the maximum 
salary level that may be o’ered. However, any salary 
increases will normally be no higher than the typical 
level of increase awarded to other UK employees.
Increases above this level may be o’ered in 
certain circumstances such as where an Executive 
Director has been promoted, has had a change in 
responsibility, to reﬂect increased experience in the 
role, or where there has been a signiﬁcant change 
in the size and/or scope of the business.
When reviewing salary increases, the Committee 
also takes into account the impact of any increase 
to base salaries on the total remuneration package.
Details of the current salaries of the Executive 
Directors are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. 
Performance 
related bonus
The annual bonus is 
designed to drive and 
reward the short-term 
operating performance 
of the Company and 
encourage the delivery 
of consistently good 
customer outcomes. 
Annual 
(determined 
after the year 
end).
Annual bonuses are determined by reference 
to performance against a mix of ﬁnancial, non 
ﬁnancial and personal objectives. Before any bonus 
is payable a minimum level of both customer and 
ﬁnancial performance must be achieved.
Bonuses are based on Group performance and, if 
relevant, the speciﬁc territory for which an Executive 
Director is responsible. Individual performance 
accounts for no more than 20% of the overall bonus 
opportunity.
The maximum potential quantum is 100% of salary.
A minimum level of both customer and ﬁnancial 
performance must be achieved before any bonus 
becomes payable.
Bonuses are payable in cash but may be voluntarily 
deferred by the executive into shares under the 
matching element of the LTIP.

Long-term 
incentives
To drive long-term 
delivery of the 
Group’s objectives, 
to align Directors’ 
interests with those 
of the Company’s 
shareholders and to 
encourage exceptional 
performance.
Three years Awards of performance and matching shares are 
granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan (which 
was approved by shareholders in 2008). 
The maximum limit is 200% of salary for 
performance share awards (normally, awards of 
150% of salary are made to the Executive Directors) 
and a maximum 2:1 match on voluntary investment 
of bonus into shares. 
The maximum amount of bonus that may be 
invested is set at 75% of the maximum bonus 
potential (i.e. 75% of salary). If the bonus earned 
is less than 25% of salary, then the executive may 
invest the equivalent of 25% of salary, from their 
own money, in shares to receive a matching award. 
In determining the number of matching awards to 
be granted, the investment is deemed to be made 
gross of tax.
Dividend equivalents may be awarded on shares 
vesting under the Plan.
Both performance and matching awards are 
currently subject to the same performance 
conditions which are based on challenging 
earnings per share and relative Total Shareholder 
Return targets. Performance is measured over a 
performance period of at least three years and, 
for awards granted in FY16 onwards, a two year 
post vesting holding period applies. Di’erent 
measures may be applied for future award cycles as 
appropriate to reﬂect the business strategy.
Pension To provide beneﬁts 
comparable with 
similar roles in similar 
companies.
N/A Executive Directors may receive a pension 
allowance of up to 20% of salary, to be paid, subject 
to the scheme limits, into the HomeServe Money 
Plan (a money purchase pension scheme) and/or 
taken as a cash allowance in lieu.
Richard Harpin currently continues to participate in 
the Water Companies Pension Scheme (a deﬁned 
beneﬁt scheme which is closed to new members). 
Retirement beneﬁts under the scheme are restricted 
by a notional earnings cap (£136,710 for FY17). An 
unapproved pension contribution equal to 20% 
of the amount by which basic salary exceeds the 
notional cap is provided.  Governance

Other beneﬁts Provides a competitive 
package of beneﬁts to 
assist with recruitment 
and retention of sta’.
N/A Other beneﬁts include a fully expensed car (or cash 
alternative), fuel allowance, private health cover 
(for the individual, partner and dependant children), 
death in service beneﬁts (up to 8 x salary) and 
permanent health insurance.
Other beneﬁts may be provided as appropriate 
and Directors can access HomeServe products 
and services on the same terms as o’ered to 
employees.
Any reasonable business related expenses (including 
tax thereon) may be reimbursed.
There is no maximum limit on the value of the 
beneﬁts provided but the Committee monitors the 
total cost of the beneﬁt provision.
All Employee 
Share Plans
To encourage 
employee share 
ownership.
N/A The Executive Directors may participate in any 
HMRC tax-advantaged all employee share plans 
o’ered by the Company on the same terms as 
other employees, subject to limits on the level of 
individual participation as set by HMRC. 
Chairman and 
Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees
To attract and retain 
Non-Executive 
Directors of the right 
calibre.
N/A Non-Executive Director fees are determined by the 
Board. The fees for the Chairman are determined by 
the Remuneration Committee taking into account 
the views of the Chief Executive. The Chairman 
excludes himself from such discussions.
The fee levels are reviewed periodically and are set 
to reﬂect the responsibilities and time commitment 
of the role and the experience of the individual. Fee 
levels are set by reference to rates in companies of 
comparable size and complexity. The fees for the 
Non-Executive directors comprise a basic Board fee, 
with additional fees paid for chairing a Committee 
or for the Senior Independent Directorship. The 
Chairman receives an all encompassing fee for  
his role.
In exceptional circumstances, additional fees may 
be payable to reﬂect a substantial increase in time 
commitment. The fees are paid monthly in cash.
Any reasonable business related expenses (including 
tax thereon) may be reimbursed.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors may be 
eligible to access HomeServe products and services 
on the same terms as o’ered to employees.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Rationale behind performance metrics and targets
The Remuneration Committee works hard to ensure that the remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors supports the business strategy, and that the level of remuneration received 
is reﬂective of the overall business performance and the returns received by shareholders. 
A signiﬁcant proportion of the remuneration package comes from variable pay with careful 
consideration given to the choice of performance metrics to ensure that the executives are 
not encouraged to take inappropriate risks. 
Annual Bonus
The annual bonus is designed to drive and reward strong short-term operating performance. 
No annual bonus is paid unless a high level of performance is achieved. The Committee 
reviews the annual bonus plan measures annually in order to ensure that they are aligned 
with the Group’s strategy and so that bonus arrangements are consistent amongst the senior 
executive team. Performance targets are set at the start of the ﬁnancial year and are linked to 
the Group’s strategic and operational objectives. The customer focused culture across our 
business is reﬂected in the use of non ﬁnancial metrics in the annual bonus scheme. These are 
balanced by the use of ﬁnancial targets and personal objectives used to reﬂect other strategic 
priorities. 
The Committee retains the discretion to alter the choice and weighting of the metrics for 
future bonus cycles to reﬂect the changing needs of the business. The payment of any bonus 
is at the discretion of the Committee and bonuses will only be paid once a minimum level of 
customer and ﬁnancial performance is achieved. 
LTIP
Long-term incentive awards will be granted in accordance with the rules of the shareholder 
approved HomeServe 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) (and any subsequent replacement 
plan) and the discretions contained therein. The performance measures for the matching and 
performance awards are set using a sliding scale of targets and no more than 25% of the award 
(under each measure) will vest for achieving the threshold performance hurdle.
The choice of measures may change for future award cycles, but is currently based on the 
following:
Metric Link to strategy
Earnings per share (EPS) This provides an assessment of the proﬁtability of the Group over the 
longer-term and is strongly aligned to the execution of the business strategy. 
Challenging targets are set for each award cycle based on internal and 
external forecasts.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) This measures the total return to shareholders provided through share price 
appreciation and dividends. TSR is measured relative to the performance 
of the FTSE 250 Index. TSR provides a clear alignment between the value 
created for shareholders and the reward earned by executives. Governance
88
The Committee would consult with shareholders in advance of a change in the choice or 
weighting of the performance measures to be applied to future award cycles.
Under the rules of the plan, the Committee has the discretion to adjust the targets applying to 
existing awards in exceptional circumstances providing the new targets are no less challenging 
than originally envisaged. The Committee also has the power to adjust the number of shares 
subject to an award in the event of a variation in the capital of the Company.
Awards under the LTIP may be granted as conditional allocations or nil (or nominal) cost 
options with, or as, forfeitable shares. The Committee may also decide to grant cash based 
awards of an equivalent value to share based awards or to satisfy share based awards in cash, 
although it does not currently intend to do so. Awards are satisﬁed through a mixture of either 
market purchase or new issue shares. To the extent new issue shares are used, the 2008 LTIP 
will adhere to a 5% in 10 year dilution limit.
A post vesting holding period was introduced for awards granted in FY16 onwards. There 
will be a minimum period of ﬁve years from the date of grant of an award before shares can 
be sold. To the extent that nil cost options are exercised after the three year vesting point, 
but before ﬁve years, the net of tax value of the vested shares must continue to be held. The 
dividend roll up on unexercised nil cost options will continue until ﬁve years from grant. This 
ﬁve year view provides a longer-term perspective to the incentive programme than the three 
year performance period.
Clawback
The Committee has the power to reclaim some, or all, of a cash bonus and vested LTIP awards 
(performance and matching) in exceptional circumstances, such as misstatement of ﬁnancial 
results, an error in assessment of performance, the use of misleading information and/or gross 
misconduct on the part of the individual. 
Pensions
Richard Harpin participates on a non-contributory basis in a funded, HMRC approved 
occupational deﬁned beneﬁt scheme (with beneﬁts limited to a notional capped salary) which 
is closed to new members. An unapproved pension contribution is paid in respect of basic 
salary above the cap.
The main features of the scheme are:
• pension at normal retirement age of one-half of ﬁnal pensionable salary and a tax free 
lump sum of one and a half times ﬁnal pensionable salary on completion of 40 years’ 
service at an accrual rate of 80ths plus 3/80ths cash
• life assurance of ﬁve times basic salary
• pension payable in the event of ill health; and spouse’s pension on death
• normal retirement at age 60.
Remuneration report (continued) 89
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Shareholding guidelines
It is the Board’s policy that Directors build up and retain a minimum shareholding in the 
Company. Each Director is encouraged to hold shares of at least equal value to two times their 
annual basic salary or fee. 
If the holding guideline has not been fulﬁlled at the point of exercise of any option or the 
vesting of any other long-term incentive award, the Director must retain 50% of the net 
proceeds in the Company’s shares until the holding requirement is achieved. Details of the 
current shareholdings of the Directors are provided later in this report.
How employees’ pay is taken into account
The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed with regard to the policy for 
employees across the Group as a whole. Our ability to meet our growth expectations and 
compete e’ectively is dependent on the skills, experience and performance of all of our 
employees. Our employment policies, remuneration and beneﬁt packages for employees are 
regularly reviewed. 
There are some di’erences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors and senior management team compared to other employees reﬂecting their 
di’ering responsibilities, with the principal di’erence being the increased emphasis on 
performance related pay for the more senior executives within the organisation. However, 
there are many common themes. For example, the structure of the annual bonus, with the 
focus on ﬁnancial, non ﬁnancial and personal performance, is the same for employees at 
management grade and above. 
Employee share ownership is encouraged and facilitated through extending participation 
in the LTIP to other senior leaders within the business and all eligible employees are able to 
participate in the HomeServe One Plan, a share incentive plan.
Although the Committee does not consult directly with employees on directors’ pay, the 
Committee does take into consideration the pay and employment conditions of all employees 
when setting the policy for directors’ remuneration. In terms of comparison metrics, the 
Committee takes into account the average level of salary increase being budgeted for the UK 
workforce when reviewing the salary levels of the Executive Directors. The Committee is also 
mindful of any changes to the pay and beneﬁt conditions for employees more generally when 
considering the policy for directors’ pay. 
How shareholders’ views are taken into account
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received regarding the Remuneration report 
annually and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally. These views 
are key inputs when shaping remuneration policy. The Committee consults with shareholders 
when considering changes to remuneration arrangements. Governance

Overall balance of measures for variable pay for FY17
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors
The chart below details the composition of each Executive Director’s remuneration 
package and how it varies at di’erent levels of performance under the policy set out above. 
It demonstrates the balance between ﬁxed and variable pay at threshold, on-target and 
maximum performance levels under the normal remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors. 
Assumptions
Fixed ﬁxed pay only (salary plus beneﬁts plus pension). 
On target target annual bonus of 80% of salary plus target LTIP awards of 90% of salary plus matching awards of 90% of salary. 
Maximum maximum annual bonus of 100% of salary plus maximum LTIP awards of 200% of salary plus matching awards of 150% of salary.
Salary levels (on which other elements of the packages are calculated) are based on those applying from July 2017. 
The value of taxable beneﬁts is based on the actual values paid in FY17 apart for David Bower where expected beneﬁts are shown. 
Richard Harpin participates in a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme which has been valued according to BIS regulations. The other Executives receive a pensions 
allowance of 20% of basic salary. The Executive Directors may participate in all-employee share schemes on the same basis as other employees. The 
value that may be received under these schemes is subject to tax approved limits. For simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in these 
schemes has been excluded from the above charts. The chart excludes the impact of share price growth.
David Bower will not receive a matching award in FY18 having only recently been appointed to the Board.

Executive Directors’ service agreements and policy on payments for loss of o¥ce
Under the Executive Directors’ service contracts up to twelve months’ notice of termination of 
employment is required by either party (reduced to six months if following a prolonged period 
of incapacity).
Dates of current contracts are summarised in the table below:
Name Date of contract
R Harpin 18 January 2002
M Bennett 1 January 2013
D Bower 3 February 2017
J Ford 1 October 2012
Should notice be served, the Executives can continue to receive basic salary, beneﬁts and 
pension for the duration of their notice period. The Company may require the individual to 
continue to fulﬁl their current duties, or may assign a period of garden leave. The Company 
applies a general principle of mitigation in relation to termination payments and supports the 
use of phased payments. 
Outplacement services may be provided where appropriate, and any statutory entitlements 
or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination (including, at the 
discretion of the Committee, reimbursement for legal advice) would be paid as necessary.
The service contracts also enable the Company to elect to make a payment in lieu of notice 
equivalent in value to twelve months’ base salary, beneﬁts and pension. Mr Harpin’s contract 
was amended during the year to remove the entitlement to bonus as part of any payment in 
lieu of notice.
In the event of cessation of employment, the executives may still be eligible for a performance 
related bonus for the period worked. Di’erent performance measures may be set to reﬂect 
changes in the director’s responsibilities until the point of departure.
The rules of the LTIP set out what happens to outstanding share awards if a participant leaves 
employment before the end of the vesting period. Generally, any outstanding share awards 
will lapse when an Executive leaves employment, except in certain circumstances. If the 
Executive leaves employment as a result of redundancy, death, ill-health, injury, disability, 
retirement, transfer of employment or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee, 
then they will be treated as a ‘good leaver’ under the plan rules. 
For a good leaver, any outstanding unvested LTIP awards will vest on the normal vesting date 
subject to an assessment of performance, with a pro-rata reduction to reﬂect the proportion 
of the vesting period served. The Committee may dis-apply the time pro-rating requirement 
if it considers it appropriate to do so. In the case of cessation due to death, the Committee 
can determine that the awards vest early. Outstanding vested but not exercised awards can be 
exercised by a good leaver until the expiry of the normal exercise period (or within 12 months 
in the case of death). Governance
92
In determining whether an Executive should be treated as a good leaver and the extent to 
which their award may vest, the Committee will take into account the circumstances of an 
individual’s departure. 
The treatment of share awards on a change of control is the same as that set out above in 
relation to a good leaver (albeit with the vesting period automatically ending on the date of 
the change in control). 
Recruitment Policy
Base salary levels will be set in accordance with HomeServe’s remuneration policy, taking 
account of the executive’s skills, experience and their current remuneration package. Where 
it is appropriate to o’er a lower salary initially, a series of increases to the desired salary 
positioning may be given over subsequent years subject to individual performance. Beneﬁts 
will generally be provided in accordance with the approved policy, with relocation expenses 
and/or an expatriate allowance paid for if necessary. For an overseas appointment (which may 
include the relocation of an existing Director), the beneﬁt and pension arrangements may be 
tailored to reﬂect local market practice (subject to the overall maximum limits on pension set 
out in the policy table).
The structure of the variable pay element will be in accordance with HomeServe’s policy as 
detailed above. The maximum permitted variable pay opportunity is 450% of salary (100% of 
salary bonus + 200% of salary LTIP + 150% of salary matching award). However, the normal 
award limits are a bonus of 100% of salary, a performance share award of 150% of salary and 
up to a 150% of salary matching award. In the case of the matching awards, a new recruit 
may be invited to invest up to 25% of salary from their own funds in the ﬁrst year in order to 
receive a matching award (in determining the number of matching awards to be granted, the 
investment is deemed to be made gross of tax). LTIP awards may be made shortly following an 
appointment (assuming the Company is not in a closed period).
The performance and matching awards would be granted on a consistent basis to the other 
Executive Directors. In the case of the annual bonus, di’erent performance measures may be 
set for the ﬁrst year, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual and the point in 
the ﬁnancial year at which they joined. If it is necessary to buy-out incentive pay (which would 
be forfeited on leaving the previous employer) in order to secure the appointment, this would 
be provided for taking into account the form (cash or shares), timing and expected value (i.e. 
likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria) of the remuneration being forfeited. 
The LTIP permits the grant of restricted share awards to Executive Directors in the case of 
recruitment to facilitate this, although awards may also be granted outside of this scheme if 
necessary, and as permitted under s.9.4.2.2 of the Listing Rules. 
The service contract for a new appointment would be in accordance with the policy for the 
current Executive Directors.
Remuneration report (continued) 93
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous 
role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be set in line with the approved 
policy.
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
Non-Executive Directors serve under letters of appointment for periods of three years. The 
Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) have a notice period of three months but 
no liquidated damages are payable. 
Fees are determined by the Executive Directors within the limits set by the Articles of 
Association, and are based on information on fees paid in similar companies and the skills and 
the expected time commitment of the individual concerned.

Annual Report on Remuneration
This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with Part 3 of the revised Schedule 
8 set out in The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports)

Remuneration Committee Members
Stella David (Chairman)
JM Barry Gibson
Mark Morris
Ben Mingay 
All of the members are independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board determined that 
the Company Chairman, Barry Gibson, should remain a member of the Committee taking 
account of the fact that he was considered to be independent on appointment and also that, 
as a former Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, his knowledge of the development 
of the remuneration policy and practices at HomeServe is invaluable. He takes no part in 
discussions relating to his own remuneration. 
Responsibilities
The primary responsibilities of the Committee are to:
• determine the Group’s overall remuneration strategy
• determine the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and other members of 
the Executive Committee
• approve the grant and exercise of executive long-term incentive arrangements and 
oversee the operation of other share-based plans across the Group. 
In determining remuneration policy, the Committee is free to obtain such professional advice 
as it sees ﬁt, and it periodically monitors both the policies of comparator companies and 
current market practice in order to ensure that the packages provided are su‡cient to attract 
and retain Executive Directors of the necessary quality.
The Committee aims to develop and recommend remuneration strategies that drive 
performance and reward it appropriately. In determining its policy, the Committee has paid 
regard to the principles and provisions of good governance contained in the Code and the 
guidelines issued by institutions such as the Investment Association, ISS and the NAPF. The 
Committee operates under the delegated authority of the Board and its terms of reference are 
available on the website. 
Remuneration report (continued) 95
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Board. No Director is involved in 
determining his or her own remuneration.
The Committee has agreed and implemented a procedure for reviewing and assessing its own 
e’ectiveness.
Advisers
During the year New Bridge Street (’NBS‘), a ﬁrm of independent remuneration consultants, 
served as advisers to the Committee. NBS also provided technical implementation and 
accounting advice in relation to the administration of the Company’s share schemes. Other 
than in relation to advice on remuneration, NBS has no other connections with the Company. 
NBS is a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd, the ultimate parent company of which is Aon plc. Aon 
UK Ltd (another Aon company) provides insurance broking services to HomeServe and Aon 
Risk Services Ltd provides health and safety assurance services. The Remuneration Committee 
is comfortable that this does not present a conﬂict of interest as Aon UK and NBS operate 
entirely independently of one another. The fees paid to NBS during the year for services to the 
Committee were £31,000.
The Committee has also received assistance from Richard Harpin, Group Chief Executive, Emma 
Thomas, Group Legal and HR Director and Anna Maughan, Company Secretary, all of whom 
attended meetings of the Committee as required. No Executive took part in discussions in 
respect of matters relating directly to their own remuneration.  Governance

102
The performance awards up to 150% of salary and the matching awards are subject to two 
performance conditions. 25% of the awards are subject to a relative total shareholder return 
performance condition that requires HomeServe’s TSR to match that of the FTSE 250 Index 
over a three year performance period for threshold vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis 
to Index + 15% pa. for full vesting. The other 75% of the awards are subject to an earnings per 
share condition that requires compound annual EPS growth of 6% to 15% per annum. 6% 
growth would result in threshold vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting if 
growth of 15% per annum is achieved. 
The performance awards over the remaining 50% of salary are subject to an earnings per share 
condition that requires compound annual growth of 15% to 20% pa. for between 0% and 100% 
of this part of the awards to vest.
As set out in last year’s report, the Committee considered that granting awards at this level was 
appropriate given the stretching performance conditions attached.  Major shareholders were 
consulted prior to the awards being made and were supportive of the proposals.
Vesting is also subject to underlying ﬁnancial performance.

Shareholding Guidelines (Audited)
It is the Board’s policy that Executive Directors build up and retain a minimum shareholding in 
the Company. Each Director is encouraged to hold shares of at least equal value to 200% of 
their annual basic salary or fee. 
If the holding guideline has not been fulﬁlled at the point of exercise of any option or the 
vesting of any other long-term incentive award, the Director must retain 50% of the net 
proceeds in the Company’s shares until the holding requirement is achieved. Details of the 
current shareholdings of the Directors are in the table below. 
The beneﬁcial interests of Directors who served at the end of the year, together with those of 
their families, in the shares of the Company are as follows:

Percentage change in Chief Executive’s remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s total remuneration 
(excluding the value of any pension, matching awards and performance awards receivable  
in the year) between FY16 and FY17 compared to the average for all employees of  
HomeServe plc.

£7.8m of the sta’ costs ﬁgures relate to pay for the Executive Directors. This is di’erent to the 
aggregate of the single ﬁgures for the year under review due to the way in which the share 
based awards are accounted for.
The dividends ﬁgures relate to amounts payable in respect of the relevant ﬁnancial year. Governance

Loss of O¥ce Payments (Audited)
No payments have been made for loss of o‡ce in the year.
Application of the remuneration policy for FY18
Basic salary
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking 
into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual. Salary 
increases are determined taking into account pay and employment conditions of employees 
elsewhere in the Company and market data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable 
companies in the FTSE 250. 
Salaries are normally reviewed in July each year (unless responsibilities change). Johnathan 
Ford’s salary was increased by 6.6% to £400,000 following his appointment as COO to reﬂect 
his changes in responsibility. This year salaries will increase by 1.5% which is in line with the 
average increase for the UK workforce. 
The salaries for the Executive Directors e’ective from 1 July 2017 will therefore be as follows:
Name of Director
Salary as at 
1 July 2016
Salary as at 
 1 July 2017 Increase
R Harpin £556,875 £565,228 1.5%
M Bennett £413,100 £419,297 1.5%
D Bower ¹ £300,000 £300,000 n/a
J Ford £400,000 £406,000 1.5%
¹ David Bower was appointed on 6 February 2017.
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
As detailed in the remuneration policy, the Company aims to set remuneration for Non-
Executive Directors at a level which is su‡cient to attract and retain Non-Executive Directors 
of the right calibre. The fees paid to the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are 
reviewed periodically. The fees for the Non-Executive Directors were last reviewed during 
FY15. The Chairman’s fee was reviewed in FY16. 
Details of the current fees are detailed in the table below. 
Chairman’s fees £250,000
Senior Independent Director additional fee £7,500
Non-Executive Directors’ base fee £55,000
Chair of Remuneration or Audit & Risk Committee £10,000
Remuneration report (continued) 109
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Annual bonus performance targets
The annual bonus plan for FY18 will operate on a similar basis to FY17 and is consistent with 
the policy detailed earlier in this report. 
The bonus measures will be as follows:
Financial measures (30% of bonus) Non ﬁnancial measures (50% of bonus) Personal objectives (20% of bonus)
• Proﬁt before tax (25%)
• Net debt (5%)
• Customer growth (25%)
• Customer satisfaction (25%)
• Up to ﬁve stretching 
personal objectives
The ﬁnancial and non ﬁnancial measures for Richard Harpin, David Bower and Johnathan 
Ford will be based on Group performance. The ﬁnancial measures for Martin Bennett will 
be based on Group and UK performance and the non ﬁnancial measures will be based 
on UK performance. The Committee considers the forward looking performance targets 
to be commercially sensitive but more detailed disclosure will be provided in next year’s 
remuneration report.
The Committee has discretion to scale back any bonus payments if it is deemed appropriate.
Long-term incentives 
Performance criteria
The long-term incentive plan is a mix of a Performance Share award (up to 200% of salary) and 
a Matching Share award (2:1 match on up to 75% of salary bonus invested in shares). 
In line with the policy, the FY18 Performance Share award for Executive Directors will be at 
150% of salary. 
For Performance Share awards and Matching Share awards, the performance targets for FY18 
grants will be:
FY18 weighting 3 year performance target Change from FY17
75% based on EPS 6% to 15% per annum EPS growth (for 25% to 
100% vesting).
No change
25% based on relative TSR 25% vesting for TSR equal to that of the FTSE 250 
Index increasing on a straight-line basis to full 
vesting for out-performance of the Index by 15% 
per year or more. 
No change
When setting the EPS target range for the FY18 grants, the Committee took into account 
internal projections and external forecasts. Having considered these projections and forecasts, 
the Committee believes that the EPS targets are appropriately stretching.  Governance
110
Holding period for vested shares
The net of tax value of any shares vesting under the LTIP must be held for a further two years, 
providing a longer-term perspective to the incentive programme.
Shareholding guidelines
The minimum required shareholding for each Executive Director will continue to be two times 
annual basic salary. Executives will be required to retain no less than 50% of the net of tax value 
of shares from vested awards until this threshold is exceeded. Shareholding guidelines at two 
times their fee also applies to Non-Executive Directors.

General
The market price of the Company’s shares at 31 March 2017 was £5.65 (2016: £4.306). During 
the year the price ranged from £4.13 to £6.30.
The shares required for share options and awards under any of the long-term incentive 
schemes described above may be fulﬁlled by the purchase of shares in the market by the 
Company’s Employee Beneﬁt Trust (EBT). Awards may also be fulﬁlled through newly issued 
shares, subject to the dilution limits within each scheme (which are fully compliant with 
investor guidelines). As beneﬁciaries under the EBT, the Directors are deemed to be interested 
in the shares held by the EBT which at 31 March 2017 amounted to 31,026 ordinary shares.

Capital Structure
Details of the issued share capital, together with details of shares issued during the year, 
are set out in note 24. There is one class of ordinary shares which carries no right to ﬁxed 
income. Each share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company.
There are no speciﬁc restrictions on the size of a holding or on the transfer of shares, 
which are both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and 
prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of 
the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting 
rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 35. No votes are cast in respect of the 
shares held in the Employee Beneﬁt Trust and dividends are waived.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued 
shares are fully paid. Subject to the Companies Act 2006 and any relevant authority of the 
Company in general meeting, the Company has authority to issue new shares.
The AGM held in 2016 authorised the Directors to allot shares in the capital of the Company 
within certain limited circumstances and as permitted by the Companies Act. A renewal of 
this authority will be proposed at the 2017 AGM. 
Authority to purchase shares
The Company was authorised at the 2016 AGM to purchase its own shares, within certain 
limits and as permitted by the Articles of Association. A renewal of this authority will be 
proposed at the 2017 AGM. No shares were purchased during the year and no shares are 
held in Treasury.
Signiﬁcant agreements – change of control
There are a number of agreements that take e’ect, alter or terminate upon a change 
of control of the Company such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, 
property lease arrangements and employees’ share plans. None of these are considered 
to be signiﬁcant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole. 
Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and its 
Directors and employees that provide for compensation for loss of o‡ce or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts, 
Remuneration report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. 
Under that law, the Directors are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements under 
International Financial Reporting Standards (’IFRSs‘) as adopted by the European Union 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent Company 
ﬁnancial statements under IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Under company law, the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of a’airs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company for 
that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable information; and 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs 
are insu‡cient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance and 
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are su‡cient to 
show and explain the Company’s transactions and that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and 
ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may di’er from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 115

Summary of our audit approach
Key risks
The key risks that we identiﬁed in the current year were:
• carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets;
• cancellation provision and revenue deferrals; and
• the acquisition of Utility Service Partners Inc (“USP”). 
Materiality
The materiality that we applied in the current year was £7.2m which was determined on the 
basis of 7.5% of proﬁt before tax.
Scoping
As in the prior year, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at the 
following components: 
• UK;
• North America;
• France; and
• Spain.
All of these were subject to a full audit, whilst the New Markets segment was subject to 
speciﬁc audit procedures. 
Signiﬁcant changes in our approach 
In comparison to the prior year, we highlight the following changes: 
• we identiﬁed a new key risk in relation to the Group’s acquisition of USP for consideration 
of £60.9m on 1 July 2016; and
• we no longer consider regulatory risk to be a key risk as a result of a reduced level of 
regulatory scrutiny from local regulatory bodies across the Group in recent years.
Other than the change in key risks as described above, there were no other signiﬁcant 
changes in our approach. Financial statements

Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten 
the solvency or liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the 
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 2 to the 
ﬁnancial statements and the directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group 
contained within the strategic report, on page 50.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 42-49 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ conﬁrmation on page 51 that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the directors’ statement in note 2 to the ﬁnancial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
them and their identiﬁcation of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of 
the ﬁnancial statements; and
• the directors’ explanation on page 50 as to how they have assessed the prospects of 
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions.
We conﬁrm that we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in respect of these 
matters.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we 
did not identify any such material uncertainties. However, because not all future events 
or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. 121
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors and conﬁrm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulﬁlled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. 
We conﬁrm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also conﬁrm we have not provided 
any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest 
eect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the eorts of 
the engagement team.
Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets  
Risk description
The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is £590.5m (2016: £457.7m). 
The Group’s assessment of the carrying value of goodwill is a judgemental process 
which requires estimates concerning the future cash ﬂows of each cash-generating-
unit and associated discount rates, growth rates, selling prices and direct costs based on 
management’s view of future business prospects. 
The key judgements in relation to other intangible assets relate to the expected future cash 
ﬂows assigned to each intangible asset and the value of costs to capitalise in relation to 
the new CRM system which will be fully implemented within the UK business in FY18. The 
cumulative value of costs capitalised to date in relation to the CRM system is £60.8m.
There is a risk that the management information used to make these judgements is either 
incomplete or inaccurate, and costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalisation are 
included within other intangible assets.
Further detail on the key judgements involved is set out within the Audit and Risk Committee 
report on page 77, signiﬁcant accounting policies in note 2 and the associated key 
judgements involved are set out in the critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty in note 3 to the ﬁnancial statements.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We assessed the design and implementation of controls that the Group has in place to assess 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, speciﬁcally the management 
review process to assess the accuracy and completeness of key assumptions within the 
impairment assessment. Financial statements
122
We challenged management’s assessment of whether there are any impairment indicators 
by considering the performance of each cash-generating-unit as well as any notable 
business developments during the year.
We challenged management’s key assumptions relating to the estimated future cash ﬂows, 
growth rates, selling prices, direct costs and the discount rates applied to each cash-
generating-unit. Our procedures included reviewing forecast cash ﬂows with reference 
to historical trading performance, assessing the Group’s ability to accurately forecast 
business performance, consideration of future prospects of the business and benchmarking 
assumptions such as the discount rate to external macro-economic and market data using 
our internal valuations specialists.
We have reviewed the consistency of the key assumptions used in the carrying value of 
goodwill assessment to the budget used by the Group to assess longer term-viability and 
going concern.  
For other intangible assets we have assessed the key assumptions used within the expected 
future cash ﬂow assessment including the expected retention rates, and tested a sample of 
costs capitalised during the year in relation to the CRM system to assess whether they met 
the recognition criteria for capitalisation. 
Key observations
We concluded that the key assumptions used within management’s goodwill impairment 
assessment were reasonable. 
The key assumptions used within the carrying value of goodwill assessment were consistent 
with the Group’s longer term-viability and going concern assessment.  
We are satisﬁed that the costs capitalised in relation to the CRM system meet the 
recognition criteria for inclusion as an intangible asset.
Cancellation provision and revenue deferrals   
Risk description
The recognition of revenue requires signiﬁcant judgement by management to determine 
key assumptions, particularly regarding the level of revenue to defer in order to satisfy the 
Group’s obligations for future claims handling and policy cancellations. 
The total amount of revenue deferred at 31 March 2017 in respect of the Group’s future 
claim handing obligations is £76.7m (2016: £54.4m) and the amount of revenue provided in 
respect of future cancellations is £18.0m (2016: £16.0m).
The key assumptions used by management for claims handling are the monthly exposures 
to policy claims, frequency of claims per policy type and the average cost per claim. For 
policy cancellations the key assumptions are retention rates and average revenue per policy. 
Independent Auditor’s report  
to the members of HomeServe plc 
(continued) 123
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Further detail on the Group’s revenue recognition policy is set out within the Audit and Risk 
Committee report on page 77, signiﬁcant accounting policies in note 2 and the associated 
key judgements involved are set out in the critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty in note 3 to the ﬁnancial statements.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
We ﬁrst understood management’s process and key controls around the cancellation 
provision and revenue deferrals by undertaking a walk-through. Following identiﬁcation of 
the key controls we evaluated the associated design and implementation of such controls. 
Speciﬁcally, we assessed the implementation of controls that the Group has in place to 
manage the risk of inappropriate assumptions being used within the cancellation provision 
and revenue deferrals.
We assessed the Group’s policy for deferring revenue, including considering whether the 
policy is in accordance with current accounting standards.
We challenged and tested the methodology used for calculating the claims handling 
revenue deferral by comparing the inputs and assumptions used by reference to policy 
agreements, industry data provided by the underwriter and costs incurred in satisfying 
claims in the current ﬁnancial year.
For the policy cancellations provision we have challenged the key assumptions by reference 
to the Group’s previous and recent retention experience and the level of revenue earned per 
policy agreement originated in the current ﬁnancial year. 
Sensitivity analysis was also performed in relation to the key assumptions in order to assess 
the potential for management bias.
Additionally we have assessed if the calculations are consistent across the membership 
businesses worldwide and in line with Group policy. 
Key observations
We were satisﬁed that appropriate revenue deferral policies have been adopted and 
complied with across the Group. 
We identiﬁed no issues with the key controls that we identiﬁed within the UK business. 
We found the models used by management to determine the cancellation provision 
and revenue deferrals to be working as intended and the underlying assumptions were 
reasonable. 
Acquisition of USP  
Risk description
The most signiﬁcant business combination during the year was the acquisition of USP on  
1 July 2016 for total consideration of £60.9m. The acquisition of USP resulted in goodwill  
of £33.2m, intangible assets of £34.8m and deferred tax assets of £11.4m. Financial statements
124
Management are required to calculate the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, 
including identiﬁcation of any intangible assets. We focussed our assessment on the 
recognition and valuation of acquired intangible assets, namely the acquired customer 
back book and acquired partner relationships. Key assumptions in valuing the intangible 
assets included the expected future cash ﬂows and the discount rate applied to these cash 
ﬂows. Changes to these assumptions can have a material impact on the intangible assets 
recognised, as well as the resulting level of goodwill identiﬁed. 
There is also a risk that deferred tax assets in relation to acquired net operating losses are not 
recognised appropriately, which is dependent on the Group being able to access and utilise 
these losses over a number of years.
Further detail on the Group’s approach to accounting for business combinations is set out 
within the signiﬁcant accounting policies in note 2, the associated key judgements involved in 
the valuation of acquisition intangibles are set out in the critical accounting judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty in note 3 and a full breakdown of the identiﬁable assets 
and liabilities acquired is included within note 35.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We assessed the design and implementation of controls that the Group has in place to 
manage the risk of inappropriate assumptions being used within the fair value assessment.
We reviewed the Group’s methodology for accounting for the business combination and 
assessed whether it has been performed in accordance with IFRS 3, as well as the approach 
adopted to the identiﬁcation of the fair value of assets and liabilities.
Internal valuation specialists were engaged to support our assessment of the Group’s 
approach to the fair value assessment, including the identiﬁcation of acquisition intangibles. 
As part of this, an assessment of the appropriateness of key assumptions used to derive the 
expected future cash ﬂows and discount rate was performed.
Internal tax specialists were engaged to assess the appropriateness of the recognition of the 
deferred tax asset in relation to acquired net operating losses by considering the expected 
future proﬁtability of the North America business as well as the Group’s ability to access and 
utilise acquired losses.
Key observations
We concluded that management’s acquisition accounting for USP was performed in 
accordance with IFRS 3 and the key assumptions used within management’s fair value 
assessment were reasonable.
We are satisﬁed that the recognition of a deferred tax asset in relation to acquired net 
operating losses is appropriate.

Our application of materiality
We deﬁne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements that 
makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would 
be changed or inﬂuenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the ﬁnancial statements 
as a whole as follows:
Group materiality
£7.2m (2016: £6.1m).
Basis for determining materiality
7.5% (2016: 7.5%) of proﬁt before tax. 
Rationale for the benchmark applied
We determined materiality using proﬁt before tax as we considered this to be the most 
appropriate measure to assess the performance of the Group.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit 
dierences in excess of £360,000 (2016: £122,000), as well as dierences below that 
threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. The change in the 
reporting threshold has been made following our reassessment of what matters require 
communicating. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we 
identiﬁed when assessing the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its 
environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement 
at the Group level. Based on that assessment, as in the prior year, we focused our Group audit 
scope primarily on the audit work at the following components: 
• UK;
• North America;
• France; and
• Spain.
All of these were subject to a full audit, whilst the New Markets segment was subject to 
speciﬁc audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations at this location. 
The acquisition of USP is included within the North America component and was therefore 
subject to a full audit.
The UK, North America, France and Spain components account for 97.9% (2016: 96.9%) of the 
Group’s revenue and 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s proﬁt before tax from proﬁt-making 
components (there was a loss for the year in the New Markets segment which is not subject 
to a full audit). They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit 
work to address the risks of material misstatement identiﬁed above. Our audit work at the four 
components was executed at levels of materiality ranging from £3.1m to £4.7m (2016: £3.0m 
to £4.6m). 
At the Parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical 
procedures to conﬁrm our conclusion that there were no signiﬁcant risks of material 
misstatement of the aggregated ﬁnancial information of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of speciﬁed account balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been 
designed so that a senior member of the Group audit team visits the UK, North America, 
France and Spain at least once a year. This included participation in their audit close meetings 
and reviewing documentation of the ﬁndings from their work.

Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited ﬁnancial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge 
of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identiﬁed any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee 
which we consider should have been disclosed. 
We conﬁrm that we have not identiﬁed any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and 
Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures 
are eective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial 
statements suªcient to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited ﬁnancial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
1. General information
HomeServe plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address 
of the registered oªce is Cable Drive, Walsall, WS2 7BN.
These ﬁnancial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with 
the policies set out in note 2.
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European 
Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The ﬁnancial statements have been 
prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain ﬁnancial instruments that are measured at fair 
value at the end of each reporting period as explained in note 42.
Adoption of new or revised standards and accounting policies
The following accounting standards have been adopted in the year:
Amendments to IFRS10, Investment Entities – Applying the Consolidation Exception
IFRS12 and IAS28
Amendments to IAS1 Disclosure Initiative
None of the accounting standards listed above have had any material impact on the amounts reported in 
this consolidated set of ﬁnancial statements.
Standards in issue but not yet eŒective
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements the following Standards and Interpretations, 
which have not been applied in these ﬁnancial statements, were in issue but not yet eective (not all of 
which have been endorsed by the EU):
IFRS9  Financial Instruments
IFRS14  Regulatory Deferral Accounts 
IFRS15  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS16  Leases   
Amendments to IFRS2  Classiﬁcation and Measurement of Share-based payment Transactions
Amendments to IFRS4  Applying IFRS9 Financial Instruments with IFRS4 Insurance Contracts
Amendments to IAS12  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
Amendments to IAS7  Disclosure Initiative
Amendments to IAS40  Transfers of Investment Property
Improvements to IFRS   2014-2016 Cycle
IFRIC Interpretation 22  Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
The implementation of IFRS9 may impact both the measurement and disclosures of ﬁnancial 
instruments.  The implementation of IFRS15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related 
disclosures. IFRS16 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of leases.  Beyond the information 
above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the eect of IFRS9, IFRS15 and IFRS16 until 
a detailed review has been performed. We have established a review team and are assessing the impact 
in all of our businesses and expect this to be completed in the coming year. The Directors do not expect 
that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact on 
the ﬁnancial statements of the Group in future years.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to aect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report.
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budget, forecast and cash ﬂows for 2018 and beyond, and 
concluded that they are in line with their expectations with regards to the Group’s strategy and future 
growth plans. In addition the Directors have reviewed the Group’s position in respect of material 
uncertainties and have concluded that there are no items that would aect going concern or that should 
be separately disclosed.
The Directors have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below:
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has 
the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an investee entity, is exposed or has rights to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power to aect  
its returns.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are identiﬁed separately from 
the Group’s equity interest. Non-controlling interests consist of those interests at the date of the original 
business combination and the minority’s share of the changes in equity since the date of  
the combination.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their 
fair values at the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year 
are included in the consolidated income statement from the eective date of acquisition or up to the 
eective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Notes to ﬁnancial statements 
(continued)
Year ended 31 March 2017 137
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Interests in associates 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated into these ﬁnancial statements using 
the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, an interest in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated balance 
sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the proﬁt and loss and other 
comprehensive income of the associate.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The 
consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of 
exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement, as incurred, in administrative expenses.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a 
contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes 
in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period 
(see below) adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration 
classiﬁed as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair 
value of contingent consideration classiﬁed as equity are not recognised.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period 
in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the 
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period 
(see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reﬂect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition-date that, if known, would have aected the 
amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains 
complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, subject to a 
maximum of one year.
Any adjustments to contingent consideration for acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2010 which result in 
an adjustment to goodwill continue to be accounted for under IFRS3 (2004) and IAS27 (2005). Financial statements

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised at cost as an asset at the date control is acquired 
(the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred 
over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identiﬁable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an 
indication that it may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating-
units expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating-unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating-unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 
proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous 
UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written o to reserves 
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent 
proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts 
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT, 
Insurance Premium Tax and other sales related taxes.
Revenue recorded by the Group includes commissions receivable in the Group’s role as an intermediary 
in the policy sale and administration process. Any third-party costs incurred on behalf of the principal that 
are rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the Group’s role is only as an intermediary 
in the cash collection process, are not included in revenue. Consequently, on the sale of a policy, gross 
revenue consists of only a component of the overall policy price, representing the commission receivable 
for the marketing and sale of the policy, stated net of sales related taxes.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to 
customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element 
as if it were an individual contract. Accordingly, revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except 
where an obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims handling and policy administration 
services. In these situations, a proportion of revenue, suªcient to cover future claims handling costs 
and margin, is deferred over the life of the policy, as deferred income. The assessment of future claims 
handling takes account of the expected numbers of claims and the estimated cost of handling those 
claims, which are validated through experience of historical actual costs. 139
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The deferred revenue is released over the expected proﬁle of anticipated claims over the policy period. 
The deferral also includes a proﬁt element to recognise the performance of these services in the future.
Revenue on sales of franchises is recognised when the obligations to the franchisee are complete. 
Revenue on the sale of new franchise licences is recognised upon the signing of the related franchise 
agreement. These franchise fees are non-refundable and primarily relate to initial set-up services.
Repair revenue relates to repairs undertaken on behalf of underwriters subject to separate contractual 
arrangements. Such revenue is recognised on completion of the repair.
Revenue in respect of boiler installations and uninsured jobs is recognised when our performance 
obligations are complete.
Annual service revenue is recognised on completion of the annual service. Ongoing service revenue is 
recognised in equal instalments over the life of the policy.
Marketing expenses
Costs incurred in respect of marketing activity, including for example, direct mail and inbound/outbound 
telephone costs, which is undertaken to acquire or renew a policy, are charged to the income statement 
in the period in which the related marketing campaign is performed.
Marketing expenses also include payments made to Aªnity Partners in recognition of their support for 
the Group’s selling and policy renewal activities. The terms of their support and related payments are 
included in contractual agreements with each Aªnity Partner. Amounts incurred upon the sale and 
renewal of an individual policy by the Group, referred to as Aªnity Partner Commissions, are recognised 
as an operating expense when individual policies incept or renew. Commissions are payable to Aªnity 
Partners only when the Group has collected the premium due on behalf of the third party underwriter 
from the policy holder.
Leasing
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at 
the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁnance lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to 
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the relevant lease. Beneﬁts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are 
also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Financial statements

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies except for those that are designated as long term equity investments, 
are re-translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, with changes taken to the income 
statement. Foreign exchange translation movements on monetary assets that are designated as long 
term equity investments are transferred to the Group’s translation reserve.  Non-monetary items that are 
measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are treated as monetary liabilities and are translated at the rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Exchange rate movements on foreign currency borrowings are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Foreign currency borrowings are not treated as hedges 
of net investments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly. Exchange movements, if any, 
are classiﬁed as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such cumulative exchange 
movements are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating proﬁt
Operating proﬁt is stated after charging all operating costs, but before investment income and  
ﬁnance costs.
Retirement beneﬁt costs
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For deﬁned beneﬁt retirement schemes, the cost of providing beneﬁts is determined using the projected 
unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains 
and losses and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised in full in the period in 
which they occur. They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement  
of comprehensive income. Re-measurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income are  
not recycled.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the beneﬁts are already vested, and is 
otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the beneﬁts become vested. 
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability or asset. 141
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Any retirement beneﬁt obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the 
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value 
of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from the calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present 
value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Any tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on dierences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable proﬁt and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary dierences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible 
temporary dierences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary dierences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary dierence and it is 
probable that the temporary dierence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that suªcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the 
asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when 
it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or within equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are oset when there is a legally enforceable right to set o current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write o the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful 
lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Buildings 25 – 50 years
Furniture, ﬁxtures and equipment 5 – 7 years 
Computer equipment 3 – 7 years
Motor vehicles 3 years (with 25% residual value)
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as 
owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. Financial statements

Intangible assets
Acquisition intangible assets
Acquired access rights relate to the contractual agreements entered into with the former owners of 
businesses acquired as part of business combinations. These agreements set out the contractual terms of 
the Aªnity Partnership and provide the contractual framework within which the Group markets, sells and 
renews policies with the individual customers of the Aªnity Partner. Acquired access rights are recorded 
at fair value by using the estimated and discounted incremental future cash ﬂows resulting from the 
relationship. Acquired access rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, 
which are in the range of 3 - 20 years.
Acquired customer databases represent the value attributable to the portfolios of renewable customer 
policies that exist at the date of acquisition and are acquired by the Group as part of a business 
combination. Acquired customer databases are recorded at fair value using the estimated and discounted 
incremental future cash ﬂows resulting from the future renewal of the portfolio of acquired policies over 
their estimated residual life. Acquired customer databases are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives, which are in the range of 3 - 15 years.
Other intangible assets
Access rights arise from the contractual agreements with Aªnity Partners which provide the contractual 
framework within which the Group markets, sells and renews policies with the individual customers 
of the Aªnity Partner. Access rights are valued at the discounted present value of the contractually 
committed payments, where such payments are not related to the success or otherwise of activity under 
the contractual agreements and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of the contractual 
agreement, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Trademarks represent costs incurred to legally protect the established brand names of the Group. 
Trademarks are stated at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, up 
to a maximum of 20 years.
Customer databases represent the value attributable to the portfolios of renewable customer policies 
that have been created by our Aªnity Partners through their own sales and marketing activity and 
subsequently purchased by the Group. Such customer databases are recorded at their fair value based  
on the amount paid to the Aªnity Partner. These customer databases are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the expected duration of the customer relationship, which are in the range of 3 - 10 years.
Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over 
their useful lives of 3 –10 years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suered an impairment loss. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating-unit to which the asset 
belongs. 143
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the assets for 
which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating 
unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs comprise direct material cost 
only. Cost is measured on a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out (FIFO) basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and 
distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The classiﬁcation depends on the nature 
and purpose of the ﬁnancial assets or liabilities and is determined at the time of initial recognition. 
Available for sale investments
At each balance sheet date the Group conducts a fair value assessment of its investments, the dierence 
between the fair value and carrying value is charged or credited to the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income accordingly and held in the available for sale reserve.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an 
insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Financial statements

Financial instruments (continued) 
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the eective interest 
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in 
the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct  
issue costs.
‘Put’ options over the equity of subsidiary companies
The potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary 
companies are accounted for as ﬁnancial liabilities. The amounts that may become payable under the 
option on exercise are initially recognised at the present value of the expected gross obligation with the 
corresponding entry being recognised in retained earnings. 
Such options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the eective interest rate method, 
in order to accrete the liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it ﬁrst 
becomes exercisable. The charge arising is recorded as a ﬁnancing cost. In the event that options expire 
unexercised, the liability is derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.
Other ‘put’ and ‘call’ options
Other put and call options are recognised at fair value with any associated beneﬁt being recognised 
directly in the proﬁt and loss account.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of 
the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The Group also provides employees 
with the ability to purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through 
Save As You Earn schemes. In addition, the Group provides employees with the ability to purchase shares 
through its One Plan scheme. For every two shares purchased, employees will receive one free matching 
share at the end of the vesting period.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo simulation models depending 
on the type of scheme. 145
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Own shares reserve
Shares of the parent Company that were purchased by the HomeServe plc Employee Beneﬁt Trust were 
held at cost and shown as a deduction in equity. Cost comprised consideration paid, including directly 
attributable costs. The shares were held to satisfy obligations under the Group’s equity settled share based 
payment schemes.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are 
required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may 
dier from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision aects only that 
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision aects both current and future 
periods.
Revenue recognition
Claims handling obligations
A key accounting judgement in respect of revenue recognition is the proportion of revenue to defer to 
cover the Group’s future obligations in respect of handling future claims arising on those policies that are 
on risk at the year end. 
The key sources of estimation uncertainty in determining an appropriate proportion of revenue to defer 
are the assumptions made with regards to claims frequency and the estimated cost of handling a claim. 
The Group uses historical experience of claim volumes and forecast activity levels to estimate these 
assumptions. The total amount of revenue deferred at 31 March 2017 in respect of the Group’s future 
claim handing obligations is £76.7m (FY16: £54.4m). If either of these assumptions were individually higher 
or lower than the Group’s historical experience by 10% the impact to the proﬁt in the year would  
be £7.7m.
Policy Cancellations
A further judgement is in respect of those policies that may be cancelled by the customer part way 
through the contractual term, which will aect the economic beneﬁts that ﬂow to the Group. To the 
extent that policies are expected to cancel ‘mid-term’ and hence all the economic beneﬁts of those 
policies is not expected to ﬂow to the Group, an estimate of the related revenue is not recognised. 
The key source of estimation uncertainty in calculating the provision for policy cancellations are the 
expected mid-term cancellation percentage and the period of cover remaining on the policy at the 
point of cancellation. The Group uses historical experience to determine the appropriate assumptions 
to be used in this calculation. The total amount of revenue not recognised at 31 March 2017 in respect 
of potential future cancellations is £18.0m (FY16: £16.0m) and is recognised as a reduction in the value 
of trade receivables. The most material estimation uncertainty within this judgement is the mid-term 
cancellation percentage. If this assumption was individually higher or lower than the Group’s historical 
experience by 10% the impact to proﬁt in the year would be £1.8m. Financial statements

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Valuation of acquisition intangible assets
Acquisitions may result in acquired access rights and acquired customer databases being recognised as 
intangible assets. These are valued using the excess earnings method taking into account a number of 
key assumptions such as retention and net income. In applying this methodology, certain key judgements 
and estimates are required to be made in respect of future cash ﬂows together with an appropriate 
discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash ﬂows.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty with respect to customer databases are the future retention 
rate and the income per customer generated from those customers. The carrying value of acquired 
customer databases at 31 March 2017 is £90.0m (FY16: £66.7m). If the retention rate or income per 
customer was individually higher or lower by 10% the impact to proﬁt in the year would be £9.0m. 
In respect of intangible assets for acquired access rights, the key sources of estimation uncertainty relate 
to the assumptions regarding the number of policy sales and associated penetration of the customer list 
along with the cost of acquisition, retention rate and costs associated with servicing those customers. 
The total value of acquired access rights at 31 March 2017 is £24.0m (FY16: £8.6m), therefore if the 
assumptions used in this valuation were individually higher or lower by 10% the impact to the proﬁt in the 
year would be £2.4m.
Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets
The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates 
of the value in use (or fair value less costs to sell) of cash-generating units to which goodwill and 
acquisition intangibles have been allocated. CGUs are aligned to the regions in which we operate. As a 
result, estimates of future cash ﬂows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the 
purpose of determining the present value of those cash ﬂows. The carrying value of goodwill is £301.9m 
(FY16: £247.7m). The carrying value of acquisition intangibles is £114.0m (FY16: £75.3m). Following the 
annual impairment review, no impairment charge has been recorded against goodwill or acquisition 
intangibles.
As set out in note 13, changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, prices, margins 
and discount rates can impact the recoverable value. Management do not believe that any reasonably 
possible changes to the key assumptions would produce an impairment in the forthcoming year.
In addition to the amounts above, there is goodwill of £25.7m included in the interests in associates in 
relation to our recent investment in Sherrington Mews Limited, the holding company of the Checkatrade 
Group. Each individual associate will be assessed as a single asset if there are any indications of 
impairment.  147

5. Business and geographical segments
Segment revenues and results
IFRS8 requires operating segments to be identiﬁed on the basis of internal reports about components of 
the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, who is considered to be the 
Chief Executive, to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. 
Segment proﬁt/(loss) represents the result of each segment including allocating costs associated with 
head oªce and shared functions, but before allocating investment income, ﬁnance costs, and tax. This is 
the measure reported to the Chief Executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of 
segment performance.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Signiﬁcant 
Accounting Policies. Group cost allocations are deducted in arriving at segmental operating proﬁt. Inter-
segment revenue is charged at prevailing market prices.
During the year the USA segment has been renamed “North America” reﬂecting the increased presence 
that the Group has in Canada, which is managed and considered together with our business in the United 
States of America.  Other than the change in name of the USA segment, no other changes have been 
made to the operating segments.

Given the UK parented nature of the Group, the majority of ﬁnancing that the overseas businesses 
require is provided from the UK, and as such the UK has provided a number of intra-group loans to its 
overseas operations in order to fund their growth plans. In light of the dierent tax rates applicable in 
each of the markets in which the Group operates, as noted above, these loans result in a reduction in the 
Group’s eective tax rate, which is included in ‘Overseas tax rate dierences’ in the table above.

Adjusted profit for the year  83.6  68.4 
Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share have been calculated in accordance with IAS33 Earnings 
Per Share. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁt or loss in the ﬁnancial year by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. Adjusted earnings per share is 
calculated excluding amortisation of acquisition intangibles. The Group uses adjusted operating proﬁt, 
EBITDA, adjusted proﬁt before tax and adjusted earnings per share as its primary performance measures. 
These are non-IFRS measures which exclude the impact of the amortisation of acquisition intangible 
assets (FY17: £14.1m, FY16: £10.4m). Acquisition intangible assets principally arise as a result of the past 
actions of the former owners of businesses in respect of marketing and business development activity. 
Therefore, the adjusted measures reﬂect the post acquisition revenue attributable to, and operating costs 
incurred by, the Group. Diluted earnings per share includes the impact of dilutive share options in issue 
throughout the period. 153

In addition to the amounts above, there is goodwill of £25.7m included in the interests in associates in 
relation to our recent investment in Sherrington Mews Limited, the holding company of the Checkatrade 
Group. Each individual associate will be assessed as a single asset if there are any indications of 
impairment. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating-units 
(‘CGUs’) that are expected to beneﬁt from that business combination. The Group deﬁnes its CGUs as 
geographical territories, because they represent the smallest identiﬁable group of assets that generate 
cash ﬂows. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications 
that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in 
use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates 
and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates the 
discount rates using pre-tax rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money. 
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are 
based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash ﬂow forecasts derived from the most recent ﬁnancial budgets and plans for 
the next three years approved by the Directors and extrapolates the annual cash ﬂow using estimated, 
country speciﬁc, long-term growth rates. The pre-tax cost of capital rates used to discount the forecast 
pre-tax cash ﬂows are dierent for each territory and are detailed below:
• UK 8.7% (FY16: 7.5%)
• North America  12.2% (FY16: 10.6%)
• France 10.4% (FY16: 7.8%)
• Spain 10.0% (FY16: 8.0%)
Pre-tax cost of capital rates reﬂect the latest cost of debt and equity for a sample of comparable 
companies in accordance with the market participant premise detailed in IAS 36. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU’s carrying 
value, which also reﬂects the dierent risk proﬁle of each CGU. The Group believes that there are no 
reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying 
amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.  Financial statements

This view is based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, it takes account of the headroom 
in the value in use calculation versus the current carrying value.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:

The Group’s CGUs do not contain any intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful economic lives. The long-
term growth rate is 2% (FY16: 2%).
14. Other intangible assets
Acquisition intangibles represent non-monetary assets, arising on business combinations, and include 
acquired access rights and acquired customer databases. Other intangibles include trademarks, access

consideration of £4.0m that is payable subject to ﬁnancial performance conditions being met by the 
business, the present value of which is £2.7m. Legal costs of £0.7m associated with the transaction were 
added to the cost of the investment.
On 9 March 2017 the Group disposed of 51% of Assistenza Casa Srl, a wholly owned Group company. 
The remaining 49% has been accounted for as an associate using the equity method. The Group realised 
a gain of £0.1m as a result of this transaction.

A list of the investments in associates, including the name, address, country of incorporation, and

Through a call option the Group has the means to acquire a further 35% of the shares in Sherrington 
Mews Limited at a valuation which is the higher of a) the pro-rata of the amount payable for the initial 
40% investment and b) 10 times adjusted EBITDA for the year ending 31 March 2019 multiplied by 
35%, subject to a cap of £35m.  In accordance with IAS39 the valuation of this call option has been 
considered and it is not deemed to have any material value at 31 March 2017 as it would not currently 
allow the Group to acquire an additional stake at less than market value.  In addition, the current 
controlling shareholders of Sherrington Mews Limited have a put option requiring the Group to acquire 
a further 35% of their shareholdings at the same price as that determined above in respect of the call 
option, though subject to additional ﬁnancial performance conditions also being met by the business.  
Again, the valuation of this put option has been considered in accordance with IAS39 and it is not 
deemed to have any material value at 31 March 2017.

Trade receivables
The Group has provided fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover. This 
assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all signiﬁcant balances that are past due and 
involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk, 
with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers. There are no customers 
that represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £12.1m (FY16: 
£7.1m) which are past due at the reporting date but for which the Group has not provided for as there 
has not been a signiﬁcant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The 
Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of receivables not impaired is 
21 days (FY16: 30 days). Trade debtors to be received from customers relating to instalments of policy 
premiums that are not yet due have been excluded from the average age calculation.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit 
quality from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk 
is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that 
there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

   1.9 2.5
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their  
fair value.
Other receivables
The Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on behalf of 
third parties. Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders 
and are to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance 
Premium Tax. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and 
spread across a diverse policyholder base. In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as 
defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be oset against the corresponding payable included 
in ’Other creditors’.
Cash balances and cash equivalents
Cash balances and cash equivalents of £46.2m (FY16: £54.2m) comprise cash held by the Group and 
short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these 
assets approximates to their fair value.

The US Dollar and Euro denominated borrowings are used to provide debt funding to North America

overseas subsidiaries of the Group by way of intercompany loans, denominated in the same currencies. 
These external borrowings and the equivalent intercompany receivable loans are treated as monetary 
liabilities and assets respectively and, as such, the Group’s foreign currency exposure risk is minimised. Financial statements

All the Group’s borrowings are unsecured. The carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings approximates 
to their fair value and the currencies in which they are denominated reﬂect the geographical segments 
for which they have been used.
The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
• The Group has a £300m revolving credit facility with ﬁve banks. This facility was taken out on 31 July 
2014 and has a term of ﬁve years. The ﬁnancial covenants associated with the credit facilities are 
‘net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.0 times’ (FY16: 3.0 times) and ‘interest cover greater than 4.0 times 
EBITDA’ (FY16: 4.0 times). Interest is charged at ﬂoating rates at margins of between 1.05% and 1.25% 
(FY16: 0.9% and 1.25%) above the relevant reference rate, thus exposing the Group to cash ﬂow and 
interest rate risk. At 31 March 2017, the Group had available £174.0m (FY16: £155.6m) of undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met
• The Group has £110m of US Private Placements (FY16: £50m). An additional £60m US Private 
Placement was taken out on 6 March 2017 and has a term of seven years. The ﬁnancial covenants 
associated with this facility are the same as the £300m revolving credit facility and interest is charged 
at a ﬁxed rate of 2.59%. The existing £50m US Private Placement was taken out on 7 October 2015 
and has a term of seven years. The ﬁnancial covenants associated with this facility are the same as the 
£300m revolving credit facility and interest is charged at a ﬁxed rate of 3.44%
• The Group secured additional funding via a €50m amortising term loan which was taken out on  
13 September 2016 and has a term of 4 years. The ﬁnancial covenants associated with this facility are 
the same as the £300m revolving credit facility and interest is charged at ﬂoating rates at margins of 
0.9% above the relevant reference rate, thus exposing the Group to cash ﬂow and interest rate risk
•  The Group renewed a £25m short term loan on 1 February 2017 which has a term of six months. The 
ﬁnancial covenants associated with this facility are the same as the £300m revolving credit facility 
and interest is charged at ﬂoating rates at margins of 0.63% above the relevant reference rate, thus 
exposing the Group to cash ﬂow and interest rate risk
•  The Group has a $5m facility in the USA, of which $2.3m / £1.9m (FY16: $3.1m / £2.1m) was drawn at 
the 31 March. The weighted average interest rate was 2.0% (FY16: 1.5%).
The Group has complied with all covenant requirements in the current and prior year. Information about 
liquidity risk is presented in note 42. 163

At the balance sheet date, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of £13.3m (FY16: £0.1m) on unused 
tax losses of £30.4m (FY16: £0.3m) available for oset against future proﬁts, based on estimates of 
budgeted proﬁts in the forthcoming years. The increase in unused tax losses in the year primarily relates 
to the Group’s acquisition of Utility Service Partners Inc. Deferred tax has not been recognised on £1.1m 
(FY16: £18.3m) of unused losses due to the uncertainty over the timing of future recovery. The reduction 
this year is due to the disposal of Assistenza Casa Srl.
There are no expiry dates in respect of the unrecognised tax losses (FY16: £nil). Financial statements

proportion of monies received in advance are treated as deferred income and recognised over the  
relevant period.
Other creditors mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders but to be remitted to 
third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.

Through a call option the Group has the means to acquire the remaining 30% of the shares in Habitissimo 
S.L which can be exercised in either 2020 or 2021. In addition, the non-controlling shareholders have a 
put option requiring the Group to acquire the remaining 30% of their shareholding.  There is no market 
value deﬁned in the shareholder agreement but a ﬂoor of €6.4m, based on the current price of the 
remaining 30%, and a cap of €30m. The fair market value of the company will be mutually agreed by 
HomeServe and the founders at the point at which the options become exercisable. 165
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The potential cash payment relating to the put option issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary 
companies has been accounted for as a ﬁnancial liability. This has been recognised at a fair value 
of £9.3m with the corresponding charge being recognised in retained earnings. The option will be 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the eective interest rate method, in order to accrete the 
liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it ﬁrst becomes exercisable.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The goodwill arising on the excess of consideration over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
represents the expectation of synergy savings and eªciencies. None of the goodwill is expected to be 
deducted for tax purposes. The gross contracted amounts due are equal to the fair value amounts stated 
above for trade and other receivables. 
The provisional fair values for USP Inc. disclosed as part of the Group’s interim results in November 2016 
have been updated, resulting in a reduction to goodwill of £0.5m. 
The post-acquisition revenue, operating proﬁt and acquisition-related costs (included in administrative 
expenses) from these acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2017 was as follows:
   USP  npower Services Habitissimo Total
   £m £m £m £m
Revenue 21.1 2.0 1.8 24.9
Operating profit/(loss) (0.7) 1.4 (0.2) 0.5
Acquisition-related costs 0.4 0.2 0.3 0.9
If all of the acquisitions had been completed on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁnancial year, Group revenues for the 
period would have been £802.0m and Group proﬁt before taxation would have been £100.1m.
In addition to the net cash outﬂow on the acquisitions above of £71.8m, deferred consideration was paid 
relating to prior year business combinations of £3.1m (FY16: £1.1m) and net cash was acquired as part of an 
immaterial acquisition in Spain of £0.7m.
Through a call option the Group has the means to acquire the remaining 30% of the shares in Habitissimo 
S.L. which can be exercised in either 2020 or 2021. In addition, the non-controlling shareholders have a 
put option requiring the Group to acquire the remaining 30% of their shareholding.  There is no market 
value deﬁned in the shareholder agreement but a ﬂoor of €6.4m, based on the current price of the 
remaining 30%, and a cap of €30m. The fair market value of the company will be mutually agreed by 
HomeServe and the founders at the point at which the options become exercisable.
The potential cash payment relating to the put option issued by the Group over the equity of Habitissimo 
S.L. has been accounted for as a ﬁnancial liability. This has been recognised at the present value of the 
expected gross obligation of £9.3m with the corresponding entry being recognised in retained earnings. 
The option will be subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the eective interest rate method, 
in order to accrete the liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it ﬁrst 
becomes exercisable.  Financial statements

Certain motor vehicles are held under ﬁnance leases. The average lease term is 5 years (FY16: 5 years). For 
the year ended 31 March 2017, the average eective borrowing rate was 2.5% (FY16: 2.5%). Interest rates 
are ﬁxed at the contract date. All leases are on a ﬁxed repayment basis and no arrangements have been 
entered into for contingent rental payments.
All lease obligations are denominated in US dollars. The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations is 
approximately equal to their carrying amount. The Group’s obligations under ﬁnance leases are secured 
by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.
39. Share-based payments
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group had three (FY16: four) share-based payment schemes, 
which are described below:
i) Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP provides for the grant of performance, matching and restricted awards. The vesting period 
is normally three years.  Restricted awards are not subject to performance conditions.  Vesting of 
performance and matching awards granted in 2013 and 2014 is dependent upon comparative Total 
Shareholder Return performance.  For performance and matching awards granted in 2015 and 2016, 
75% of each award is subject to an Earnings Per Share performance condition and the remaining 25% 
is subject to comparative Total Shareholder Return performance. In 2016, members of the Executive 
Committee received an additional performance award which was subject to a more stretching Earnings 
Per Share performance condition. 
ii) Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’)
The SAYE was open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted 
market price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount. The options can be 
exercised during a six month period following the completion of either a three or ﬁve year savings period. 
There were no awards made in the year.
iii) One Plan 
One Plan is a share incentive scheme which is available to all employees.  For every two partnership 
shares purchased, participants will receive (or have the right to receive) one free matching share.  
Matching shares are held in trust for a period of up to three years.   Financial statements

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for SAYE and 
One Plan and Monte Carlo simulations for the LTIP. The assumptions used in the models (which are 
comparable to the prior year) are as follows:
Input Assumption
Share price Price at date of grant
Exercise price Per scheme rules
Expected volatility 23% – 52%
Option life Per scheme rules
Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield
Risk free interest rate 0.1% – 1.3%
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages. Volatility is calculated 
by looking at the historical share price movements prior to the date of grant over a period of time 
commensurate with the remaining term for each award.
The Group recognised total expenses of £7.4m (FY16: £5.1m) related to equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions.
40. Retirement beneﬁt schemes
Deﬁned contribution schemes
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt scheme for all UK employees. The assets 
of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. Where 
there are employees who leave the scheme within two years of joining and they choose to take a refund, 
the contributions paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee.
In addition to the scheme in the UK, the Group operates a deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt 
scheme for North America employees.
The total cost charged to income of £3.8m (FY16: £3.4m) represents contributions payable to the 
schemes by the Group at rates speciﬁed in the rules of the schemes. At 31 March 2017, contributions  
of £323,000 (FY16: £311,000) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to  
the schemes.
Deﬁned beneﬁt scheme
The Group participates in a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme, the Water Companies Pension Scheme, which is 
closed to new members. This is a sectionalised scheme and the Group participates in the HomeServe 
plc Section of the Scheme. The Section is administered by a Trustee and is independent of the Group’s 
ﬁnances. Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the recommendations of an 
independent actuary.
The results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2014 were updated to the accounting date by a 
qualiﬁed independent actuary in accordance with IAS19. Remeasurements are recognised immediately 
through other comprehensive income. Financial statements

Key assumptions used:
Discount rate at 31 March  2.6% 3.5%
Consumer price inflation  2.4% 2.2%
Retail price inflation  3.4% 3.2%
Expected rate of salary increases  2.4% 2.2%

Life expectancy of female aged 60 at balance sheet date 29.8yrs 29.7yrs
Life expectancy of male aged 60 at balance sheet date 27.9yrs 27.8yrs
Pensions accounting entries are subject to judgement and volatility, as the assets are largely linked to 
the equity market, whereas the present value of the obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate 
bonds.
As an indication, all other things being equal:
• an increase in the discount rate of 0.1% would lead to a reduction in the value placed on the 
obligations of the Section of approximately £0.8m
• an increase in the inﬂation assumption rate of 0.1% would lead to an increase in the value placed on 
the obligations of the Section of approximately £0.7m
• an increase of life expectancy of one year would lead to an increase in the value placed on the 
obligations of the Section of approximately £0.9m.

Trading transactions
Group companies purchased services of £0.3m (FY16: £0.1m) from Harpin Limited, £0.1m (FY16: £nil) from 
Pilot Services Limited and £0.1m (FY16: £0.3m) from Harpin Parkin Limited, none of which are members 
of the Group. These companies are related parties because they are controlled by Richard Harpin, Chief 
Executive Oªcer of the Group and Director of the parent company of the Group. Amounts outstanding 
to all of these companies on 31 March 2017 amounted to £0.1m (FY16: £0.3m).
Provision of services to and the purchase of services from related parties were made at arm’s length 
prices. The amounts outstanding are unsecured and will be settled in cash. No guarantees have been

42. Financial instruments
Principal ﬁnancial instruments
The principal ﬁnancial instruments used by the Group from which ﬁnancial instrument risk arises are  
as follows:
• cash and cash equivalents 
• bank overdrafts, revolving credit facilities, bank loans and Private Placements 
• trade receivables 
• other receivables 
• trade payables
• contingent and deferred consideration
• other creditors
• investments.
All principal ﬁnancial instruments are stated at amortised cost, with the exception of contingent and 
deferred consideration and investments which are held at fair value.
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into 
Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included 
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for 
the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The Group has no ﬁnancial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to Level 1 or 
Level 2 and there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels during the period. There are no 
non-recurring fair value measurements. The Group held the following Level 3 ﬁnancial instruments at  
fair value:

Call option over associate  — —
Contingent and deferred consideration at fair value through profit and loss:
Current liabilities  (2.6) (1.2)
Non-current liabilities  (5.1) (5.6)
The movement in investments versus the prior year relates to the foreign exchange movement as a result 
of the weakening of Sterling versus the Euro. 
The ‘call option over associate’ included above relates to the option the Group has to acquire a further 
35% of the shares in Sherrington Mews Limited, as referred to in note 18. In accordance with IAS39 the 
valuation of this call option has been considered and it is not deemed to have any material fair value at  
31 March 2017 as it would not currently allow the Group to acquire an additional stake at less than  
market value. Financial statements

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going concerns 
while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity. The 
capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 21,  
cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued 
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 25 to 32 and the Group Statement of 
Changes in Equity.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital:
   2017 2016
   £m £m
Attributable to equity holders of the parent  369.2 316.6
Bank and other loans  270.1 196.5
Certain of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements from the 
Financial Conduct Authority. Where such requirements exist, the Group manages the risk through the 
close monitoring of performance and distributable capital within the entities impacted by the regulations. 
The Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the current and preceding year.

Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial instruments comprise bank and other loans, overdrafts and cash and cash 
equivalents. The main purpose of these ﬁnancial instruments is to raise ﬁnance for the Group’s operations. 
The Group also has various other ﬁnancial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which 
arise directly from its operations. 
Financial risk management is overseen by the Board according to objectives, targets and policies set 
by the Board. Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk and 
liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with objectives, targets and 
policies set by the Board. Treasury is not a proﬁt centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial instruments
In addition to the other ﬁnancial assets and liabilities set out above in ‘Principal ﬁnancial instruments’, the 
Group also has ﬁnancial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 20, 23 and 24. The main risks arising from 
the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to the Group’s long-
term debt requirements with ﬂoating interest rates. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using 
a mix of ﬁxed and variable rate debts.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁnancial 
instruments shall be undertaken.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase in the 
cost of borrowing, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s proﬁt before tax (through the 
impact on ﬂoating rate borrowings).
   2017 2016
Increase in cost of borrowing  10% 10%
Reduction in profit before tax (£m)  0.1 0.1
Credit risk
The Group trades only with creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that, with the exception of 
our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for ﬁnancial 
stability.
The majority of the Group’s trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence 
for these balances the Group does not have any signiﬁcant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.  
As a result, the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not considered to be signiﬁcant. Note 3 to the accounts 
contains further detail regarding the potential risk if cancellations were to be 10% higher than expected.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other ﬁnancial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and 
cash equivalents, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only 
with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions. Financial statements
180
Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Group’s Board which sets the 
framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and 
banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ﬂows. Included in note 21 are 
details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to reduce liquidity risk further.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, the revolving credit facilities, half of the 
amortising four year term loan, a loan in the USA and the US Private Placements, all of the Group’s 
ﬁnancial liabilities are due for payment within two years, based on contractual payment terms.
The maturity proﬁle of the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities based on contractual maturities is provided in 
the table below. Interest is payable on all bank and other loans. Deferred and contingent consideration 
payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outﬂows before discounting.
The actual payment proﬁle of ‘Other creditors’ is principally dependent upon the collection of the 
corresponding ’Other receivables’ from policyholders. These amounts principally relate to underwriting, 
which are collected from policyholders and remitted to underwriters following cash collection. 
Therefore, the actual cash ﬂows may dier from those presented, but will not result in the acceleration 
of the settlement of the liability.

Trade receivables
The Company has a policy for providing fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to 
recover. This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all signiﬁcant balances that 
are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the creditworthiness of the 
counterparty.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Company considers any change in the 
credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. 
The concentration of credit risk is mitigated through the close management and regular review of 
performance of the subsidiary companies.
No allowance for doubtful debts is considered necessary based on prior experience and the Directors’ 
assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their  
fair value.
Cash balances and cash equivalents
Cash balances and cash equivalents of £nil (FY16: £62.1m) comprise cash held by the Company and 
short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these 
assets approximates to their fair value. Financial statements

liabilities at the year end are as follows:
   Assets   Liabilities

Euro  31.7 14.6 (43.0) (42.7)
US dollar 214.4 119.7 (57.0) (63.5)

sterling against the relevant foreign currencies, with all other variables held constant, of the Company’s 
proﬁt before tax and equity.

Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Company’s Board which sets the 
framework for the management of the Company’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves 
and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ﬂows. Included in note 21 
are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Company and the Group to further reduce 
liquidity risk.
With the exception of the revolving credit facilities, half of the amortising four year term loan and the US 
Private Placements, all of the Company’s ﬁnancial liabilities are due for payment within two years, based 
on contractual payment terms.
The maturity proﬁle of the Company’s ﬁnancial liabilities is provided in the table below. The revolving 
credit facility is drawn down and associated interest is settled on a monthly basis. The principal is included 
in the table below when the facility is due to expire. Financial statements
