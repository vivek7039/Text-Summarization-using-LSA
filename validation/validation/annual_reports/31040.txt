01 OUR SOLUTIONS
Polypipe SuDS solution 
enhanced flood 
protection and ensured 
minimal intrusion into 
residents’ usable space
The lack of capacity in the existing highway 
drainage network placed many properties 
in the residential area of Linnet Rise at risk 
of flooding. Polypipe supplied a complete 
prefabricated solution using Polystorm 
geocellular tanks, together with pipework, 
manholes and catchpits all manufactured 
off-site. The final design saw the installation 
of two Polystorm geocellular tanks at a depth 
of 3.2 metres, under two resident owned car 
parks on the Linnet Rise site, providing 366m
3
 
and 479m
3
 of storage respectively. The solution 
was retrofitted to the existing area with 
minimal disruption to local residents to provide 
long-lasting flood protection.
This retrofitted  
flood alleviation  
scheme was designed 
and prepared off-site  
to minimise disruption 
for this busy  
residential area

STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW
I am delighted to present the Polypipe 
2017 Annual Report and Accounts 
following another excellent year for the 
Group. Despite the continued economic 
and political uncertainty that has prevailed 
since the EU Referendum and a mixed UK 
construction market performance, our end 
markets continue to perform well, with the 
Group growing UK revenue significantly 
ahead of the UK construction market. As 
well as managing this growth, the Group 
has also seen a number of key leadership 
changes during the year, including the 
retirement of David Hall in October 2017 
following 12 years as CEO, and the 
promotion of Martin Payne from CFO to 
CEO following David’s retirement. Glen 
Sabin was promoted to the role of Chief 
Operating Officer and appointed to the 
Board in October 2017, and the Company 
Secretarial function was also brought in-
house following the appointment of Emma 
Versluys as Company Secretary. Paul James 
joined the Company and Board as Chief 
Financial Officer on 5 March 2018, and I 
believe that the executive management 
team is now at full complement following 
this period of change and well placed to 
drive the Group’s strategy forwards.
In this regard, the Group announced on 
31 January 2018 that it had entered into 
advanced negotiations to dispose of its 
French subsidiary following a review of 
the strategic overlap between the UK and 
French business. Given the French business 
operates in lower margin product areas, 
it was agreed to dispose of the business. 
Completion is expected in the first half of 
2018 and, once completed, will allow the 
Group to focus on its higher margin  
product areas. 
RESULTS
Performance throughout 2017 has been 
very strong, with a 6.3% increase in 
revenue to £411.7m and a 6.0% increase 
in underlying operating profit at £72.6m. 
UK revenue growth of 8.1% was ahead 
of the market, primarily as a result of 
strong growth in the UK residential sector 
driven by new housebuilds. Underlying 
operating margin was robust at 17.6%, 
despite continued input cost inflation, 
and underlying diluted earnings per share 
increased by 10.1% to 27.2p per share. 
Net debt continued to reduce to 1.6 times 
EBITDA compared with 1.9 times for the 
prior year. 
DIVIDEND
We have again maintained our dividend 
policy and I am pleased to report that the 
Board recommends a final dividend of 7.5 
pence per share, giving a full year dividend 
of 11.1 pence per share for the year ended 
31 December 2017, a 9.9% increase on the 
prior year. 
STRATEGY
During 2017, the key objectives of the 
Board included:
 { Investigating and prioritising selected 
development and acquisition 
opportunities, while the Group 
continued to reduce leverage. 
 { Targeting investment to support the 
continued growth of our key businesses.
 { Investigation and development of new 
export markets.
Good progress was made against these 
objectives during 2017.
In addition to our ongoing initiatives, in 2018 
our attention will be focused upon:
 { Continuing to develop our core 
manufacturing capabilities by investing 
in further new capacity and automation 
to help grow both revenues and profit 
organically.
 { Continued progression of the Group’s 
M&A agenda.
PEOPLE
The exceptional effort and ongoing 
commitment of our employees continues 
to be a key driver of the Company’s strong 
performance. In 2017, the Board and I 
spent time visiting our sites both in the UK 
and France, and continue to be impressed 
by the knowledge, enthusiasm and 
commitment of our employees across the 
Group. Effective and efficient management 
of our key facilities is critical to the Group’s 
ongoing success, and strong leadership 
in each business unit by experienced and 
dedicated management teams is a key 
differentiator.
In November 2017, the first Save As You 
Earn (SAYE) options granted in 2014 
matured, and employees across the Group 
were able to benefit from their hard work 
in driving the Group’s growth over the last 
three years and have the option of becoming 
shareholders in the Company. The Company 
issued invitations to join a third SAYE scheme 
during the year, resulting in 600 (24%) of 
eligible employees choosing to participate. 
Across the Group, we now have 30.7% of all 
employees currently contributing to one or 
more schemes.
David Hall retired in October 2017 having 
been CEO during the Company’s prior 
ownership and through its transformation 
into a public company. I would like to 
record both the Board’s and my own 
personal thanks to David for his enormous 
contribution to making Polypipe the 
successful Group that it is today, and wish 
him well in his retirement. Martin Payne 
was appointed as Group CEO following 
David’s retirement and both I and my 
Board colleagues have been impressed 
and encouraged by the significant impact 
he has made since his appointment while 
continuing to have responsibility for the 
CFO function in the period before Paul 
James joined us. The Board changes have 
been well received within the Group as 
well as with advisers and shareholders, 
and the motivation and enthusiasm of our 
employees has been unaffected throughout 
this period of change. The Board and I look 
forward to the next chapter in the Group’s 
growth story under the stewardship of the 
new executive management team. 
SUMMARY
Once again, the Group has made significant 
progress during 2017. The strong 
performance in the year is testament to the 
strength of the growth drivers on which the 
Group’s strategy is based, namely legacy 
material substitution, tailwinds from both 
water management and carbon reduction 
legislation, and development of selective 
export markets. With a continued focus 
on investment into engineered solutions 
to meet those needs, an experienced 
and dedicated senior management team, 
committed workforce, and a clear strategy, 
I am confident that the Group will continue 
to thrive during 2018.

CHAIRMAN’S
INTRODUCTION In the 1980s Polypipe’s offer was 
largely a basic product offer of discrete 
lengths of pipe and fittings sold through 
distribution, which over the years 
has become commoditised and more 
difficult to differentiate. Adoption of 
kite-marks and continued investment in 
manufacturing efficiency over this time 
has retained a competitive position for 
these products. Further investment in 
new products and differentiated features 
continues today, which helps support 
the Polypipe brand as the leading UK 
manufacturer of these discrete products.
In the mid-90s, this proposition evolved 
to combine these discrete products 
into performance systems, such as 
pushfit plumbing, for example. Through 
developing an intimate understanding 
of the requirements of end customers, 
plumbers in this case, in 1998 Polypipe 
launched the very successful range 
of non-demountable grey fittings, 
Polyplumb, which has since become an 
industry standard system offer in the UK.
Later, this evolution continued with 
large diameter pipe solutions for water 
attenuation, leading to the development 
of the Polystorm geocellular range, 
designed to provide retention, attenuation 
or infiltration at a variety of depths. 
Polystorm is suited to deeper burial depths 
and can accommodate a wide range of 
traffic loadings, from pedestrianised areas 
to large HGV parks. As a proposition, it 
is taken to market as bespoke one-off 
designs, engineered according to the 
particular design characteristics for each 
project, such as soil conditions, flood 
intensity requirements and flow versus 
retention requirements, amongst many 
other parameters.
Understanding the detailed characteristics 
and complexity of the individual projects 
requires Polypipe to work closely with 
the customers’ design engineers to 
understand these problems, in order 
to be in a position to propose an 
appropriate engineered solution. Working 
closely with end customers in this way 
helps to generate pull-through demand 
for Polypipe’s solutions through the 
distribution channel.
Today, this evolution is continuing 
through the development of smart 
technologies, to bring together the 
optimised performance of underfloor 
heating systems with ventilation systems, 
for the convenience and comfort of the 
building occupants.
Throughout this evolution, Polypipe 
has encountered new competitors, 
but through its progressive market 
reach, and managing these activities 
and manufacturing in-house, Polypipe 
generates incremental profitability while 
maintaining commercial competitiveness 
and market leadership.
This collective learning and track record 
forms the basis of a set of competencies 
across the Group, which position Polypipe 
well for future development in the UK 
and further afield.
The evolution of Polypipe’s commercial proposition over the years reflects the 
Company’s new product development strategy, to deliver value-engineered solutions 
for customers, while generating incremental profitability and maintaining commercial 
competitiveness and market leadership.

STRATEGIC REPORT
POLYPIPE’S VALUE – CREATION MODEL
Unique and differentiated POLYPIPE’S MARKETPLACE
OUTPUT TRENDS
Over the next two years, overall 
construction output is forecast to remain 
broadly flat in 2018, rising by only 
0.2%, before growth of 1.7% in 2019, 
driven primarily by growth in private 
housing and infrastructure. Outside of 
the private housing and infrastructure 
sectors, slower UK economic growth 
and investment uncertainty are expected 
to weigh on construction output in the 
private sectors. This, combined with the 
persistent uncertainty associated with 
the conditions of Brexit, has acted as a 
considerable hindrance to major new 
investment in private sector construction, 
especially for new high-end residential 
and commercial offices projects within 
London that are particularly reliant on 
foreign investment.
From an economic point of view, other 
uncertainties, such as the implications 
of continued inflation and the fall in real 
wages on consumer confidence and 
general UK economic growth, and the 
availability of skilled construction labour 
may also affect the rate of construction 
growth in 2018 and 2019.
RESIDENTIAL
Output in the private housing sector 
continued to grow in 2017 and is 
expected to rise further in 2018  
and 2019.
Property transactions in 2017 were 
slightly lower than transactions in the last 
two years and indicate a broadly flat to 
slightly negative general housing market. 
These transactions have been distorted 
due to changes in stamp duty in recent 
years that adversely affected sales at the 
top end of the market in particular.
UK house price inflation in 2017 was 
3.0% compared to 2016 according to 
Nationwide, indicating that the supply 
of properties onto the market slowed 
in line with demand. As long as house 
price inflation continues, housebuilders 
will be keen to increase supply, especially 
given that the Government’s Help-To-Buy 
schemes have skewed demand towards 
new housebuild and they remain positive 
with respect to increasing supply. A key 
part of the housebuilding market that 
appears to have been adversely affected 
over the past year is prime London 
properties. House prices in central London 
have fallen 15% since their peak in 2014 
according to Savills. Uncertainty on rates 
of return on high-end properties from 
international investors due to short-
term economic and longer-term Brexit 
uncertainty has also affected demand for 
prime residential real estate in the capital.
The private housing repair, maintenance 
and improvement (RM&I) sector was 
worth an estimated £19.9 billion in 2017. 
The trend of slightly negative property 
transactions over the past year would 
suggest falling output in the private RM&I 
sector, particularly given that a higher 
proportion of transactions than normal 
involve new housebuild, encouraged by 
Help-To-Buy. At the same time there is 
a slight demographic impact on RM&I 
particularly among older homeowners in 
certain areas who prefer to release equity 
from pensions and stay and improve 
rather than move. As a result, output 
from private RM&I is expected to remain 
flat in 2018 before falling 2.0% in 2019.
As falls in housebuilding in London are 
offset by growth in housebuilding outside 
the capital, the private housing sector is 
forecast to continue its growth from 2017, 
with 3.0% in 2018 and 2.0% in 2019.
The UK construction market accounts for 89% of Polypipe’s revenue, where the brand 
is well known and respected for its value, quality of service, innovation and expertise.

Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc
08 Polypipe has a balanced mix of business that covers the Residential, Commercial 
and Infrastructure construction sectors; and within each of these, the activities of 
New Build and Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (RM&I) sub-sectors. This 
broad exposure across the construction sectors provides a counter-cyclical balance 
to the more volatile peaks and troughs of the new-build cycle, and provides 
even further opportunity for Polypipe to provide effective solutions to new and 
emerging legislation, substitute legacy building materials, and therefore to deliver 
above-market growth.
BALANCED SALES SPLIT
Greater certainty over grant funding  
and flexibility under the Shared 
Ownership and Affordable Homes 
Programme 2016–21 (SOAHP) had been 
expected to drive an increase in public 
housing activity in 2017; however, starts 
in England were 0.1% lower in the first 
three quarters of the year following two 
previous years of declines.
CIVILS AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Overall output in the infrastructure sector 
is expected to rise by 6.3% in 2018 
and 11.1% in 2019 driven by work on 
large-scale infrastructure projects in the 
rail, water and sewerage and electricity 
sub-sectors, in particular.
Within this, output in the rail sector is 
expected to increase by 5.0% in 2018 
and is projected to accelerate to 20.0% 
in 2019 as main civil engineering work 
is projected to start on phase 1 of HS2. 
Recent data indicated that £5.8 billion  
worth of annual orders have been 
awarded at the end of 2017 reflecting 
seven key contracts.
Output in roads construction, where 
Polypipe has significant exposure, is 
expected to remain flat in 2018, with 
delays in some projects pushing demand 
into future years. Going forward, output 
in roads is projected to return to growth 
and increase 3.0% in 2019 driven by a 
pick-up in activity under the £15.2 billion 
Road Investment Strategy.
An important recent factor affecting the 
infrastructure construction sector has 
been the collapse of Carillion. According 
to data from Barbour ABI, around 60% 
of Carillion’s active schemes or projects 
with contracts awarded in which 
Carillion is the sole major contractor 
are infrastructure projects. Within their 
infrastructure work, 53% of the projects 
are road schemes and 42% of the 
projects are rail schemes. The full impact 
of Carillion’s liquidation is yet to play out 
through the long supply chain of sub-
contractors, but will almost certainly  
add to the downside risk of project 
delivery timing.
COMMERCIAL
Commercial activity peaked during the 
first half of 2017 based on new orders 
signed prior to the EU Referendum.
Activity remains at historically high 
levels as commercial sector output 
rose by 3.0% in 2017, based on the 
ONS’s revised output data for the year. 
However, commercial offices new orders 
have fallen since the EU Referendum 
in June 2016 and, following the 12–18 
month lag between orders and output 
in commercial projects, output has fallen 
since summer last year. Since the EU 
Referendum vote, international investors 
and developers adopted more risk-averse 
behaviour towards new projects and new 
orders have fallen sharply. Hence, output 
in the offices sub-sector is expected to 
fall by 5.0% in 2017, 15.0% in 2018 and 
a further 10.0% in 2019.
As a result, commercial sector output 
overall is expected to fall by 5.0% in 
2018 and 1.4% in 2019 as the fall in 
orders feeds through the project pipeline.

POLYPIPE’S BUSINESS MODEL 
Creating the competitive advantage
Polypipe understands its customers’ 
businesses and the challenges they 
face, making us well placed to help 
deliver solutions that meet key market 
drivers. As well as ensuring availability 
of the broadest product portfolio 
that carry an extensive list of product 
approvals, allowing its systems to be 
widely specified, Polypipe has a team of 
experienced experts that train, interact 
with and influence the numerous 
customer groups in all of our market 
sectors. From specifiers and engineers, 
to the merchants, to the installers and 
plumbers, Polypipe’s customers have 
come to expect quality, support, trust, 
competence and capability, which are 
values that are consistently maintained 
throughout the Company’s operations.
In combining all of the above, Polypipe 
continues to maintain the market 
leading position for creating plastic pipe 
technology and sustainable products that 
are intelligently engineered.
With storm events and water shortages 
occurring more frequently due to 
environmental change, Polypipe’s 
engineered solutions help its customers 
ensure their developments are resilient. 
The Company can act as a key partner in 
providing modern building practices in 
regards to managing water as a scarce 
resource, empowering town planners and 
regional authorities to create drainage 
systems that support modern city living. 
As the trend of urbanisation continues 
on a global scale, Polypipe maintains 
its position as an authority on water 
management in these environments, 
helping an expanding population deal 
with flood events and enjoy healthy, 
green space in and around the built 
environment.
Polypipe’s ventilation solutions boosted 
by the acquisition of Nuaire, help to 
provide comfortable environments for 
occupants of buildings, by for example 
regulating temperature, humidity, 
The strength and long-term value of our business model is in  
placing our customers, their markets and the environment at  
the heart of everything that we do.
odours and contaminants in the air. With 
average air temperatures projected to 
rise significantly over the coming decades 
due to climate change, and the ‘urban 
heat island effect’ likely to exacerbate 
the intensity of heatwaves in cities, the 
convergence of low energy heating 
and ventilation solutions that maintain 
comfortable internal temperatures and 
help avoid overheating all year round 
becomes increasingly important.
Furthermore, Polypipe’s Permavoid system 
used on podium decks or at roof level, 
provides a solution for water capture 
(‘rainwater harvesting’) and allows for a 
planted ‘green roof’ that not only acts as 
an insulation barrier, but the combination 
of plant processes (photosynthesis and 
evapotranspiration) and soil processes 
(evapotransmission) reduce the 
amount of solar energy absorbed by 
the roof membrane, leading to cooler 
temperatures beneath the surface, further 
reducing the energy required for cooling.

Polypipe helped provide Seacoal House in the heart of London with a 
state-of-the-art hard landscaped roof and stormwater management 
system, improving the efficiency of the building’s drainage system, 
while providing a roof garden design as a recreational space. At just 
85mm deep, and with a very high void ratio, Permavoid was the 
ideal solution for this roof garden application.

Products: Terrain FUZE HDPE, Soil & Waste
For this prestigious 19-storey hotel, with 453 bedrooms and suites, 
it was of paramount importance that the drainage system installed 
could be trusted not to leak, and so M&E Contractor, H.E. Simm & 
Son Ltd., approached Polypipe to manufacture a suitable solution. 
Terrain FUZE HDPE, made of high-density polyethylene, is lighter 
in weight than the cast iron equivalent and is available in longer 
lengths, meaning less jointing is required, which in turn provides 
fewer opportunities for the system to leak.

STRATEGIC REPORT VISION
STRATEGY
To be the leading provider of 
sustainable and resilient water and 
climate management solutions for 
the built environment
We will do this by building a world-class sustainable 
business and by leveraging our core UK competencies 
across key markets around the world.
A combination of emerging factors such as climate 
change, increasing urbanisation, skills shortages 
on-site, and changes in legislation is leading the 
construction sector to seek innovations and modern 
methods to tackle these challenges, while ensuring 
safe on-site working methods, reduced time to install 
and reduced total cost of ownership. Polypipe’s 
position as a market leader with strong heritage, 
broad product and service portfolio, advanced 
research and development capability and growing 
international presence, makes it ideally placed to 
help its customers tackle many of these challenges.
While Polypipe is well known and respected as a 
manufacturer of plastic pipe products particularly 
for plumbing, drainage and water management 
solutions, the Company’s acquisition of Nuaire 
greatly increases its ability to offer broader 
engineered solutions to customers who also face 
the challenge of climate management associated 
with heating, ventilation, cooling and air quality. The 
innate product benefits of plastic offer the Company 
the opportunity to make gains against manufacturers 
of ‘legacy material’ solutions in many of the markets 
it already leads – offering further growth where 
the brand is already well established. As awareness 
continues to heighten around environmental factors, 
and increased legislation is applied in a variety of 
sectors, Polypipe is well placed to continue to grow 
in the UK, and abroad.

The demand for comprehensive 
water management solutions 
continues to rise. Extreme rainfall 
events, driven by climate change, 
are becoming more frequent. In 
response, the Government has 
introduced new legislation. The 
Floods and Water Management 
Act 2010 sets out new ways to 
manage surface water through 
sustainable drainage systems 
(SuDS). Polypipe has responded 
to this challenging market 
by developing engineered 
Water Management solutions, 
including geocellular and 
large diameter pipe systems 
for retention, attenuation and 
infiltration applications, surface 
water treatment products and 
rainwater reuse solutions, all 
supported by in-house design, 
technical, fabrication and 
product support teams.
Although currently no Government 
legislation is in place, there is 
growing public awareness of the 
need for better indoor air quality. 
Particularly in urban areas, the 
levels of toxins, nitrogen dioxide 
and particulates from heavy traffic 
in particular can cause health 
problems for occupants who 
may be particularly susceptible. 
Through its Nuaire business, 
Polypipe can propose solutions 
that address indoor air quality 
through active filtration systems to 
remove particulates, and humidity 
and temperature management 
systems. Many ventilation systems 
specified today include heat 
recovery systems, Mechanical 
Ventilation with Heat Recovery 
(MVHR) that, as well as improving 
air quality, also recover heat from 
the air being expelled so it can 
be used to heat the incoming air, 
offering significant savings on the 
costs of heating the properties or 
operating the premises.

Using engineered plastics 
rather than traditional 
materials such as concrete or 
clay can lead to innovative 
project solutions that offer 
transportation, installation 
and cost-saving benefits. 
As thermoplastic pipes are 
inherently lighter in weight 
than legacy materials, they 
are quicker and easier to 
install. Polypipe produces 
pipes and fittings utilising 
recycled materials where 
appropriate and all products 
are recyclable at the end 
of their useful life. These 
benefits combined with 
Polypipe’s strong brand and 
technical expertise, offer 
potential for Polypipe’s 
propositions to penetrate 
further against legacy 
materials such as concrete, 
clay, or copper pipes. 
As legislation continues 
to tighten to meet the 
international performance 
targets on water 
management, air quality, 
carbon reduction, and city 
resilience, Polypipe continues 
its long-term investment 
into Water Management 
and Climate Management 
solutions.
For example, Government 
planning policy has defined 
the need for sustainable 
drainage systems (SuDS) 
to ensure that flood risk is 
taken into account during 
all stages of the planning 
process. This planning policy 
is further interpreted into 
national frameworks, local 
legislation and regulations, 
which provide a dynamic 
legislative environment. 
Polypipe’s solutions are 
engineered to address these 
challenges, providing an 
effective controlled retention, 
attenuation or infiltration 
system to suit site-specific 
requirements.
With Polypipe’s UK 
standard-based products, 
and the esteem that UK 
manufacturing is held in 
within a number of growing 
markets around the world, 
the Company seeks to 
expand in selected further 
markets. Many factors 
supporting Polypipe’s growth 
are not unique to the 
UK, such as urbanisation, 
managing water as a scarce 
resource, combined sewer 
systems already at capacity, 
urban island heat effect, and 
poor air quality.
The track record of growth 
in the UK, and the collective 
learning that the Group 
has developed over time, 
form the basis of a set of 
unique competencies across 
the Group, which position 
Polypipe well for future 
development outside the UK.
Acquisition of market-leading 
companies such as Nuaire has 
seen Polypipe do more than 
broaden its manufacturing 
base, with the Company 
also diversifying its offer 
and giving the brand further 
scope to sell an increasingly 
broad range of systems to 
its customers resulting from 
the growing convergence 
of requirements of separate 
systems. Supplementing the 
Group’s existing product 
portfolio, these acquisitions 
help to accelerate the Group’s 
strategic priorities, capability 
and product ranges’ offerings 
– particularly in the areas 
of material substitution 
and Water Management 
and Climate Management 
solutions.
CONTINUOUS INVESTMENT IN PROCESSES  
AND EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES
7
A key component of Polypipe’s success has been its efficiency 
initiatives, with the Company committed to reducing its 
environmental impact in producing its systems. This, in turn, 
has led to reductions in waste – both material and financial. 
Continuous improvement initiatives across the Group, through 
factory automation, as well as investments in fleet and logistics, 
have led to significant improvements in overall operational 
efficiency. Polypipe has been able to streamline its processes by 
increasingly selling complete engineered solutions to customers. 
Rather than simply selling pipe, Polypipe has made best use 
of its manufacturing facilities and expertise to manufacture 
in-house a complete range of complementary fittings and 
ancillaries, enabling design of bespoke systems, and improved 
services for customers.

At Polypipe, our commitment to sustainability flows from our way of working, 
to build and develop a sustainable business, through to taking solutions to 
market that are by nature of their application enabling a sustainable and 
resilient built environment.
The start of this journey is rooted in 
the way we process our polymer raw 
materials.
The reputation of plastic as a material 
has suffered a deterioration in its public 
perception in recent times. However, the 
very characteristics that can lead to plastics 
being a problem for the environment can 
also be applied to solve key environmental 
challenges, such as the management of 
water, or the management of various 
attributes of climate.
By their nature, plastics are chemically 
inert, which means that by themselves 
they do not pollute, in the way that 
hydrocarbons that run off from roads, 
or fertilisers that run off from fields do. 
Furthermore, since plastics repel water 
and do not readily biodegrade, they 
are ideally suited for applications that 
manage water in a sustainable manner.
Therefore, in an environment where 
extreme storm events are becoming 
frequent, and existing combined sewage 
outfall infrastructure is reaching capacity, 
the use of plastics can be engineered as 
a very effective part of the solution to 
manage water.
Along with ensuring that virgin plastics 
and polymers are sourced only from 
reputable suppliers, Polypipe has invested 
heavily and optimised its own recycling 
and polymer processing plant at the 
Horncastle site. Furthermore, Polypipe 
works with industry leading partners 
such as Veolia to source quality recyclable 
bales of plastic bottles and containers. 
This allows the Company to create 
products from recycled plastics, reducing 
transport and the number of processing 
steps to convert recyclate into a high 
performing product, ensuring quality 
control throughout.
Not only is the polymer material 
recyclable at the end of its product 
life, which is designed to be at least 50 
years, the benefits of plastic make it a 
much more considerate choice for the 
environment versus alternative materials. 
Concrete, clay, copper, steel and ductile 
iron pipe systems all require significantly 
more haulage and specialist lifting 
equipment than much lighter plastics, 
which means that the use of Polypipe 
systems greatly reduces carbon emissions 
in delivery and installation.
For example, producing a kilogram of 
virgin plastic releases 2–3 kilograms of 
carbon dioxide, which is about as much 
as the same amount of steel. However, a 
single kilogram of plastic can produce 10 
times more usable product in application 
than steel and 100 times more than 
concrete, so the embedded carbon 
dioxide in application is significantly 
less with plastic pipes than with the 
alternative legacy materials.
In addition, the light weight attribute of 
plastics means that plastic pipes can be 
70% cheaper to transport than equivalent 
size concrete pipes and can be handled 
and stored much more safely on-site.
Producing pipe with recycled plastics 
instead of virgin plastic reduces the 
embedded carbon dioxide further 
still. Recent life cycle analysis (LCA) 
reports suggest that there are clear 
environmental benefits to producing 
plastic products from recovered plastics, 
compared with using virgin polymers 
and disposing of the product post-use 
via incineration or landfill; and these 
environmental gains are particularly high 
for high density polyethylene (HDPE), 
such as that used to make plastic 
bottles. For each tonne of HDPE that is 
recycled, one tonne of carbon dioxide 
is saved versus producing and disposing 
of the same quantity of virgin material. 
HDPE is the material that Polypipe uses 
to produce its large diameter pipes. In 
2017, Polypipe recycled 44,000 tonnes 
of plastic, of which 17,500 tonnes 
came from recyclable plastic bottles and 
containers. As such, recycled plastic 
accounted for 75% of the raw material 
consumed by our Civils and Infrastructure 
Division in 2017, to produce pipes that 
were destined to be buried in the ground 
in applications that will manage and treat 
rainwater and stormwater.

OUR SUSTAINABLE JOURNEY
During the manufacturing process, 
Polypipe works hard to limit 
environmental impact. Taking an 
engineered approach to manufacturing 
ensures that Polypipe customers are 
able to receive systems that meet 
their needs exactly, minimising waste. 
Polypipe staff recognise the importance 
of design through to manufacturing and 
installation and the impact that these 
processes have on the environments in 
which their products are manufactured 
and used, continuously searching for 
the optimum methods of reducing their 
environmental impact.
Polypipe believes that to fulfil its 
responsibilities to the wider industry it 
should actively participate in relevant 
trade bodies such as the British Plastics 
Federation, encouraging best practice 
and a uniform approach to sustainability 
across the industry.
All of this starts with an understanding 
of the built environment. While 
global warming may mean increasing 
temperatures, it also means increased 
rainfall events that have the potential to 
be erratic. Flooding, which has become 
more frequent in the UK in recent 
years, can cause mass disruption in 
the areas it affects, causing damage to 
homes, commercial premises and vital 
infrastructure.
In residential dwellings and tall commercial 
buildings, Polypipe’s solutions start the 
process of managing water at roof level. 
The Company’s market leading geocellular 
solutions, Permavoid, enables architects 
and M&E consultants to create podium 
decks within roofs that can capture water 
and release it into surrounding drainage 
systems at a controlled rate to ensure 
systems are not overwhelmed. In addition, 
these podium decks can encourage 
biodiversity in urban environments 
through the creation of green roofs. 
Building owners can cultivate roof gardens 
that can actively help to mitigate issues 
such as the Heat Island Effect. This helps 
to maintain a stable climate and constant 
temperature inside the building and can 
be part of a carbon efficient solution to 
further reduce the energy requirement for 
cooling and air conditioning.
In addition, the Group’s Nuaire ventilation 
business enhances Polypipe’s ability to 
provide solutions for energy efficient 
ventilation alongside its heating products 
which are suited to low carbon heating. 
While apartment blocks are ideal to 
meet the housing demands of cities, 
developers must deal with the complex 
issues of optimising space, managing 
air quality and overheating, without 
creating nuisance ambient noise. Nuaire’s 
energy-efficient and low-noise ventilation 
systems, with integral heat recovery and 
air filtration, provide solutions to these 
issues, offering developers low-energy 
solutions which safeguard the health of 
residents, in terms of providing sufficient 
fresh air.
With an increasing awareness of the 
need for cities to not only be resilient to 
flooding events, but to plan for these 
events in advance using principles like 
water sensitive urban design (WSUD), 
Polypipe and its experts can provide 
solutions for the creation of spaces that 
are healthy and safe by mitigating water 
abundance, water scarcity and poor air 
quality from manufacture through to 
system performance.

power and water consumption by 
metering usage at machine level.
SUSTAINABLE 
MATERIALS
Polypipe is proud to manufacture 
plastic pipes that are strong yet 
light in weight. This fact alone 
helps towards considerably 
reducing fuel consumption in 
transportation, lowering health 
and safety risks on-site and, as 
we know, our products can be 
recycled at the end of the life.
SUSTAINABLE 
SOLUTIONS
Our products are not only 
sustainably produced, but they 
enhance sustainability in their 
installation and everyday use. For 
example, they save energy, reduce 
CO

STRATEGIC REPORT With an increase in urbanisation across the globe, and the challenges that increased population density places on 
resources, national and regional governments are increasingly aware of the issues surrounding sustainability and the 
need for urban centres to be resilient to extreme events such as flooding and overheating.
Our expertise and product range make us the ideal partner to help manage the movement of water and provide 
engineered solutions that enable the reduction of carbon in these environments, providing a truly global opportunity 
to deliver a sustainable and resilient built environment in established and growing markets around the world.
As cities become more populated and as weather events become more extreme more frequently, no 
single technical solution can claim to resolve these issues by itself. Nevertheless, steps can be taken 
to mitigate the potential impact. Polypipe’s extensive range of Water Management solutions are 
designed to reduce or intercept the potential impact of extreme flooding and to help cities recover 
more quickly.
In fact, to help cities become ever more resilient, Polypipe has developed systems to manage surface 
water, flooding, rainwater harvesting and treatment as well as recycling for reuse.

Project: The Windmill, Doncaster
Application: Underfloor heating
Products: Polypipe’s Overlay™ system 
The very tall layout of the building meant that the heating 
system had to be installed to avoid the heat rising only along the 
wall, leaving the middle of the room cold. Polypipe’s Overlay™ 
system is only 18mm in depth, and so does not raise the floor 
to an unacceptable level, removing the need for messy and 
expensive excavation. With the room being completely round, 
it was impossible to locate radiators to fit the curve of the wall. 
Underfloor heating resolved this issue completely, with no large 
wall mounted equipment required, and so provided the optimal 
retrofit solution.

STRATEGIC REPORT “ Polypipe’s balanced business model, underpinned 
by the long-term growth drivers of legacy material 
substitution and continuing legislative tailwinds, has 
helped produce another record performance in 2017.”
CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S REVIEW
In my first review since appointment as 
Chief Executive Officer, I am pleased to 
report that Polypipe has delivered another 
record performance in 2017, with revenue 
from continuing operations 6.3% higher 
than the prior year at £411.7m (2016 
restated: £387.2m) and underlying 
operating profit 6.0% higher at £72.6m 
(2016 restated: £68.5m). Against a 
background of mixed conditions in the 
UK construction market, this performance 
shows the robust nature of the Polypipe 
business model and the strength of its 
long-term strategic drivers of legacy 
material substitution and continuing 
legislative tailwinds in water management 
and carbon efficiency. Polypipe continues 
to be cash generative and has reduced 
leverage to 1.6 times EBITDA (2016: 1.9 
times) leaving the Group well invested and 
able to pursue bolt-on acquisitions that 
complement the Group’s current activities. 
The Group will continue to focus on its 
key strategic and operational priorities, 
and I am confident that we will maintain 
revenue growth ahead of the overall UK 
construction market.
In January 2018, the Group announced 
that it was in advanced negotiations to 
dispose of its French subsidiary (Polypipe 
France) to Ryb S.A., a private French 
business that operates in similar French 
markets to Polypipe France, for €16.5m 
on a cash-free, debt-free, normalised 
working capital basis. In 2017, Polypipe 
France generated revenue of £58.4m 
and underlying operating profit of 
£1.4m. There is very little strategic 
overlap between our UK and French 
businesses as they operate in different 
product areas, the latter operating in 
the significantly lower margin electrical 
conduit, potable water, gas and irrigation 
pipe product groups. Following a full 
review of the business, the Board decided 
Polypipe France was not core to the 
Group and to dispose of it. Completion 
of the transaction is expected in the first 
half of 2018. I believe this deal represents 
excellent shareholder value and once 
completed will allow the Group to 
concentrate on its higher margin product 
areas. For the purposes of this report, 
the results of Polypipe France have been 
treated as discontinued. 
I am pleased to say that the Group 
has risen to several commercial and 
operational challenges during the year. 
Following the EU Referendum in June 
2016 and the subsequent devaluation 
of Sterling, materials costs rose 
substantially in the second half of 2016 
and into 2017. While we do all we can 
to ameliorate price increases through 
cost reduction, selling price increases 
were inevitable. These were successfully 
implemented across the Group in the first 
half of 2017 to mitigate materials and 
other inflationary increases, taking effect 
progressively throughout the period. 
Although exchange rates were relatively 
stable throughout 2017, increasing oil 
prices as well as tight polymer markets 
in the second half of the year pushed 
materials prices higher still, and impacted 
on second half performance. Further 
selling price increases are being actioned 
in early 2018 to address this and other 
inflationary effects. The Group has a 
good history of cost inflation recovery, 
even in difficult market conditions, and 
I have confidence the Group will be 
successful with this latest challenge.

Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc
22 In June 2017, a trade embargo was 
introduced between Qatar and many of 
the Gulf states following ongoing political 
disagreements. With approximately 
60% of our pipeline projects emanating 
from Qatar, and the more general 
project financing issues in the wider 
Gulf in the first half of the year, the 
decision was taken to temporarily cease 
manufacturing in our Dubai facility, and 
a non-underlying charge of £0.9m was 
recorded in our interim results covering 
redundancy costs and stock provisions. 
During the second half of the year there 
has been no change to the situation 
between Qatar and the other Gulf states; 
the trade embargo remains in force, and 
general project financing still appears 
to be slow as the region adjusts to a 
lower oil price. While the Middle East still 
represents a significant opportunity for 
the Group, we have decided to pursue an 
alternative manufacturing strategy in the 
region through use of sub-contractors 
and to close permanently our Dubai 
manufacturing facility. All equipment will 
be relocated back to our Horncastle plant 
where Polystorm is manufactured for the 
UK market, enabling us to remove the 
need for more expensive sub-contract 
manufacturing in the UK. A further non-
underlying charge of £3.1m has been 
recorded covering machinery relocation 
costs, further redundancy, onerous lease 
costs and asset impairments, leaving the 
total non-underlying charge for the year 
at £4.0m, of which £1.7m is non-cash. 
As well as expanding capacity where 
necessary, we continue to invest in both 
new product technology and automation 
in our businesses. Our new £2.2m 
multi-layer extrusion lines in our main 
Doncaster plant became operational in 
the early part of 2017 which has allowed 
us to significantly increase the amount of 
recycled material used in manufacturing 
our drainage and latterly our soil and 
waste pipes. Towards the end of the 
year, our new £5.0m large diameter 
continuous corrugator came into 
operation at our Horncastle plant. This 
increases our capacity to manufacture 
750mm and 900mm drainage pipes 
and allows the Group to make further 
inroads in this area of the market. These 
new pipes, as well as much of our 
existing civils drainage pipe offer, are 
manufactured from recycled milk bottles 
and other polyethylene consumer liquid 
bottles using our wash plant recycling 
facility at Horncastle. We consume 
approximately 44,000 tonnes of recycled 
material representing one-third of the 
overall material requirement across the 
Group, and both of these projects further 
enhance our already strong sustainability 
and recycling credentials, something that 
is important to Polypipe, our customers 
and our wider stakeholders.
As well as new product technology, 
there has been further investment 
in automation in the year to expand 
capacity, but also to test out new 
automation techniques. We took 
delivery of our first collaborative robot in 
December, which when fully integrated 
into our manufacturing process will 
further improve productivity and quality. 
This advanced, lower cost automation 
technology has the potential to unlock 
productivity opportunities that have not 
been achievable previously because of 
technical or financial constraints.
The treatment of Polypipe France in this 
report has caused the Group to review its 
segmental analysis. The remaining part 
of the previously reported Commercial 
and Infrastructure – Mainland Europe 
segment, being our Italian business 
Effast, will be consolidated with the 
existing Commercial and Infrastructure – 
UK segment to create one segment called 
Commercial and Infrastructure Systems.

STRATEGIC REPORT RESIDENTIAL SYSTEMS
Revenue in our Residential Systems 
segment, which is almost exclusively 
derived from the UK market, was 10.3% 
higher than the prior year at £223.5m 
(2016: £202.7m), of which 6.6% is 
volume growth, considerably ahead of 
the market.
Strong demand in the new housebuild 
sector continued to drive growth in 
the year as the Government’s Help-
to-Buy scheme continues to support 
first time buyers’ demand. The Repair, 
Maintenance and Improvement (RMI) 
market however continues to be slow, 
with weak consumer confidence and 
falling real wages constraining private 
RMI, and austerity in Government 
spending on social housing stock 
constraining public RMI.
Continued growth in this segment, 
exacerbated by merchant pull forward of 
orders ahead of the February 2017 selling 
price increase, led to some challenges 
in the earlier part of the year, notably in 
capacity planning and logistics. The year 
started with below normal levels of stock 
following some pull forward of orders 
into December 2016, but as a number 
of areas moved into seven day working 
these stock levels normalised. Capital 
expenditure on new capacity allowed 
us to revert back to more normal shift 
patterns in those areas during the year, 
and leaves the business well placed to 
continue to benefit from the buoyant UK 
residential market. 
Residential Systems delivered an 
underlying operating profit 13.3% higher 
than the prior year of £44.3m (2016: 
£39.1m) representing a 19.8% margin 
(2016: 19.3%).
CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S REVIEW
COMMERCIAL AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS
Revenue in our Commercial and 
Infrastructure Systems segment was 
2.0% higher than the prior year at 
£188.2m (2016 restated: £184.5m). 
UK revenue, which accounts for 79% 
of the overall segment revenue, was 
4.1% higher than the prior year, against 
strong comparatives in 2016. In the 
infrastructure sector, our Civils business 
has seen strong demand for stormwater 
collection, storage and attenuation 
products from the new housebuild 
sector. However, strong demand in 2016 
from the Aberdeen Bypass road project, 
which finished in early 2017, and delays 
in the A14 road upgrade and other 
projects has meant the roads sector 
has been more challenging. The dip in 
commercial project awards seen around 
the time of the EU Referendum in the 
middle of 2016, together with a 12 to 18 
month lag before delivery to site for our 
products, led to subdued demand in the 
commercial sector. Although the project 
pipeline improved towards the back end 
of the year, it is clear that projects are 
being delayed as the continuing political 
and economic situation in the UK causes 
uncertainty. 
Export revenue, which accounts for 
approximately 21% of overall segment 
revenue, was 5.4% lower than the prior 
year, with the performance in the Middle 
East driving this. The large Jebel Ali Hills 
project in 2016 that was supplied initially 
from our Horncastle plant, and later in 
the year from our Dubai manufacturing 
facility, completed in early 2017. A 
combination of project customer funding 
issues, and latterly the Qatar trade 
embargo, meant new projects did not 
come through at a pace to compensate. 
More encouragingly, exports to Europe 
performed well, and in particular our 
Italian business, Effast, made good 
progress.

The Group gains significant resilience by having a balanced exposure to the different 
elements of the UK construction market, all of which have different drivers and move at 
different paces, and this year’s performance perhaps more than most demonstrates this. 
24
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc
24 Commercial and Infrastructure Systems 
delivered an underlying operating profit 
of £28.3m (2016 restated: £29.4m) 
and represents a 15.0% margin 
(2016 restated: 15.9%). The financial 
performance of our Dubai manufacturing 
facility, including the temporary cessation 
of manufacturing in the second half 
of the year, is the main driver behind 
this reduction in operating profit and, 
as described earlier, decisive actions 
have been taken to improve future 
performance in the Middle East.
OUTLOOK
Following the Group’s record 
performance in 2017, the current year 
has started ahead of the same period 
last year. Forecasts for 2018 show a 
broadly flat construction market although 
the Group has a strong track record 
of outperforming the market. While 
the UK RMI market is likely to remain 
tough throughout the coming year, the 
strength of the UK new housebuild sector 
will continue to drive demand for our 
Residential Systems segment, for which 
the year has started well. Conditions in 
the UK commercial and infrastructure 
sectors remain positive in terms of project 
pipeline, and demand from key road 
projects such as the A14 road upgrade 
should gather pace this year, but there is 
evidence that project starts continue to 
be delayed, impacting performance in our 
Commercial and Infrastructure Systems 
segment in the early part of the year. The 
news of Carillion’s demise in January may 
potentially lead to further project delays 
as main contracts are renegotiated and 
the impact on sub-contractors works 
through the market. 
Having successfully delivered the 
necessary actions in 2017 to mitigate 
polymer and other cost inflation 
arising from the post EU Referendum 
weakening of Sterling, we again need 
to pass through polymer and other cost 
inflation seen during 2017 and into early 
2018. While doing everything we can 
to alleviate the need for selling price 
increases, we are confident that our 
customers expect us to pass on essential 
increases, and we expect to see the 
benefit of these price increases coming 
through as we move into the second 
quarter of 2018. 
Our continued focus on delivering 
innovative new products and excellent 
customer service, together with the 
strength of our growth drivers of 
legacy material substitution, continuing 
legislative tailwinds and our balanced 
exposure to the different sectors of 
the construction industry, gives the 
Board confidence that despite a mixed 
market outlook, 2018 will be another 
year of progress for the Group and 
our expectations for the year remain 
unchanged.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S
REPORT
Group revenue at £411.7m was 6.3% 
higher than the prior year. With Polypipe 
France now classified as discontinued 
there is little foreign currency translation 
effect on reported revenue, and the 
structure of the Group on a continuing 
operations basis is the same in both 
periods, meaning like-for-like growth 
was also 6.3%. Within this, revenue 
derived from the UK market grew 8.1%, 
with approximately 3.7% driven by price 
increases and 4.4% by volume growth. 
This volume growth was materially 
ahead of the overall UK construction 
market, which the Construction Products 
Association (CPA) winter forecast 
suggests has grown by 3.0% in the year.
The Group underlying operating margin 
remained robust at 17.6% (2016 
restated: 17.7%). The dilutive effect 
of increasing selling prices to recover 
absolute cost inflation and the financial 
performance of our Dubai manufacturing 
facility has been offset by operational 
leverage and cost reduction initiatives in 
our core businesses.

NON-UNDERLYING ITEMS
Non-underlying items in both 2017 and

charges in respect of intangible assets 
recognised with the acquisitions made 
during 2015. In 2017, they also included 
restructuring costs of £4.3m, in respect of 
the closure of our Dubai manufacturing 
facility (£4.0m, of which £1.7m is 
non-cash) and relocation of our Domus 
Ventilation manufacturing facilities to 
Nuaire (£0.3m). In 2016, they included 
a non-cash charge of £0.9m in respect 
of the impairment of a surplus freehold 
property that is held-for-sale.

Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc
26 FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs of £6.9m (2016: £7.6m) 
were lower than the prior year driven by 
lower average net debt in the year, and 
the lower interest rate margin payable on 
our borrowings as leverage reduces. This 
reflects the continued cash generative 
nature of our business. Interest is payable 
on the revolving credit facility (RCF) 
at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin 
ranging from 1.25% to 2.75%. The 
interest rate margin at 31 December 
2017 was 1.75% (2016: 2.00%).
In order to reduce exposure to future 
increases in interest rates the Group has 
entered into interest rate swaps at fixed 
rates ranging between 1.735% and 
2.21% (excluding margin) with notional 
amounts hedged ranging from £60.0m 
to £91.7m over the period of the interest 
rate swaps.
The unrealised mark to market 
adjustment on these forward interest 
rate swaps at 31 December 2017 was 
£2.5m negative (2016: £4.2m negative). 
The movement in the mark to market 
adjustment during the year of £1.7m 
is included in the Group Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
TAXATION
Underlying taxation:
The underlying tax charge in 2017 was 
£11.8m representing an effective tax 
rate of 18.0% (2016 restated: 19.2%). 
This is below the blended UK standard 
tax rate of income tax of 19.25% (2016: 
20.00%) due primarily to the benefit of 
patent box relief.
Non-underlying items comprised:

Non-underlying items before taxation 10.1 7.4
Taxation (1.2) (1.6)
Non-underlying items after taxation 8.9 5.8
Taxation on non-underlying items is covered in the note on taxation below. 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On 31 January 2018, the Group 
announced that it had entered into 
exclusive negotiations to sell Polypipe 
France Holding SAS (Polypipe France) to 
Ryb S.A., a France-based manufacturer 
and distributor of plastics in Europe. The 
cash consideration payable by Ryb S.A. 
will be €16.5m on a cash-free, debt-free 
and normalised working capital basis. It 
was determined that the sale was highly 
probable at 31 December 2017 and 
accordingly the net assets of Polypipe 
France have been classified as held-for-
sale in the consolidated balance sheet. 
In accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current 
Assets Held-for-Sale and Discontinued 
Operations, an impairment loss of £12.5m 
to remeasure the carrying amount of the 
assets to fair value less costs to sell has 
been recognised. A loss from discontinued 
operations of £11.3m (2016 restated: 
£0.8m profit) is recorded in the income 
statement, being the impairment loss of 
£12.5m (2016 restated: £nil), net of the 
post-tax results of Polypipe France for the 
period of £1.2m profit (2016 restated: 
£0.8m profit).
EXCHANGE RATES
The Group is exposed to movements 
in exchange rates when translating the 
results of its Mainland Europe operations 
from Euros to Sterling. Following the 
EU Referendum in June 2016, Sterling 
depreciated further against the Euro 
during 2017 with the average exchange 
rate used for translation purposes moving 
from £1:€1.23 in 2016 to £1:€1.15 
in 2017. With Polypipe France now 
classified as discontinued, the impact 
of this exchange rate movement is now 
negligible on both reported revenue and 
underlying operating profit.
The Group trades predominantly in 
Sterling but has some revenues and costs 
in other currencies, mainly the US Dollar 
and the Euro, and takes appropriate 
forward cover on these flows using 
forward currency derivative contracts.
Forward foreign currency derivatives 
are classified as held for trading. There 
was no unrealised gain or loss on these 
derivative contracts at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £1.5m loss included in financial 
liabilities). The unrealised gains or losses 
are treated as underlying and recorded in 
cost of sales in the income statement.

Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com
STRATEGIC REPORT Taxation on non-underlying items:
The non-underlying taxation credit of 
£1.2m in 2017 represents an effective 
rate of 11.9%, primarily due to a 
substantial proportion of restructuring 
costs being incurred in the Jebel Ali tax-
free zone in the Middle East.

indication of the Group’s underlying 
financial performance and more 
meaningful comparison with prior and 
future periods to assess trends in our

Underlying basic EPS improved by 
10.1% in 2017 due to the improved 
underlying operating result, lower interest 
costs and lower underlying tax rate as 
explained above.
DIVIDEND
The final dividend of 7.5 pence per share 
is being recommended for payment 
on 25 May 2018 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 
20 April 2018. The ex-dividend date will 
be 19 April 2018.
Our dividend policy is to pay a minimum 
of 40% of the Group’s annual underlying 
profit after tax. The Directors intend 
that the Group will pay the total annual 
dividend in two tranches, an interim

REPORT
BALANCE SHEET
The Group’s balance sheet is summarised below:
2017 
£m
2016 
£m
Property, plant and equipment 98.6 101.0
Goodwill 319.7 329.3
Other intangible assets 36.8 42.3
Net assets classified as held-for-sale 13.1 0.7
Net working capital 0.4 0.5
Taxation (12.6) (14.3)
Other current and non-current assets and liabilities (5.6) (7.8)
Net debt (loans and borrowings, net of cash and cash 
equivalents) (148.4) (164.3)
Net assets 302.0 287.4
Property, plant and equipment reduced by £2.4m and, excluding the transfer to 
assets classified as held-for-sale of £9.2m in respect of Polypipe France, increased by 
£6.8m predominantly due to capital expenditure exceeding depreciation by a similar 
amount, which included the £3.0m of expenditure deferred from 2016 as discussed in 
last year’s Annual Report and Accounts. Other intangible assets decreased by £5.5m, 
compared to a decrease of £6.8m in 2016, reflecting that some of the assets in 
respect of the 2015 acquisitions are now fully amortised. Net working capital reduced 
by £0.1m but excluding the transfer to assets classified as held-for-sale of £7.2m, 
increased by £7.1m, driven by higher material costs of inventories and normalisation 
of stock levels. Net debt is discussed below.
PENSIONS
The Group does not have any defined benefit pension schemes and only has defined 
contribution pension arrangements in place. Pension costs for the year amounted to 
£2.7m (2016: £2.5m).
CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT
The Group’s cash flow statement is summarised below:

Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc
28 Underlying cash generated from operations after net capital expenditure at £57.7m 
(2016: £67.8m) represents a conversion rate of 78% (2016: 97%). The lower 
conversion rate compared to the prior year is due to a higher working capital outflow 
and higher capital expenditure than the prior year. The higher working capital outflow 
is largely due to increases in stock, partly driven by higher material costs, and also 
finished goods stock build. This was necessary to replenish stock back to normal levels 
in the earlier part of the year following pre-price increase buying in December 2016, 
and further stock build in the latter part of the year in anticipation of further pre-price 
increase buying ahead of the February 2018 price increase. 
As discussed in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, in a measured response to the 
uncertainty created by the EU Referendum in June 2016, we took the decision to delay 
certain capacity expansion capital expenditure projects, while continuing to spend 
on development growth projects and essential replacement. The performance of the 
Group since the EU Referendum and the more positive economic outlook compared 
to the period immediately afterwards gave us the confidence to resume those delayed 
projects, and therefore net capital expenditure in 2017 at £23.2m was £4.5m higher 
than the prior year.
In 2016, one million shares were purchased at a cost of £2.9m and held for the 
purpose of satisfying future employee share option scheme awards. In 2017, a further 
748,000 shares were purchased at a cost of £0.7m net of the proceeds from the 
maturing Sharesave Plan.
Net debt of £148.4m comprised:

Unamortised debt issue costs 0.9 1.2 (0.3)

Net debt (excluding unamortised 
debt issue costs): EBITDA 1.6 1.9
At 31 December 2017, liquidity headroom (cash and undrawn committed banking 
facilities) was substantial and improved to £140.7m (2016: £134.5m) despite the 
£10.0m contractual reduction in the facility during the year. Continued focus on 
deleveraging following the Nuaire acquisition in August 2015 has seen our net debt 
to EBITDA ratio reduce substantially to 1.6 times EBITDA at 31 December 2017 (2016: 
1.9 times), demonstrating the continued cash generative nature of our business. This 
headroom, together with the disposal proceeds from Polypipe France when received, 
enables us to develop our acquisition pipeline and continue to seek out compelling 
opportunities to accelerate growth in our strategic development areas.
FINANCING
The Group has an RCF committed through to August 2020 with a facility limit at 
31 December 2017 of £290m, reducing by £10m per annum at 31 December 2018 
and 2019. At 31 December 2017, £185m of the RCF was drawn down.
The Group is subject to two financial 
covenants. At 31 December 2017 there 
was significant headroom:

STRATEGIC REPORT FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISK
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Group maintains an effective risk management system. It determines the Group’s 
approach to risk, its policies and the procedures that are implemented to mitigate exposure to risk.
PROCESS
The Board continually assesses and monitors the key risks in the business and Polypipe has developed a risk management 
framework to identify, report, and manage its principal risks and uncertainties. This includes the recording of all principal risks and 
uncertainties on a Group Risk Register and a Group Risk Profile which are both updated at least every six months. Risks are fully 
analysed, allocated owners, scored for both impact and probability to determine the exposure to the business, which should be 
prioritised, and what mitigation is required.
External risks include economic conditions, the weather, Government action, policies and regulations, raw material prices and 
information systems disruption. Internal risks include reliance on key customers, and recruitment and retention of key personnel.
The Board seeks to mitigate the businesses’ exposure to strategic, financial and operational risk, both external and internal. The 
effectiveness of key mitigating controls is continually monitored and subjected to periodic testing by the Group Financial Controller. 
The table below highlights the principal risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the Group’s performance and 
prospects and the mitigating activities which are aimed at reducing the impact or likelihood of a major risk materialising. These risks 
have all been considered by the Board when developing the Group’s Viability Statement. The Board does recognise however that 
it will not always be possible to eliminate these risks entirely. In addition, the principal risks listed below do not comprise all of the 
risks that the Group may face and they are not listed in order of priority, probability or magnitude of potential impact.
PRINCIPAL  
RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES
Risk Potential impact Mitigation
Change in potential 
impact and/or 
probability
Raw material prices
The Group is exposed to 
volatile raw material prices, 
particularly polymers, due to 
fluctuations in the market 
price of crude oil and other 
petroleum feedstocks, foreign 
currency exchange rate 
movements, and changes 
to suppliers’ manufacturing 
capacity.
Any increase in the market 
price of crude oil or other 
petroleum feedstocks, 
foreign currency exchange 
rate movements, or changes 
to suppliers’ manufacturing 
capacity could have a direct 
impact on the prices the Group 
pays for raw materials which 
could adversely affect its 
financial results. 
The Group seeks to pass on raw material price 
increases to its customers wherever possible. There 
is usually at least a three-month time lag from 
notification of the raw material price increase before 
selling prices can be adjusted in the market. 
Competitors of the Group are likely to experience 
the same pressures of any sustained raw material 
price increases.
No change
Business disruption
The Group’s manufacturing 
and distribution operations 
could be subjected to 
disruption due to incidents 
including, but not limited to, 
fire, failure of equipment, 
power outages, workforce 
strikes, or unexpected or 
prolonged periods of severe 
weather.
Such incidents could result 
in the temporary cessation in 
activity, or disruption, at one of 
the Group’s production facilities 
impeding the ability to deliver 
its products to its customers, 
thereby adversely affecting the 
Group’s financial results.
In addition, prolonged periods 
of severe weather could 
result in a slowdown in site 
construction activity reducing 
the demand for the Group’s 
products thereby adversely 
affecting its financial results.
The Group has developed business continuity, crisis 
response, and disaster recovery plans.
The Group performs regular maintenance to 
minimise the risk of equipment failure.
Finished goods holdings across the operations act as 
a limited buffer in the event of operational failure.
The Group has the ability to transfer some of 
its production to alternative sites and could also 
subcontract out some of its tooling to reduce any 
potential loss in production capacity.
The Group maintains a significant amount of 
insurance to cover business interruption and damage 
to property from such incidents.
Independent insurer inspections take place across 
all sites to identify and assess potential hazards and 
business interruption risks.

Reliance on key customers
Some of the Group’s 
businesses are dependent 
on key customers in highly 
competitive markets.
Failure to manage relationships 
with key customers, while 
continuing to provide high 
quality products delivered on 
time in full, and developing 
new innovative products, 
could lead to a loss of business 
thereby adversely affecting the 
Group’s financial results.
The Group’s strategic objective is to broaden its 
customer base wherever possible.
The Group focuses on delivering exceptional 
customer service and maintains strong relationships 
with major customers through direct engagement at 
all levels.
The Group maintains customer service matrices 
which are continually tracked and monitored with 
intervention made where required.
The Group closely manages its pricing, rebates, and 
commercial terms with its customers to ensure that 
they remain competitive.
The Group continually seeks to innovate and develop 
its product lines to ensure its products are to the 
standard our customers expect.
No change
Recruitment and retention of key personnel
The Group is dependent on 
the continued employment 
and performance of our senior 
management team and other 
key skilled personnel.
Loss of any key personnel 
without adequate and timely 
replacement could disrupt 
business operations and the 
Group’s ability to implement 
and deliver its growth strategy.
The Group has a formal succession plan in place 
facilitating staff retention and progression through 
the Group. 
The Group aims to provide competitive remuneration 
packages and incentive schemes to retain and 
motivate key personnel.
Increased
Economic conditions
The Group is dependent on 
the level of activity in the 
construction industry and 
is therefore susceptible to 
any changes in its cyclical 
economic conditions.
Lower levels of activity within 
the construction industry could 
reduce sales and production 
volumes thereby adversely 
affecting the Group’s financial 
results.
The Group closely monitors trends in the industry, 
invests in market research and is an active member 
of the Construction Products Association. The 
Group uses Construction Products Association and 
Euroconstruct forecasts in its budgeting process.
The Group closely manages its demand forecasts and 
costs through weekly operational review meetings. 
No change
Government action and policies
The Group is in part 
dependent on Government 
action and policies relating to 
public and private investment 
and is therefore susceptible 
to changes in Government 
spending priorities.
Significant downward trends 
in Government spending on 
public and private investment 
arising from economic 
uncertainty and ongoing 
austerity policies could have 
an adverse impact on the 
construction industry which 
could impact on sales and 
production volumes thereby 
adversely affecting the Group’s 
financial results.
The Group’s strategy is to have its operations 
structured so that it has a balanced exposure to 
the residential, commercial and infrastructure 
construction sectors so as to reduce the impact of 
any adverse Government action or policy on any one 
of the construction sectors.
The Group closely monitors trends in the industry, 
invests in market research and is an active member 
of the Construction Products Association.

Government regulations and standards relating to the manufacture and use  
of building materials
The Group is subject to the 
requirements of UK and 
European environmental 
and occupational safety and 
health laws and regulations, 
including obligations to 
investigate and clean up 
environmental contamination 
on or from properties. 
Failure of the Group to 
comply with changes to 
environmental regulations and 
other obligations relating to 
environmental matters could 
result in the Group being liable 
for fines, require modification 
to operations, increase 
manufacturing and delivery 
costs, and could result in the 
suspension or termination of 
necessary operational permits, 
thereby adversely affecting the 
Group’s financial results.
The Group has a formal Health, Safety and 
Environmental policy, and procedures are in place to 
monitor compliance with the policy.
The Group performs internal environmental audits 
and is subjected to external environmental audits on 
a periodic basis.
The Group performs weekly and monthly reporting 
on key Health, Safety and Environmental matters 
which require the attention of the Board.
No change
Product liability
The Group manufactures 
products that are potentially 
vital to the safe operation of 
its customers’ products or 
processes. These products 
are often incorporated into 
the fabric of a building 
or dwelling, or buried in 
the ground as part of an 
infrastructure system and in 
each case, it would be difficult 
to access, repair, recall or 
replace such products.
A product failure or recall 
could result in a liability claim 
for personal injury or other 
damage leading to substantial 
financial settlements, 
damage to the Group’s 
brand reputation, costs and 
expenses and diversion of key 
management’s attention from 
the operation of the Group, 
which could all adversely affect 
the Group’s financial results.
The Group operates comprehensive quality assurance 
systems and procedures at each site. 
Wherever required, the Group obtains certifications 
over its products to the relevant national and 
European standards including Kitemarks, BBAs, 
WRCs and WRACs. 
The Group maintains product liability insurance 
to cover third party claims arising from potential 
product failures or recalls.

RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES Risk Potential impact Mitigation
Change in potential 
impact and/or 
probability
Information systems
The Group is dependent on the 
continued efficient operation 
of its information systems 
and is therefore vulnerable to 
potential failures due to power 
losses, telecommunication 
failures, or from an external 
security breach due to 
the increasing levels of 
sophisticated cyber-crime now 
threatening businesses.
Disruption or failure of the 
information systems could affect 
the Group’s ability to conduct its 
ongoing operations which could 
adversely affect the Group’s 
financial results.
The Group contracts with several third party providers 
to supply off-site, business continuity arrangements 
for wholesale or partial recovery of the key servers 
and applications which are used within the various 
business units of the Group. These continuity 
arrangements are subject to periodic validation and 
testing. Some business units of the Group also take 
advantage of their multi-site operations to provision 
server and applications recovery between those sites. 
There are a range of local, business unit specific, 
backup processes which are performed on a daily, 
weekly and monthly basis.
Firewalls are in place to protect the perimeter of 
the Group’s networks and any off-site access to the 
Group’s servers and applications is through secure 
Virtual Private Network connections. In addition, 
email and internet traffic filtering is in place to protect 
against potential viruses or malware entering the 
Group’s networks. User and server computing devices 
have anti-virus software installed to protect from 
potential infection.
The Group continually invests in the maintenance and 
upgrade of IT infrastructure and information systems. 
All upgrades are carefully planned and actively 
managed by senior personnel to minimise potential 
business disruption.
Increased
Acquisitions
The management of 
acquisitions’ activity and their 
integration play a part in 
delivering the Group’s growth 
strategy and there is a risk 
that any acquisitions may not 
perform as expected.
Ineffective management of 
acquisitions could lead to 
management distraction, a 
drain on financial resources, and 
impact on the Group’s ability 
to successfully implement and 
deliver its growth strategy.
Full due diligence is performed before any acquisition 
is made.
The Group seeks contractual assurances from the 
sellers to mitigate against any identified issues or 
risks.
Formal Board level approvals are required in 
accordance with the Group’s delegation of authority 
structure for any acquisition activity.
The progress of any integration is closely monitored 
at Board and senior management team level.

Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose 
it to a variety of financial risks 
that include the effects of:
The Group has in place financial risk management 
procedures that seek to limit the potential adverse 
effects of the financial risks as follows:
Foreign currency exchange 
risk – The risk that the fair 
value of a financial instrument 
or future cash flows will 
fluctuate because of changes 
in foreign currency exchange 
rates. The Group’s risk relates 
primarily to its operating 
activities where the revenue 
or expense is denominated 
in a currency other than 
the functional currency of 
the entity undertaking the 
transaction.
Foreign currency exchange rate 
fluctuations could adversely 
affect the Group’s financial 
results.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency 
exchange rate contracts for the purchase and sale of 
foreign currencies in order to manage its exposure 
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
primarily in respect of US Dollars and Euros relative 
to Pounds Sterling. It is not possible for the Group to 
mitigate foreign currency exchange rate movements 
which impact the translation of its overseas 
subsidiaries’ results and net assets as all of the 
Group’s long-term borrowings are Pounds Sterling 
denominated.
Increased
Credit risk – The risk that a 
counterparty of the Group 
will not be able to meet its 
obligations under a financial 
instrument or customer 
contract. The Group is 
exposed to credit risk from 
its trading activities (primarily 
from trade receivables) and 
from its financing activities, 
including deposits with banks.
The failure of a counterparty to 
meet their financial obligations 
could lead to a financial loss for 
the Group.
Customer credit risk is managed by each business 
unit subject to the Group’s established policy, 
procedures and controls relating to customer credit 
risk management. Credit quality of the customer 
is assessed based on an extensive credit rating 
scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in 
accordance with this assessment.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly 
monitored and any shipments to major export 
customers are generally covered by letters of credit 
or credit insurance.
Where the Group perceives there to be a significant 
credit exposure it will take out credit insurance or 
obtain an irrevocable letter of credit prior to any 
transaction.
Credit risk arising from cash deposits with banks is 
managed in accordance with the Group’s established 
treasury policy, procedures and controls. Investments 
of surplus funds are made only with banks that have 
as a minimum a single A credit rating.
No change
Liquidity risk – The risk that 
the Group will not be able to 
meets its financial obligations 
as they fall due.
Insufficient funds could result 
in the Group not being able to 
fund its operations.
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to 
ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable 
losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
Reduced
Interest rate cash flow risk 
– The risk that interest rates 
could rise impacting on the 
Group’s borrowings.
Increases to interest rates 
could result in significant 
additional interest rate cash 
payments being required on 
any borrowings. 
To reduce the Group’s exposure to future increases 
in interest rates, the Group has entered into interest 
rate swaps from variable to fixed interest rates.
Increased
EU REFERENDUM AND UK DEPARTURE FROM THE EU 
The result of the Referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU leading to the expected departure of the UK from the EU (Brexit), 
could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty around our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and 
future customers, suppliers and colleagues. These disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect the Group’s financial results. 
As further details of the Brexit terms emerge, management will continue to assess the potential risks and impact of these on  
the Group.

34 POLICY
Polypipe’s policy is to enhance 
shareholder value while ensuring we 
provide a safe working environment 
and continually seeking to minimise the 
impact of our operations and products on 
the environment.
The Board considers that operating 
efficiently with high quality standards 
includes promoting high standards of 
health and safety and helping to protect 
the environment.
This section of the Strategic Report 
sets out our approach to corporate 
responsibility and includes regulatory 
information on carbon emissions, 
employee diversity and our policies in 
relation to the recruitment and retention 
of our employees.
EMPLOYMENT
Our vision for our businesses and 
employees is to have a culture 
of customer focused continuous 
improvement, driven by teamwork, 
effective communication and personal 
development. Our core values are hard 
work, honesty, trust and integrity and 
maintaining a working environment 
based on mutual respect.
Polypipe is committed to providing 
the appropriate skills and technical 
training that allow employees to operate 
effectively and safely in their roles and 
deliver excellent customer service. As part 
of our ongoing commitment to customer 
service excellence, all our new starters 
in front-line service areas receive The 
Institute of Customer Service training on 
joining the Group, resulting in over 200 
of our employees benefiting from this 
programme in the last four years.
Polypipe has consistently provided 
apprenticeships to the communities 
around our businesses by supporting 
enthusiastic, highly motivated people 
who are keen to learn a trade. We 
have an outstanding record of retaining 
apprentices in ongoing, long-term, 
full-time employment; indeed, many of 
our management team started with the 
business as apprentices. We consider it 
an essential part of finding and retaining 
people with the sector specific skills that 
we need.
During 2017 we had 32 apprentices 
employed in our businesses in the UK and 
we intend to increase the number further. 
The majority of our apprenticeships are 
in electrical, mechanical and tool-making 
trades but we continue to support a 
number of apprenticeships in other 
disciplines.
Underlining our commitment to 
advanced manufacturing engineering, 
we continue to place apprentices at the 
new University of Sheffield Advanced 
Manufacturing Research Centre, a 
state-of-the-art centre that offers the 
very best in practical and academic 
training. In support of our engineering 
focus we continue to work closely with 
Cogent Skills, strategic partner to the 
science industry, supporting ongoing 
development of industry specific 
apprenticeship frameworks for the future.
The Group involves employees through 
formal and informal systems of 
communication and consultation. Each 
of our main operating sites have display 
boards which set out our continuous 
improvement strategy and include KPIs 
updated each month on areas relevant 
to the strategy such as health and safety 
performance, products and process 
improvement initiatives, and customer 
satisfaction performance.
While the Group does not have a specific 
human rights policy, it does have an 
Anti-Slavery policy and Modern Slavery 
Act Transparency statement available on 
the Company’s website, within which we 
state our zero tolerance policy towards 
any modern slavery or human trafficking 
rights violations.
The Group gives every consideration to 
applicants for employment regardless 
of their sex, sexual orientation, religion, 
colour, race, nationality, marital status or 
disability having regard for their aptitude 
and ability to adequately perform the 
role while maintaining a safe working 
environment. Where employees become 
disabled, the Group makes appropriate 
and reasonable adjustments to their work 
environment and/or duties, endeavouring 
to maintain their employment provided 
there are duties they can perform.
CASE STUDY SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT
The Big Bang Fair is an annual event designed to inspire students to take up a career in 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM). 
As a major Doncaster employer with a huge variety of career options, Polypipe was 
delighted to meet young visitors at the Doncaster Big Bang Science Fair and tell them 
all about the career options that are open to them, with staff from human resources, 
manufacturing and supply chain on hand to answer their questions. 
We also challenged students to see who could fit together PolyMax push-fit in the 
quickest time, with the winners taking home prize bundles from our charity partner Help 
for Heroes, which included hoodies, teddies, pens, and mugs.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
The Group aims to continuously improve 
the quality and safety of the working 
environment for all employees. The 
Group has a published Health, Safety 
and Environment policy that sets out the 
overriding principles of health and safety 
for all employees. The business units 
operate to externally accredited ISO / 
OHSAS standards.
Health and Safety achievements in 
the year included:
Following five consecutive RoSPA 
Gold Awards, the Group achieved the 
Gold Medal Award for exceptional 
performance and dedicated support for 
health and safety within the organisation.
Polypipe’s tool making and repair 
business, Mason Pinder, based in Thorne, 
achieved over 3,400 days without a lost 
time accident. This is an outstanding 
achievement and a significant milestone, 
of which everyone at Mason Pinder can 
be proud. These safety achievements 
have resulted in donations to the 
Children’s Heart Surgery Fund under the 
Charity Award for Safety and Health 
(CASH) scheme of over £3,600.
The Group continued the implementation 
of a focused formalised safety 
tour programme for management. 
These safety tours, undertaken 
by Executive Directors through to 
department managers, engage staff 
and further encourage health, safety 
and environmental discussion and 
improvement.
The Group operates a formal system for 
reporting and recording hazards and 
near misses. The ‘See it, Sort it, Report it’ 
scheme encourages individuals across the 
business at all levels to report hazards, 
suggest solutions and allows trends to be 
analysed. In 2017, the number of such 
reports reached record levels at 5,321 
reports resulting in improvement projects 
being delivered across the Group which 
in turn enhanced employee working 
environment safety.
Accident frequency performance and 
details of all significant incidents are 
reviewed during the weekly executive 
meeting attended by the Executive 
Directors and certain senior managers.
The table below sets out the KPIs used 
by the Group to monitor accident 
performance:
2015 2016 2017
Frequency per 
100,000 hours 
worked
– all accidents 8.24 6.43 5.93
– RIDDORS* 0.65 0.65 0.53
*  RIDDORS – HSE reportable accidents and 
dangerous occurrences based on the current 
seven-day absence from work reporting 
requirement in the UK and although there is no 
direct equivalent in Mainland Europe and the 
Middle East, the same definition is applied.
THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
We aim to minimise the lasting impact 
of our operations on the environment, 
and sustainability is a key feature of 
our products and their impact on the 
environment. See pages 15 to 21 
for further details of our sustainable 
solutions for the environment.
Our modern and efficient injection 
moulding and extrusion operations use 
significant amounts of electricity. We 
monitor very closely our electricity usage, 
even at a machine level, and take a 
proactive approach to improve energy 
efficiency. The Group collects electricity 
and natural gas usage information from 
each business unit on a monthly basis.
CASE STUDY HELP FOR HEROES
The Polypipe Regatta has become a popular event in 
the industry calendar, raising Polypipe’s profile and 
offering a great way for staff to engage with existing and 
new customers, while raising much-needed funds for 
worthwhile causes, which for 2017 included Polypipe’s 
new charity partner, Help for Heroes.
As well as organising charitable events such as the 
Regatta, Polypipe will sponsor ex-servicemen and women 
through a British Plumbing Employers Council (BPEC) 
course at the Polypipe Professional Development centre in 
Doncaster. Those who are looking to embark on a career 
in plumbing can attend taster courses, with Polypipe 
facilitating work experience and vocation experiences  
for veterans who show an interest in a career in plumbing 
and groundworks, supporting the long-standing 
connection between the British Armed Forces and the  
UK construction industry.

Company Reporting, with the exception 
of international electricity which were 
taken from the International Energy 
Agency’s 2017 update.
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR 
CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS
Suppliers are key to our business and 
we endeavour to build long-term 
relationships with them based on trust. 
We will seek to extend our supplier base 
if risks of undercapacity or resilience 
arise in our supply chain. Polypipe has 
no significant suppliers who are wholly 
dependent on the Group’s business. 
Suppliers are paid in line with contractual 
obligations.
We stay close to our existing and 
potential customers and distributors and 
strive to meet their needs. Our businesses 
are focused on achieving market leading 
delivery service levels for our customers 
and to respond quickly to their emerging 
requirements.
POLYPIPE AND THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITY
Each operation is aware of its role 
within its local community. Wherever 
possible they seek to recruit locally and 
retain a skilled local workforce. They 
are encouraged to build relationships 
with local community organisations and 
to support charitable initiatives. These 
activities range from the organisation 
of our Annual Charity Sailing Regatta 
in which over 700 people from our 
customers and associates participated, 
marathon running, through to quiz 
nights, cake sales and summer gala days. 
Our employees raised over £30,000 
(2016: £38,000) for worthwhile causes 
during the year from these activities.
Charitable donations by Group 
companies during the year were £27,000 
(2016: £27,000).
ANTI-BRIBERY AND 
CORRUPTION POLICY
The Group seeks to prohibit all forms  
of bribery and corruption within 
its business and complies with the 
requirements of all applicable anti-bribery 
and corruption laws.
The Group requires all relevant employees 
and agents to confirm each year that 
they remain in compliance with the 
Group’s Anti-Bribery policy.

its behalf.

STRATEGIC REPORT This luxury lodge is 
made from Canadian 
pine and is the 
first of its kind to 
be imported from 
Canada to the UK
OUR SOLUTIONS
Located in a picturesque forest in South 
Lanarkshire, and on the site of a prestigious 
golf club, this lodge is intended to be 
a flagship holiday let home. Underfloor 
heating was the perfect solution for 
this green development, as the pipes 
are entirely underfoot and out of sight, 
maximising space and leaving walls 
available for furniture or artwork, rather 
than being lost to wall mounted radiators. 
Underfloor heating is also a sustainable 
heating option as it operates at a much 
lower water temperature than a radiator 
system, so the heat source is working more 
efficiently and consuming less energy to 
generate the warm water required to heat 
the space.
Freedom Joinery chose Polypipe underfloor 
heating to bolster its green credentials and 
maximise available living space.
The developer chose 
to include Polypipe 
underfloor heating in

OUR GOVERNANCE INTRODUCTION  
FROM THE CHAIRMAN
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to present the Company’s 
Corporate Governance Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2017, on behalf 
of the Board.
This year has seen further changes to 
the Board, with Martin Payne being 
appointed as Chief Executive Officer 
following the retirement of David Hall 
in October 2017 after 12 years’ service 
as Chief Executive Officer. At the same 
time, Glen Sabin was promoted to Chief 
Operating Officer and appointed to the 
Board. Mr Payne continued to oversee 
and manage the group finance function 
following his appointment as CEO until 
the appointment of Paul James as Chief 
Financial Officer on 5 March 2018. 
The Company Secretarial function was 
also brought in-house for the first time 
since the IPO with the appointment of 
Emma Versluys as Company Secretary. I 
am delighted to say that these changes 
have been well received by employees 
and shareholders, and that there was a 
seamless transition of CEO responsibilities 
from David to Martin. I remain confident 
that we have a strong and diverse Board 
in place, with the necessary motivation 
and an appropriate balance of experience 
and skills to lead the Company through 
the next phase of its development. 
Following the externally facilitated 
review of our Board’s performance in 
2016, an internal review of the Board, its 
Committees and individual Directors was 
carried out in 2017 using an evaluation 
questionnaire. The results of the 
evaluation, which were discussed by the 
Board at its meeting in November 2017, 
concluded that the Board continues to 
function strongly and collaboratively. 
Suggestions for minor improvements 
were also made, and the outcome of the 
evaluation process is discussed in more 
detail on pages 46 and 47 of this Report. 
The terms of reference for each of the 
Board committees were reviewed and 
updated as necessary to reflect legislative 
changes and best practice. 
During the year the Board has 
placed much focus on the consistent 
leadership of the Group through 
this period of change, as well as its 
strategic development, in light of which 
presentations by the Group’s financial 
advisers and brokers and the annual 
strategy day proved very valuable. 
The following pages of this report and 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report set 
out in greater detail how the principles 
and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (April 2016) (the UK 
Code) have been applied and how the 
Board and its committees have fulfilled 
their responsibilities during the year to 
ensure that robust governance practices 
are embedded across the Group. The 
report also serves to provide insight 
into how the Board and management 
team run the business for the benefit 
of shareholders. As always, we 
welcome questions or comments from 
shareholders either via our website at 
www.polypipe.com or in person at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM).

COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
CODE
This report, which is also available on the 
Company’s website, explains key features 
of the Company’s governance structure 
and is designed to provide a greater 
understanding of how the principles of 
the UK Code published in April 2016 by 
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), 
have been applied and the areas of  
focus during the year. The UK Code can 
be found on the FRC’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk. 
In accordance with the Listing Rules 
of the UK Listing Authority, the Board 
confirms that throughout the year ended 
31 December 2017 and as at the date of 
this report, the Company has complied 
with the principles of the UK Code.
The report also includes items required 
by the FCA’s Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules. The Board has 
ultimate responsibility for the approval of 
the Annual Report and Accounts. It has 
considered the content of the Annual 
Report and Accounts and confirms that, 
taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
necessary information for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
HOW THE BOARD WORKS
The Board and its Committees
The Board is responsible for the 
leadership and direction of the Group 
and is ultimately responsible to the 
Company’s shareholders for the Group’s 
long-term success. The Board takes the 
lead in areas such as strategy, financial 
policy and making sure we maintain 
a sound system of internal control. By 
delegating authority to its Committees, 
the Board directs and reviews the Group’s 
operations within an agreed framework 
of controls, allowing risk to be assessed 
and managed within agreed parameters. 
The Board has established a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its 
approval and has delegated other 
specific responsibilities to its principal 
committees: the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees. These 
are clearly defined within the terms of 
reference of the respective Committees. 
The schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board includes the consideration and 
approval of:
 { strategy and overall management and 
leadership of the Group;
 { financial items – including the Group’s 
annual budget, dividend policy, annual 
and half-yearly accounts, accounting 
policies, and monetary limits;
 { the risk management system and 
internal controls;
 { contracts with third parties not in the 
ordinary course of business;
 { legal, administration and pension 
arrangements;
 { the Group’s corporate governance 
arrangements;
 { the operation of the Company’s share 
option schemes as recommended by 
the Remuneration Committee; 
 { Directors’ and Officers’ insurance 
coverage and the commencement or 
settlement of any litigation;
 { communications with shareholders 
and the issue of shareholder circulars;
 { Board and senior management 
appointments and arrangements; and
 { conflicts of interest where permitted 
by the Company’s Articles of 
Association.
The Board has also delegated to the 
Chief Executive Officer the responsibility 
for implementing the Group’s business 
model and for the day-to-day operational 
management of the Group. The Chief 
Executive Officer is supported in carrying 
out his responsibilities by the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Chief Operating 
Officer and the senior management team.

Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com
OUR GOVERNANCE The Board has direct access to the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible 
to the Board for ensuring that Board 
procedures are complied with. The Board 
may take independent professional 
advice in the furtherance of its duties if 
necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Board Composition, Qualification 
and Experience
At the year end, the Board comprised the 
independent Non-Executive Chairman, 
two Executive Directors and three Non-
Executive Directors. Biographical details 
of the individual Directors, as well as 
Paul James, who joined the Board on 
5 March 2018, can be found on pages 
40 and 41. The Non-Executive Directors 
were appointed for the diversity of their 
backgrounds as well as their personal 
attributes and experience. The current 
Board members bring a wide range of 
skills and experience to the Board and all 
actively contribute in discussion. 
In accordance with UK Code Provision 
B.1.1 the Nomination Committee and the 
Board have considered the independence 
of each of the Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board considered the Chairman and 
all the Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent throughout the period.
In accordance with UK Code Provision 
B.7.1, at the 2018 AGM and all future 
AGMs, the Board is proposing that all 
of the Directors will be subject to re-
election. Paul James and Glen Sabin will 
both offer themselves for election at the 
2018 AGM and for re-election annually 
thereafter. 
Role of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer
The roles and responsibilities of the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer 
are separate and clearly defined. 
It is the Chairman’s duty to provide 
overall leadership and governance 
of the Board. In performing this role, 
the Chairman sets the Board agenda, 
ensures that adequate time is available 
for discussion of all agenda items 
and promotes a culture of openness, 
challenge and debate at Board meetings. 
The Chairman is also responsible for 
ensuring that the Directors have an 
understanding of the views of major 
shareholders.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible 
for executive management of the Group’s 
business, consistent with the strategy 
and commercial objectives agreed by the 
Board. He leads the senior management 
team in effecting decisions of the Board 
and its Committees and is responsible 
for the maintenance and protection of 
the reputation of the Group. The Chief 
Executive Officer is also responsible for 
ensuring that the affairs of the Group are 
conducted with the highest standards 
of integrity, probity and corporate 
governance.
Interaction between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Officer
As noted above, the roles of Ron Marsh 
as the Chairman and Martin Payne as 
the Chief Executive Officer are separate, 
with a distinct division of responsibilities. 
The partnership between both is based 
on mutual trust and facilitated by regular 
contact between them. The separation 
of authority enhances the independent 
oversight of the executive management 
by the Board and helps to ensure that 
no one individual on the Board has 
unfettered authority.
Role of the Senior Independent 
Director
Paul Dean is the Senior Independent 
Director (SID) of the Company and is 
available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that cannot be addressed 
through normal channels. The role of the 
SID is to act as a sounding board  
for the Chairman and an intermediary for 
the other Directors when necessary. The 
SID is also available to chair the Board 
in the absence of the Chairman and has 
authority to add items to the agenda 
of any regular or special meeting of the 
Board. The role of the SID is considered 
to be an important check and balance in 
the Group’s governance structure.
Appointment and Tenure
The Non-Executive Directors serve on 
the basis of letters of appointment 
which are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office. The letters 
of appointment set out the expected 
time commitment of the Non-Executive 
Directors who, on appointment, 
undertake that they have sufficient time 
to carry out their duties. There is no fixed 
expiry date and no notice period in their 
letters of appointment.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts 
are also available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office. The notice 
period for the Executive Directors is 12 
months.
Directors’ Induction and Training/
Professional Development
The Chairman, with the support of the 
Company Secretary, is responsible for 
the induction of new Directors and the 
ongoing development of all Directors. 
Glen Sabin joined the Board during the 
year and received training on directors’ 
duties and obligations. Paul James is 
currently in the process of receiving 
a comprehensive induction, having 
joined the Company on 5 March 2018, 
and further information on this will be 
provided in the 2018 Annual Report and 
Accounts. 
As the internal and external business 
environment changes, it is important 
to ensure the Directors’ skills and 
knowledge are refreshed and updated 
regularly. The Board was therefore given 
presentations during the year by the 
Company’s financial advisers and brokers, 
as well as several presentations by senior 
management, in addition to the annual 
strategy day. During Board meetings held 
during the year the Company Secretary 
updated the Board on new legislation 
and regulations as well as changes to the 
current legislative and regulatory regimes 
to which the Company is subject.

Polypipe Group plc
CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE STATEMENT Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
Each Director has a duty under the 
Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation 
where he or she may have a direct or 
indirect interest that conflicts with the 
interests of the Company. The Company 
has robust procedures in place to identify, 
authorise and manage such conflicts 
of interest, and these procedures have 
operated effectively during the year.
All potential conflicts approved by the 
Board are recorded in a Conflicts of 
Interest Register which is maintained by 
the Company Secretary and reviewed by 
the Board on a regular basis. Directors 
have a continuing duty to update the 
Board with any changes to their conflicts 
of interest.
Directors’ Indemnity and Insurance
Details of the Directors’ indemnity 
arrangements can be found on pages  
74 and 75 of the Directors’ Report.
Internal Controls and Risk 
Management
The Board is responsible for determining 
the nature and extent of the significant 
risks it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives. It is also responsible 
for maintaining sound risk and internal 
control systems in accordance with 
section C.2.3 of the UK Code and 
confirms that:
 { there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating, and managing 
the principal risks faced by the Group;
 { the systems have been in place for 
the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts;
 { the systems are regularly reviewed by 
the Board; and
 { the systems accord with the FRC 
guidance on risk management, 
internal control and related financial 
and business reporting. 
The effectiveness of these systems is also 
reviewed through the work of the Audit 
Committee described on pages 51 to 53. 
The key risks which the Board has 
focused on this year together with their 
potential impact and mitigating actions 
are set out on pages 30 to 34.
The Company has a risk management 
framework which adopts a top down 
and a bottom up view of the key risks 
which involves both the downward 
cascade and upward escalation of risks 
between Group and the business units. 
It comprises a risk register template, a 
risk profile template and assessment 
guidelines to be used by both the Group 
and business units when considering 
risk. It also includes a detailed approach 
to formally recording and independently 
assessing Group level risks.
The Board has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls and risk management and is 
satisfied that it complies with Provision 
C.2.3 of the UK Code. 
FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS 
REPORTING PROCESS
The Board recognises its duty to ensure 
that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the position and performance, 
strategy and business model of the 
Company. In addition to the Annual 
Report and Accounts, the Company also 
ensures that other price-sensitive reports 
and other information are published 
externally. 
The Group has a thorough assurance 
process in place in respect of the 
preparation, verification and approval of 
periodic financial reports which is set out 
in the Report of the Audit Committee on 
pages 51 to 53. 
This process includes:
 { the involvement of qualified, 
professional employees with an 
appropriate level of experience (both 
in Group Finance and throughout the 
Group’s businesses);
 { formal sign-off from appropriate 
business segment senior executives;
 { comprehensive review and, where 
appropriate, challenge from 
appropriate Group senior executives 
and Executive Directors;
 { a transparent process to ensure full 
disclosure of information to the 
external auditor;
 { oversight by the Audit Committee, 
involving (amongst other duties):
 — a detailed review of key financial 
reporting judgements which have 
been discussed by management;
 — review and, where appropriate, 
challenge on matters including:
 > the consistency of, and 
any changes to, significant 
accounting policies and 
practices during the year;
 > significant adjustments 
resulting from an external 
audit; 
 > the viability statement 
assumptions; and
 > the going concern 
assumption.
The above process provides comfort 
to the Board that the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable.

OUR GOVERNANCE BOARD MEETINGS
The Board met regularly during the year, holding nine Board meetings and a number of other meetings and teleconferences to 
discuss and review progress on issues affecting the Group. A number of Committee meetings were also held during the year.

As the above table demonstrates, every 
effort is made to ensure that all Directors, 
where possible, attend scheduled Board 
meetings. However, in the event that a 
Director is unable to attend a meeting, 
they are nevertheless provided with the 
meeting papers and information relating 
to the meeting and are able to discuss 
the issues arising with the Chairman and 
other Directors. 
Senior management from across the 
Group, and advisers, attend some of the 
meetings for discussion of specific items 
in greater depth.
In order to provide the Board with greater 
visibility of the Group’s operations and 
to provide further opportunities to meet 
senior management, the Board visits at 
least one of the Group’s business unit 
locations each year. Such visits allow the 
Board to gain a deeper understanding 
of local market dynamics and to assess 
management performance and potential. 
During the year, the Board visited the 
Group’s operations in Castres (France), 
Ulster, Doncaster, Loughborough and 
Caerphilly. During these visits the 
Board members attended management 
presentations and/or toured the factories 
and distribution centres. 
In November 2017 the Board held its 
annual strategy day, where it spent a 
full day with senior management to 
discuss current performance of the 
Group and the strategic plan. Members 
of senior management from across the 
Group presented the operational and 
financial performance of their respective 
businesses in detail to the Board and 
explained the growth prospects of each 
market segment in the UK and abroad.
Board dinners are typically held ahead 
of scheduled Board meetings to provide 
a more relaxed forum than the formal 
meetings in which the Board members 
are able to have additional discussions 
amongst themselves and with the senior 
management team at that location, 
which improves the focus of the formal 
Board meetings. 
During the year the Chairman held one 
meeting with the Non-Executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors present, 
and the Non-Executive Directors met 
on one occasion without the Chairman 
being present to appraise the Chairman’s 
performance as discussed below.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has appointed three Board 
Committees: the Audit Committee, 
the Nomination Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee. The role and 
responsibilities of each Committee are set 
out in formal Terms of Reference. These 
Terms of Reference have been reviewed 
during the year and adjusted as necessary 
to improve the Committees’ efficiency 
and to reflect legislative changes and best 
practice. The updated Terms of Reference 
are available on the Company’s website 
at www.polypipe.com. 
The Committees make recommendations 
to the Board as they see fit. Each 
Committee Chair provides an update 
to the Board on the key discussions 
and decisions made at the preceding 
Committee meeting. 
BOARD EVALUATION AND 
EFFECTIVENESS
Following the externally facilitated 
Board evaluation carried out in 2016 
in accordance with UK Code Provision 
B.6.2, the Board and its Committees 
undertook an internal evaluation in 
2017, which was facilitated by the 
Company Secretary and the Chairman. 
46 46
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc
CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE STATEMENT The evaluation consisted of a high-
level questionnaire for the Directors’ 
completion which was structured to 
provide Directors with an opportunity to 
express their views about:
 { Board structure, composition and 
functionality;
 { Board meetings and contents;
 { Board administration and governance;
 { interaction with management;
 { committee structure, functionality 
and meetings; and
 { personal effectiveness and overall 
Board effectiveness.
The results of the performance 
evaluation were reviewed by the Board 
at its meeting in November 2017. The 
results of the evaluation indicated that 
the Directors consider the Board to be 
effective, collaborative and focused, with 
positive working relationships amongst 
all of its members. Notwithstanding the 
above, the Directors recognised the need 
to continuously improve and develop 
their contributions, and the following 
actions were agreed as a result of the 
exercise and will be progressed over the 
coming year: 
 { an action plan and progress log in 
relation to the evaluation itself would 
be developed and maintained by the 
Company Secretary;
 { a review would be undertaken for 
2019 to ensure the frequency and 
timing of the Board and Committee 
meetings remained appropriate;
 { longer-term Non-Executive Director 
succession planning would need to 
be considered in light of the fact that 
all NEDs would reach the end of their 
terms of appointment during 2020;
 { a legal training and refresher session 
by the Company’s appointed lawyers 
would be held annually; and
 { a formal review of the Company’s 
strategic objectives would be 
undertaken annually at the half year 
following the strategy day held in the 
preceding November. 
In addition, the Chairman discussed 
with each Director their performance 
and their training needs and the Senior 
Independent Director led the assessment 
of the Chairman’s leadership.
As a result of these individual reviews, 
it is considered that the performance 
of each of the Directors continues to 
be effective and that each Director 
demonstrates sufficient commitment to 
his or her role. It was acknowledged  
that the objective of the Board in 
supporting the senior management 
team to improve the performance of 
the Group and promote the interests of 
the shareholders and stakeholders had 
been achieved and it would continue 
to constructively challenge the senior 
management team. Consequently, I can 
confirm that each Director is suitable for 
re-election at the forthcoming AGM.
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Responsibility for shareholder relations 
rests with the Chief Financial Officer. The 
Chief Financial Officer, in conjunction 
with the corporate broker, ensures 
that there is effective communication 
with shareholders on matters such 
as governance and strategy and that 
an active dialogue is maintained with 
investors through a planned programme 
of investor relations activities. As part of 
the investor relations programme, formal 
meetings with investors are scheduled 
to discuss the Group’s interim and final 
results. In the intervening periods, the 
Company continues its dialogue with 
the investor community by meeting key 
investor representatives and holding 
investor roadshows.
During the reporting period, the top 20 
shareholders of the Group were invited to 
meet with the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee and, if appropriate, the 
Senior Independent Director to discuss 
the Company’s updated remuneration 
policy which will be subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM. 
No shareholders requested a meeting but 
written feedback from some shareholders 
was provided to the Remuneration 
Committee Chair.
The Chairman, the Senior Independent 
Director and the other Directors are 
available to engage in dialogue with 
major shareholders as appropriate. Board 
members develop an understanding 
of the views of major shareholders 
through analysts’ and brokers’ briefings 
and any direct contact initiated by 
shareholders. The Board believes that 
there were appropriate mechanisms in 
place during the year for the Board to 
understand the views of shareholders and 
to communicate with them on matters 
including governance, remuneration, 
strategy and performance. 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Company’s AGM is to be held on  
23 May 2018 at the Holiday Inn, 
High Road, Doncaster, DN4 9UX. All 
shareholders have the opportunity to 
attend and vote, in person or by proxy, at 
the AGM. A copy of the notice of AGM 
can be found on the Company’s website 
at www.polypipe.com. 
The AGM is the Company’s principal 
forum for communication with private 
shareholders. The Chairman of the Board 
and the Chair of each of the Committees 
will be available to answer shareholders’ 
questions at the AGM.
The notice of AGM will be sent out 
to shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the meeting. Results will 
be announced to the London Stock 
Exchange via a Regulatory Information 
Service announcement and published on 
the Company’s website.
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
At the AGM, all Directors will retire 
and submit themselves for election or 
re-election. As a result of the Board 
evaluation exercise, as Chairman I am 
satisfied that each Director continues to 
show the necessary level of commitment 
to the Group and has sufficient time 
available to fulfil his or her duties, to 
justify their re-election. Paul James and 
Glen Sabin will both offer themselves  
for election at the 2018 AGM and for  
re-election annually thereafter. 
Approved by the Board and signed on  
its behalf.

OUR GOVERNANCE INTRODUCTION FROM THE CHAIR  
OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER 
I am delighted to present the Report 
of the Nomination Committee (the 
Committee) for 2017. During the 
year, the Committee has overseen a 
number of Board changes, and a more 
comprehensive description of the 
activities of the Committee during the 
year is provided in the following report. 
I will be available at the AGM to answer 
any questions about the work of the 
Committee.
Ron Marsh
Chair of the Nomination Committee
20 March 2018
COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP 
AND MEETINGS
The Committee comprises Ron Marsh 
(the Chairman), all of the Non-Executive 
Directors, being Moni Mannings, Paul 
Dean and Mark Hammond, and Martin 
Payne (the Chief Executive Officer). 
Accordingly, there are five members. 
The Committee is chaired by the Board 
Chairman except when considering his 
own re-election. 
In accordance with UK Code Provision 
B.2.1, the majority of the members 
were independent. During the year, 
Martin Payne became CEO following the 
retirement of David Hall, and as a result 
took over David’s membership of the 
Committee. 
The members of the Committee 
and details of their attendance at 
Committee meetings are set out on 
page 46. Biographies of each member 
are shown on pages 40 and 41. Under 
the Committee’s Terms of Reference, 
the Committee will normally meet not 
less than twice a year and at such other 
times as the Chairman shall require. The 
Committee held three scheduled formal 
meetings during the year under review. 
After each Committee meeting, the 
Chairman reports to the Board on the 
main items discussed.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee’s main responsibilities 
are to evaluate the structure, size 
and composition (including the skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity) 
required of the Board and the 
Committees; to give full consideration 
to succession planning of Directors 
and other senior executives and to 
assist with the selection process of new 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
including the Chairman. The Committee’s 
Terms of Reference were reviewed and 
updated in March 2018 and explain the 
Committee’s role and responsibilities. 
The Terms of Reference can be found 
on the Company’s website at http://
investors.polypipe.com/corporate-
governance/board-committees. The 
Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the Committee.
In accordance with its terms of reference, 
the Committee is required to:
 { Review the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and make 
recommendations to the Board, as 
appropriate.
 { Consider succession planning for 
Directors and other senior executives, 
taking into account the challenges 
and opportunities facing the Group 
and the future skills and expertise 
needed on the Board.
 { Review the leadership needs of 
the organisation, both Executive 
and Non-Executive, with a view to 
ensuring the continued ability of the 
organisation to compete effectively in 
the marketplace.
 { Identify the balance of skills, 
knowledge, diversity and experience 
on the Board and nominate 
candidates to fill Board vacancies.
 { Identify and nominate for the approval 
of the Board, candidates to fill Board 
vacancies as and when they arise.
 { Review the time commitment 
required from Non-Executive 
Directors. 
 { Review the results of the Board 
performance evaluation process  
that relates to the composition of  
the Board.
 { Review and approve the Group’s 
diversity policy and evaluate its 
effectiveness on a regular basis. 
GOVERNANCE
The effectiveness of the Committee was 
considered as part of the Board and 
Committee evaluation detailed on pages 
46 and 47. At its meeting in January 
2018, the Committee considered the 
contents of the review and concluded 
that the evaluation had found the 
Committee to be operating effectively 
and providing robust challenge to the 
business.
MAIN ACTIVITIES DURING  
THE YEAR
During the year under review, the 
Committee carried out a process to 
recruit a new Chief Executive Officer to 
replace David Hall, who had indicated 
his intention to retire from the Company 
in October 2017. The Committee also 
considered the appointment of Glen 
Sabin to the Board as Chief Operating 
Officer and carried out a process to 
recruit a new Chief Financial Officer to 
replace Martin Payne. Further information 
on these processes is set out below. The 
Committee also carried out its duties 
as listed above and has given particular 
focus to succession planning for both 
the Board members as well as senior 
executives as discussed below. As stated 
in the Corporate Governance Report, all 
of the Company’s Directors will retire and 
each will offer themselves for election or 
re-election at the forthcoming  
AGM in accordance with UK Code 
Provision B.7.1. The Chairman confirms 
that the Committee has considered  
the formal performance evaluation  
and the contribution and commitment 
of the Directors that are required to offer 
themselves for re-election. The Chairman 
has confirmed to the Board that their 
performance and commitment is such 
that the Company should support their 
re-election.
No Director was able to vote in respect  
of their own re-election when 
consideration was given to Director 
re-election at the AGM.
Information on the Directors’ service 
agreements, shareholdings and share 
options is set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 64 to 73.

Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc REPORT OF THE  
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
SUCCESSION PLANNING
A key activity of the Committee is to 
keep under review the Company’s 
succession plans for members of the 
Board and senior managers over the 
short, medium and long term to ensure 
that the composition of the Board and 
senior management team remains 
appropriately balanced between new 
and innovative thinking and longer-term 
stability. Management training is provided 
to senior and middle management where 
appropriate in order to continue to 
develop the pipeline of internal talent for 
the future.
In addition, the Committee considers 
emergency succession planning and is 
comfortable that a framework is in place 
should key management roles need to be 
covered on an interim basis. 
Board appointment criteria are 
considered automatically as part of 
the Committee’s review of succession 
planning. The Committee believes that 
limited tenure of the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors and their subsequent 
enforced retirement as Directors is not 
always appropriate, and matters of 
Director tenure are viewed on a case by 
case basis. Currently all the Non-Executive 
Directors and the Chairman have been in 
post for less than six years, as set out in 
Provision B.2.3 of the UK Code.
CEO SUCCESSION
The Committee engaged the Zygos 
Partnership (Zygos), an executive 
recruitment firm, to identify potential 
candidates to succeed David Hall on 
his retirement. Zygos reviewed CVs 
and interviewed various candidates 
before providing the Chairman and the 
Committee members with a shortlist of 
candidates, who were interviewed by 
the members of the Board, excluding 
Martin Payne. Following these interviews, 
all Committee members independently 
identified Martin Payne as the preferred 
candidate, having the necessary attributes 
and skills required of a Chief Executive 
Officer. The interviewing panel also 
discussed and agreed that the creation of 
a new Board position of Chief Operating 
Officer, reporting to the Chief Executive 
Officer, would enable the Chief Executive 
Officer to better balance his strategic 
and operational responsibilities. The 
Committee members identified Glen Sabin 
as the preferred candidate, having the 
necessary attributes and skills required of 
a Chief Operating Officer, and considered 
that his appointment would provide 
continuity and provide further support to 
Martin Payne in his new role as CEO and 
recommended the appointments of both 
Martin Payne as CEO and Glen Sabin as 
COO to the Board. 
CFO SUCCESSION
In relation to the recruitment of a new 
CFO, discussions with three potential 
recruitment firms were held and 
consideration given to the merits of 
using each of them. On the basis that 
the appointment was time critical, the 
Committee agreed to again engage Zygos 
to identify potential candidates for the 
role of CFO on the basis of their prior 
detailed knowledge of the business and 
the Board. Martin Payne interviewed six 
potential candidates identified by Zygos, 
and second interviews by Martin Payne 
and Paul Dean with a shortlist of two 
candidates followed shortly afterwards. 
The remaining Committee members, as 
well as Glen Sabin, met with the preferred 
candidate, following which all Committee 
members agreed that Paul James had 
the necessary attributes and skills that 
were being sought for the role of Chief 
Financial Officer and recommended his 
appointment to the Board.
DIVERSITY
The Committee supports diversity, 
acknowledging the advantages that 
come from having diverse viewpoints and 
the influence this can have in decision 
making. It is the aim of the Committee 
to always consider the benefits that arise 
from a diverse Board when making Board 
appointments. The Committee does 
not judge it appropriate to introduce a 
quota system to enhance diversity in all 
of its forms to the Board. The Company’s 
recruitment and appointment strategy 
is based on the merits of the individual 
candidates, without bias towards age, 
gender, marital or family status, race, 
sexual orientation, religion or belief 
or any disability. Currently one of the 
seven Directors is female, as well as the 
Company Secretary.
Details of diversity within our workforce, 
including at Board and senior 
management level can be found in our 
Corporate Responsibility Statement on 
pages 35 and 36.
TENURE OF NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS
Appointments to the Board are typically 
made for an initial term of three years and 
are ordinarily limited to three consecutive 
terms in office, subject to annual  
re-election by shareholders at the AGM.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
PRIORITIES FOR 2018
During the forthcoming year, the 
Committee will be focusing on the 
composition of the Board in light of 
the new executive leadership team to 
ensure the balance of skills, experience 
and responsibility remains appropriate, 
which will include a process to recruit 
an additional Non-Executive Director. 
The Committee will also consider talent 
management on a Group-wide basis 
and succession planning for the senior 
executives, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the 
Group as it implements its strategy and 
the future skills and expertise needed by 
the business as a result. The Committee 
will also consider the succession planning 
of Non-Executive Directors so that 
replacements, which will be required in 
the longer term, can be phased in over 
a suitable period. The Committee will 
continue to consider diversity in 2018, 
bearing in mind the recommendations 
from the Hampton-Alexander Review 
on FTSE Women Leaders and the Parker 
review on Diversity of Boards, and will 
report on this in due course.
By order of the Board.

OUR GOVERNANCE INTRODUCTION FROM THE  
CHAIR OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to present the Report of  
the Audit Committee (the Committee)  
for 2017.
The Committee is appointed by the 
Board from its Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee has continued to focus 
on the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting, risk management and internal 
controls, and the quality of the internal 
and external audit processes. We will 
continue to keep our activities under 
review to ensure that we comply with any 
changes in the regulatory environment.
The Board has asked the Committee 
to oversee the process for determining 
whether the Annual Report and 
Accounts, when taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
financial position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
As a result of its work undertaken during 
the year and taking into account the 
result of the performance evaluation 
(further details are set out on pages 
46 and 47), the Committee considers 
that it has acted in accordance with its 
Terms of Reference and has ensured 
the independence, objectivity and 
effectiveness of the external and internal 
auditors.
I am pleased to welcome Paul James to 
the Board following his appointment 
on 5 March 2018. I would also like to 
thank Martin Payne for his hard work and 
continued support in 2017, in particular 
in continuing to carry out the CFO 
function following his change in role to 
CEO while the recruitment process for 
the new CFO was completed. 
I will be available at the AGM to answer 
any questions about the work of the 
Committee.

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP 
AND MEETINGS
The Committee is appointed by the 
Board and comprises three Non-
Executive Directors, being Paul Dean, 
Mark Hammond and Moni Mannings. 
All Committee members are considered 
independent. 
In accordance with the requirements of 
Provision C.3.1 of the UK Code, Paul 
Dean is designated as the Committee 
member with recent and relevant 
financial experience. All other members 
of the Committee are deemed to have 
the necessary ability and experience to 
understand the financial statements. The 
Committee as a whole has competence 
relevant to the sector in which the Group 
operates.
The Committee discharges its 
responsibilities through a series of 
scheduled formal meetings during 
the year. Each meeting has a formal 
agenda which is linked to the events 
in the financial calendar of the Group. 
Attendees at each of the meetings are 
the Committee members as well as, 
by invitation, the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, 
the Group Financial Controller, and the 
external auditor, Ernst & Young LLP . The 
Company Secretary is also Secretary to 
the Committee.
The Committee held three formal 
meetings during the year. In accordance 
with best practice, the Committee met 
with the Ernst & Young LLP lead audit 
partner without executive management 
being present.
GOVERNANCE
In accordance with best practice, 
the effectiveness of the Committee 
was evaluated internally this year by 
means of a questionnaire completed 
by all Directors, following the external 
evaluation performed in 2016. At 
its meeting in November 2017, the 
Committee considered the results of 
the internal evaluation and concluded 
that it had found the Committee to 
be operating effectively, particularly 
in relation to the open and robust 
discussion of audit matters, thus 
providing the Board with a high 
level of assurance that they are dealt 
with appropriately. Areas which the 
Committee believed could potentially be 
improved were discussed and included in 
its action plan for next year.
MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE 
COMMITTEE DURING THE YEAR
As part of the process of working with 
the Board to carry out its responsibilities 
and to maximise its effectiveness, 
meetings of the Committee normally 
take place prior to the Board meetings, 
at which the Chair of the Committee 
provides an update to the Board.
At these meetings the Committee 
focused on the following areas:
Financial reporting
During the year, Committee meetings 
were held prior to the Board meetings to 
approve the Group’s interim and annual 
financial statement announcements 
and to consider the financial reporting 
judgements made by management. These 
considerations are made through review 
of the accounting papers and financial 
reports prepared by management and 
reports prepared by the Group’s external 
auditor.
The Committee also reported to the 
Board that it considered that, taken as a 
whole, the Annual Report and Accounts 
is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
financial position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

OUR GOVERNANCE Significant financial reporting risk, 
judgement and estimates
The significant risk reviewed by the 
Committee in respect of the year under 
review was as follows:
 { Revenue recognition and 
customer rebates – The 
Committee considered the 
operating effectiveness of controls 
surrounding revenue recognition and 
management’s subjective assessment 
and recognition of customer rebate 
liabilities at the interim and year end. 
The significant judgement reviewed by 
the Committee in respect of the year 
under review was as follows:
 { Discontinued operations – On 
31 January 2018, the Group 
announced it had entered into 
exclusive negotiations to sell Polypipe 
France. It was determined that 
the sale was highly probable at 
31 December 2017. The Committee 
considered the financial accounting 
and reporting disclosure impacts 
in relation to this determination 
outlined by management including 
the French operations being classified 
as discontinued, the associated net 
assets being classified as held-for-
sale, and a loss on remeasurement 
to fair value less costs to sell being 
recognised.
The significant estimates reviewed by the 
Committee in respect of the year under 
review were as follows:
 { Impairment of non-financial 
assets – The Committee considered 
a detailed report prepared by 
management setting out the 
assumptions used in determining 
whether goodwill, other intangible 
assets or property, plant and 
equipment required impairment 
for any of the business units. This 
included a review of the discount rate 
and growth factors used to calculate 
the discounted projected future cash 
flows, the sensitivity analysis applied, 
and the discounted projected future 
cash flows used to support the 
carrying amount of the goodwill.
 { Restructuring provisions – The 
Committee considered various 
reports prepared by management 
setting out the events and changes 
in circumstances which resulted in 
the closure of the Dubai, United Arab 
Emirates manufacturing facility, and 
the resulting recognition of cash and 
non-cash restructuring costs.
 { Inventory provisioning – The 
Committee reviewed the carrying 
amount of the Group’s finished 
goods inventory and management’s 
assessment and recognition of the 
appropriate level of provisioning 
against slow-moving and obsolete 
items.
Internal control, internal audit and 
risk management
Internal audit performs an integral role 
in the Group’s governance structure 
and provides regular reports to the 
Committee. The Committee has reviewed 
and approved the scope of the rolling 
internal audit work programme in 
relation to the Group’s internal controls 
and procedures at each of the three 
meetings held during the year. 
The Committee reviews and challenges 
the results and reports from the internal 
audit work programme and the adequacy 
of management’s responses and 
proposed resolutions. 
The Group’s risk assessment process, 
including how significant financial risks 
are managed and mitigated, is a key 
area of focus for the Committee. During 
the year, the Committee monitored and 
reviewed the Group’s risk management 
framework and the results of testing 
performed by the Group’s internal audit 
function on specific elements of that 
framework. There were no significant 
internal control failings or weaknesses 
during the year.
Other activities
Other activities undertaken by the 
Committee during the year included the 
following:
 { considered the external audit plan 
and approved the audit fee;
 { considered the viability statement and 
going concern assumption;
 { instigated, monitored and reviewed 
the Group’s response to an 
external review of cyber security 
performed during the year by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP;
 { considered the impact of new 
financial reporting standards and 
legislative requirements on the Group;
 { reviewed the Committee’s 
performance, effectiveness and 
constitution; and
 { recommended the Report of the 
Audit Committee for approval by  
the Board.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
Appointment
The Committee carefully considers 
the reappointment of the external 
auditor each year prior to making its 
recommendation to the shareholders. 
As part of this process, the Committee 
considers the independence of the 
external auditor, the effectiveness of the 
external audit process, its remuneration, 
and the terms of engagement. Having 
reviewed the performance of Ernst & 
Young LLP in 2017, the Committee has 
decided to recommend to the Board that 
Ernst & Young LLP should be reappointed 
for the 2018 audit and a resolution to this 
effect will be proposed at the 2018 AGM. 
In accordance with current professional 
standards, the external auditor is required 
to change the lead audit partner every 
five years in order to protect auditor 
independence and objectivity. Ernst & 
Young LLP were awarded the external 
audit in 2012 following a competitive 
tendering process. The lead audit partner 
was rotated in 2017. In accordance 
with the UK Code, the Competition and 
Markets Authority (CMA) Order and 
the EU Audit Directive, it is the Group’s 
intention to put the audit out to tender 
at least every ten years. Accordingly, the 
Company plans to run a competitive 
tender process in or before 2022.

REPORT OF THE  
AUDIT COMMITTEE Independence
The independence of the external auditor 
was confirmed by Ernst & Young LLP in 
November 2017 and March 2018 at the 
Committee meetings. The Committee 
considered Ernst & Young LLP’s 
presentation on auditor independence 
and confirmed that it considered the 
auditor to be independent.
Non-audit services 
The Group’s non-audit services policy 
restricts the external auditor from 
performing certain non-audit services 
in accordance with the Revised Ethical 
Standard 2016 issued by the FRC. All 
non-audit services proposed to be 
performed by the external auditor must 
be pre-approved and sponsored by a 
senior executive with a detailed written 
recommendation including: the nature 
and scope of the proposed service, the 
supplier selection process and criteria, the 
chosen supplier and selection rationale, 
the relationship of the individual within 
the external auditor to perform the 
proposed service with those undertaking 
the audit work, a fee estimate and 
the category of non-audit service, if 
relevant. In addition, the external auditor 
must provide a written statement of 
independence approved by the lead audit 
partner. All non-audit services proposed 
to be performed by the external auditor 
with a fee estimate in excess of £10,000 
must also be pre-approved by the 
Committee. This policy and approach 
further enhances auditor objectivity and 
independence. There were no exceptions 
to this policy during 2017.
Effectiveness of the external audit 
process
The Committee operated a formal 
process for reviewing the effectiveness 
of Ernst & Young LLP during the year 
under review. This process included the 
following:
 { an assessment of the lead audit 
partner and the audit team;
 { a review of the audit approach, 
scope, determination of significant 
risk areas and materiality;
 { the execution of the audit;
 { interaction with management and 
communication with, and support to, 
the Committee;
 { the quality of any recommendation 
points; and
 { a review of independence, objectivity 
and scepticism.
Ernst & Young LLP’s external audit of the 
Group’s financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 was reviewed 
by the FRC’s Audit Quality Review (AQR) 
team. We have considered the findings of 
the AQR team as part of the Committee’s 
assessment of the effectiveness of Ernst 
& Young LLP’s external audit. As well 
as receiving and discussing the AQR’s 
final letter which summarised their 
conclusions, the Committee had open 
and transparent conversations with Ernst 
& Young LLP’s lead audit partner on the 
areas of the external audit that were 
reviewed by the AQR team. This included 
understanding the substance of the 
discussions between Ernst & Young LLP 
and the AQR team during the review and 
the actions that will be taken by Ernst & 
Young LLP in response to the AQR team’s 
findings.
After considering the above matters, the 
Committee considered that the audit 
had been effective and recommended 
to the Board that Ernst & Young LLP be 
reappointed as external auditor to the 
Group.
FRAUD, WHISTLE-BLOWING 
AND THE UK BRIBERY ACT
The Committee monitors any reported 
incidents under its whistle-blowing policy, 
which has been reviewed during the year. 
This policy is included in the Employee 
Handbook and sets out the procedure for 
employees to raise legitimate concerns 
about any wrongdoing in financial 
reporting or other matters such as: 
 { something that could be unlawful; 
 { a miscarriage of justice; 
 { a danger to the health and safety of 
any individual;
 { damage to the environment; or
 { improper conduct. 
There were no concerns which required 
the attention of the Committee during 
the year.
The Committee also reviews the Group’s 
procedure for detecting fraud and the 
systems and controls in place to prevent 
a breach of anti-bribery legislation. The 
Group Finance Manual sets out the 
procedures to which employees must 
adhere and is aimed at reducing the 
risk of fraud occurring. The Group is 
committed to a zero-tolerance position 
with regard to bribery. Those employees 
which the Group considers are more 
likely to be exposed to potential breaches 
of the Group’s Anti-Bribery policy and 
statutory obligations under the UK 
Bribery Act have been provided with 
relevant guidance on compliance with 
their obligations. The Group maintains 
a record of all employees who have 
received this guidance and requests 
annual confirmations from each relevant 
individual stating that they have complied 
with the Group’s policy.
By order of the Board.

OUR GOVERNANCE ANNUAL STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIR  
OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2017. The report is split 
into two sections in line with legislative 
reporting regulations:
 { Remuneration Policy – contains 
details of the various components of 
the Remuneration Policy, which will 
be subject to a binding shareholder 
vote at our 2018 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) and will have 
effect from the date on which it is 
approved. The Remuneration Policy 
is broadly unchanged from the Policy 
approved by shareholders at the 2015 
AGM, apart from a reduction in the 
maximum level of pension provision 
for Executive Directors from 20% 
to 15% of salary and an increase in 
the required minimum shareholding 
guideline for Executive Directors from 
100% to 200% of salary. Further 
details are set out on pages 56 to 63.
 { The Annual Report on 
Remuneration – contains details of 
remuneration received by Directors 
in 2017 and also contains full details 
of how we intend to implement 
the updated Remuneration Policy 
during 2018. The Annual Report 
on Remuneration will be subject to 
an advisory vote at the 2018 AGM. 
Further details are set out on pages 
64 to 73.
This Directors’ Remuneration Report 
is compliant with Schedule 8 of The 
Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2013, the UK Listing 
Authority Listing Rules and the 
Companies Act 2006 and is consistent 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2016 (the Code).
ALIGNING REMUNERATION 
WITH COMPANY STRATEGY
The Remuneration Policy is designed 
to encourage achievement of our 
strategic goals and priorities, details 
of which are set out on pages 12 
and 13, by rewarding in line with 
underlying Company performance 
while encouraging leadership behaviour 
which carries an appropriate level of 
risk. This is achieved by an annual bonus 
arrangement which is linked to achieving 
profit targets, working capital targets 
and personal objectives and a long-term 
incentive plan which only rewards for 
shareholder value creation and delivery of 
long-term earnings growth. 
The most substantial issues considered 
by the Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee) during the past year are set 
out below. 
PERFORMANCE IN 2017
The financial and operating performance 
of the Group in 2017 is set out on pages 
86 to 125. The Company has continued 
to deliver sustainable returns and 
growth for its shareholders during 2017, 
achieving profit before tax of £55.6m, 
up 3.9% from 2016, and increasing 
underlying basic earnings per share from 
continuing operations by 10.1% to 27.2p 
per share. 
Based on the Company’s strong financial 
performance during the year and 
fulfilment of their individual objectives, 
the Committee determined that 
Martin Payne, Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO), earned 66.8% of his maximum 
potential annual bonus in respect of 
2017 performance and that Glen Sabin, 
Chief Operating Officer (COO), earned 
65.8% of his maximum potential annual 
bonus in respect of 2017 performance, 
prorated to reflect the amount of time 
served in their respective roles during 
the year. In accordance with the current 
Remuneration Policy, 25% of this bonus 
will be deferred into shares. 
RETIREMENT OF DAVID HALL
As a Committee, we recognise our 
responsibility to ensure that pay decisions 
relating to departing Directors are 
determined fairly both for shareholders 
and for the departing individuals. During 
2017, our former CEO, David Hall, 
retired after 12 years’ service as CEO 
of the Company. Mr Hall received no 
termination payment although he will 
receive a time prorated annual bonus 
for 2017 payable at the end of March 
2018. His outstanding Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan (DSBP) awards vested upon 
cessation of employment in accordance 
with the rules of the DSBP , and were 
settled in cash. His outstanding awards 
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
are subject to the rules of the LTIP , and 
will therefore vest on the normal vesting 
date, subject to achievement of the 
relevant performance target and prorated 
to reflect the period of time between the 
date of grant and date of retirement. 
APPOINTMENT OF 
MARTIN PAYNE
The Committee approved the pay 
arrangements for Martin Payne, the 
former CFO, who took over as CEO of 
the Company on 2 October 2017, when 
David Hall retired. It is the Committee’s 
intention, subject to satisfactory 
performance, to increase Martin Payne’s 
salary over time to the equivalent salary 
as was paid to David Hall when he held 
the CEO role. This may therefore result 
in an annual increase over and above 
the average increase awarded to the 
workforce in any given year. Full details of 
Martin Payne’s remuneration are set out 
on pages 64 to 73.
APPOINTMENT OF GLEN SABIN
The Committee approved the pay 
arrangements for Glen Sabin, who was 
promoted to the position of COO and 
joined the Board on 2 October 2017. Full 
details of those arrangements are set out 
on pages 64 to 73.
54 54
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc APPOINTMENT OF PAUL JAMES
The Committee approved the pay 
arrangements for Paul James, who joined 
the Company as CFO on 5 March 2018. 
Full details of those arrangements are set 
out on pages 65 and 66.
LTIP AWARDS
In May 2017, the Committee approved 
the grant of LTIP awards to the Executive 
Directors and other senior management. 
Award levels were 125% of salary for 
David Hall, 100% of annual salary for 
Martin Payne (CFO at the date of grant) 
and the relevant percentage of annual 
salary for Glen Sabin in his role as 
Managing Director of the Plumbing & 
Drainage Division at the date of grant. 
These award levels are significantly 
below the maximum of 200% of annual 
salary permitted under the current 
Remuneration Policy. 
The Committee considered a number 
of possible performance measures 
and concluded that a combination of 
stretching Earnings per Share (EPS) 
growth targets and a relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) measure 
provided an appropriate basis for 
rewarding the successful delivery of 
longer-term strategic priorities, Company 
growth and shareholder value.
KEY REMUNERATION 
DECISIONS FOR 2018
The proposed implementation of the 
Remuneration Policy for our Executive 
Directors for 2018 is outlined on pages 
64 to 67. Key decisions made by the 
Committee in relation to 2018 include:
 { The award of a 2.0% salary increase 
for Executive Directors. This is 
consistent with the average increase 
awarded to the Group’s UK workforce 
for 2018.
 { Maximum bonus potential and LTIP 
award levels for Martin Payne in 2018 
will be the same as applied to his 
predecessor as CEO in 2017 (125% 
of salary for each element). Maximum 
bonus potential and LTIP award levels 
for the other Executive Directors will 
be 100% of salary for each element. 
The Committee believes that these 
levels of award are appropriate to 
ensure that the Executive Directors’ 
interests are fully aligned with the 
interests of other shareholders.
 { No changes to the performance 
measures to be used to assess 
Company performance in 2018. 
The Group Underlying Operating 
Profit and Working Capital financial 
measures which determine 90% 
of the bonus and the Underlying 
diluted EPS and relative TSR measures 
which determine 100% of the LTIP 
provide alignment with the priorities 
outlined in the Strategic Report and 
alignment with our shareholders’ 
interests. The Committee believes 
that this combination provides a fair 
and rounded assessment of short-
term and longer-term Company 
performance. 
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
We take a keen interest in shareholder 
views on executive remuneration and, 
in this context, the Committee carried 
out a consultation process with its top 
20 shareholders and the shareholder 
advisory bodies in 2017 on the proposed 
draft Remuneration Policy to be 
presented for approval by shareholders at 
the 2018 AGM. Overall, feedback from 
those shareholders that responded was 
supportive. 
I will be available to answer questions 
on the Remuneration Policy and the 
Annual Report on Remuneration at the 
AGM on 23 May 2018. I hope you will 
find this report to be clear and helpful 
in understanding our remuneration 
practices and that you will be 
supportive of the resolutions relating to 
remuneration at the AGM.

OUR GOVERNANCE This part of the report sets out 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(Remuneration Policy). This Remuneration 
Policy will be subject to a binding 
shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM 
and will apply to payments made from 
the date of approval. The information 
provided in this section of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report is not subject  
to audit.
The only changes of substance in 
this Remuneration Policy from the 
Remuneration Policy approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM are 
a reduction in the maximum level of 
pension provision for Executive Directors 
from 20% to 15% of salary and an 
increase in the required minimum 
shareholding guideline for Executive 
Directors from 100% to 200% of salary. 
POLICY TABLE
The following table sets out details of 
each component of the Executive Director 
remuneration package. Our aim is to 
provide pay packages that will:
 { Promote the long-term success of the 
Company.
 { Encourage and support a high 
performance culture.
 { Reward delivery of the Company’s 
business plan and our key strategic 
and operational goals.
 { Motivate and retain our industry 
leading employees.
 { Attract high quality individuals to join 
the Company.
 { Align our employees’ interests with 
the interests of shareholders and 
other external stakeholders.
Consistent with these aims, the 
Committee has agreed a remuneration 
policy for Executive Directors, whereby:
 { Salaries will be set at competitive, 
but not excessive, levels compared 
to peers and other companies of an 
equivalent size and complexity.
 { Performance-related pay, based 
on stretching targets, will form a 
significant part of remuneration 
packages.
 { There will be an appropriate balance 
between rewards for delivery of short-
term and longer-term performance 
targets taking into account, where 
relevant, existing shareholdings.

Fixed pay
Base salary
To appropriately recognise 
skills, experience and 
responsibilities and attract 
and retain talent by 
ensuring salaries are market 
competitive.
Generally reviewed annually with 
any increase normally taking effect 
from 1 January although the Committee 
may award increases at other times of 
the year if it considers it appropriate.
The review takes into consideration a 
number of factors, including (but not 
limited to):
 { The individual Director’s role, 
experience and performance.
 { Business performance.
 { Market data for comparable roles in 
appropriate pay comparators.
 { Pay and conditions elsewhere in the 
Group.
No absolute maximum has been set for 
Executive Director base salaries. Current 
Executive Director salaries are set out 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
section of this Remuneration Report. 
Any annual increase in salaries is at the 
discretion of the Committee taking into 
account the factors stated in this table 
and the following principles:
 { Salaries would typically be increased 
at a rate consistent with the average 
salary increase for UK employees.
 { Larger increases may be considered 
appropriate in certain circumstances 
(including, but not limited to, 
a change in an individual’s 
responsibilities or in the scale of their 
role or in the size and complexity of 
the Group).
 { Larger increases may also be 
considered appropriate if a Director 
has been initially appointed to their 
position on the Board at a lower 
than typical salary.
No performance conditions. 
Malus and clawback provisions do not 
apply.

(1)
Benefits
To provide market 
competitive benefits.
Benefits currently include company car 
(or car allowance), income protection 
insurance, private family medical 
insurance, permanent health insurance 
and life assurance of four times annual 
salary. The Committee has discretion to 
add to or remove benefits provided to 
Executive Directors.
Executive Directors are entitled to 
reimbursement of reasonable expenses. 
Executive Directors also have the benefit 
of a qualifying third party indemnity from 
the Company as well as Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance.
There is no overall maximum as the 
level of benefits depends on the annual 
cost of providing individual items in the 
relevant local market and the individual’s 
specific role.
No performance conditions. 
Malus and clawback provisions do not 
apply.
Pension 
To provide market 
competitive retirement 
benefits.
Current policy is for the Company to 
contribute to the Group Pension Plan, a 
personal pension scheme and/or provide 
a cash allowance in lieu of pension.
Executive Directors receive a pension-
related contribution of up to 15% of 
salary, reduced from 20% under the 
previous policy.
No performance conditions. 
Malus and clawback provisions do not 
apply.

(2), (3)
 
To link reward to key 
financial and operational 
targets for the forthcoming

Additional alignment with 
shareholders’ interests 
through the operation of 
bonus deferral.
The Executive Directors are participants in 
the annual bonus plan which is reviewed 
annually to ensure bonus opportunity, 
performance measures and targets 
are appropriate and supportive of the 
business plan.
No more than 75% of an Executive 
Director’s annual bonus is delivered in cash 
following the release of audited results 
and the remaining amount is deferred into 
an award over Company shares under the 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
 { Deferred awards are usually granted 
in the form of conditional share 
awards or nil-cost options (and may 
also be settled in cash).
 { Deferred awards usually vest in 
two equal tranches two and three 
years after award although may 
vest early on leaving employment 
or on a change of control (see later 
sections).
 { An additional payment (in the form 
of cash or shares) may be made in 
respect of shares which vest under 
deferred awards to reflect the value 
of dividends which would have been 
paid on those shares during the 
vesting period (this payment may 
assume that dividends had been 
reinvested in Company shares on a 
cumulative basis).
The maximum award that can be made 
to an Executive Director under the annual 
bonus plan is 125% of salary. 
The bonus is based on performance 
assessed over one year using appropriate 
financial, operational and individual 
performance measures.
The majority of the bonus will be 
determined by measures of Group 
financial performance. 
A sliding scale of targets is set for each 
Group financial measure with payout at 
no more than 25% for threshold financial 
performance increasing to 100% for 
maximum performance.
The remainder of the bonus will be based 
on financial, strategic or operational 
measures appropriate to the individual 
Executive Director. 
Details of the bonus measures operating 
each year will be included in the relevant 
Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Any bonus payout is ultimately at the 
discretion of the Committee.
The cash bonus will be subject to recovery 
and/or deferred shares will be subject to 
withholding at the Committee’s discretion 
in exceptional circumstances where within 
three years of the bonus determination 
or before the vesting of each tranche of 
deferred shares a material misstatement 
or miscalculation comes to light which 
resulted in an overpayment under the 
annual bonus plan or if evidence comes 
to light of material misconduct by an 
individual or if evidence emerges of a 
material health and safety breach.

OUR GOVERNANCE Purpose and link to

Performance conditions and 
provisions for recovery of 
sums paid
(1)
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) 
(3), (4)
To link reward to key 
strategic and business 
targets for the longer term 
and to align Executive 
Directors’ interests with 
shareholders’ interests.
Awards are usually granted annually 
under the LTIP to selected senior 
executives.
Individual award levels and performance 
conditions on which vesting will be 
dependent are reviewed annually by the 
Committee.
Awards may be granted as conditional 
awards of shares, nil-cost options (or, if 
appropriate, as cash-settled equivalents). 
Awards normally vest or become 
exercisable at the end of a period of at 
least three years following grant although 
may vest early on leaving employment 
or on a change of control (see later 
sections). The Committee has flexibility at 
its discretion to add an additional holding 
period after a performance period before 
awards vest.
An additional payment (in the form of 
cash or shares) may be made in respect 
of shares which vest under LTIP awards 
to reflect the value of dividends which 
would have been paid on those shares 
during the vesting period (this payment 
may assume that dividends had been 
reinvested in Company shares on a 
cumulative basis).
The maximum annual award permitted 
under the LTIP is shares with a market 
value (as determined by the Committee) 
of 200% of salary.
Each year the Committee determines the 
actual award level for individual senior 
executives within this limit. 
All LTIP awards granted to Executive 
Directors must be subject to a 
performance condition.
Vesting of Executive Directors’ LTIP 
awards would be dependent on 
measures which could include Group 
earnings, return on capital employed and 
total shareholder return with the precise 
measures and weighting of the measures 
determined by the Committee ahead of 
each award. 
Performance will usually be measured 
over a performance period of at least 
three years. For achieving a ‘threshold’ 
level of performance against a 
performance measure, no more than 
25% of the portion of the LTIP award 
determined by that measure will vest. 
Vesting then increases on a sliding scale 
to 100% for achieving a maximum 
performance target.
LTIP awards will be subject to withholding 
or recovery at the Committee’s discretion 
in exceptional circumstances where 
before the later of the vesting of an 
award and the second anniversary of the 
end of the performance period a material 
misstatement or miscalculation comes 
to light or if evidence comes to light of 
material misconduct by an individual or 
if evidence emerges of a material health 
and safety breach.
Sharesave Plan 
(3)
To create staff alignment 
with the Group and 
promote a sense of 
ownership.
UK tax-approved monthly savings 
scheme facilitating the purchase of 
shares through share options at a 
discounted exercise price by all eligible 
UK employees.
Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate on the same basis as other UK 
employees.
Monthly savings limit of £500 (or such 
other limit as may be approved from 
time to time by HMRC) under all savings 
contracts held by an individual.
The Sharesave Plan is structured in 
accordance with HMRC requirements 
so has no performance conditions but 
requires participants to make regular 
contributions into a savings contract.
Malus and clawback provisions do not 
apply.
Share Ownership 
Guidelines 
To create alignment 
between the long-term 
interests of Executive 
Directors and shareholders.
Executive Directors have been required to 
build and maintain a shareholding as a 
percentage of salary in the form of shares 
in the Company since Admission. 
Executive Directors are expected to 
achieve the shareholding requirement 
within five years of an individual 
becoming subject to the requirement.
Since Admission, Executive Directors have 
been required to build a shareholding 
equal to 100% of salary. Following a 
review by the Committee in 2017, this 
will be increased to 200% of salary with 
effect from 2018.
Not applicable.

REMUNERATION
POLICY Notes to table:
1. 
The Committee may amend or substitute any performance condition(s) if one or more events occur which cause it to determine that an amended or substituted 
performance condition would be more appropriate, provided that any such amended or substituted performance condition would not be materially less difficult 
to satisfy than the original condition (in its opinion). The Committee may also adjust the calculation of performance targets and vesting outcomes (for instance 
for material acquisitions, disposals or investments and events not foreseen at the time the targets were set) to ensure they remain a fair reflection of performance 
over the relevant period. In the event that the Committee was to make an adjustment of this sort, a full explanation would be provided in the next Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
2. 
Performance measures – annual bonus. The annual bonus measures are reviewed annually and chosen to focus executive rewards on delivery of key financial 
targets for the forthcoming year as well as key strategic or operational goals relevant to an individual. Specific targets for bonus measures are set at the start of 
each year by the Committee based on a range of relevant reference points, including, for Group financial targets, the Group’s business plan and are designed to be 
appropriately stretching.
3. 
The Committee may: (a) in the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital, demerger, special dividend or dividend in specie or any other corporate event 
which it reasonably determines justifies such an adjustment, adjust; and (b) amend the terms of awards granted under the share schemes referred to above in 
accordance with the rules of the relevant plans. Share awards may be settled by the issue of new shares or by the transfer of existing shares. In line with prevailing 
best practice at the time this Remuneration Policy is approved, any issuance of new shares is limited to 5% of share capital over a rolling ten-year period in relation 
to discretionary employee share schemes and 10% of share capital over a rolling ten-year period in relation to all employee share schemes. 
4. 
Performance measures – LTIP . The LTIP performance measures will be chosen to provide alignment with our longer-term strategy of growing the business in a 
sustainable manner that will be in the best interests of shareholders and other key stakeholders in the Company. Use of earnings and return on capital employed 
measures would reward management for delivery of key financial measures of Company success that should result in sustainable value creation. Use of a total 
shareholder return measure would align management’s interests with the interests of our shareholders. Targets are considered ahead of each grant of LTIP awards by 
the Committee, taking into account relevant external and internal reference points and are designed to be appropriately stretching.
5. 
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in 
connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before 
the 2015 AGM (the date the Company’s first shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy came into effect); (ii) before the policy set out above came into 
effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the shareholder approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a 
time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual 
becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an 
award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted.
6. 
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Remuneration Policy for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a 
change in legislation, without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.

(NED) fees
To appropriately recognise 
responsibilities, skills and 
experience by ensuring fees are 
market competitive. 
NED fees comprise payment of an annual basic fee and 
additional fees for further Board responsibilities such as:
 { Senior Independent Director
 { Chair of Audit Committee 
 { Chair of Remuneration Committee 
The Chairman of the Board receives an all-inclusive fee.
No NED participates in the Group’s incentive arrangements or 
pension plan or receives any other benefits other than where 
travel to the Company’s registered office is recognised as a 
taxable benefit in which case a NED may receive the grossed-
up costs of travel as a benefit. Non-Executive Directors are 
entitled to reimbursement of reasonable expenses. 
Fees are reviewed annually. 
NEDs also have the benefit of a qualifying third party 
indemnity from the Company and Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance.
Fees are set at an appropriate level that is market competitive 
and reflective of the responsibilities and time commitment 
associated with specific roles.
No absolute maximum has been set for individual NED 
fees. Current fee levels are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration section of this Remuneration Report. 
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that the total 
aggregate fees paid to the Chairman and NEDs will not 
exceed £600,000 per annum.

APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT 
REMUNERATION
Principles
In determining remuneration 
arrangements for new appointments to 
the Board (including internal promotions), 
the Committee will apply the following 
principles:
 { The Committee will take into 
consideration all relevant factors, 
including the experience of the 
individual, market data and existing 
arrangements for other Executive 
Directors, with a view that any 
arrangements should be in the best 
interests of both the Company and 
our shareholders, without paying 
more than is necessary.
 { Typically, the new appointment will 
have (or be transitioned onto) the 
same remuneration structure as the 
other Executive Directors, in line with 
the Remuneration Policy.
 { Upon appointment, the Committee 
may consider it appropriate to 
offer additional remuneration 
arrangements in order to secure 
the appointment. In particular, 
the Committee may consider it 
appropriate to ‘buy out’ terms or 
remuneration arrangements forfeited 
on leaving a previous employer 
(discussed below).
 { The Committee may provide costs 
and support if the recruitment 
requires relocation of the individual.
 { Where an Executive Director is an 
internal promotion, the normal policy 
of the Company is that any legacy 
arrangements would be honoured 
in line with the original terms and 
conditions. Similarly, if an Executive 
Director is appointed following the 
Company’s acquisition of or merger 
with another company, legacy terms 
and conditions would be honoured.
Maximum level of variable pay
The maximum level of variable 
remuneration which may be granted 
to new Executive Directors in respect 
of recruitment shall be limited to 
the maximum permitted under the 
Remuneration Policy, namely 325% of 
their annual salary. This limit excludes any 
payments or awards that may be made to 
buy out the Executive Director for terms, 
awards or other compensation forfeited 
from their previous employer (discussed 
below). 
Buyouts
To facilitate recruitment, the Committee 
may make a one-off award to buy out 
compensation arrangements forfeited 
on leaving a previous employer. In doing 
so, the Committee will take account 
of all relevant factors, including any 
performance conditions attached to 
incentive awards, the likelihood of those 
conditions being met, the proportion 
of the vesting/performance period 
remaining and the form of the award 
(e.g. cash or shares). The overriding 
principle will be that any buyout award 
should be of comparable commercial 
value to the compensation which has 
been forfeited. However, such buyout 
awards would only be considered where 
there is a strong commercial rationale to 
do so.
Components and approach
The remuneration package offered to 
new appointments may include any 
element within the Remuneration 
Policy, or any other element which the 
Committee considers is appropriate 
given the particular circumstances, 
with due regard to the best interests of 
shareholders, subject to the limits on 
variable pay set out above. 
In considering which elements to include, 
and in determining the approach for all 
relevant elements, the Committee will 
take into account a number of different 
factors, including (but not limited to) 
market practice, existing arrangements 
for other Executive Directors and internal 
relativities. If appropriate, different 
measures and targets may be applied to 
a new appointee’s annual bonus in their 
year of joining.
The Committee would seek to structure 
buyout and variable pay awards on 
recruitment to be in line with the 
Company’s remuneration framework 
so far as practical but, if necessary, the 
Committee may also grant such awards 
outside of that framework as permitted 
under Listing Rule 9.4.2 subject to the 
limits on variable pay set out above. 
61 61
Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com
OUR GOVERNANCE The exact terms of any such awards 
(e.g. the form of the award, time frame, 
performance conditions, and leaver 
provisions) would vary depending upon 
the specific commercial circumstances.
Recruitment of Non-Executive 
Directors
In the event of the appointment of a new 
Non-Executive Director, remuneration 
arrangements will normally be in line 
with the Remuneration Policy for 
Non-Executive Directors. However, the 
Committee (or the Board as appropriate) 
may include any element within the 
Remuneration Policy, or any other 
element which the Committee considers 
is appropriate given the particular 
circumstances, with due regard to the 
best interests of shareholders.  
In particular, if the Chairman or a  
Non-Executive Director takes on an 
executive function on a short-term  
basis, they would be able to receive  
any of the standard elements of  
Executive Director pay.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
Key terms of the current Executive 
Directors’ service agreements and 
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment are summarised in the table 
below. It is envisaged that any future 
appointments would have equivalent 
contractual arrangements unless 
otherwise stated in this Report.
Provision Policy
Notice period Executive Directors – 12 months’ notice by either the Company or the Executive Director.
Non-Executive Directors – at the Company’s discretion, Non-Executive Directors may have 
a notice period of up to three months. The Non-Executive Directors do not have a notice 
period in their letters of appointment.
Termination payment Following the serving of notice by either party, the Company may terminate employment 
of an Executive Director with immediate effect by paying a sum equal to salary. Executive 
Directors are not contractually entitled to any bonus for the period of service in the year in 
which their employment ends. 
Non-Executive Directors are only entitled to receive any fee accruing in respect of the period 
up to termination.
Expiry date Executive Directors have rolling 12 month notice periods so have no fixed expiry date.
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment have no fixed expiry date.
In accordance with the Code, each Director will retire annually and put themselves forward for re-election at each AGM of the 
Company. 
All Executive Directors’ service agreements and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office at Broomhouse Lane, Edlington, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, DN12 1ES.
POLICY ON PAYMENT FOR 
LOSS OF OFFICE
In relation to payments under non-
contractual incentive schemes, the 
Committee would take the following 
factors into account:
 { The Committee may determine that 
the Executive Director is eligible to 
receive a bonus in respect of the 
financial year in which they cease 
employment. This bonus would 
usually be time apportioned and 
may be settled wholly in cash. In 
determining the level of bonus to 
be paid, the Committee may, at 
its discretion, take into account 
performance up to the date of 
cessation or over the financial year 
as a whole based on appropriate 
performance measures as determined 
by the Committee.
 { The treatment of outstanding share 
awards is governed by the relevant 
share plan rules as summarised below.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan
 { On cessation of employment, 
unvested shares will vest in full unless 
the Committee determines otherwise.
 { On a change of control, unvested 
shares will vest in full.
 { If other corporate events occur such 
as a demerger, delisting, special 
dividend, voluntary winding-up or 
other event which in the opinion 
of the Committee may affect the 
current or future value of shares, the 
Committee will determine whether 
unvested shares should vest.
62 62
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc
REMUNERATION
POLICY LTIP 
 { On cessation of employment, 
unvested awards will lapse unless 
cessation is as a result of death, ill 
health, injury, disability, transfer of 
employing company or business to 
which an individual’s employment 
relates out of the Group or any other 
scenario in which the Committee 
determines at its discretion that 
good leaver treatment is appropriate 
(other than circumstances justifying 
summary dismissal). In these 
scenarios, unvested awards will 
usually continue until the normal 
vesting date unless the Committee 
determines that the award should 
vest earlier and will vest to an 
extent that takes into account the 
performance condition assessed at 
the date of vesting and, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, to 
an extent that takes into account the 
period of time between grant of the 
award and cessation of employment.
 { On a change of control, unvested 
LTIP awards will vest immediately to 
an extent that takes into account 
the performance condition assessed 
at the change of control and, 
unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, to an extent that takes 
into account the period of time 
between grant of the award and the 
change of control. If other corporate 
events occur such as a demerger, 
delisting, special dividend, voluntary 
winding-up or other event which in 
the opinion of the Committee may 
affect the current or future value of 
shares, the Committee will determine 
whether unvested LTIP awards 
should vest. If they do vest, they will 
vest immediately to an extent that 
takes into account the performance 
condition assessed at the date of the 
event and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, to an extent 
that takes into account the period of 
time between grant of the award and 
the date of the event.
Sharesave Plan
 { Options become exercisable 
immediately on death, ceasing 
employment due to injury, disability, 
retirement, redundancy, sale of the 
employing company or business to 
which an individual’s employment 
relates out of the Group or on a 
change of control/voluntary winding-
up of the Company.
The Committee reserves the right to 
make any other payments in connection 
with a Director’s cessation of office 
or employment where the payments 
are made in good faith in discharge 
of an existing legal obligation (or by 
way of damages for breach of such an 
obligation) or by way of a compromise 
or settlement of any claim arising in 
connection with the cessation of a 
Director’s office or employment. Any such 
payments may include but are not limited 
to paying any fees for outplacement 
assistance and/or the Director’s legal and/
or professional advice fees in connection 
with his/her cessation of office or 
employment.
CONSIDERATION OF 
EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS 
ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
The Committee does not formally consult 
with employees when determining 
Executive Director pay. However, the 
Committee is kept informed of general 
management decisions made in relation 
to employee pay and is conscious of 
the importance of ensuring that its 
pay decisions for Executive Directors 
are regarded as fair and reasonable 
within the business. As outlined in the 
Remuneration Policy table, pay and 
conditions in the Group are one of the 
specific considerations taken into account 
when the Committee is considering 
changes in salaries for the Executive 
Directors.
DIFFERENCES IN POLICY 
FROM BROADER EMPLOYEE 
POPULATION
A greater proportion of Executive 
Directors’ potential wealth is ‘at risk’, 
either through their existing shareholding 
or through LTIP awards than for our 
employees generally and a greater 
proportion determined by performance 
than for our employees generally. 
However, common principles underlie 
the pay policy throughout the Company 
including for the Executive Directors. 
In particular, we place great emphasis 
throughout the Company on reward 
being linked to performance (either 
Group performance or performance 
of an individual’s business unit) and on 
encouraging share ownership (through 
participation in the LTIP or an all-
employee share scheme). 
CONSIDERATION OF 
SHAREHOLDERS’ VIEWS
The Company carried out a consultation 
process with its top 20 shareholders 
and the shareholder advisory bodies in 
2017, setting out the key elements of 
the draft Remuneration Policy and the 
rationale for the changes to the Policy 
approved by shareholders at the 2015 
AGM. The Committee Chair offered to 
meet with any shareholders who wished 
to discuss the proposals in more detail. 
The feedback received from those that 
responded was generally supportive.

OUR GOVERNANCE UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2018
This section provides an overview of how the Committee is proposing to implement the Remuneration Policy in 2018 for the 
Executive Directors.
Base annual salary
As described in the Annual Statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, an annual salary review has been carried 
out by the Committee. The Committee approved a 2.0% increase in Executive Director salaries effective from 1 January 2018. This 
increase is consistent with the average annual salary increase awarded to the Company’s UK workforce for 2018.

Paul James (CFO) £285,000† n/a n/a
* Date of appointment to current role.
† Appointed to the Board on 5 March 2018. 
Pension
In 2018, the Executive Directors will receive a Company contribution worth 15% of annual salary to the Group Pension Plan, a 
personal pension scheme, or as a cash allowance. This has been reduced from 20%, the level of contribution under the previous 
Remuneration Policy.
Other benefits
In 2018, the Executive Directors will receive a standard package of other benefits consistent with those received in 2017, other 
than as disclosed below in relation to the relocation allowance for Paul James.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus plan for 2018 will be broadly consistent with the bonus plan operated in 2017. Key features of the plan for 
2018 are: 
 { There will be a maximum bonus opportunity of 125% of annual salary for Martin Payne and 100% of annual salary for Glen 
Sabin and Paul James (prorated from date of joining). 
 { 25% of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP). Half of these shares will 
vest two years post grant and the remaining half three years post grant.
 { In the event that a material misstatement or miscalculation subsequently comes to light which resulted in an overpayment 
under the annual bonus plan or if evidence comes to light of material misconduct by an individual or if evidence emerges of 
a material health and safety breach, then the Committee has the flexibility to withhold the value of shares granted under the 
DSBP and/or to require repayment of an appropriate portion of the annual bonus cash award in respect of the relevant  
bonus year.
The annual bonus for 2018 for Executive Directors will be determined as detailed below:
Performance measure
Percentage of maximum bonus opportunity
CEO CFO COO
Group Underlying Operating Profit 70% 70% 70%
Working Capital 20% 20% 20%
Individual objectives 10% 10% 10%
The targets for these performance measures in relation to the 2018 financial year are deemed to be commercially sensitive. 
However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.

ANNUAL REPORT ON 
REMUNERATION LTIP
The Executive Directors will receive an award under the LTIP during 2018. Key terms of this award will be:
 { Martin Payne will receive an award over shares worth 125% of annual salary at grant and Glen Sabin and Paul James will 
receive an award over shares worth 100% of annual salary at grant.
 { Awards will become exercisable three years after grant.
 { In the event that a material misstatement or miscalculation subsequently comes to light which results in too high a level of 
vesting under the LTIP or if evidence comes to light of material misconduct by an individual or if evidence emerges of a material 
health and safety breach, then the Committee has the flexibility to withhold or recover the value of shares granted under  
the LTIP .
 { Awards will be subject to a combination of underlying diluted EPS and relative TSR performance measures assessed over a 
three-year period as detailed below:

calculated using a 5% per annum growth on 2017 underlying diluted 
EPS. Maximum three-year cumulative underlying diluted EPS will be 
calculated using a 12% per annum growth on 2017 underlying diluted 
EPS. Vesting for performance between Threshold and Maximum will be 
calculated pro rata on a straight-line basis.
Comparator group comprises companies in the 
FTSE 250 Index that are classified as Industrials by 
the Industry Classification Benchmark. Vesting for 
performance between Median and Upper quartile 
will be calculated pro rata on a straight-line basis.
Sharesave Plan
Invitations to UK employees (including Executive Directors) to participate in the Sharesave Plan were issued in 2014, 2016 and 
2017. The Board is proposing to issue invitations to join the Plan on an annual basis, and all eligible UK employees will therefore be 
invited to join the Plan in 2018. 
New CFO’s pay arrangements
Paul James commenced employment with the Company on 5 March 2018 and was appointed to the Board on the same date. 
 His pay arrangements upon appointment were in line with the updated Remuneration Policy and comprise:
 { Annual salary of £285,000.
 { Pension contribution worth 15% of annual salary plus a standard benefits package.
 { Eligibility to participate in the annual bonus plan with a maximum annual bonus opportunity of 100% of annual salary, time 
prorated from date of appointment. 
 { Annual LTIP awards. The current policy is that Executive Directors (other than the CEO) will receive an annual LTIP award of 
shares worth 100% of annual salary. The LTIP award to be granted in 2018 will be time prorated to reflect the fact that he will 
be employed for only part of the three-year period to which the award will relate.
 { 12-month notice period.
 { Relocation package, comprising reimbursement of costs of up to £75,000 for relocation expenses, recoverable on a sliding scale 
if employment lasts less than three years. Costs will cover temporary accommodation costs for a maximum of nine months from 
5 March 2018, removal costs and fees associated with the purchase of a local residence, including stamp duty. 
In addition, certain buy-out arrangements (set out on page 66) have been agreed to partially compensate Paul James for bonus 
and long-term incentive awards that were forfeited when he left his previous employer, Dixons Carphone plc. The buy-out 
arrangements have been structured in accordance with the principles set out in the approved Remuneration Policy, in particular that 
they should be of comparable commercial value to the incentives that have been forfeited. These awards will be granted after the 
announcement of the Group’s preliminary results on 20 March 2018.

All of these non-pensionable share awards were granted under a deed in accordance with Listing Rule 9.4.2R (2) of the Listing 
Rules in order to facilitate the recruitment of Paul James as permitted under the approved Remuneration Policy and set out in the 
‘Approach to Recruitment Remuneration’ section on page 61. Other significant terms of these awards are as follows:
 { Awards will be granted as nil cost options exercisable from their respective vesting dates until the tenth anniversary of grant. At 
its discretion, the Committee may permit settlement in cash.
 { The number of shares will be calculated using the average closing share price for the three dealing days prior to grant. 
 { The number of shares under the forfeited bonus award will be increased to reflect dividends with a record date between 
the date Paul James commenced employment with the Company and the vesting date. The value of the dividends will be 
determined as if they had been reinvested into Company shares on such terms as the Committee will determine. 
 { In such circumstances as the Committee determines appropriate, including if a material misstatement of Dixons Carphone 
plc’s audited financial results (in relation to which a buy-out award is being granted) subsequently comes to light or if evidence 
comes to light of material misconduct by the individual, then the Committee has the flexibility to withhold the buy-out awards.
 { Awards will be satisfied by existing shares other than treasury shares.
 { Ordinarily unvested buy-out awards would lapse on cessation of employment. However, if Paul James ceases to hold office or 
employment in good leaver circumstances including death, ill health, injury or disability or any other reason at the Committee’s 
discretion (except in circumstances justifying summary dismissal), unvested awards would become exercisable on a time 
prorated basis (unless the Committee determines otherwise) either at the original vesting date or the date of cessation of 
employment at the Committee’s discretion.
 { In the event of a change of control (other than an internal reorganisation of the Polypipe Group), unvested awards would 
become exercisable on a time prorated basis (unless the Committee determines otherwise).
 { The Committee may allow some or all of the award to vest (or adjust the number of shares subject to the award) in the event 
of demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which, in their opinion, would affect the current or future value of the 
award. The number of shares subject to the award may also be adjusted in the event of any variation of share capital.
 { No further awards will be made under this arrangement and no amendments will be made to the advantage of Paul James 
in relation to (i) the basis for determining his entitlement to, and the terms of, shares to be provided under the award; and 
(ii) any adjustment that may be made for any variation of share capital or special dividend without prior shareholder approval 
in general meeting except for minor amendments to benefit the administration of the award, to take account of a change in 
legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment.
 { The award is personal to Paul James and cannot be transferred, assigned or otherwise disposed of by him (other than to his 
personal representative following his death).

PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS
There were no payments to past Directors during 2017 that have not already been fully disclosed in previous Directors’ 
Remuneration Reports. 
PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
David Hall, the former CEO, retired from the Company on 2 October 2017. He received salary, pension and benefits up until his 
retirement date (as outlined in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 67) and received no subsequent loss of office 
payments. 
The Committee determined that David Hall should be entitled to receive a time prorated bonus for 2017 based on the Company’s 
full-year performance (again as outlined in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 67). 
David Hall’s outstanding share incentives were treated in accordance with the rules of the applicable plans:
 { DSBP — David Hall was granted 42,801 ordinary shares in April 2015, 31,174 ordinary shares in April 2016 and 23,924 
ordinary shares in April 2017 representing the 25% retained value of his 2014, 2015 and 2016 annual bonus awards. The 
Committee determined that he should be treated as a good leaver in respect of these awards which therefore vested on 
2 October 2017. Under the rules of the DSBP he took up the option to receive a cash amount in substitution for the right to 
receive these shares. 
 { LTIP – David Hall was granted 194,340 ordinary shares in May 2016 and 143,383 ordinary shares in May 2017. Under the rules 
of the LTIP , he will be deemed to be a good leaver and will therefore be entitled to exercise the awards on their normal vesting 
dates, subject to achievement of the relevant performance targets and time prorated to reflect the period of time that has 
elapsed between the date of grant of the relevant award and the date of his retirement. 
 { Sharesave Plan – David Hall’s outstanding options held under the all-employee Sharesave Plan were subject to the rules of the 
Sharesave Plan and therefore exercisable within six months of his retirement date. 
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDING AND SHARE INTERESTS
Upon Admission, the Committee introduced a shareholding requirement of 100% of annual salary for the Executive Directors. 
Following a review of this requirement in 2017, the Committee agreed that this should be increased to 200% of salary, in line with 
current market practice.
Executive Directors are expected to achieve the shareholding requirement within five years of an individual becoming subject to 
the requirement. The Committee reviews ongoing individual performance against the shareholding requirement at the end of each 
financial year. Martin Payne commenced employment with the Company during 2016, and his salary was increased in October 
2017, when he became CEO, and he is continuing to build up his shareholding on this basis in line with the aforementioned five-
year timescale. Glen Sabin met this requirement as at 31 December 2017.

all UK employees is appropriate for the purposes of this analysis.

ANNUAL REPORT ON 
REMUNERATION CONSIDERATION BY THE DIRECTORS OF MATTERS RELATING TO DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The Committee is chaired by Moni Mannings. During the year, the Committee also comprised Ron Marsh, Paul Dean and Mark 
Hammond.
The Committee met six times during 2017. The CEO, David Hall, was also present at those meetings by invitation until his 
retirement on 2 October 2017 following which Martin Payne, CEO from 2 October 2017, was present by invitation. 
The Committee is responsible for determining all aspects of Executive Director pay. It also monitors pay arrangements for other 
senior executives and oversees the operation of all share plans. Full terms of reference of the Committee are available on our 
website at www.polypipe.com.
Deloitte LLP was appointed in 2014 to provide advice on executive remuneration matters. During the year, the Committee received 
independent and objective advice from Deloitte LLP principally on market practice, incentive design and remuneration policy for 
which Deloitte LLP was paid £8,920 (2016: £47,300) in fees (charged on a time plus expenses basis). Deloitte LLP is a founding 
member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting in the UK. In addition, during 2017, other departments within Deloitte LLP provided advice to 
the Company in relation to tax. The Committee has reviewed the nature of this additional advice and is satisfied that it does not 
compromise the independence of the advice that it has received.

OUR GOVERNANCE INTRODUCTION
The Directors present their Annual Report 
and Accounts for the period ended 
31 December 2017. In accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 as amended, 
and the Listing Rules and the Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules, the 
reports within the Governance section of 
the Annual Report and Accounts should 
be read in conjunction with one another, 
and the Strategic Report. As permitted 
by legislation, some of the matters 
normally included in the Directors’ 
Report have instead been included in the 
Strategic Report (pages 4 to 37) as the 
Board considers them to be of strategic 
importance.
THE COMPANY
Polypipe Group plc is a public company 
limited by shares, incorporated in England 
and Wales with registered number 
06059130. Since 16 April 2014, the 
Company was and remains listed on the 
premium segment of the London Stock 
Exchange. While the Group operates 
predominately in the UK, it does have 
operations in France, Italy and the United 
Arab Emirates.
STRATEGIC REPORT 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the 
Company to present a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
Group’s business during the financial year 
and the position of the business at the 
end of that year. This review is contained 
within the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 
37. The principal activities of the Group 
are described in the Strategic Report on 
pages 4 to 11.
FINANCIAL RISK 
MANAGEMENT
The Group’s financial risk management 
objectives and policies, including 
information on financial risks that 
materially impact the Group and financial 
instruments used by the Group (if any), 
are disclosed in Note 28 to the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements on 
pages 120 to 123. 
VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with Provision C.2.2 of the 
UK Code, the Directors have assessed 
the prospects of the Group over a longer 
period than 12 months required by the 
‘Going Concern’ provision. The Board 
conducted this review for a period of 
three years as the Group’s Strategic 
Review covers a three-year period.
During 2017, the Board carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. In 
their assessment of the viability of the 
Group, the Directors have considered 
each of the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties detailed on pages 30 to 
34 of the Strategic Report. The Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully, 
having taken into account the current 
economic outlook. Accordingly, the Board 
believes that, taking into account the 
Group’s current position, and subject to 
the principal risks faced by the business, 
the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and to meet its liabilities

GOING CONCERN STATEMENT
After making enquiries, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to 
continue its operational existence for the

to adopt and consider appropriate the 
going concern basis in preparing the

Group’s consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union.
Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the Group’s financial

they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and of the profit

required to:

that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable 
information;
 { make judgements that are 
reasonable;
 { provide additional disclosures

financial performance; and
 { state whether the financial 
statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union. 
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and Article

Guidance and Transparency Rules.
The Directors are responsible for the

knowledge:

financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole;

DIRECTORS’  
RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT OUR SOLUTIONS
As early adopters in 2013, Nuaire were the 
first ventilation manufacturer to provide a free 
level-1 BIM library of Revit files for the ventilation 
equipment offered.
Nuaire designs its BIM models as ‘type catalogues’ 
allowing the parametric selection of units 
and components from a single Revit file. The 
models also contain information such as links to 
installation and maintenance guides, company 
websites, electrical data, acoustic data and 
connection points to facilitate integration with 
ducting systems and ancillaries from third parties.
Now, across the Polypipe Group, the adoption 
of BIM and Revit are at the forefront for offering 
additional services to customers. Project-specific 
performance criteria and support for design, 
project management and building operations can 
be incorporated, which result in improved design 
efficiency and help to position the Group as 
‘future ready’.

Polypipe Group plc
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF POLYPIPE GROUP plc CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO PRINCIPAL RISKS, GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENT
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the Annual Report and Accounts, in relation to which the ISAs 
(UK) require us to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
 { the disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts set out on pages 30 to 34 that describe the principal risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
 { the Directors’ confirmation set out on page 74 in the Annual Report and Accounts that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
 { the Directors’ statement set out on page 74 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements; 
 { whether the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R (3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 { the Directors’ explanation set out on page 74 in the Annual Report and Accounts as to how they have assessed the prospects 
of the entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.

OUR FINANCIALS KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition and 
customer rebates 
Refer to the Report of the Audit 
Committee (page 52), Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies (page 
92) and Note 3.2 to the consolidated 
financial statements (page 99).
The timing of revenue recognition is 
relevant to the reported performance of 
the Group as a whole and also to the 
completeness of rebate expense and 
related year end liabilities as discussed 
below. There is opportunity to misstate 
the recording of revenue between 
periods in order to influence reported 
results. 
Furthermore, as described in Note 3.2 
to the Group financial statements, the 
Group’s pricing structure includes rebate 
arrangements with customers. Some of 
these arrangements involve estimation 
when determining the amount to be 
recognised as an expense in the year 
and a liability at the year end. This is 
particularly the case where the Group is 
reliant on information from customers 
which may not be available at the time 
the liabilities are recognised.
We validated any material manual journals either 
side of the year end to assess for any evidence 
of management bias, by checking to supporting 
documentation.
We tested the accuracy of revenue cut off around 
the year end. Our work comprised the agreement of 
sales transactions from either side of the year end to 
supporting documentation.
We also performed procedures where applicable 
using EY bespoke data analytics tools to test the 
appropriateness of journal entries recorded in the 
general ledger by correlating sales postings with cash 
receipts throughout the year. 
We tested the appropriateness of rebate provision 
calculations by agreeing a sample of amounts 
recognised to terms of agreements and other 
supporting documents.
We compared year end customer rebate provisions 
and rebate costs in the year to prior year amounts and 
expectations in order to identify unusual trends. 
We compared a sample of rebate payments made in 
the year with amounts provided as at 31 December 
2016 which gave us assurance over the accuracy of 
amounts previously provided. 
We assessed the completeness of rebate amounts 
recognised by reference to the Group’s customer base 
from which revenue was derived in the year. 
We performed full scope audit procedures over this 
risk area in all locations, which covered 100% of the 
risk amount.
We have concluded that revenue is 
appropriately recognised in the correct 
accounting period and found no evidence 
of management bias.
We have concluded that the customer 
rebates expense and liability are 
appropriately recognised and that amounts 
estimated are reasonable.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and 
our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit 
scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this 
enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We take into account factors such as size, risk 
profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of 
Group-wide controls when assessing the level of work to be 
performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group 
financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate 
quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial 
statements, of the 12 reporting components of the Group, we 
selected all 12 components covering entities within the UK, 
France, Italy and the United Arab Emirates, which represent the 
principal business units within the Group.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 
all 12 components selected (‘full scope components’).

Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF POLYPIPE GROUP plc Therefore for the current year, the full scope components where 
we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% of the 
Group’s Profit Before Tax (2016: 100%), 100% of the Group’s 
Revenue (2016: 100%) and 100% of the Group’s Total Assets 
(2016: 100%). 
Changes from the prior year 
There were no scoping changes from the prior year.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken 
at each of the components by us, as the primary audit 
engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY 
global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the 
12 full scope components, audit procedures were performed 
on nine of these directly by the primary audit team which 
was responsible for all UK locations. For the three full scope 
components where the work was performed by component 
auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to 
enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were undertaken by 
the primary audit team to the component team in France. This 
visit involved discussing the audit approach with the component 
team and any issues arising from their work, meeting with local 
management, attending the closing meeting and reviewing key 
audit working papers on risk areas. The primary team interacted 
regularly with the component teams where appropriate during 
various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers 
and were responsible for the scope and direction of the 
audit process. This, together with the additional procedures 
performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing 
the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements 
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually 
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and 
extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £3.1m (2016: 
£2.7m), which is 5% (2016: 5%) of the Group’s Profit Before 
Tax excluding non-underlying items other than amortisation of 
intangible assets. We believe that Profit Before Tax excluding 
non-underlying items other than amortisation of intangible 
assets provides us with the most relevant measure of Group 
profitability. 
Starting basis
Adjustments
Materiality
Reported Proﬁt Before Tax of £55.6m
Totals £61.6m
Materiality of £3.1m (5% of materiality basis)
Add Proﬁt from discontinued operations before tax of £1.4m
Add Non-underlying items, excluding amortisation 
of intangible assets, of £4.6m
We determined materiality for the parent company to be £2.3m 
(2016: £2.5m), which is 1% (2016: 1%) of equity.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account 
or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of 
uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our 
judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2016: 
75%) of our planning materiality, namely £2.3m (2016: £2.0m). 
We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to 
the past history of few misstatements indicating a lower risk of 
misstatement in the financial statements.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of 
obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement 
accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total 
performance materiality. The performance materiality set for 
each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the 
component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the 
risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the 
range of performance materiality allocated to components was 
£0.5m to £2.3m (2016: £0.4m to £2.0m).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are 
considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.2m 
(2016: £0.1m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in 
light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our 
opinion.

OUR FINANCIALS OTHER INFORMATION
The other information comprises the information included in 
the Annual Report and Accounts set out on pages 1 to 78, 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or 
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of the other information, we 
are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to 
our responsibility to specifically address the following items in 
the other information and to report as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information where we conclude that 
those items meet the following conditions:
 { Fair, balanced and understandable (set out on page 45) 
– the statement given by the Directors that they consider 
the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 { Audit Committee reporting (set out on pages 50 to 53) – 
the section describing the work of the Audit Committee 
does not appropriately address matters communicated by us 
to the Audit Committee; or

Directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review 
by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R (2) do 
not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY 
THE COMPANIES ACT 2006

Polypipe Group plc
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF POLYPIPE GROUP plc RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statements set out on pages 77 and 126, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for 
such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group and parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend 
to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT 
OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT EXTENT THE AUDIT 
WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING 
IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify 
and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement 
due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate 
responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected 
fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary 
responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests 
with both those charged with governance of the entity and 
management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
 { We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 
frameworks that are applicable to the Group and 
determined that the most significant frameworks which 
are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial 
statements are those that relate to the reporting framework 
(IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate 
Governance Code) and the relevant tax compliance 
regulations in the UK.
 { We understood how Polypipe Group plc is complying 
with the relevant frameworks by making enquiries 
of management and those responsible for legal and 
compliance. We corroborated our enquiries through our 
review of Board minutes and papers provided to the Audit 
Committee.
 { We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial 
statements to material misstatement, including how fraud 
might occur.
 { Based on this understanding we designed our audit 
procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and 
regulations. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we 
performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud 
risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and 
were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements were free from fraud and error.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at https://
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditor’s report.
OTHER MATTERS WE ARE REQUIRED  
TO ADDRESS
 { We were appointed by the Company in 2012 to audit 
the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2012 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals 
and reappointments is six years, covering the years ended 
31 December 2012 to 31 December 2017.
 { The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent 
company and we remain independent of the Group and the 
parent company in conducting the audit.
 { The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to 
the Audit Committee.

GROUP CASH FLOW STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by  
the Board of Directors on 20 March 2018 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Martin Payne and  
Paul James.
Polypipe Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The principal activity of the 
Group is the manufacture of plastic pipe systems for the building and construction market.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated historical financial information for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material 
respects to all the periods presented. 
As explained in Note 18, certain operations have been classified as discontinued during the year and consequently the 
comparative financial information has been restated where appropriate to meet the presentational requirements of IFRS 5, 
Non-current Assets Held-for-Sale and Discontinued Operations, to take account of this change.
2.1 Basis of preparation and statement of compliance with IFRSs
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as endorsed by the European Union regulations as they apply to the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 and also in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the consolidated financial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial 
instruments that have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and 
all values are rounded to one decimal place of a million (£m) unless otherwise indicated.
2.2 Going concern
The Directors, having considered all relevant risk factors, believe the Group has adequate financial resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements.
2.3 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries at 31 December 
2017. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:
 { power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
 { exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
 { the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to 
one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the 
subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains 
control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line 
with the Group’s accounting policies. All inter-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
The Group holds 100% of the equity and controls 100% of the voting rights in all subsidiaries, with the exception of Water 
Management Solutions LLC which has not traded since incorporation in Qatar in 2015. Accordingly, the treatment of non-
controlling interests or any other non-voting right factors in respect of control is not material.

OUR FINANCIALS
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.4 Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is the total of the 
consideration transferred, measured at acquisition fair value. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in 
administration expenses in the income statement.
Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from 
goodwill.
2.5 Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration 
transferred over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business 
combination. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses (see Note 2.12).
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the profit or loss 
on disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it. 
2.6 Foreign currency translation 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is also the parent company’s functional 
currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of 
each entity are measured in that functional currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recognised by the Group entities at their respective functional currency rates 
prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of 
exchange at the balance sheet date. All differences arising on settlement or translation are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates 
at the dates of the initial transactions. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Pounds Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing. The resulting exchange differences are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
2.7 Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, value 
added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been passed to the buyer (when 
the goods are delivered). The amount is recognised net of any discounts or rebates payable, which are accrued at the point at 
which the goods are delivered. As explained in Note 3.2, rebates can be complex in nature and involve estimation.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised as interest accrues on cash balances using the effective interest method. The effective interest 
rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to its 
net carrying amount.
2.8 Income taxes
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the tax authorities based on income tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.

Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions:
 { where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of 
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;
 { in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and 
 { deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. 
For deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries it must additionally be probable that the 
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets against current income tax 
liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same tax authority and that authority permits the Group to make a 
single net payment.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the income tax rates that are expected 
to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on income tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other 
comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are charged or 
credited directly to equity. Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the income statement.
2.9 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost 
comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes 
costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on the cost less residual value of property, plant and equipment, and is on a straight-line basis over its 
expected useful life as follows:
Freehold land Nil
Freehold buildings Over expected economic life not exceeding 50 years
Plant and other equipment 4 to 10 years
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful 
lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each financial year end and where adjustments are required 
these are made prospectively.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or where 
no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any profit or loss arising on the 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.

2.10 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are initially measured at cost. Intangible assets arising on business combinations are 
initially measured at fair value. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised 
development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the income statement in the year in which the 
expenditure is incurred. 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on 
a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the 
intangible asset may be impaired. 
Amortisation of intangible assets is provided over the following expected useful lives:
Patents and brand names ten years
Customer relationships five years
Customer order book up to one year
Research and development costs 
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on individual projects are recognised as an intangible 
asset when the Group can demonstrate: 
 { the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
 { its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset;
 { how the asset will generate future economic benefits;
 { the availability of resources to complete the asset; and
 { the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.
At the balance sheet date no development costs have met the above criteria. 
2.11 Assets classified as held-for-sale
Assets classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value, less costs to sell. Assets are 
classified as held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, expected to be completed within one year from 
the date of classification and accordingly included within current assets with the associated liabilities being included within 
current liabilities, and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
2.12 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there are any indicators that an asset may be impaired. 
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of 
the asset’s recoverable amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. The recoverable amount of an asset 
or cash-generating unit (CGU) is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and it is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or 
groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and 
is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future pre-tax cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no 
such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation 
multiples or other available fair value indicators.
The Group bases its impairment calculations on detailed budgets and industry forecast calculations which are prepared 
separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and industry forecast 
calculations are generally covering a period of four years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied 
to project future cash flows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the 
impaired asset.

Goodwill
Goodwill has specific characteristics for impairment and is tested annually (at 31 December) or when circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may be impaired. 
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates. For 
the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related CGUs. Each CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill 
is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes 
and is not larger than an operating segment before aggregation. Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its 
carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses related to goodwill are not reversed in future periods. 
2.13 Leasing
The classification of leases as finance or operating leases requires the Group to determine, based on an evaluation of the 
terms and conditions, whether it retains or acquires the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these assets and 
accordingly whether the lease requires an asset and liability to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases and rentals payable are charged in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
2.14 Financial instruments
(i) Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), loans 
and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, except in the case of financial 
assets recognised at FVTPL. 
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and trade and other 
receivables.
Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification. The Group does not hold any held-to-
maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets held for trading. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are 
acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the 
Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by IAS 39.
Financial assets at FVTPL are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in finance revenues 
or finance costs in the income statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. After initial measurement, such assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included in finance 
revenues in the income statement. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the income statement in finance 
costs. Loans and receivables also include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.

Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com
OUR FINANCIALS 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised 
when: 
 { the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.
 { the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group 
has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Impairment
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. 
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value 
and recoverable amount. Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost. 
A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant 
financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms 
of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are 
derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
ii) Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL, loans and borrowings, or as 
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification 
of financial liabilities at initial recognition. The Group has trade and other payables, loans classified as loans and borrowings 
and derivative financial instruments. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, except in the case of loans and 
borrowings which are recognised at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows:
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Profits or losses on 
liabilities held for trading are recognised in the income statement.
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.
Profits and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised in finance 
revenues and finance costs, respectively.
Derecognition
A liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. 
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or 
fees incurred are recognised in the income statement.
iii) Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet if, and only if, there is 
a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to 
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

iv) Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction in the 
principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions.
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at the balance sheet date is determined by reference 
to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs. 
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. 
Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference to the current fair value of another 
instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis; or other valuation models. 
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in Note 28.
v) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency exchange 
contracts, to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities and the financing of those activities. The Group 
does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. 
Changes in the fair value of any derivative financial instruments that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained 
in IAS 39 are recognised immediately in the income statement. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-
current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or 
settled within 12 months.
vi) Hedge accounting
The Group maintains documentation of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the 
inception of a hedging transaction together with the risk management objective and the strategy underlying the designated 
hedge. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an 
ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net 
investment hedges.
Note 28 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes.
The Group does not currently have any designated fair value hedges or net investment hedges.
Cash flow hedge
Cash flow hedging matches the cash flows of hedged items against the corresponding cash flows of the derivative. The 
effective part of any profit or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the hedged 
item is accounted for in accordance with the policy for that financial instrument. Any ineffective part of any profit or loss 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the 
income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative profit or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity 
is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative profit or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
2.15 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to 
its present location and condition, as follows:
 { raw materials – purchase cost on a first in, first out basis.
 { work in progress and finished goods – cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads based on a normal 
level of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

2.16 Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits consist of cash at bank and in hand. 
2.17 Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan. Contributions payable in the year are charged to the income 
statement. The assets are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. Differences 
between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the 
balance sheet. 
2.18 Non-underlying items
The Group presents discontinued operations, amortisation of intangible assets, profit on disposal of property, plant and 
equipment and non-recurring operating costs, finance costs and tax in respect of acquisitions as non-underlying items on the 
face of the income statement. These are items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency 
of the events giving rise to them, the Directors consider merit separate presentation to provide a better and more consistent 
indication of the Group’s underlying financial performance and more meaningful comparison with prior and future periods to 
assess trends in financial performance. The tax effect of the above is also included.
2.19 Share-based payments
In the case of equity-settled schemes, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at the date of grant and spread over the period during which 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The value of the options is measured using the Black-Scholes 
and Monte Carlo models, taking into account the terms and conditions (including market and non-vesting conditions) 
upon which the options were granted. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of 
equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over 
the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not 
ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all 
other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings 
per share.
2.20 Own shares
The Group operates an employee benefit trust (EBT). The Group, and/or the EBT, holds Polypipe Group plc shares for the 
granting of Polypipe Group plc shares to employees and Directors. These shares are recognised at cost and presented in the 
balance sheet as a deduction from equity. No profit or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue 
or cancellation of these shares. No dividends are earned on these shares, and they are ignored for the purposes of calculating 
the Group’s earnings per share.
2.21 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Restructuring provisions are recognised only when the Group has a constructive obligation, which is when a detailed formal 
plan identifies the business or part of the business concerned, the location and number of employees affected, a detailed 
estimate of the associated costs, and an appropriate timeline, and the employees affected have been notified of the plan’s 
main features.
Provisions for warranty-related costs are recognised when the product is sold or service provided to the customer. Initial 
recognition is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of warranty-related costs is revised at least annually.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 3. JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the amounts reported for assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses 
during the year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
The following judgement has the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
3.1 Discontinued operations
In accordance with IFRS, the conditions for a disposal group or non-current asset to be classified as held-for-sale include 
whether management is committed to a plan to sell, the disposal group is available for immediate sale, an active programme 
to locate a buyer is initiated, the sale is highly probable (within 12 months of classification as held-for-sale, subject to limited 
exceptions), the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a sales price reasonable in relation to its fair value and the actions 
required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that plan will be significantly changed or withdrawn.
On 31 January 2018, the Group announced it had entered into exclusive negotiations to sell Polypipe France. It was 
determined that the sale was highly probable at 31 December 2017 and accordingly the French operations were classified as 
discontinued, the associated net assets were classified as held-for-sale, and a loss on remeasurement to fair value less costs to 
sell was recognised. 
The following estimates have the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
3.2 Revenue recognition and customer rebates
The Group’s pricing structure involves rebate arrangements with several of its direct and indirect customers. These can be 
complex in nature and involve estimation in determining the required level of provision for rebate liabilities, particularly where 
the Group is reliant on information from customers which may not be available at the time the liabilities are assessed.
3.3 Impairment of non-financial assets
Non-financial assets include goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. In accordance with IFRS, 
the Group considers whether there are any indicators of impairment of these assets. Where indicators of impairment are 
identified, the Group tests the asset for impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually (at 31 December) and when 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. 
The Group’s impairment test for goodwill is based on a value in use calculation. The value in use calculation is based on a 
discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budgets and forecasts for the next four years and do not 
include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the 
performance of the asset or the cash-generating unit (CGU) being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the 
discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash flows and the growth rate used for 
extrapolation purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs are further 
explained in Note 16.
3.4 Restructuring provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle the probable outflow of resources, and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation.
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. Onerous contracts are 
considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the 
contract exceed the economic benefit expected to be received under the contract.
Provisions for employee contract termination benefits are recognised when the Group is demonstrably committed to either 
terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan where valid expectations are created 
that the obligation will be discharged, or when the Group provides termination benefits as a result of an offer made to 
encourage voluntary redundancy.
3.5 Inventory provisioning
The Directors make estimates based on experience regarding the level of provisioning required against slow-moving and 
obsolete items to state inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

OUR FINANCIALS 4. STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
Standards which have been adopted in the year
There were no new standards or interpretations adopted in the year that had a material impact on the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements. 
Standards issued but not yet effective
The following listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that the Group reasonably expects to have an impact 
on disclosures, financial position or performance but which have an effective date after the date of these consolidated 
financial statements. The Group has not early adopted them and plans to adopt them from the effective dates adopted by the 
European Union. 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) Effective date
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities, introduces new rules for 
hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
The Group has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and is expecting the following impact from the adoption of the new 
standard on 1 January 2018:
Cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other receivables: the new rules do not affect the classification and measurement of 
these financial assets which will continue to be recognised at amortised cost. 
Financial liabilities: the new rules only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL). The only liabilities currently designated as FVTPL are the forward foreign currency derivatives (see below). 
The derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and have 
not been changed.
Interest rate swaps: these will continue to qualify as hedges on adoption of IFRS 9.
Forward foreign currency derivatives: these are currently accounted for as held-for-trading derivatives at FVTPL. Accordingly, 
no change is required to the way in which these liabilities are recognised.
The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on forward-looking expected credit 
losses rather than backward looking incurred losses previously applied under IAS 39. This applies to financial assets classified 
at amortised cost, namely cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. The only financial asset that is currently 
impaired and which may continue to be impaired under IFRS 9 is trade receivables. A large proportion of trade receivables 
are covered by credit insurance. Initial assessments indicate any change to the loss allowance for trade receivables will be 
immaterial.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 which covers contracts for goods and services and IAS 11 which covers construction costs. The new 
standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer. The 
standard permits either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption.
We have considered variable consideration, specifically in relation to rebates. The Group accounts for rebates as discussed in 
Notes 2.7 and 3.2 to the consolidated financial statements and there is not expected to be any impact of applying the new 
standard.
Due to the generally short-term nature of the Group’s contracts there will likely be no significant impact on the timing of 
recognition of revenue prospectively.
The Group intends to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach which means that the cumulative impact 
of the adoption will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 and the comparatives will not be restated.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 4. STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE CONTINUED
IFRS 16 Leases
Under IFRS 16 the present distinction between operating and finance leases will be removed, resulting in all leases being 
recognised on the balance sheet (except short-term leases and leases of low-value assets) and termed right-of-use assets. At 
inception, a right-of-use asset will be recognised together with an equivalent liability reflecting the discounted lease payments 
over the estimated term of the lease. While the overall cost of using the asset over the lease term should be the same, it is 
likely that the weighting of the charge between periods may differ due to the requirement to distinguish between the lease 
and non-lease elements of the agreement. Adoption of this standard is likely to result in an increase in gross assets and gross 
liabilities in the balance sheet, and finance costs being reclassified in the income statement to depreciation and/or interest 
expense. Currently, the Group does not have any finance leases but does have operating leases which are disclosed in Note 
26. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial estimate of the effect of this standard 
until a detailed review has been completed.
5. SEGMENT INFORMATION
IFRS 8, Operating Segments, requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of the internal financial information 
reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The Group’s CODM is deemed to be the Board of Directors, who are 
primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments. 
Following the announcement on 31 January 2018 that the Group had entered into exclusive negotiations to sell Polypipe 
France Holding SAS, its French operations, to Ryb S.A., the Board of Directors refined its reporting segments. The Group 
now has two reporting segments – Residential Systems and Commercial and Infrastructure Systems. The reporting segments 
are organised based on the nature of the end markets served. There are no significant judgements in aggregating operating 
segments to arrive at the reporting segments. Inter-segment sales are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to 
transactions with third parties.
As explained in Note 18, the operations of Polypipe France have been classified as discontinued during the year and 
consequently the comparative financial information has been restated where appropriate to meet the presentational 
requirements of IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held-for-Sale and Discontinued Operations, to take account of this change.

The Chancellor has announced that the main UK corporation tax rate will be reduced from the current rate of 19%, which 
was applied from 1 April 2017, to 17% from 1 April 2020. The reduction in the corporation tax rate to 17% was included 
within the UK Finance Act 2016 that was enacted in September 2016.
Deferred income tax is measured at income tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary timing 
differences are expected to reverse based on income tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax has therefore been provided at 17% (2016: 17%).
(e) Unrecognised tax losses 
A deferred income tax asset of £0.6m (2016: £1.0m) in respect of surplus non-trading losses of £3.7m (2016: £5.5m) has not 
been recognised at 31 December 2017 as its recovery is uncertain.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 13. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to the owners of the parent 
company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The diluted earnings per share 
amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to the owners of the parent company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of potential ordinary 
shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive share options into ordinary shares.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following:
2017 2016
Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 198,390,485 198,930,384
Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares 1,788,892 1,053,339
Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 200,179,377 199,983,723
Underlying earnings per share is based on the result for the year after tax excluding the impact of non-underlying items of 
£20.2m (2016: £5.0m). The Directors consider that this measure provides a better and more consistent indication of the 
Group’s underlying financial performance and more meaningful comparison with prior and future periods to assess trends in 
our financial performance. The underlying earnings per share is calculated as follows:
2017 2016
Underlying profit for the year attributable to the owners of the parent company (£m) 53.9 49.2
Underlying basic earnings per share (pence) 27.2 24.7
Underlying diluted earnings per share (pence) 26.9 24.6

Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
The Polypipe France goodwill of £9.6m was reclassified as held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held-
for-Sale and Discontinued Operations, as explained in Note 18. 
Impairment testing of goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to a number of 
cash-generating units (CGUs). These represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes.
Carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs:
CGU
31 December 
2017
£m
31 December 
2016
£m
Building Products 146.1 146.1
Terrain 31.4 31.4
Civils 36.0 36.0
Nuaire 91.3 91.3
Others 14.9 24.5
319.7 329.3
Impairment tests on the carrying amounts of goodwill are performed by analysing the carrying amount allocated to each CGU 
against its value in use. Value in use is calculated for each CGU as the net present value of that CGU’s discounted future pre-
tax cash flows. These pre-tax cash flows are based on budgeted cash flows information for a period of one year, construction 
industry forecasts of growth for the following year and growth of between 2% to 3% thereafter (2016: 2% to 3%). 
A pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% (2016: 10.0%) has been applied in determining the recoverable amounts of CGUs. The pre-
tax discount rate is estimated based on the Group’s risk adjusted cost of capital.
The Group has applied sensitivities to the remaining goodwill of £319.7m to assess whether any reasonably possible changes 
in assumptions could cause an impairment that would be material to these consolidated financial statements. The application 
of these sensitivities did not cause an impairment of goodwill.

Details of Group undertakings
Details of the investments in which the Group holds 20% or more of the nominal value of any class of share capital at 
31 December 2017 are set out in Note 4 to the parent company financial statements. 
18. ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE
On 31 January 2018, the Group announced that it had entered into exclusive negotiations to sell Polypipe France Holding SAS, 
its French operations, to Ryb S.A., a France-based manufacturer and distributor of plastics in Europe. The cash consideration 
payable by Ryb S.A. will be €16.5m on a cash-free, debt-free and normalised working capital basis. It was determined that the 
sale was highly probable at 31 December 2017 and accordingly the net assets of the French operations have been classified as 
held-for-sale in the consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held-for-Sale and Discontinued 
Operations, an impairment loss of £12.5m to remeasure the carrying amount of the assets to fair value less costs to sell has 
been recognised following the reclassification of the net assets of Polypipe France Holding SAS as held-for-sale. An analysis of 
the assets held-for-sale and liabilities associated with the assets classified as held-for-sale is as follows:

Own shares
Own shares represent the cost of Polypipe Group plc shares purchased in the market and held by the Company, and/or the 
employee benefit trust (EBT), to satisfy the future exercise of options under the Group’s share option schemes.  
At 31 December 2017, the Group held 402,746 (2016: 1,714,148) of its own shares at an average cost of 294p (2016: 268p) 
per share. The market value of these shares at 31 December 2017 was £1.6m (2016: £5.6m). The nominal value of each share 
is £0.001.
The EBT held 748,000 shares at 31 December 2017 (2016: nil) at an average cost of 422p (2016: nil) per share. The market 
value of these shares at 31 December 2017 was £2.9m (2016: nil). The nominal value of each share is £0.001.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve contains the effective portion of the cash flow hedge relationships entered into by the Group in respect 
of interest rate swaps as mentioned in Note 25.
Foreign currency retranslation reserve
The foreign currency retranslation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign subsidiaries.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate capital structure to 
support its business objectives and maximise shareholder value. The Group regards shareholders’ equity and net debt as its 
capital. The Group’s net debt is defined as cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had bank debt of £185.0m (2016: £192.0m), an undrawn committed revolving credit 
facility of £105.0m (2016: £108.0m) and cash of £35.7m (2016: £26.5m). A key objective of the Group is to maintain 
sufficient liquidity (cash and committed bank facilities) in order to meet its cash commitments including interest payments due 
on that debt. 
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 
2016.

Sharesave Plan
Sharesave Plan options were granted to eligible employees on 7 September 2017 at an exercise price of £3.10 per share, 
a 20% discount to the average share price over the three business days preceding the offer. Participating employees can 
exercise their options to purchase the shares acquired through their savings plans at the option price after three years. These 
options have an exercise date of 2020 to 2021.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
LTIP options were awarded to a number of senior executives on 2 May and 22 May 2017. These options have an exercise date 
of 2020 to 2027. The vesting of each award is subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria, of which 25% is 
based on total shareholder return (the TSR element) and 75% is based on earnings per share performance (the EPS element). 
Further details of the scheme are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)
On 25 April 2017, the Executive Directors received an award of shares under the DSBP relating to the 2016 annual bonus. 
David Hall’s deferred bonus share awards vested upon cessation of employment on 2 October 2017 in accordance with the 
DSBP rules, and were settled in cash.

Other share awards
In 2016 other share awards in the form of nil cost options were made relating to buy-out arrangements to partially 
compensate Martin Payne for bonus and long-term incentive awards which were forfeited when he left his previous employer. 
Of these, 24,352 were exercised on 8 August 2017 including 668 in respect of dividends accrued since the grant date. Further 
details are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
All these equity-settled, share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at 
the date of grant of the equity-settled, share-based payments is expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimates of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding adjustment to 
equity. Fair value for the Sharesave Plan options and the EPS element of the LTIP options is measured by use of a Black-Scholes 
model. Fair value of the TSR element of the LTIP options is measured by use of a Monte Carlo model. The expected life used in 
the models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations.
The assumptions used for each share-based payment are as follows:

Bank loan
The bank loan, which is a revolving credit facility, is secured and expires in full in August 2020. Interest is payable on the bank 
loan at LIBOR plus an interest margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.75% which is dependent on the Group’s leverage (net debt 
as a multiple of EBITDA) and reduces as the Group’s leverage reduces. The interest margin at 31 December 2017 was 1.75% 
(2016: 2.00%). 
At 31 December 2017, the Group had available, subject to covenant headroom, £105.0m (2016: £108.0m) of undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at 31 December 2017. 
The facility reduced by £10m to £290m at 31 December 2017 and will reduce by a further £10m each year, regardless of 
leverage, at 31 December 2018 and 2019; the remainder is available until August 2020.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its bank loan which, if breached, would result in the bank loan 
becoming immediately repayable. These covenants specify certain maximum limits in terms of net debt as a multiple of 
EBITDA and interest cover. At 31 December 2017, the Group was not in breach of any bank covenants. The covenant position 
was as follows:
Covenant
Covenant

Interest cover (Underlying operating profit:Finance costs excluding debt issue cost amortisation) >4.0:1 11.5:1
Leverage (Net debt:EBITDA) <3.0:1 1.6:1
The interest cover and leverage covenants remain at 4.0:1 and 3.0:1, respectively, throughout the remaining term of the 
revolving credit facility to August 2020.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED
The Group’s senior management oversees the mitigation of these risks which are summarised as follows:
Interest rate cash flow risk
The interest rate on the Group’s £290m revolving credit facility is variable, being payable at LIBOR plus a margin. To reduce 
the Group’s exposure to potential future increases in interest rates the Group has entered into interest rate swaps for the 
following notional amounts, with interest payable at a fixed rate return dependent on the swap of either 2.21% or 1.735% 
(2016: 2.21% or 1.735%) (excluding margin):

Foreign currency exchange risk
Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument or future cash flows will fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating activities where the revenue or expense is denominated in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the entity undertaking the transaction.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase and sale of foreign currencies in order to 
manage its exposure to fluctuations in currency rates primarily in respect of US Dollar and Euro receipts and payments.
Foreign currency exchange sensitivity
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 10% change in the Euro exchange rate and the United Arab Emirates 
Dirham exchange rate versus Pounds Sterling, the presentational currency of the Group used for translation purposes, on the 
net assets and profit after tax of the Group. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes for all other 
currencies is not material.

OUR FINANCIALS 28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade receivables) and 
from its financing activities, including cash deposits with banks.
Trade receivables
Customer credit risk is managed by each subsidiary subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and controls relating 
to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of the customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard 
and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly 
monitored and any shipments to major export customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit 
insurance. 
The requirement for impairment is analysed at each balance sheet date on an individual basis for major clients. Additionally, 
a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The 
calculation is based on actually incurred historical data. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is the 
carrying amount of each class of financial assets as disclosed in Note 20.
The Group does not hold collateral as security. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables 
as low. At 31 December 2017, 68.2% (2016: 75.3%) of net trade receivables were covered by credit insurance which is 
subject to the normal policy deductibles.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
The Group maintains strong liquidity through cash balances and deposits (£35.7m at 31 December 2017) and its undrawn 
committed revolving credit facility (£105.0m at 31 December 2017) which matures in August 2020.
Credit risk arising from cash deposits with banks is managed in accordance with the Group’s established treasury policy, 
procedures and controls. Deposits of surplus funds are made only with banks that have as a minimum a single A credit 
rating. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 and 
31 December 2016 is the carrying amounts as illustrated in Note 21. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal 
and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group had 
cash and cash equivalents of £35.7m and undrawn and committed credit facilities of £105.0m at 31 December 2017, and no 
debt maturities within 12 months.

The fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined by reference to market values.
Forward foreign currency derivatives fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates. 
Fair value hierarchy 
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 
technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recognised fair value are observable, either 
directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recognised fair value that are not based on 
observable market data.

true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 { present fairly the financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows 
of the Company;
 { select suitable accounting policies in 
accordance with IAS 8, Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors, and then apply 
them consistently;
 { present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable 
information;
 { make judgements that are 
reasonable;
 { provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union is insufficient 
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the 
Company’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
 { state whether the financial 
statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by

Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

COMPANY CASH FLOW STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The parent company financial statements of Polypipe Group plc (the “Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 were 
authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 20 March 2018 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by 
Martin Payne and Paul James. 
Polypipe Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The principal activity of the 
Company is that of a holding company. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the historical financial information for the year ended 
31 December 2017 are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material respects to all 
the periods presented. 
2.1 Basis of preparation and statement of compliance with IFRSs
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as endorsed by the European Union regulations as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 
31 December 2017 and also in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. 
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2017.
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The financial statements are presented 
in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to one decimal place of a million (£m) unless otherwise indicated. No income 
statement or statement of comprehensive income is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006. The results of Polypipe Group plc are included in the consolidated financial statements of Polypipe 
Group plc.
2.2 Going concern
The Directors, having considered all relevant risk factors, believe the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
2.3 Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at historical cost less any applicable provision for impairment. 
2.4 Share-based payments
In the case of equity-settled schemes, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at the date of grant and spread over the period during which 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The value of the options is measured using the Black-Scholes 
and Monte Carlo models, taking into account the terms and conditions (including market and non-vesting conditions) 
upon which the options were granted. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of 
equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over 
the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not 
ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all 
other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings 
are recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements. In particular, the Company records an increase in its 
investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding adjustment to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
2.5 Own shares
The Company operates an employee benefit trust (EBT). The Company, and/or the EBT, holds Polypipe Group plc shares for 
the granting of Polypipe Group plc shares to employees and Directors. These shares are recognised at cost and presented  
in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity. No profit or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of these shares. No dividends are earned on these shares.
