Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 03 Overview > Our Company at a Glance Chairman’s Statement
However, we suffered a setback in the second half 
of the year due to a combination of factors which 
overall impacted our reported profits for the year; 
first, as a result of customer disruption in the wake 
of the June 2017 UK General Election, sign-off on 
some contract wins, especially within health and 
transport, was delayed; secondly, following an 
internal review by our finance team in preparation for 
the full year audit, we identified nine contracts where 
we did not consider revenue should be recognised 
in these results. 
I am pleased to report that the year-end audit and 
subsequent review of revenue recognition did not 
show up any additional material problems around 
accounting irregularities, nor did it increase the size 
of the related adjustment materially. 
Our finance team are to be congratulated for 
their diligence and integrity in standing up for the 
correct treatment and precise year end cut off. On 
the downside, we have expended considerable 
management time on resolving these issues.
There have been more robust discussions and 
technical analysis of revenue recognition accounting 
policies, in particular around the complex area of 
6PM software licence treatment. As a result, an 
adjustment was made to management figures 
relating to 6PM licence revenue.
The Board
Richard Kellett-Clarke, who had become a Non-
Executive Director of Idox in November 2016 after a 
successful tenure as our Chief Executive, stepped 
back in as Interim Chief Executive in December 
2017 following the regrettable illness of his original 
successor Andrew Riley. Andrew remains on 
extended sick leave. I am pleased to report that 
Richard has been able to rapidly execute on a 
plan to get the business back on track as soon as 
possible and will help out for as long as necessary. 
2017 proved to be a year of change and 
contrasting performance for Idox; after a promising 
start to the year, it is disappointing to report on a 
mixed set of results for the year as a whole. 
The early part of the year was focused on 
completion of the acquisition of 6PM, a software 
and solutions business whose main customer 
is the UK NHS, which represented a significant 
expansion in the health and social care market.  
We made a further important acquisition in August, 
of Halarose, an electoral back office software and 
services business that has significantly enhanced 
our elections’ capabilities. 
“ Spanning both the public and private sectors, 
Idox works across a range of industries and 
sectors – from central and local government to 
transport, health and social care and commercial 
organisations, to deliver smart technology that 
enhances services and improves productivity.”

04 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Peter Lilley, who joined the Board in 2005 will step down from his 
role at the Company’s AGM as Senior Non-Executive Director and 
chair of the Remuneration Committee after twelve years’ service 
to the Group. We would like to take this opportunity of thanking 
him for his contribution to the Group over this period. 
Results Summary
A summary of our financial key performance indicators is 
presented above.
Idox grew revenues by 16% but organic growth suffered due to 
the one off issues that occurred during the year, as outlined in 
the Chief Executive’s Statement. As a result, adjusted EBITDA 
declined by 13.9%. The overall Group margin declined to 21% 
from 28% in the previous year. This was the result of a change in 
mix and higher than anticipated one off costs in several parts of 
the business.

The miss of the originally expected EBITDA target of £27.2m by 
£8.7m can be summarised as follows:
Management had an expectation that 6pm licences would be able to be 
recognised at a point in time and had budgeted for revenue in this way. 
In practice this was not possible and 6pm licences were recognised over 
time resulting in a £1m difference between expected revenues and actual 
revenues recognised.

28 February 2018
Chairman’s Statement continued
Net debt (including the 6PM bond) as at 31 October 
2017 stood at £32.1m (2016: £25.0m), and has not 
been impacted by the revenue recognition issues. 
Bank debt remains within the Group’s banking 
facilities, and the net debt / EBITDA ratio as at 
31 October was 1.7 times. Cash conversion has 
improved to 82% (2016: 63%).
Group Strategy
The Group continued its focus on providing digital 
solutions and services to the public sector in 
the United Kingdom and Europe. The key to our 
success is to ensure we deliver better user results 
and productivity improvements for customers 
through focusing on usability, functionality and 
application of integrated digital technologies  
and solutions.
The Group has had a setback this year but the 
Board believes it can bounce back quickly with the 
steps already taken to rectify the issues identified 
and reflecting the underlying strengths of the core 
business, its product offering and talented people. 
Acquisitions
During the financial year two acquisitions were 
completed, 6PM for £18.5 million and Halarose for 
£5.0 million, both in line with our strategy, and both 
of which contributed to this year’s financial results. 
6PM represented a significant expansion into one 
of the most important and largest public services 
– healthcare. Halarose significantly consolidates 
our position in elections. The Board believes that 
both will deliver earnings enhancing contributions in 
future periods.
The 6PM acquisition was funded by means of a 
placing of new shares which raised gross proceeds 
of £20.5 million, whilst £3.5m of the Halarose 
acquisition was financed out of the Group’s existing 
cash resources, with £1.5m settled in shares. 
Dividends
The Board proposes, subject to approval at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting, that a final 
dividend of 0.655p (2016: 0.650p) be paid bringing 
the total for the year to 1.04p (2016: 1.00p), an 
increase of 4%, consistent with our progressive 
dividend policy. In reaching this decision, the Board 
has taken into account the disappointing results for 
the year. 
Summary
Following the disappointment at the year-
end regarding delayed contracts and revenue 
recognition, I am pleased that these matters have 
now been clarified and that we can look forward 
with confidence to the new financial year. Idox 
has an exceptionally strong market position in the 
public sector, a sound balance sheet, and multiple 
opportunities for growth. I am therefore confident of 
the Group’s future prospects.

Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview
Strategic Report >  Our Strategic Overview Chief Executive’s Review
Richard Kellett-Clarke
Chief Executive Officer
The failure to achieve the year end numbers is 
the result of a perfect storm of issues. Recent 
complex acquisitions, exacerbated by earn outs, 
and a time-consuming capital raise created a lot of 
work in the first half of the year and did not result 
in the customary tight integration and release of 
value. This was aggravated by a general election 
year, which served to push contract activity out 
towards the end of the financial year, and revenue 
recognition which was intended to ensure we hit 
year end targets but proved too aggressive. 
The focus since I stepped back into the CEO role, 
has been on five core changes which are expected 
to deliver benefits in the current financial year:
• The full integration of the last four acquisitions to 
deliver shareholder value. This will be completed 
during H1 2018 with a new streamlined 
organisational structure.
• Target £7m of cost savings (10%) through  
the identification of cost synergies and 
technological overlaps in the business to aid 
productivity and efficiency. Introduction of Group 
policies and procedures to increase, security, 
accountability, productivity and compliance.  
This is well advanced with major changes 
already implemented.
• A review of Group pricing and revenue 
recognition policy with external input from 
independent accountants to ensure consistency 
and clarity and improve cash conversion. 
This will be completed during H1 2018 and 
implemented by the end of 2018. It is expected 
to have an initially negative impact on revenues 
as a result of increased SaaS pricing although 
this is expected to have a medium-term benefit.
• Acceleration of our digital, mobile and web 
technology strategy in partnership with our 
customers, and a refocus of our development 
resources to concentrate on core technologies 
and reduce capital costs.
• Improve processes to reduce administration  
and improve cash collection.
Overview
It was quite unexpected to be back in this seat 
some 15 months after stepping down, but I have 
been pleased by the warmth of the reception 
from the Idox team, who have knuckled down 
in what has been a difficult few months. I am 
particularly grateful to Jane Mackie, our CFO, and 
her team who in difficult circumstances upheld the 
Company’s standards of honesty and integrity. We 
are obviously disappointed by the impact these 
matters have had on the reputation of the business 
and fully intend to restore it to full health.
“The Board is confident that the Group is well 
positioned for the current financial year, driven 
by a combination of new contract momentum, 
management and organisational changes.”
10 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 We have made rapid progress as these  
were all initiatives that were previously  
proposed, but deferred.
Public Sector Software
Post the year end we have completed a small 
reorganisation to integrate completely the recent 
acquisitions and to drive greater efficiency and more 
focus to our core public sector customer base. 
Today our services facing government and the local 
public sector aimed at improving the usability and 
quality of services, account for 72% of revenues, an 
increase of 17% on the previous year. 
The business had another strong election year 
which not only disrupted the business in the middle 
of the year with the uncertain outcome of the 
general election in May, but ended the year with the 
delayed completion of the national election system 
for Northern Ireland due to uncertainty around 
potential fresh elections, and the award of the 
e-Count contract for Malta.
We have continued to enhance our digital services 
platform and roll out the completed mobile 
application platform which aims to improve the 
customer experience and assist our customers 
in their productivity goals. The total number of 
customer solutions has now exceeded over 100. 
Building on this, consultation has begun on the 
next generation of web based solutions for local 
government which is scheduled for delivery in 
incremental stages starting in 2019 through to 2020.
Overall, we have continued to see further  
market share gains with 108 new local authority 
customers, 7 new system sales and 11 managed 
service customers.
Our Transport solutions have delivered and awaiting 
sign from the two major systems they have been 
working on for the past two years in Perth, Australia 
and Manchester. This has led to cost overruns but 
the resultant ground-breaking innovation in these 
solutions has resulted in further international interest 
and the closure of the Bristol Transport contract in 
Q1 2018. 
These solutions offer real time adaptive traffic 
signalling, dynamic timetabling and printing, alters 
and monitoring solutions for multi modal journeys, 
dynamic stand management, performance 
monitoring of journey times, bus lateness and air 
quality, as well as “green wave” solutions to control 
vehicle speed for current and autonomous vehicles. 
They represent our long-term investment in smart 
City solutions, which we believe represents an 
attractive opportunity for the Group.
Facilities management (‘FM’) had another good year 
and has now started to work more closely with our 
health business to deliver FM solutions linked with 
asset tracking to hospitals.

Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview
Strategic Report >  Chief Executive’s Review Chief Executive’s Review continued
6PM
Post-acquisition integration of 6PM quickly 
uncovered a number of issues which resulted in:
• The restatement of 6PM’s audited accounts  
due to material errors which were identified in 
due diligence.
• Discovery of additional unaccrued costs.
• Incurring one-off legal, auditing and consulting 
costs to expedite discipline in the business.
• Increased management time and resources to 
achieve the partial integration which detracted 
attention from the core business.
• The points above resulted in a reassessment of 
forecasts and an agreed impairment of £2.7m to 
the carrying value of goodwill in the accounts.
• Continued and extended discussions with our 
auditors over the recognition of revenues in 2017. 
The technical discussion was a complex area 
which focused on recognition of revenue either at 
a point in time or over time, with the difference in 
revenue and profits being £1m. Management had 
an expectation that 6pm licences would be able 
to be recognised at a point in time. In practice 
this was not possible and 6PM licence revenue 
continued to be recognised over time rather 
than at a point in time. This has resulted in the 
£1m revenue and profits which was expected by 
management to be recognised in 2017 not being 
recognised in the period and carried forward to 
future periods. 
Now this is all behind us, we are concentrating 
on reviewing how we sell to the NHS to improve 
sales performance, time to closure and revenue 
recognition which may affect revenues in the  
short-term.
Digital 
The Digital business had an unexciting year 
in revenue terms but was very proud to have 
completed and delivered new designs and 
approaches for a diverse customer base including 
the Church of England, as well as several well-
known premier league football clubs. It has started 
to work with both the transport, FM, and local 
government areas of the business to improve 
the usability of customer web sites and deliver 
better customer experiences and more relevant 
information, which is all part of our strategy to use 
digital technology to deliver better public services. 
Content
The Compliance part of our business has been 
merged at the end of this year with our Grant’s 
business as they are both content and services 
businesses. The combined Content business unit 
has stabilised after a poor performance in the 
prior year and grew revenues by 15% in 2017. New 
products this year included new modules to help 
corporates and local authorities with the education 
of staff around the European GDPR standard. 
Content has continued to take market share with 
strong sales for our Research connect platform.
Engineering Information  
Management (EIM)
Engineering revenue declined slightly by 8% year 
on year, the result of a more stringent revenue 
recognition policy and delayed completion of 
projects. The business has continued to invest in 
its SaaS platform which has received good reviews 
and is expected to be launched in the second half of 
2018 as an upgrade to the current system.
12 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Markets
Looking forward we see no material change in all 
our markets. We saw delays in decision making 
processes in 2017 as a result of the general election 
but no discernible impact from Brexit. The oil and 
gas market has seen a slight uptick as a result of 
the strengthening price of oil but this is yet to turn 
into substantial growth. The Content business 
remains a slower growth, lower margin business in 
highly competitive markets. Public sector customers 
continue to look at our digital, mobile and web 
offerings and we continue to see good growth in  
the use of these services.
Objectives for 2018
The Group’s strategy remains to focus on the wider 
public sector (with the addition of Health last year). 
We intend to accelerate our international ambitions, 
and having consolidated our position in the UK 
elections market we are looking to expand this area 
of the business outside the UK.
The short-term focus has been to rectify the issues 
which developed in 2017. To that end we have 
started and will have completed by the end of 
H1 2018 the full integration of all the business we 
have bought in the past two years. This will result 
in some significant cost saving and improvements 
in quality standards across the Group as well as 
helping us to leverage our intellectual property.
This year will see the launch of a new Group 
web site which integrates all our solutions, 
capabilities and technologies to aid cross selling 
and to leverage the capability of the business. The 
investment strategy will result in an increased focus 
on our web cloud and smart city solutions. 
The Board believes government bodies must invest 
in digital solutions to improve the quality of their 
services and continue their drive for improvements 
in productivity and accessibility. Idox is unique in 
having an extensive range of capabilities which 
it can integrate to deliver quick outcomes and is 
looking forward to building stronger links with its 
customers to deliver true innovation to the market 
with their help.

Outlook
In the early months of the new financial year the 
business has had an encouraging start with the 
majority of the delayed contracts from last year 
being signed; the Bristol transport solution, the 
e-Count solution for the Government of Malta, and 
new solutions for the Isle of Man, Western Isles, 
Croydon and the South Downs National Park and 
Dorset Councils partnership. 
2018 will see a decisive move towards a change in 
product pricing and a focus on cash conversion; we 
believe this will deliver stronger future growth and 
a higher quality earnings, although in the short-
term it will depress revenue growth in 2018. We 
expect margins to improve following the cost saving 
measures being targeted and the completion of 
integration activity. 
Overall, the Board is confident that the Group is 
well positioned for the current financial year, driven 
by a combination of new contract momentum, 
management and organisational changes, 
savings made since the year end and the full year 
contributions from the 2017 acquisitions.
I remain confident of Idox’s prospects and believe 
that the Group has good growth opportunities, 
through its continued focus on digital  
transformation and channel shift in the public 
sector, increasing market shares, ensuring existing 
acquisitions are fully bedded in, cross selling, and 
geographical expansion.

“Group revenues grew by 16% to £88.9m”
Financial Review
Financial Review
Group revenues grew by 16% to £88.9m (2016: 
£76.7m), driven by the impact of two acquisitions; 
6PM, providing software and services to the NHS 
(February 2017) and Halarose supplier of electoral 
back office software and services to UK local 
authorities (August 2017). 
74% of Group revenues were generated in the UK 
(2016: 73%) with the two acquisitions completed 
in 2017 having the majority of their customers 
based in the UK. Gross profit earned increased 
11% to £73.7m (2016: £66.6m) and the Group 
saw a decrease in gross margin from 87% to 83% 
as a result of lower margin election print revenue 
related to the May local elections and General 
Election. Earnings before interest, tax, amortisation, 
depreciation, restructuring, acquisition, impairment, 
corporate finance and share option costs (‘Adjusted 
EBITDA”) decreased by 14% to £18.5m (2016: 
£21.5m) with EBITDA margins decreasing to  
21% (2016: 28%). Group EBITDA margin was 
impacted by lower margins in the Digital and Health 
divisions and a change in mix of election revenue in 
the PSS division.
Performance by Segment
Following the acquisition of 6PM a new segment 
was created with the addition of Health, which 
reflects the results of 6PM. Halarose acquired in 
August 2017 is part of the PSS segment. Grants 
and Compliance have been combined in the second 
half of the year following a reorganisation and now 
come under the Content division.
The PSS division, which accounted for 46% of 
Group revenues (2016: 53%), delivered revenues of 
£41.2m (2016: £41.0m) and included a contribution 
from Halarose acquired August 2017. Product and 
services revenue increased by 7% (or organically 
decreased by 5%) to £20.4m (2016: £19.0m). 
Election revenues accounted for £4.7m (2016: 
£5.6m) of PSS revenues with the division delivering 
on the May local elections and the General Election. 
Election revenue was down on the prior year as 
2016 included the EU referendum, May Scottish 
and local elections and the Scottish Government 
eCount project. Recurring revenues within the PSS 
division from maintenance and hosting were £16.1m 
(2016: £16.4m). Recurring revenues represented 
39% (2016: 40%) of total PSS revenue. Divisional 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 6% to £15.4m 
(2016: £16.3m), delivering a 37% EBITDA margin 
(2016: 40%). 
The Digital division accounted for 17% of Group 
revenues (2016: 14%) with revenue of £14.7m (2016: 
£10.9m) and a full year of Rippleffect acquired in 
August 2016.
The EIM division accounted for 15% of Group 
revenues (2016: 18%) with revenue of £12.9m  
(2016: £14.1m). Recurring revenues within the EIM 
division from maintenance and SaaS were 60% 
(2016: 57%). EIM saw a fall in revenue due to an 
increased emphasis on SaaS and managed service 
deals, continued pressure on per-seat licence 
prices and oil and gas spending still tight on  
non-key investment.
The Content division in the UK and Europe had 
revenue growth of 15% to £12.4m (2016: £10.8m).
The Health division contributed nine months trading 
to the period, since the acquisition of 6PM in 
February 2017, with revenues of £7.6m.
14 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 The Challenge
Looking to streamline operations and deliver  
an enhanced, online service to its citizens, Craven  
District Council wanted to transition to a new Planning  
and Building Control platform.
The new technology needed to facilitate improved citizen 
engagement and drive efficiencies by delivering a fully  
integrated, end-to-end service.
Deliverables at-a-Glance
The Council commissioned Idox to implement a suite of digital 
services including online application submission portal, proven 
back-office system Uniform, Public Access, and a robust Electronic 
Document and Records Management System.
The Planning and Building Control application went live in summer 
2017, with future phases already planned to launch an online service 
for Environmental Health, Licensing, and Housing and Waste 
Management later this year. A citizen-led approach also ensures 
Craven residents can enjoy enhanced engagement with the  
Council in a timely, efficient manner.
The launch of the new system at Craven marked Idox  
as a key supplier of smart technology to all nine  
councils in Yorkshire.

Strategic Report Company Information Financial Statements Governance Overview
Strategic Report > Financial Review 15 Financial Review continued
Adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings 
per share are alternative performance measures, 
considered by the Board to be a better reflection 
of true business performance than looking at the 
Group’s results on a statutory basis only. These 
measures are widely used by research analysts 
covering the Group. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 14% to £18.5m (2016: 
£21.5m) impacted by lower margin election revenue 
in PSS, lower revenue in EIM, lower margin in pay per 
click revenue in Digital and a maiden loss contribution 
from Health. Cost of sales increased 49% with 37% 
of the increase due to acquisitions in the period. 
Several issues have arisen in the Health division since 
acquisition. Although full financial due diligence was 
carried out by Grant Thornton on 6pm and identified 
material errors, the accounting issues which have 
come to light have been greater than expected. 
We have inherited issues with incomplete accounting 
records, revenue recognition and inconsistent 
contractual paperwork. These issues have taken 
up an exceptional amount of finance resources to 
resolve. The Health division was fully integrated into 
the Idox accounting function in July 2017 following 
the acquisition at the end of February. As a result, 
the issues inherited are not expected to be repeated 
going forward.
Administrative expenses increased by 31% to £68.6m 
(2016: £52.3m) or excluding acquisitions by 4%. Staff 
costs increased by 19% to £42.3m (2016: £35.5m) or 
excluding acquisitions decreased by 1%. 
Finance costs have increased to £2.0m (2016: £1.4m) 
due to the 6PM bond interest payable (£0.8m). The 
Maltese Stock Exchange bond was issued in 2015 
prior to Idox acquiring 6PM at a nominal value of 
€13m, is repayable in 2025 and has a coupon rate  
of 5.1%.
Reported profit before tax decreased to £3.5m 
(2016: £13.0m) as a result of higher amortisation 
and finance costs following the acquisition of 6PM 
plus an impairment charge related to 6PM. The 
impairment arose from a reassessment of the 
forecasts prompted by the emergence of inherited 
issues as described above. Amortisation of 
intangibles increased to £5.2m (2016: £3.8m) due to 
the acquisition of 6PM. Amortisation of development 
costs was £2.3m (2016: £1.3m) and amortisation 
on software licences was £0.9m (2016: £1.0m). 
Development costs are amortised over a 1 to 5 year 
period on a project by project basis and software 
licences are amortised over 3 years. Acquisition 
costs of £8,000 (2016: £0.4m credit) relate to £0.2m 
of 6PM and Halarose acquisition costs, offset by a 
further £0.2m reduction in the earn out payment for 
Cloud Amber. Restructuring charges of £0.7m (2016: 
£0.3m) includes £0.3m for the restructuring of the 
Digital division following the acquisition of Rippleffect.

Profit Before Tax
16 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 The Group continues to invest in developing 
innovative technology solutions and has incurred 
capitalised development costs of £4.8m (2016: 
£2.8m). Research and Development costs expensed 
in the period were £3.8m (2016: £4.0m).
Taxation
The effective tax rate (‘ETR’) for the period was 
24.21% (2016: 9.06%). 
Significant tax repayments were processed in 2017, 
not previously provided for, in respect of historic R&D 
claims covering the Reading Room Group and Idox 
Health Ltd, resulting in downward pressure on the 
ETR for the year.
However, certain other factors contributed to 
increasing the ETR, primarily impairment of the 6PM 
acquisition and costs associated with this acquisition, 
both of which are non-deductible expenses for tax 
purposes. Another factor which increased ETR was 
the non-recognition of losses incurred in Malta, 
owing to uncertainty over their future utilisation. 
These losses will be recognised where their likelihood 
of utilisation increases, with any future recognition 
resulting in a decrease to ETR.
Unrelieved trading losses of £1.1m, across the 
US and the UK, remain available to offset against 
future taxable trading profits. This number excludes 
substantial carried-forward losses not recognised 
for deferred tax purposes to date, owing to adoption 
of a prudent loss recognition position. The gross 
value of these losses not recognised to date totals 
£12.1m, split across Malta (£8.7m), the UK (£2.1m) 
and Germany (£1.3m). The Board is hopeful that 
the Group will benefit from these derecognised tax 
losses in future, and will be recognised at the point 
where utilisation becomes more certain.
Earnings Per Share and Dividends
Adjusted earnings per share fell to 2.40p (2016: 
4.11p). Adjusted diluted earnings per share fell to 
2.34p (2016: 3.96p). Adjusted earnings per share was 
impacted in the period by increased finance costs 
following the acquisition of 6PM.
Basic earnings per share fell to 0.66p (2016: 3.30p). 
Diluted earnings per share fell to 0.64p (2016: 3.18p). 
Basic earnings per share fell due to the impact of 
the 6PM acquisition on increased finance costs, 
increased amortisation on acquired intangibles, 
increased acquisition costs and impairment. 
The Board proposes a final dividend of 0.655p an 
increase of 0.8% on the previous final dividend, giving 
a total dividend for the year of 1.04p and 4% growth 
for the full year. This is in line with our progressive 
dividend policy for dividend growth. Subject to 
shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting, the final dividend is expected to 
be paid on the 20 April 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at 3 April 2018.
Balance Sheet and Cashflows
The Group’s balance sheet continued to strengthen 
during the period and at 31 October 2017 net 
assets were £91.3m compared to £65.2m at 31 
October 2016. The increase in net assets includes 
£35m relating to goodwill on acquisition and other 
intangibles of 6PM.
Cash generated from operating activities before 
tax as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA was 82% 
(2016: 63%). Cash conversion has historically been 
impacted by deferred payment deals over 3 to 5 
years which have been offered to local authorities. 
The cash conversion trend continues to improve as 
payment from customers are more aligned with when 
services are provided. 
The Group ended the period with net debt of £32.1m 
(2016: £25.0m), after utilising the facility for the 
acquisition of Halarose (£3.5m) and taking on the 
6PM bond of £11.4m which existed in 6PM pre-
acquisition. The 6PM bond sits outside the Group’s 
signed debt facilities.
The Group’s total signed debt facilities at 31 October 
2017 stood at £36.5m, a combination of a £9.5m 
term loan, £4m overdraft and £23m revolving credit 
facility, split £22.8m with the Royal Bank of Scotland 
and £13.7m with Silicon Valley Bank. In addition to 
the signed debt facilities the 6PM bond is a Maltese 
Stock Exchange bond issued in 2015 pre-acquisition 
at a nominal value of €13m, it is repayable in 2025 
and has a coupon rate of 5.1%.
Deferred income, representing invoiced maintenance 
and SaaS contracts yet to be recognised in revenue 
stood at £19.8m (2016: £15.9m). An increase of 
£4.9m is due to acquisitions in the period. Accrued 
income, representing future cashflows, increased to 
£23.0m (2016: £18.8m). The increase in prior year 
includes £1.2m due to acquisitions. 
£15.1m of accrued income relates to licences and 
services that have been delivered to local authorities 
and revenue recognised but the customer is paying 
for the licence and services over a period of typically 
3 to 5 years. This will be future cash inflows for the 
Group. The balance of accrued income is service 
revenue where work has been completed but the 
project has not yet reached an invoicing milestone 
and will convert to cash in the short-term.

Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview
Strategic Report > Financial Review Risk identification and management continues to be 
a key role for the Board. Risk management strategy 
is led by the Board; thereafter management of risk 
is judiciously managed through dedicated expert 
professionals in the business. 
Risk management processes and internal control 
procedures are established within business 
practices across all levels of the organisation. 
Risk identification, assessment and mitigation 
are performed across Idox with a more detailed 
assessment at operational level, and through 
Board led assessment of strategic and market risk. 
Risk management and internal controls provide 
reasonable but not absolute protection against risk. 
Risk appetite is not static and is regularly assessed 
by the Board to ensure it continues to be aligned 
with the Group’s goals and strategy.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Local 
Management
Annual comprehensive 
risk reviews are performed by 
local management teams 
and reported to the Risk 
Committee.
Internal Audit
The Group’s internal 
audit function performs 
regular audits in country 
offices to assess culture,  
financial controls in 
accordance with local 
regulatory requirements 
and Group controls.
Audit 
Committee
The Audit Committee has 
responsibility for assessing 
and challenging the robustness 
of the internal control environment.  
It directs and reviews local 
management, internal audit and 
Group finance reports on internal 
control and risk management 
throughout the year, and 
reports the principal 
risks to the Board.
Risk 
Committee
The Risk Committee 
meets quarterly and 
discusses the Group’s 
strategy, identifies the 
principal risks to the 
strategy and agrees 
mitigating actions.
Board
The Board has 
overall responsibility for 
Idox’s risk management, 
processes and reporting. Risk 
management processes and 
internal control procedures 
are the ultimate 
responsibility of  
the Board. 
Risk Profile
New and existing risks were identified and  
assessed during 2017. Executive management,  
the Risk Committee and the Board performed 
further analysis to prioritise these risks, with a focus 
on those principal risks posing the highest current 
risk to the achievement of the Group’s objectives. 
All risks facing Idox were consolidated onto a risk 
heat map. 
Risks included on the heat map are monitored 
more closely by executive management, the 
Risk Committee and the Board. Whilst these 
principal key risks represent a significant portion 
of the Group’s overall risk profile, the executive 
management and the Risk Committee continue 
to monitor the universe of risks to identify new 
or emerging risks as well as any changes in risk 
exposure. The risk profile continued to change 
throughout the year, in part as a result of the 
acquisition of the 6PM Holdings plc group of 
companies and Halarose Holdings Limited. We 
now have operations in Malta, Macedonia and have 
more exposure to the health sector and increased 
exposure in the elections space.
18 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Embedding the Risk Culture 
Throughout the Group, risk management is an 
evolving process. This is recognised by ongoing 
training and advice by divisional and business unit 
risk representatives, supported by the central risk 
and assurance team, best practice sharing, gap 
analysis and internal benchmarking. Successful 
training and communication help build a culture and 
ability to further embed processes and procedures 
throughout the organisation. A more deeply 
embedded risk management culture supports 
long-term value creation for all stakeholders.
The principal risks involved in delivering the  
Group’s strategy are actively managed and 
monitored against our risk appetite as follows:
Risk Principle risks Management of risks
Cyber risk Information security breach or 
cyber-attack resulting in loss 
or theft of data, content or 
intellectual property.
Idox operates with a number of complex systems 
that maintain confidential data. The risk is 
perceived to have increased due to the higher 
number of cyber-attacks in the UK.
Idox has cyber, data protection and security 
policies in place and regularly reviews the 
effectiveness of these policies. System controls 
include secure infrastructure, content level 
protection, access management and monitoring. 
There is an enterprise-wide data security 
programme and defined incident management 
processes, including those for employees to report 
security breaches.
Idox continues to focus on achieving ISO 22301: 
‘Business Continuity Management System’.
Idox is accredited to the UK government based 
Cyber Essentials standard.  
Economic 
environment
The performance of Idox is 
affected by the economic cycles 
of the markets of the countries in 
which it operates. The recent US 
election and ‘Brexit’ referendum 
on the exit of the UK from the 
Treaty of the European Union 
have increased the uncertainty 
in the economic, social and 
environmental markets in which 
we operate.
A diversified geographical footprint and sector 
focus reduces the risk of exposure due to adverse 
country or sector-specific conditions. 
Idox continues to focus on the diversification of 
customers and geographical markets. In February 
2017 Idox acquired 6PM Holdings plc. This 
group of companies was headquartered in Malta 
with operations in the UK and Macedonia. This 
expansion of the Group’s customer base and 
geographical reach increases risk.
Idox has budgeted for foreign exchange 
fluctuations; however, this may not mitigate the 
risk entirely. The Executive team deliver against a 
framework for future investment for both organic 
and acquisitive growth. The investment going 
forward will be focused on: public sector initiatives 
in international expansion; increasing market share 
in existing public sector markets; entering new 
public sector markets; and delivering increased 
account sales in product & sales initiatives.

innovation
Idox risks being outclassed by 
competitor products that have 
increased capabilities if the 
Group fails to deliver continued 
product development.
Idox strives to deliver quality products, which 
provide strong competition in the market, while 
continuing to invest in quality assurance and 
research and development functions. 
Idox has invested significantly in increasing its 
capability to become a significant player in the 
delivery of digital.  
Retention and 
succession
Due to recent acquisitions, 
Idox may inherit employees 
who have levels of training 
and remuneration that are 
inconsistent with the wider 
Group, potentially leading to 
retention issues and resultant 
loss of skills and knowledge. 
Idox continues to deliver successful integrations 
of acquired businesses. Human Resources leads 
on assessing remuneration packages and training 
requirements. Where required, mitigating actions 
are taken to develop or enhance benefits packages 
to Group employees.
Acquisitions Acquisitions/restructuring may 
not achieve the anticipated 
returns impacting on projected 
margin rates.
Idox has set up a robust M&A team, which  
works together with our integration function, to 
carry out due diligence and mitigate risks where 
possible. For more complex acquisitions, the 
team work in conjunction with external advisors to 
reduce exposure. 
The Group has a robust and disciplined approach 
to identifying and testing potential companies 
for acquisition. Following the recent complex 
acquisition the group will enhance the approach 
to identifying and testing acquisitions to ensure 
the likelihood of issues encountered (as discussed 
in the Chief Executive’s review) this year are not 
repeated.”. Targets are subject to due diligence 
processes, and analysed according to Board level 
agreed investment decision criteria to identify 
suitable, earnings enhancing acquisitions. They are 
assessed by the Executive team for strategic fit. 
The due diligence process is led by experienced 
M&A Integration Managers and supported by 
relevant experts in domain knowledge and heads 
of department. Idox’s focus for 2018 is to fully 
integrate recent acquisitions and improve discipline 
to ensure adherence to policies across the Group.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued Risk Principle risks Management of risks
Business 
continuity
There is a risk that any business 
may face the failure of business 
continuity systems, disruption 
to normal business operations 
and closure of offices for a 
significant period of time. This 
would have a significant impact 
on our operations and trading 
capability.
To successfully manage this risk, Idox has 
developed effective business continuity and 
incident management plans. The disaster recovery 
plan provides for re-build in and already contracted 
secondary location.
Idox’s information management team has 
provided for the replication of key systems data at 
existing secondary location to reduce key system 
recovery time. As part of our commitment to risk 
management, Idox continues to carry out a wider 
business review of disaster recovery plans to 
ensure they are fit for purpose. 
Regular business continuity plans are updated and 
delivered to the Board on at least an annual basis. 
In the current year, Idox has focused on  
achieving ISO 22301: ‘Business Continuity 
Management System’. 
Political The Group has a large customer 
base in local government. A 
change in spending priorities 
by the current or a future 
Government could materially 
impact the Group.
This risk is mitigated due to the contractual nature 
of the recurring revenue in the Group. 
The Group has increased diversification of its 
customer base through acquisitions to mitigate 
against political risks. 
Global macro-
environment
The Group operates across 
a number of countries and its 
operations are increasingly 
subject to global competition 
and political risks. The Group 
is also affected by economic 
environments in other territories, 
which include currency 
volatility, inflation and recession. 
The customer base in local 
government means that  
political changes can be 
disruptive and can interfere  
with activities and operations  
in a particular country. 
In order to mitigate these risks, the Group monitors 
and forecasts for key changes in the territories in 
which it operates. 
Idox continues to diversify its business and 
operations in various territories. Idox risk assesses 
changing geo-political environments and this 
allows for timely risk mitigation as and when 
volatility occurs. The Group gathers information 
and seeks expert advice where necessary.

24 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Substantial Shareholdings
As at 31 October 2017, the Company was aware of the following interests in 3% or more of its issued  
share capital:
Transaction in Own Shares
During the year, the Group did not purchase any of 
its own ordinary shares of 1p to be held as treasury 
shares in order to satisfy future employee share 
option exercises. 
During the year three share option exercises were 
satisfied using treasury shares. These exercises 
combined used a total of 64,000 treasury shares. 
The maximum number of shares held in treasury at 
any time during the year was 3,055,219, which had 
a cost value of £1,270,634. The current number of 
shares held in treasury is 1,491,219. 
Health, Safety and  
Environmental Policies
The Group recognises and accepts its 
responsibilities for health, safety and the 
environment (H,S&E) and has a dedicated team, 
which provides advice and support in this area. 
The team members regularly attend external H,S&E 
courses and internal reviews are performed on 
a regular basis to ensure compliance with best 
practice and all relevant legislation. In the current 
year, Idox has focused on achieving ISO 45001: 
‘Health and Safety Management’ Standard.
Disabled Employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons 
are always fully considered, bearing in mind the 
aptitudes and abilities of the applicant concerned. 
In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, 
every effort is made to ensure that their employment 
with the Group continues and that appropriate 
training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that 
the training, career development and promotion of 
disabled employees should, as far as possible, be 
identical with that of other employees. 
Employee Consultation
The Group consults employees through the National 
Company Council (NCC). The NCC sits regularly 
during the year and is made up of representatives 
voted on the Council by employees. An employee 
consultation policy is also in place. Employees are 
encouraged to present their views and suggestions 
in respect of the Group’s performance and policies. 
In addition, the Group has an intranet, which 
facilitates faster and more effective communication.
An Employee Share Investment Trust is in place 
to provide employees with a tax efficient way of 
investing in the Company. The Company purchases 
matching shares, which become the property of the 
employee after a three year vesting period.

Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview
Governance > Directors’ Report Director’s Report continued
Financial Risk Management Objectives 
and Policies
The Group uses various financial instruments which 
include cash, equity investments, bank loans and 
items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that 
arise directly from its operations. The main purpose 
of these financial instruments is to raise finance for 
the Group’s operations. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial 
instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, exchange 
rate risk and interest rate risk. The Directors review 
these risks on an ongoing basis. This policy has 
remained unchanged from previous years. Further 
information on financial risk management is 
disclosed in note 22 of the Group accounts.
Credit Risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash 
and trade receivables. The credit risk associated 
with cash is limited as the counterparties have high 
credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies. The principal credit risk arises therefore 
from its trade receivables. 
In order to manage credit risk, the management 
review the debt ageing on an ongoing basis, 
together with the collection history and third-party 
credit references where appropriate. 
Liquidity Risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by 
ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely 
and profitably.
Exchange Rate Risk
The Group monitors its exposure to exchange rate 
risk on an ongoing basis. The Group has minimal 
exposure to foreign exchange risk as a result of 
natural hedges arising between sales and cost 
transactions.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s bank borrowings bear interest at rates 
linked to LIBOR. On a quarterly basis, the Board 
reviews the LIBOR rate and discuss whether it is 
considered necessary to set up hedges to protect 
against interest rate movements. 
Going Concern
The Directors, having made suitable enquiries and 
analysis of the accounts, consider that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in business 
for the foreseeable future. Whilst the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet shows net current liabilities, £19.8m 
of current liabilities relates to deferred income 
which does not convert to cash payable. For this 
reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
In making this assessment, the Directors have 
considered the Group’s budget, cash flow 
forecasts, available banking facility and levels of 
recurring revenue.
The Board highlighted to the lenders that due to 
a limitation of scope in relation to the 6PM sub-
group the audit would result in a qualified audit 
opinion. It was explained to the lenders that due 
to poor record keeping in the early months of the 
period within 6PM there is a limitation of scope on 
6PM revenue and deferred revenue and the books 
and records of the three immaterial subsidiaries, 
particularly relating to the period up to July 2017 
when 6PM was integrated into Idox finance and 
the record keeping has been improved. Following 
discussions with the Board the bank was satisfied 
that, whilst this is technically a default, they have 
given an advance waiver to cover the period of 
signing the statutory accounts.
Auditor
A resolution to reappoint an Auditor and to 
authorise the Directors to agree their remuneration 
will be placed before the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting of the Company.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee operates within defined terms of reference. The Remuneration Committee comprises the  
Chairman and two Non-Executive Directors and normally meets four times a year. It is chaired by Peter Lilley.
Remuneration Policy
The policy of the Group is to set levels of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and key staff. The 
packages are designed to be competitive in value to those offered to the Directors of similar sized public companies in related 
sectors. It is the Board’s policy to align the long-term interests of managers with those of our shareholders in the granting of 
options and other equity rewards. 
The components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are currently a basic salary, bonus, money purchase pension 
contributions and benefits in kind. The benefits include car allowance, private medical cover, life cover and critical illness cover. The 
bonus elements are dependent on the Executive Directors achieving performance criteria set out by the Remuneration Committee. 
The criteria include targets for revenue and profits as well as cash balances. In addition, the Group operates share option schemes for 
the Executive Directors.

Governance > Corporate Governance Report
Corporate Governance
The Group is committed to achieving and 
maintaining the highest standards of corporate 
governance. As the Company is listed on the 
Alternative Investment Market, it is not required 
to comply with all aspects of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) issued in 
September 2014. The Group does not comply  
with the Code. 
However, the Group has reported on corporate 
governance arrangements by drawing upon best 
practice available, including those aspects of the 
Code considered to be relevant to the Group. The 
Board receives regular advice on best practice 
corporate governance compliance and this has 
supported enhanced governance practice. 
Board of Directors
Subject to the Articles of Association, UK 
legislation and any directions given by special 
resolution, the business of the Group is managed 
by the Board. The Code requires the Group to 
have an effective Board whose role is to develop 
strategy and provide leadership to the Group 
as a whole. It sets out a framework of controls 
that allows for the identification, assessment 
and management of risk. Additionally, it ensures 
the Board takes collective responsibility for the 
success of the Group.
The Board’s main roles are to provide leadership 
to the management of the Group, determine the 
Group’s strategy and ensure that the agreed 
strategy is implemented. The Board takes 
responsibility for approving potential acquisitions, 
major capital expenditure items, disposals, annual 
budgets, annual reports, interim statements and 
Group financing matters. 
The Board appoints its members and those 
of its principal Committees following the 
recommendations of the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee. The Board  
reviews the financial performance and operation 
of the Group’s businesses. The Board regularly 
reviews the identification, evaluation and 
management of the principal risks faced by the 
Group, and the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control.
The Board considers the appropriateness of its 
accounting policies on an annual basis. The Board 
believes that its accounting policies, in particular 
in relation to income recognition and research and 
development, are appropriate and are advised on 
its Auditors on future changes to such accounting 
policies. In the coming financial year, the business 
will be preparing for the adoption of IFRS15. 
Financial results with comparisons to budget and 
forecast results are reported to the Board on a 
regular basis, together with a commercial report 
on operational issues. Significant variances from 
budget or strategy are discussed at Board meetings 
and actions set in place to address them.
The Board comprises three Non-Executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors. Richard 
Kellett-Clarke has been acting as Interim Chief 
Executive Officer since December 2017. After fifteen 
years’ service Peter Lilley has stepped down as 
Non-Executive Director. The Board wish to thank 
Peter for his tremendous dedication and service to 
the Group. His contribution throughout the years 
has supported substantial growth and expansion  
of operations across the entire Group portfolio.  
The Board wish Peter all the best for the future. 
Richard Kellett-Clarke, Interim CEO and Jane 
Mackie, CFO, form the Executive team. 
Board and committee meetings are scheduled in line 
with the financial calendar of the Group. The timing of 
meetings ensures the latest operating data is available 
for review and that appropriate time and focus can 
be given to matters under consideration. The Board 
met nine times throughout the year for principal Board 
meetings to discuss a formal schedule of business. 
The Group has a highly committed and experienced 
Board, which is supported by an Executive team, 
and is supported by qualified executive and senior 
management teams. 
Role of Chairman and Chief  
Executive Officer
The Code requires that there should be a clear 
division of responsibilities between the running of 
the Board and the executive responsible for the 
Group’s business, so as to ensure that no one 
person has unrestricted powers of decision.
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of 
the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting 
its agenda. Once strategic and financial objectives 
have been agreed by the Board, it is the CEO’s 
responsibility to ensure they are delivered upon. 
To facilitate this, the CEO regularly meets the 
executive management team (‘EMT’) which 
additionally comprises business division directors 
and senior members of the management team.  
The day to day operations of the Group are 
managed by the EMT.
Composition of and Appointments  
to the Board 
The Code requires that there should be a  
balance of Executive and Non-Executive  
Directors and when appointing new Directors  
to the Board, there should be a formal, rigorous 
and transparent procedure. 
For the year ended 31 October 2017
29
Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview The Board comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, 
the CEO, the CFO and three Non-Executive 
Directors. Short biographies of the Directors are 
given on pages 22 to 23.
The Board is satisfied with the balance between 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Board 
have considered and decided not to replace the 
outgoing Non-Executive Director Peter Lilley. 
The Board will continue to review this position in 
the coming years. The Board considers that its 
composition is appropriate in view of the size and 
requirements of the Group’s business and the need 
to maintain a practical balance between Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors.
Each member of the Board brings different skills 
and experience to the Board and the Board 
Committees. The Board is satisfied that there is 
sufficient diversity in the Board structure to bring 
a balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge to the Group.
The Code requires that the Board undertakes a 
formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its Committees and 
Directors. The Board continues to annually review 
its composition, to ensure there is adequate 
diversity to allow for its proper functioning and that 
the Board works effectively together as a unit. 
When a new appointment to the Board is made, 
consideration is given to the particular skills, 
knowledge and experience that a potential 
new member could add to the existing Board 
composition. A formal process is then undertaken, 
which may involve external recruitment agencies, 
with appropriate consideration being given, in 
regards to Executive appointments, to internal 
and external candidates. Before undertaking the 
appointment of a Non-Executive Director, the 
Chairman establishes that the prospective Director 
can give the time and commitment necessary to 
fulfil their duties, in terms of availability both to 
prepare for and attend meetings and to discuss 
matters at other times.
Board Committees
The Board has established two committees to deal 
with specific aspects of the Board’s responsibilities: 
the Audit Committee and the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee. The Report of the Audit 
Committee can be found on pages 33 to 34. The 
Audit Committee is chaired by Jeremy Millard 
and includes Laurence Vaughan and Barbara 
Moorhouse. Richard Kellett-Clarke was a member 
of the Audit Committee until December 2017 when 
he was appointed as Interim Chief Executive Officer. 
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
is chaired by Peter Lilley and includes Barbara 
Moorhouse, Laurence Vaughan and Jeremy Millard.  
The Committee has overall responsibility for 
making recommendations to the Board of the 
remuneration packages of the Executive Directors. 
The Committee’s key responsibilities include:
• making recommendations to the Board on any 
changes to service contracts;
• approving and overseeing any share related 
incentive schemes within the Group;
• ensuring that remuneration is in line with current 
industry practice; 
• ensuring remuneration is both appropriate to the 
level of responsibility and adequate to attract 
and/or retain Directors and staff of the calibre 
required by the Group;
• reviewing the size, composition and 
structure required of the Board and making 
recommendations to the Board with regard to 
any changes; 
• identifying and nominating, for approval by the 
Board, candidates to fill Board vacancies as  
they arise; 
• giving full consideration to succession planning 
for Directors; and
• vetting and approving recommendations from 
the executive directors for the appointment of 
senior executives. 
The Audit Committee met four times in the year and 
the Nominations and Remuneration Committee met 
three times.
Executive Risk Committee Reporting to 
the Board 
The Board is responsible for risk management 
and internal controls, supported and informed by 
the executive Risk Committee. The Board defines 
risk appetite and monitors the management of 
significant risks to ensure that the nature and 
extent of significant risks taken by the Group 
are aligned with overall goals and strategic 
objectives. The Risk Committee supports the 
Board in monitoring risk exposure through regular 
reviews and has been delegated responsibility for 
reviewing the effectiveness of risk management 
processes and controls. The Risk Register is 
presented to the Board for formal review on a bi-
annual basis and progress on matters is presented 
throughout the year through executive reporting. 
Re-election
Under the Code, Directors should offer themselves 
for re-election at regular intervals. Additionally, under 
the Group’s Articles of Association, at least one third 
of the Directors who are subject to retirement by 
rotation are required to retire and may be proposed 
for re-election at each Annual General Meeting. 
Corporate Governance Report continued
For the year ended 31 October 2017
30 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Governance > Corporate Governance Report
New Directors, who were not appointed at the 
previous Annual General Meeting, automatically 
retire at their first Annual General Meeting and if 
eligible, can seek re-appointment.
Two Directors will retire from office at the Group’s 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and stand for 
re-appointment.
Internal Control
The Board takes responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining reliable systems of control in all areas 
of operation. These systems of control, especially 
of financial control, can only provide reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The key matters relating to the system of internal 
control are set out below:
• Idox has established an operational management 
structure with clearly defined responsibilities and 
regular performance reviews;
• the Group operates a comprehensive system for 
reporting financial and non-financial information 
to the Board, including review of strategy plans 
and annual budgets;
• financial results are monitored against budgets, 
forecasts and other performance indicators with 
action dictated accordingly at each meeting;
• a structured approval process based on 
assessment of risk and value delivered; and
• sufficient resource is focused to maintain 
and develop internal control procedures and 
information systems, especially in financial 
management.
The Board considers that there have been no 
substantial weaknesses in internal financial 
controls that have resulted in any material losses, 
contingencies or uncertainties that need to be 
disclosed in the accounts. There have been 
weaknesses identified in internal non-financial 
controls which has resulted in the issues discussed 
in the Chief Executive’s review.  
These weaknesses have been and continue  
to be addressed by the Board.
The Group supports an internal audit function 
that performs annual audits on its management 
systems. This function is supported by a 
management review of the audit findings. 
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group, and that this 
process has been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. This process is regularly reviewed by 
the Board. 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report and Accounts and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law, the Directors have to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union. The Directors 
have elected to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with FRS101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”. 
Under Company law, the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs and profit or loss of the Group 
and Company for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs have been 
followed for the Group financial statements 
and whether UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed for the Parent Company financial 
statements, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Group and Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Group and Company’s transactions, 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that: 
• so far as each Director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Group’s 
Auditor is unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as Directors in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s 
Auditor is aware of that information.

Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Group’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in  
other jurisdictions. 
Information and Development
The Code requires that the Board should be 
supplied in a timely manner with information in a 
form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to 
discharge its duties.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all the 
Directors continually update their skills, knowledge 
and familiarity with the Group in order to fulfil their 
role on the Board and the Board’s Committees. 
Updates dealing with changes in legislation and 
regulation relevant to the Group’s business are 
provided to the Board by external advisors, the CFO 
and Legal Counsel.
All Directors have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to 
the Board for ensuring its procedures, are properly 
complied with and that the discussions and 
decisions are appropriately minuted. Directors may 
seek independent professional advice at the Group’s 
expense in furtherance of their duties as Directors.
Training on matters relevant to their role is available 
to all Board Directors. New Directors are provided 
with an induction in order to introduce them to the 
operations and management of the business.
Investor Relations
Idox is committed to open communication with 
all its shareholders. The Directors hold regular 
meetings with institutional shareholders to discuss 
and review the Group’s activities and objectives. 
Communication with private shareholders is 
principally through the Annual General Meeting, 
where participation is encouraged and where 
the Board is available to answer questions. Idox 
maintains up-to-date information on the Investor 
Relations section of its website www.idoxplc.com.
The CEO and CFO meet institutional investors 
immediately after publication of the annual and 
interim results, and together with the Chairman, 
meet with investors and on an ongoing basis as 
required. In 2017 there was extensive investor 
engagement with the Executive attending 58 
meetings with investors, a large part related to the 
placing of shares in order to acquire 6PM  
Holdings plc.
In respect of the annual and interim results, 
Directors also undertake consultation on certain 
matters with major shareholders from time to time. 
Through these consultations, the Group maintains a 
regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and 
analysts. Feedback is reported to the Board so that 
all Directors develop an understanding of the views 
of major shareholders. 
Trading updates and press releases are issued 
as appropriate and the Group’s brokers provide 
briefings on shareholder opinion and compile 
independent feedback from investor meetings. 
Information offered at the analysts’ meetings 
together with financial press releases are available 
on the Group’s website. The Annual General 
Meeting is used by the Directors to communicate 
with both institutional and private investors. 
Every shareholder has access to a full annual report 
each year end and an interim report at the half 
year end. Care is taken to ensure that any price 
sensitive information is released to all shareholders, 
institutional and private, at the  
same time in accordance with London Stock 
Exchange requirements. 
Idox strives to give a full, timely and realistic 
assessment of its business in all price-sensitive 
reports and presentations.

Report of the Audit Committee
Overview
This report details the activities of the Committee 
during the financial year ended 31 October 2017. 
The report sets out how the Committee has 
discharged its responsibilities in relation to internal 
control and risk management. 
Membership and Meetings
The Audit Committee is a committee of the 
Board and is comprised of five Non-Executive 
Directors: Laurence Vaughan, Peter Lilley, Barbara 
Moorhouse, Richard Kellett-Clarke and Jeremy 
Millard. Richard Kellett-Clarke joined the Committee 
when he took on the role of Non-Executive Director 
in November 2016. In December 2017 Richard 
stepped down from the Audit Committee when he 
became an Executive Director in his role as Interim 
CEO. The Audit Committee is chaired by Jeremy 
Millard. By virtue of his executive and current non-
executive responsibilities (full details of which are set 
out on page 30), the Board considers that Jeremy 
Millard has relevant and recent financial experience 
to discharge this role. 
The Audit Committee invites the Executive 
Directors, the Chairman, the Auditor and other 
senior managers to attend its meetings as 
appropriate. The Company Secretary is also the 
Secretary of the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is considered to have 
sufficient, recent and relevant financial  
experience to discharge its functions. The 
Committee carries out its duties for Idox plc,  
its major subsidiary undertakings and the Group  
as a whole as appropriate. 
During the period under review, the Audit 
Committee held four scheduled meetings. The 
Group’s Auditor, Grant Thornton UK LLP, has 
a standing invitation to attend meeting and 
representatives were in attendance at all of the four 
scheduled meetings. The Executive Directors, Jane 
Mackie and Andrew Riley were welcome to attend 
the meetings if they wish. They were in attendance 
at all meetings of the Audit Committee in the year. 
Roles and Responsibilities
The Audit Committee has a wide remit and its  
key functions include reviewing and advising the 
Board on:
• the integrity of the financial statements of the 
Group, including its annual and interim reports, 
preliminary results’ announcements and any 
other formal announcement relating to its 
financial performance, reviewing significant 
financial reporting issues and judgements which 
they contain; 
• the appointment and remuneration of the 
Auditor and their effectiveness in line with the 
requirements of the Code;
• the nature and extent of non-audit services 
provided by the Auditor to ensure that their 
independence and objectivity are maintained;
• changes to accounting policies and procedures;
• decisions of judgement affecting financial 
reporting, compliance with accounting standards 
and with the Companies Act 2006;
• internal control and risk management processes, 
including principal risks and internal control 
findings highlighted by management or internal 
and external audit; 
• the content of the Auditor’s transparency report, 
concerning Auditor independence in providing 
both audit and non-audit services;
• the scope, performance and effectiveness of 
internal audit and other internal control functions 
and the Auditor’s assessment thereon; and
• the Group’s procedures for responding to any 
allegations made by whistleblowers.
The Audit Committee considers and reviews non-
audit services provided by the Auditor, and this is 
tabled bi-annually at Board for discussion. 
The Audit Committee reports to the Board on 
the effectiveness of the Auditor and receives 
information from the Executive team in this regard. 
The Audit Committee and Board also consider 
the appointment of the Auditor annually prior to 
recommending the appointment of the Auditor at 
the Idox Annual General Meeting. 
Committee Activities in the Financial 
Year Ending 2017
The Committee met four times during the financial 
year ended 31 October 2017. In addition to standing 
items on the agenda, the Committee:
• Received and considered, as part of the review 
of interim and annual financial statements, 
reports from the Auditor in respect of the 
Auditor’s review of the interim results, the audit 
plan for the year and the results of the annual 
audit. These reports included the scope of the 
interim review and annual audit, the approach 
to be adopted by the Auditor to address and 
conclude upon key estimates and other key audit 
areas, the basis on which the Auditor assesses 
materiality, the terms of engagement for the 
Auditor and an on-going assessment of the 
impact of future accounting developments for 
the Group;
For the year ended 31 October 2017
33
Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview Report of the Audit Committee continued
• Considered the Annual Report and Accounts 
in the context of being fair, balanced and 
understandable;
• Considered the effectiveness and independence 
of the external audit;
• Considered and agreed the annual internal audit 
plan and reviewed reports of the work done by 
the internal auditors in respect of those plans;
• Considered the review of business reporting 
segments in line with the guidance from 
our Auditors in respect of identifiable cash 
generating units. 
Due to the issues that arose in relation to the audit 
for the year ended 31 October 2017, as outlined in 
the Strategic Report, the Audit Committee was also 
involved in liaising with the Auditor throughout the 
audit process in particular to:
• Monitor key issues;
• Ensure adherence to reporting deadlines;
• Review the enhanced audit report; and
• Review 6PM revenue recognition. The 
Committee reviewed technical papers presented 
internally in relation to 6PM licence revenue and 
the initial conclusion was that the treatment of 
6PM licence revenue recognition at a point in 
time was correct. Following further technical 
debate and lengthy discussions with the Auditor, 
the Committee agreed to reflect the Auditor’s 
interpretation of revenue recognition on these 
licences and the revenue was recognised over 
time rather than at a point in time. 
Independence and Objectivity of  
the Auditor
The Committee continues to monitor the work of the 
Auditor to ensure that the Auditor’s objectivity and 
independence is not compromised by it undertaking 
inappropriate non-audit work. The current Auditor, 
Grant Thornton, has been the Auditor since 2000. 
Auditor objectivity was safeguarded by the 
Committee considering several factors: 
• the change in the audit team including a new 
audit partner in the year ended 31 October 2016;
• an appraisal of the standing and experience of 
the audit partner; and
• the nature and level of services provided by 
the Auditor and confirmation from the Auditor 
that they have complied with relevant UK 
independence standards and fully considered 
any threats and safeguards in the performance 
of non-audit work.
Non-audit Fees
The Committee approves all non-audit work 
commissioned from the external auditors. During 
the year the fees paid to the Auditor were £270,000 
(2016: £130,000) for Group and subsidiary audit 
services, £129,000 (2016: £34,000) in relation the 
acquisition of 6PM Holdings plc, £33,000 (2016: 
£31,000) for interim audit services, and £34,000 
(2016: £179,000) for non-audit services.
The majority of the other non-audit services 
provided by the Auditor were in respect of due 
diligence work carried out on acquisitions and 
advising on corporate finance arrangements.  
The Committee concluded that it was in the 
interests of the Group to use the Auditor for this 
work as they were considered to be best placed  
to provide these services.
Other Matters
The Committee is authorised to seek any 
information it requires from any Group employee 
in order to perform its duties. The Committee can 
obtain, at the Group’s expense, outside legal or 
other professional advice on any matters within its 
terms of reference.
The Committee may call any member of staff to be 
questioned at a meeting of the Committee as and 
when required.
Reporting Responsibilities
The Committee makes whatever recommendations 
to the Board it deems appropriate on any area 
within its remit where action or improvement  
is required. 
The Committee ensures that it gives due 
consideration to laws and regulations, the 
provisions of the Combined Code, the requirements 
of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules, 
Prospectus and Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
and any other applicable rules as appropriate. The 
Committee also and oversees any investigation of 
activities which are within its terms of reference. 
The Audit Committee operates within agreed  
terms of reference; these can be found on the 
Group’s website.

For the year ended 31 October 2017
34 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Qualified Opinion
Our opinion on the group financial statements is modified
We have audited the group financial statements of Idox Plc for the year ended 31 October 2017, which comprise the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matters described in the Basis for qualified opinion section of our report, 
the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 October 2017 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
With respect to revenue and deferred income within the sub-group headed by 6PM Holdings plc, having balances of 
£7.6 million and £4.3 million respectively, the audit evidence available to us was limited because 6PM Holdings plc’s group, 
which was acquired in February 2017, had a history of poor record keeping until it was fully integrated into the Idox plc Group 
in July 2017 and the record keeping issues addressed. Owing to the nature of the company’s records, we were unable to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding these elements of revenue and deferred income by using other audit 
procedures. In addition, with respect to consolidated revenues of £0.4 million and consolidated net liabilities of £0.2 million in 
three of 6PM Holdings plc’s subsidiaries, the audit evidence available to us was also limited because the accounting records 
of these three subsidiaries was poor. Owing to the nature of the company’s records, we were unable to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence regarding these matters by using other audit procedures. As a result of the poor record keeping 
and poor accounting records, we were unable to determine whether any adjustments might have been found necessary in 
respect of these two matters.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the group 
financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements  
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed 
entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the  
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion.
Who we are Reporting to
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions Relating to Going Concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the group financial statements is not 
appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from 
the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

• Overall materiality: £646,000, which represents approximately 3.5% of the group’s earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
• Key audit matters were identified as revenue recognition, carrying value of goodwill, business combinations - acquisitions, 
valuation of capitalised development expenditure, deferred income completeness, trade receivable existence and accrued 
income existence
• We performed full scope audit procedures on the financial statements of Idox plc and on the financial information of 
Idox Software Limited, McLaren Software Limited, McLaren Software Inc and 6pPM Holdings plc. This covered 85% of 
revenue and 91% of EBITDA for the year.
 
 
Key audit matters
The graph below depicts the audit risks identified and their relative significance based on the extent of the financial statement 
impact and the extent of management judgement. 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the group financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the group financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.

Revenue recognition
Revenue recognised during the year ended 31 
October 2017 is £88.9 million (31 October 2016: 
£76.7 million). Revenue is derived from a number 
of revenue streams, and key streams include 
public sector software, engineering information 
management, grants and digital. Each stream has 
its own revenue recognition policies based on the 
nature of the revenue and underlying contractual 
arrangements. Management judgement is required 
around the degree to which revenue has been 
earned as at the year-end date.
Large contracts are typically bundled, 
and often include hardware, software and 
maintenance revenues.
Revenue is a key number for users of the annual 
accounts, and is a key focus for management  
as they continue to grow the business  
through a combination of organic growth  
and strategic acquisitions.
As part of year-end accounting processes, 
management identified a number of revenue items 
that did not meet the criteria for recognition in the 
current year, and were thus removed from the final 
revenue figure. The value of the adjustment was 
£2.7 million. An additional £1.0 million adjustment 
was noted in relation to the accounting for licence 
revenue in 6PM Holdings PLC. Due to these issues 
noted, we revised our risk profile and approach to 
revenue testing.
In light of the multiple revenue streams, complexity 
of accounting and crucial nature of this number 
to stakeholders, we have identified revenue 
recognition as a significant risk, which was  
one of the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• Assessing the revenue recognition policies applied by  
the group;
• Performing detailed sample testing of the population of invoices for 
the first 11 months back to contractual documentation, and ensuring 
that the component income types within were checked to ensure 
that the correct specific recognition policy had been applied for each 
unbundled element where appropriate;
• Performing enhanced detailed sample testing on October 2017 
revenues which have been identified as having a greater level of risk 
due to the significance of revenue recognised at this stage in the year 
and the impact against key City expected metrics. We traced back 
to contractual documentation, and ensuring that the component 
income types within were checked to ensure that the correct specific 
recognition policy had been applied for each unbundled element 
where appropriate; 
• Assessing the split of contracts to challenge and gain sufficient 
comfort around the level of software being recognised immediately 
under bundled contracts; and
• Agreeing a sample of contracts to direct customer confirmation.
Following revenue recognition issues identified by management, we 
performed enhanced testing around the first 11 months of the year to 
bring in line with the level of work performed on October revenue as set 
out above.
The group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition is shown in note 1 
and related disclosures are included in note 2. 
Key observations
We gained sufficient audit evidence to support the majority of revenue 
through our enhanced procedures.
As noted above, we encountered a limitation of audit scope in trying to 
gain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in respect of the revenue and 
deferred income balances within 6PM Holdings PLC.

Carrying value of goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill is £73.2 million  
at 31 October 2017 (31 October 2016: £52.0 
million), with the increase primarily driven by the 
acquisition of 6PM Holdings plc during the year.  
An impairment of £2.7 million was recognised 
against the 6PM acquisition in the year.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment 
under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
An impairment review must be carried out for 
each cash-generating unit (‘CGU’), with a CGU 
being the smallest group of assets that includes 
the asset being tested for impairment. The 
balance is assessed by management with key 
judgements being made around discount rate, 
growth rate and future cash flows. Given the level 
of management judgement involved, and that there 
are comparatively low levels of headroom in certain 
CGUs, we identified the carrying value of goodwill 
as a significant risk, which was one of the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• Challenge of cash generating units and the lowest level that 
impairment reviews could be carried out at;
• Consideration of the cash flow projections for each CGU as prepared 
by management (based on 2018 budget), critically assessing the 
inherent judgements and assumptions, comparing to current year 
performance and gaining support for key movements year on year;
• The Compliance and Grants CGUs were merged during the year 
to form Content. We reviewed the fact pattern and challenged 
this assessment on the individual units to ensure that the treatment is 
appropriate and in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 
36 ‘Impairment of Assets’; 
• Assessing the outcome of management’s previous accounting estimates 
and considering the impact on management’s ability to make accounting 
estimates for the current year; and
• Performing sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions and reviewing 
the headroom when flexing key assumptions. 
The group’s accounting policy on carrying value of goodwill is shown in 
note 1 and related disclosures are included in note 11.
Key observations
Our audit work indicates that the carrying value of goodwill is fairly stated.
Business combinations – acquisitions
The 6PM Holdings plc group, which is based in 
Malta, was acquired during the year at a cost of 
£35m. This was funded by a combination of cash 
and share placing to fund the acquisition, seeing 
£20.5m (before expenses) raised through the issue 
of new share capital.
The entire share capital of Halarose Ltd was 
acquired in August 2017 for a cost of £5m. This 
comprised £3.5m in cash along with a share 
offering of £1.5m.
Given the subjectivity around assumptions used 
as part of the associated fair value exercise, there 
is a risk that such assets are incorrectly measured. 
We are aware that external valuation specialists 
have been used to perform the valuations of each 
acquisition. We therefore identified acquisition 
accounting as a significant risk, which was one 
of the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• Considering the terms of the sale and purchase agreement and 
public offer documentation respectively to ensure that the terms of the 
acquisitions have been appropriately accounted for within the financial 
statements by management;
• Appraising the fair value adjustments relating to the acquisition of 6PM 
Holdings plc;
• Following up on previous acquisition accounting and audit of any 
adjustments noted in the period;
• Analysing management’s calculations for goodwill and other intangible 
assets identified from acquisitions, along with other fair value 
adjustments, including evaluating the forecasts used to complete these 
calculations. This involved input by our specialist Valuations Team to 
ensure the calculations comply with the requirements set out in IFRS 3

• Challenging management’s rationale and calculations behind the fair 
values of any contingent consideration, including the assessment of 
the range of possible outcomes and the probability of each of these.
The group’s accounting policy on acquisition accounting is shown in note 1 
and related disclosures are included in note 25. 
Key observations
We gained sufficient evidence to be satisfied that both acquisitions in 
the year were correctly accounted for and intangibles recognised the 
methods used were appropriate.
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
to the Members of Idox plc
38 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Key Audit Matters How the matter was addressed in the audit
Valuation of capitalised development expenditure
The value of capitalised development expenditure 
at 31 October 2017 is £9.1 million (31 October 
2016 £5.0 million), with the increase primarily 
driven by the acquisition of 6PM and a focus on 
more accurately capturing all such costs. There  
are specified criteria that must be met under IAS 
38 ‘Intangible assets’ to record an asset. 
Management have adjusted their approach to 
development expenditure, with the amortisation 
period moving from a fixed 5-year period across  
all projects to an assessment of each project over 
its useful life. 
Management models require the application of 
significant judgements and assumptions to be 
made in deriving the underlying model.
In light of these complexities, we have identified 
valuation of capitalised development expenditure 
as a significant risk, which was one of the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• Obtaining and reviewing management models relating to projects  
held on balance sheet;
• Challenging all key inputs, assumptions and judgements  
(including changes to judgements) made in the process of  
creating management models;
• Discussing development expenditure with the development team, 
challenging the carrying value and assessing the useful life of key 
projects based on historical experience and future projected cash 
flows; 
• Assessing the outcome of management’s previous accounting 
estimates, and considering the impact on management’s ability to  
make accounting estimates for the current year; and
• Agreeing a sample of employee costs to source documentation to 
support their capitalisation.
The group’s accounting policy on capitalised development expenditure  
is shown in note 1 and related disclosures are included in note 11. 
Key observations
We gained sufficient audit evidence relating to the valuation of capitalised 
development expenditure.
Deferred income completeness
Deferred income is allocated on review of invoices 
raised for services not yet provided.
The risk is that deferred income is not being 
recognised fully in line with the provision of 
services, which is heightened due to the 
management policy of not reviewing any sales 
invoice totalling less than £10,000.
The value of deferred income at 31 October 2017 
is £19.8m million (31 October 2016 £18.3 million), 
with the movement largely driven by the addition  
of 6PM Holdings PLC to the group in year.
We therefore identified deferred income 
completeness as a significant risk, which was  
one of the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• As part of our statistical sample of revenue, we gathered sufficient 
evidence to determine the accuracy of deferred income apportioned  
for those items selected; 
• Stratified our total population to ensure that we get sufficient, appropriate 
evidence in relation to invoiced sums below £10,000, where there is a 
heightened risk and testing a sample of these items; and 
• Substantive analytical procedures were carried out to identify any 
significant variances in deferred income across the group that are  
not in line with our expectation.
• As noted above, we were unable to gain sufficient evidence to prove 
completeness of deferred income in 6PM Holdings plc and recognised 
a limitation of scope in this area.
The group’s accounting policy on deferred income is shown in note 1 
and related disclosures are included in note 18. 
Key observations
We gained sufficient audit evidence relating to the completeness of 
deferred income in all entities except 6PM Holdings plc as referred to in 
the limitation of scope above.

Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview
Financial Statements > Independent Auditor’s Report Key Audit Matters How the matter was addressed in the audit
Trade receivable existence
As a result of revenue recognition issues noted by 
management, we revisited our risk assessment 
during our year end audit work. We thus elevated 
this item to be a significant audit risk and a key 
audit matter.
The value of trade receivables at 31 October 2017 
is £18.8 million (31 October 2016 £18.3 million), 
broadly in line with the October 2016 position.
Management identified some instances when 
invoices were raised earlier than they were due, 
and we therefore identified the requirement to 
increase our risk profile in this area We therefore 
identified trade receivable existence as a significant 
risk, which was one of the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• Agreeing an extended sample of receivables to post year end payments 
and underlying contractual documentation to confirm they had been 
received in accordance with the contract; and
• Consideration of debtor ageing and the status of any ongoing 
discussions with customers to identify any potential issues around  
early invoicing.
The group’s accounting policy on trade receivables is shown in note 1 and 
related disclosures are included in note 15.
Key observations
We gained sufficient audit evidence to conclude relating to the existence  
of trade receivables.
Accrued income existence
As a result of revenue recognition issues noted by 
management, we revisited our risk assessment 
during our year end audit work. We thus elevated 
this item to be a significant audit risk and a key 
audit matter.
The value of accrued income at 31 October 2017 is 
£23.0 million (31 October 2016 £18.8 million), with 
the increase primarily driven by revenue growth.
Management identified some instances where the 
level of accrued income recognised was in excess 
of what was contractually earned, and we therefore 
identified the requirement to increase our risk 
profile in this area We therefore identified accrued 
income existence as a significant risk, which was 
one of the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• Performing enhanced and extended sample testing of the population of 
accrued income balances to supporting documentation to gain comfort 
around the existence of accrued income; and
• Created expectations for accrued income for sample items and 
ensured recognition was in line with this.
The group’s accounting policy on accrued income is shown in note 1. 
Key observations
We gained sufficient audit evidence from our procedures relating to the 
existence of accrued income at year end.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. 
We determined materiality for the audit of the group financial statements as a whole to be £786,000 at the planning stage, which 
was 3.5% of the group’s EBITDA. This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because it is the key performance measure 
applied by users of the financial statements. 
Following the reductions in EBITDA notified to the market, we revised our materiality for the audit of the group financial statements 
as a whole to £646,000 to reflect the adjustments in EBITDA as a result of the adjustments identified by management. 
Materiality for the current year is lower than the level that we determined for the year ended 31 October 2016 to reflect the 
reduction in EBITDA performance despite the strategic acquisitions.
We use a different level of materiality, performance materiality, to drive the extent of our testing and this was set at 75% of 
financial statement materiality for the audit of the group financial statements at the planning stage. Following the issues identified 
by management relating to revenue recognition, we revised our performance materiality level for revenue recognition, accrued 
income existence, trade receivable existence and valuation of capitalised development expenditure testing to 40% to reflect the 
revised risk profile around these balances.

40 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 The graph below illustrates how performance materiality interacts with our overall materiality and the tolerance for potential

 Tolerance for potential uncorrected misstatements
 P e r f or ma n c e ma t e r ia l it y
We also determine a lower level of specific materiality for Directors’ remuneration, related party transactions and 
auditor’s remuneration.
We determined the threshold at which we will communicate misstatements to the audit committee to be £32,300. In addition,  
we communicate misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the group’s business, its environment 
and risk profile and in particular included:
• evaluation by the group audit team of identified components to assess the significance of that component and to  
determine the planned audit response based on a measure of materiality. We considered each component’s significance 
as a percentage of the group’s total assets, revenues and EBITDA or significance based on qualitative factors, such as 
concerns over specific components; 
• interim visit, evaluation the group’s internal controls environment including its IT systems and controls; 
• components were identified as significant based on a detailed consideration of each component, quantitative financial 
considerations, risks identified at the component level and other qualitative factors; 
Audit of financial information Analytical procedures

• there were initially no significant changes in scope from the prior year audit beyond the additional procedures required 
relating to the acquisition of 6PM Holdings plc as noted above. Due to matters identified by management relating to revenue 
recognition, we reduced our performance materiality during the audit process;
• analytical procedures were performed over remaining non-significant components;
• in line with the central Idox plc finance function, all procedures were performed by the group engagement team, and therefore 
no group instructions or component visits were deemed necessary; and
• the graphs overleaf set out the total percentage coverage of full-scope audit procedures of revenue, accrued income, 
capitalised development expenditure and trade receivable existence below. We gained 100% full scope coverage over the 
carrying value of goodwill and business combinations - acquisitions key audit matters.

Independent Auditor’s Report continued
to the Members of Idox plc
42 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Matters on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the Directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In respect solely of the limitation on our work relating to revenue and deferred income, and poor record keeping, described above:
• we have not obtained all the information and explanations that we considered necessary for the purpose of our audit. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made. 
Responsibilities of Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 31, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal 
control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of group financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the group financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the group financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the group financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these group 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Idox plc for the year ended 31 October 2017. That 
report includes details of the parent company key audit matters; how we applied the concept of materiality in planning and 
performing our audit; and an overview of the scope of our audit.

General information
Idox plc is a leading supplier of software and services for the management of local government and other organisations. The 
Company is a public limited company which is listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and 
domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 2nd Floor, 1310 Waterside, Arlington Business Park, Theale, Reading, 
RG7 4SA. The registered number of the Company is 03984070.
The financial statements are prepared in pound sterling.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain 
financial assets and liabilities, being derivatives at fair value through profit or loss.
As set out on page 26 of the Directors’ Report, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing 
standards have been published that are mandatory for forthcoming financial periods, but which the Group has not adopted early. 
These are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ – effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018
• IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance considerations – effective for periods commencing on or 
after 1 January 2018 
The following standards have the potential have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements:
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’- effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. This standard 
will become effective for the Group on 1 November 2018. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively 
to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially 
applying the guidance recognised at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). IFRS 15 requires 
the disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated into categories that depict how the nature, amount, 
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The Group is currently performing a 
detailed analysis of the impact of IFRS 15 on all aspects of its business. To this date, the review has identified a number of 
areas in which adjustments may be required to revenue recognition and in the related procedures and processes. The areas 
which are likely to be affected are in relation to recognition of consultancy revenue and our ‘no win – no fee’ grant application 
business. In the year ended 31 October 2017, consultancy revenue was approximately £26m and ‘no win-no fee’ revenue was 
approximately £3m. 
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 presents new requirements for 
the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. The standard provides that lessees will be required to 
recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. 
The standard was issued in January 2016 and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 but is 
yet to be endorsed by the EU. The Directors have not yet assessed the impact that this standard will have on the Group’s net 
asset position and are therefore not in a position to make a reliable estimate of the impact this revised standard will have on 
the Group’s accounting policies. The standard is expected to be applicable to the Group for the period beginning 1 November 
2019. Please refer to note 26 for the Group’s current operating lease commitments, which will be disclosed as a balance sheet 
liability under IFRS 16 when this becomes effective. 
Adoption of new and revised standards
• There were no additional standards, amendments and interpretations that had a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements during the year. The following standards, amendments and interpretations were effective in the year but had no 
material impact on the Group’s financial statements:
• Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Classification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
• Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
• Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment Entities
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle

Restatement of comparative figures
In the previous period, the Group was organised into five main operating segments. During the year ended 31 October 2017, the 
Grants and Compliance divisions were merged into a new Content division. Following the acquisition of 6PM, a new operating 
segment called Health was established. As at 31 October 2017, the Group is therefore organised into five operating segments. 
The segmental analysis for the comparative period to 31 October 2016 have been restated to show results for the new five 
business segments. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, by 
definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The Group has evaluated the estimates and assumptions that have been made 
in relation to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in these financial statements. The estimates and assumptions which 
have the most significant impact on the financial statements which are recognised in the financial statements are as follows:
(i) Intangible assets
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition. The 
determination of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount 
of future incremental cash flows generated by the assets and selection of an appropriate cost of capital. Management estimate 
the expected useful lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on those assets accordingly. In determining the useful 
economic life of the intangible software assets, management have given consideration to the length of time that its own software 
is typically used within its market. Competitor products are also reviewed, in conjunction with the length of time they had also 
been in use. These reviews are conducted with assistance from an independent intellectual property consulting firm who have a 
wealth of experience in valuing intangible assets generated from acquisitions. 
Consideration was also given as to the likelihood that a new competitor could enter the market with a new product. This was 
considered unlikely due to the up-front capital investment which would be required to develop a new product, the requirement 
for reference sites to demonstrate the product, and the long-life cycles which products have in the market. For details on the 
estimates made in relation to intangible assets, see note 11.
(ii) Development costs
The Group reviews half yearly whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been met. This is necessary as 
the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems at the time of 
recognition. Judgements are based on the information available at each bi-annual review. In addition, all internal activities related 
to the research and development of new software products are continuously monitored by the Directors. 
During the year ended 31 October 2017, management conducted a comprehensive review of all capitalised development and 
have made a change to the standard policy of amortising all assets over a 5 year straight line period. Management have estimated 
that a range of 1 to 5 years is more appropriate depending on the future revenue projected for each individual asset. This review 
has led to accelerated amortisation on a small number of assets during the year. All new capitalised development is reviewed on 
an individual project basis and management will select the most appropriate rate of amortisation for each asset. 
See note 11 for further information.
(iii) Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amount is 
determined based upon value-in-use and net realisable value calculations. The value-in-use method requires the estimation of 
future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows. Pre-tax 
discount rates have been applied and are based on WACC calculations. See note 11 for further commentary.
During the year ended 31 October 2017, management combined the Grants and Compliance divisions into one ‘Content’ 
division, which has been used as a CGU in the impairment calculations. These divisions were combined following a review by 
management where it was identified that the operations and strategy of these teams were in alignment. A restructuring of legal 
entities took place and a new divisional director was appointed to manage this combined operating segment, and financial 
information is now reported internally on the Content division. 
50 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 (iv) Revenue recognition
Management assesses both legal paperwork and commercial substance of transactions to determine the appropriate revenue 
recognition treatment. This review could involve internal chartered accountants, internal legal staff, operational staff and external 
professional advice where appropriate. Management may exercise judgements over various elements of a contract, for example:
• whether there are ongoing obligations relating to software licences which would require the revenue to be recognised over time 
rather than at a point in time
• whether performance obligations are separable or bundled
• whether it is appropriate to recognise revenue on certain contracts such as service agreements, prior to an invoice being 
raised, where work has been completed and there is a high degree of certainty of the contract being completed and the 
invoice raised and cash received.
There was considerable discussion and review surrounding the correct revenue recognition on certain Health contracts during 
the period. Management assessed legal paperwork and commercial substance of these transactions in line with accounting 
standards and the judgement made was that revenue on these contracts should be recognised over time rather than at a point  
in time as the software and maintenance elements of the contracts could not be separated. 
See paragraph headed ‘Revenue’ below for more detail on how the Group accounts for revenue. 
(v) Contingent consideration
The contingent consideration provision is the maximum undiscounted amount which will be paid, which represents fair value. 
Where an acquisition involves a potential payment of contingent consideration the estimate of any such payment is based on its 
fair value. To estimate the fair value an assessment is made as to the amount of contingent consideration which is likely to be paid 
having regard to the criteria on which any sum due will be calculated. 
(vi) Deferred tax
The Group has tax losses available to offset future taxable profits. In estimating the amount of deferred tax to be recognised as an 
asset the Group estimates the future profitability of the relevant business unit.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 October each 
year. Under IFRS10, control exists when an investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its powers over the investee. As each of the subsidiaries are 100% 
wholly owned, the Group has full control over each of its investees.
All inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
For business combinations occurring since 1 November 2009, the requirements of IFRS 3R have been applied. The consideration 
transferred by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of assets 
transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group, which includes the fair value of any asset or liability 
arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. For all acquisitions, the Group will 
perform a fair value review of all property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to align accounting policies with the Group. 
Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts receivable in respect of goods and services provided during the year, stated net of value added 
tax. Where work has been done, but a billing milestone has not been reached, the income has been accrued and included in 
amounts recoverable within trade and other receivables. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration. The Group derives its revenue streams from software solutions 
and information solutions. 
Software licence revenue is recognised when the licence is despatched to the customer and there are no ongoing obligations 
associated with the licence once delivered. Where the licence is bespoke, revenue is recognised when the licence is delivered 
and the customer has accepted the licence as fully functional.
Software consultancy revenue is recognised on a stage of completion basis. Stage of completion is determined by time spent 
by service delivery consultants or by reference to the project milestones either included in the contract itself or included within a 
separate detailed project delivery plan. 
Revenue relating to digital services, including search engine optimisation, ecommerce and digital advertising, is recognised at the 
time of service delivery.

Revenue continued
Revenue relating to goods delivered as part of software solutions provided is only recognised once the goods have been received 
by the customer.
Revenue relating to goods delivered for elections is recognised when the goods have been received by the customer. 
Consultancy revenue for elections is recognised on a stage of completion basis. 
The revenues for maintenance and hosted managed service contracts are spread evenly over the life of the agreement, which is 
typically one year. 
Revenue from software-as-a-service (‘SaaS”) contracts, or revenue where there are ongoing obligations associated with a 
software licence, is recognised evenly over the life of the agreement. 
Revenue derived from information solutions content is recognised over the life of the subscription, which is typically one year. 
Revenue from projects is recognised over the life of the project in accordance with the stage of completion which is determined 
by reference to the project delivery plan.
Revenue relating to grant applications is recognised on a ‘no win-no fee’ basis. Revenue is only recognised when confirmation 
that the grant application has been successful is received. 
Revenue relating to hardware is recognised when the hardware is despatched to the customer.
Contract revenue
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long-term contract is recognised only when the outcome of the 
contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Management make a judgement on the fair value of the work completed 
to enable revenue on long term contracts to be recognised in the correct periods. Stage of completion is determined based on 
management’s best estimate of effort expended and progress against project plans at the year end. Provision is made for any 
losses as they are foreseen. 
The contracts for software solutions often contain multiple elements such as software, consultancy and maintenance. 
Management make appropriate judgements and estimates in relation to the fair value of each of these elements in accordance 
with IAS 18.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the steering committee, which for the year ended 31 October 
2017 comprised the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Operating Officer.
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the sum of a) fair 
value of consideration transferred, b) the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and c) acquisition-
date fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets. If the 
fair values of the identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated above, the excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) is 
recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets 
or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Unallocated goodwill on acquisitions relates mainly to workforce 
valuation, synergies and economies of scale obtained on combining acquisitions with existing operations.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to the date of transition to IFRS remains in reserves. There is no re-instatement of goodwill 
that was amortised prior to transition to IFRS. Goodwill previously written off to reserves is not written back to profit or loss on 
subsequent disposal.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-
line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis. Amortisation commences when the asset is 
available for use. The residual values of intangible assets are assumed to be zero.
52 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 (i) Research and development
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is 
incurred. Development costs incurred are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
• the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there is a market 
for the output from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used in 
generating such benefits;
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset, and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed in profit or loss as incurred. The cost of an internally 
generated intangible asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the asset to be 
capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Amortisation commences upon completion of the asset, and is 
shown separately on the statement of comprehensive income.
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have 
been met. This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future 
technical problems at the time of recognition. Judgements are based on the information available at each balance sheet date. In 
addition, all internal activities related to the research and development of new software products are continuously monitored by 
the Directors.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over a period of up to 5 years.
(ii) Customer relationships
Customer relationships represent the purchase price of customer lists and contractual relationships purchased on the acquisition 
of CAPS Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited, J4B Software and Publishing Limited, Strand Electoral Management Services 
Limited, Grantfinder Limited, McLaren Software Limited, Lalpac Limited, Interactive Dialogues NV, Opt 2 Vote Limited, Currency 
Connect Holding BV, FMx Limited, Artesys International SA, CTSpace Group, Digital Spirit GmbH, Cloud Amber Limited, Reading 
Room Limited, Open Objects Software Limited, Halarose Holdings Limited and 6PM Holdings plc. These relationships are carried 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line 
method over a period of 20, 10 and 5 years. 
(iii) Trade names
Trade names represent the named intangible asset recognised on the acquisition of CAPS Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited, 
J4B Software and Publishing Limited, Strand Electoral Management Services Limited, Grantfinder Limited, McLaren Software

Limited, Rippleffect Studio Limited, 6PM Holdings plc and Halarose Holdings Limited. These trade names are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over a 
period of between 5 and 20 years. 
(iv) Software
Software represents the UNI-form, ACOLAID, Enterprise Engineer, CAFM Explorer, electoral and licensing software purchased on 
the acquisition of CAPS Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited, McLaren Software Limited,

(v) Database
Database represents the grant information database purchased on the acquisition of J4B Software & Publishing Limited and 
Grantfinder Limited. The database is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over a period of 5 years.
(vi) Order backlog
Order backlog includes the managed service contracts and subscription deferred revenue purchased on the acquisition of  
11 land and property information solution contracts and Grantfinder Limited. Amortisation on the managed service deferred 
revenue is calculated based on the weighting and length of each contract purchased. Subscription deferred revenue is  
calculated using the straight-line method over a period of 5 years.
Order backlog includes two managed services contracts acquired from Miria Systems Inc. Amortisation on the managed service 
deferred revenue is calculated using the straight-line method over a period of 5 years.
Upon the acquisition of Halarose Holding Limited, the Group acquired deferred revenue which is being amortised using the 
straight-line method over a period of 3 years. 
Impairment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash 
flows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating 
unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business 
combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors the related cash flows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill, other intangible assets with an indefinite useful 
life, and those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or 
cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value 
in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which 
goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged 
pro rata to the other assets in the cash generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for 
indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement using the following rates and bases so as to write off the cost or valuation of 
items of property, plant and equipment over their expected useful lives. The rates that are generally applicable are:
Computer hardware  25%, 50% and 100% straight line 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 25% straight line 
Library books and journals  33 1/3% and 100% straight line
Useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed annually.
Investment property
The investment property was acquired upon the purchase of 6PM Holdings plc and was recorded initially at cost and then using 
the fair value method. The investment property was revalued annually with resulting gains and losses recognised in the income 
statement, and the property was included in the balance sheet at its fair value. 
54 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Employee benefits
Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions paid to private pension plans of certain employees are charged to the income statement in the period in which they 
become payable. Contributions paid to the Group personal pension plans of employees are charged to the income statement in 
the period in which they become payable.
Share-based payment transactions
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values.  
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly  
by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and  
excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account with a 
corresponding credit to the share option reserve.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on 
the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any 
indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to 
vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options 
that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to reserves. In some 
circumstances upon exercise of share options, the right to shares are waived and the proceeds are settled in cash.
Reserves
Equity comprises the following:
• “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares,  
net of expenses of the share issue.
• “Capital redemption reserve” represents when the entire deferred ordinary share capital was bought in exchange for one 
ordinary 1p share. 
• “Other reserves” arose as a result of:
 –  a Group reconstruction that occurred on 17 November 2000. This represents the issued share capital and share premium 
account in the Company’s subsidiary undertaking, Idox Software Limited, and;
 – Share premium arising on consideration shares issued on the acquisition of 6PM Holdings plc and Halarose Holdings Limited.
• “Share options reserve” represents shares to be issued on potential exercise of those share options that have been accounted 
for under “IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments”.
• “ESOP trust” represents share capital purchased to satisfy the obligation of the employee share scheme. Purchased shares 
are classified within the ESOP trust reserve and the cost of shares purchased are presented as a deduction from total equity.
• “Retained earnings” represents retained profits.
• “Treasury reserve” represents shares repurchased by the Company to be held for redistribution as share options. The cost of 
treasury shares is debited to the Treasury reserve.
• “Foreign currency translation reserve” represents exchange gains and losses on retranslation of foreign operations. 
• “Non-controlling interest” represents retained profits attributable to Non-controlling interests.

Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is charged to profit or loss except where it 
relates to tax on items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is charged to equity or 
other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year. 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on 
the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided 
on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business 
combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is 
not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not 
occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income credits to the Group 
are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided 
they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in profit or loss, except where they 
relate to items that are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity in which case the related deferred 
tax is also charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity.
Research and development tax credits
The UK tax regime permits additional tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred on research and development. The Research 
and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) Scheme has been adopted, which permits a tax credit of 11% of qualifying 
expenditure for companies classified as large. The Idox Group is considered large for research and development tax credit 
purposes owing to a headcount of over 500.
The tax credit is treated as a reconciling item within the taxation line of the income statement.
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. All leases 
held by the Group are operating in nature. Amounts paid under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Dividend distributions
Interim dividends in respect of equity shares are recognised in the financial statements in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends in respect of equity shares are recognised in the financial statements in the period that the dividends are 
formally approved.
Foreign currency translation
The functional and presentation currency of Idox plc and its United Kingdom subsidiaries is the pound sterling (£). Transactions in 
foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. All differences are taken to profit or loss.
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-sterling functional currency subsidiaries, are translated 
into pound sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results of non-sterling functional currency 
subsidiaries are translated into pound sterling using average rates of exchange. Exchange adjustments arising are taken to the 
foreign currency translation reserve and reported in other comprehensive income.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
56 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Financial assets
Financial assets are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially stated at their fair value, as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. All receivables are considered for impairment. Provision against trade receivables is made when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of those 
receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the assets carrying value and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on deposit with a maturity of 3 months or less from inception and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its 
financial liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct transaction costs. Such instruments are 
subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, are 
recognised in profit or loss over the term of the instrument using an effective rate of interest.
Bond
Bonds in issue are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct transaction costs. The bonds are subsequently carried at their

2 Segmental Analysis
In previous periods, the Group was organised into five main operating segments. Following the acquisition and integration of 6PM 
Holdings plc, an additional Health segment was created. During the year ended 31 October 2017, the Grants and Compliance 
segments were merged to form a new Content division. As at 31 October 2017, the Group is therefore organised into five 
operating segments, which are detailed below. 
Financial information is reported to the chief operating decision maker, which comprises the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer, monthly on a business unit basis with revenue and operating profits split by business unit. Each business unit is 
deemed an operating segment as each offers different products and services.
• Public Sector Software (PSS) – delivering specialist information management solutions and services to the public sector
• Engineering Information Management (EIM) – delivering engineering document management and control solutions to asset 
intensive industry sectors
• Content (CONT) – delivering funding and compliance solutions to corporate, public and commercial customers 
• Digital (DIG) – delivering digital consultancy services to public, private and third sector customers
• Health (HLT) – delivering a broad range of innovative solutions to the healthcare market 
Halarose Holdings Limited, acquired in August 2017, is included in the PSS segment. 
Segment revenue comprises sales to external customers and excludes gains arising on the disposal of assets and finance 
income. Segment profit reported to the Board represents the profit earned by each segment before the allocation of taxation, 
Group interest payments and Group acquisition costs. The assets and liabilities of the Group are not reviewed by the chief 
operating decision maker on a segment basis.

843 24.21 1,177 9.06
The effective tax rate (‘ETR’) for the period was 24.21% (2016: 9.06%). Significant tax repayments were processed in 2017, not 
previously provided for, in respect of historic R&D claims covering the Reading Room Group and Idox Health Ltd.
These downward pressures on ETR were mitigated by impairment, acquisition costs and the non-recognition of overseas losses. 
62 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 The higher effective tax rate in 2017, compared to 2016, is due mainly to impairment of the 6PM acquisition alongside the non-
recognition of losses incurred in Malta, owing to uncertainty over their future utilisation. These losses will be recognised where 
their likelihood of utilisation increases, with any future recognition resulting in a decrease to ETR.

The UK trading losses recognised during the year were brought in on acquisition of the 6PM Group. The foreign losses utilised 
during the year were primarily in the US, with a small element in the Netherlands. The closing unrecognised losses of £12,120,000 
relate to Malta, the UK and Germany. The decision was made to derecognise these assets until there is more certainty over their 
future utilisation. Across the year the total deferred tax asset in respect of unrelieved trading losses has decreased from £432,000 
to £337,000.

68 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Impairment test for goodwill
For this review, goodwill was allocated to individual Cash Generating Units (CGU) on the basis of the Group’s operations as 
disclosed in the segmental analysis. As the Board reviews results on a segmental level, the Group monitors goodwill on the 
same basis. 
The carrying value of goodwill by each CGU is as follows:
Cash Generating Units (CGU)
2017
£000
2016
£000
Public Sector Software 32,016 30,191
Engineering Information Management 11,773 11,774
Content 7,154 7,154
Digital 2,431 2,880
Health 20,011 –
73,385 51,999
The recoverable amount of all CGUs has been determined using value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash 
flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering the next five financial years. The key assumptions 
used in the financial budgets relate to revenue and EBITDA growth targets. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using 
the estimated growth rates stated below. Growth rates are reviewed in line with historic actuals to ensure reasonableness and are 
based on an increase in market share. 
For value-in-use calculations, the growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on financial year 2018 
budgets (as approved by the Board) which is management’s best estimate of short term performance based on an assessment 
of market opportunities and macro-economic conditions. In the year to 31 October 2017, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital 
for each CGU has been used as an appropriate discount rate to apply to cash flows. The same basis was used in the year to 31 
October 2016.
The assumptions used for the value- in-use calculations are as follows and are considered appropriate for each of the risk profiles 
of the respective CGUs:
Cash Generating Units (CGU)
Discount rate 
Current year
Growth rate 
Current year
Discount rate
 Prior year
Growth rate 
Prior year
Public Sector Software 11.19% 2% 11.41% 2%
Engineering Information Management 10.55% 2% 12.89% 2%
Content 12.04% 2% 10.94% 2%
Digital 11.05% 2% 10.94% 2%
Health 10.55% 2%
Individual Weighted Average Cost of Capital were calculated for each CGU and adjusted for the market’s assessment of the risks 
attaching to each CGU’s cash flows. The Weighted Average Cost of Capital is recalculated at each period end. 
Management considered the level of intangible assets within the Health division in comparison to the future budgets and have 
processed an impairment charge of £2,681,000 within the year (2016: £nil). 
Sensitivities have been run on cash flow forecasts for all CGUs. Management are satisfied that the key assumptions of revenue 
and EBITDA growth rates are achievable and that reasonable possible changes to those key assumptions would not lead to 
the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeding the recoverable amount for PSS, EIM and Content divisions. The carrying 
amount of the Digital CGU is close to recoverable amount and depending on future results and projections an impairment could 
be required in the future. Management have calculated that a reduction in the budgeted gross margin by 1% would lead to a 
required impairment charge of £300,000. The Heath division was impaired during year ended 31 October 2017 based on future 
budget projections. If the future budget is not met then the carrying amount of this CGU would exceed the recoverable amount 
and further impairment could be required.
Sensitivities have also been run on the discount rate applied and management are satisfied that a reasonable increase in the 
discount rate would not lead to the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeding the recoverable amount.

The carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value, which has been calculated based on 
expectations of debt recovery from historic performances feeding into impairment provision calculations. 
Trade receivables are reviewed regularly for impairment and judgement made as to any likely impairment based on historic trends 
and the latest communication with customers.
Amounts recoverable on contracts represent work completed and delivered to the customer but due to the contractual payment 
terms have not yet been invoiced. £15.1m of the balance is in relation to deferred payment deals on local authority contracts, 
which typically have three to five year payment terms. Amounts recoverable due after one year have been discounted to 
amortised cost.

the trade receivable directly. Where trade receivables are past due, an assessment is made of individual customers and the 
outstanding balance.

The Group has two loan facilities in place through a two-bank facility with Royal Bank of Scotland and Silicon Valley Bank. The 
facilities consist of a term loan of £9.5m and a revolving credit facility of £23m. The facility is available until February 2019. 
At the balance sheet date, the term loan had an outstanding balance of £9.5m (2016: £12m) and during the period the loan was 
held, the average interest rate was 2.81% (2016: 3.06%).
At the balance sheet date, the revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of £14.5m (2016: £17m) and during the period 
the loan was held, the average interest rate was 2.58% (2016: 2.75%). 
There are unamortised loan fees of £90,000 (2016: £190,000) at the balance sheet date. 
An accounting adjustment of £19,000 has been processed during the period to take into account the effective rate of interest on 
the bank facilities. 
As security for the above loans, Royal Bank of Scotland and Silicon Valley Bank hold a fixed and floating charge over the assets of 
Idox plc and certain subsidiaries, a guarantee supported by Idox plc and certain subsidiaries and a share pledge in respect of the 
entire issued share capital of each subsidiary company.
The acquisition of 6PM Holdings plc led to a breach in our Guarantor coverage covenant at the year end as the operations of a 
number of 6PM individual legal entities amount to more than 5% of group turnover, EBITDA and gross assets. As a result, we 
have an obligation to add the relevant legal entities as Guarantors to the facility. This process is in progress and the banks have 
provided a covenant waiver, which was in place at 31 October 2017, while the legal formalities are completed. 
The Board highlighted to the lenders that due to a limitation of scope in relation to the 6PM sub-group the audit would result in 
a qualified audit opinion. It was explained to the lenders that due to poor record keeping in the early months of the period within 
6PM there is a limitation of scope on 6PM revenue and deferred revenue and the books and records of the three immaterial 
subsidiaries, particularly relating to the period up to July 2017 when 6PM was integrated into Idox finance and the record keeping 
has been improved. Following discussions with the Board the bank was satisfied that, whilst this is technically a breach, they have 
given an advance waiver to cover the period of signing the statutory accounts.
During the period, the Group repaid two term loans from Oseo, France. At 31 October 2016, the total outstanding amount was 
£25,000 and the average interest rate paid during that period the facility was held was 8.10%. 
The Directors estimate that the fair value of the Group’s borrowing is not significantly different to the carrying value.

22 Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, short term deposits, bonds and bank 
borrowings. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial 
instruments, which mainly comprise trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department under policies approved by the Board. The Group’s finance 
department identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks. The Board provides guidance on overall risk management including 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess liquidity. The Board have evaluated the risks and are 
satisfied that the risk management objectives are met.
The impact of the risks required to be discussed under IFRS 7 are detailed below:
Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a 
currency that is not the functional currency of the operations. The Group has minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk as a 
result of natural hedges arising between sales and cost transactions.
(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of cash balances held with banks and other highly rated counterparties.
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to 
cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. During 2017 and 
2016, all the Group’s borrowings at variable rates were denominated in UK sterling. The average interest rate during the year 
ended 31 October 2017 was 2.81% for the term loan and 2.58% for the revolving credit facility. Interest payable in the year was 
£709,000. If the average interest rate during the year had been 1% different, this would have had an impact of £266,000 on the 
interest payable during the period. 
Credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the reporting 
date, as summarised below:
Classes of financial assets – carrying amounts
2017
£000
2016
£000
Cash and cash equivalents 3,260 3,787
Trade receivables 18,840 18,347
Amounts recoverable on contracts 23,043 18,771
Other receivables 1,001 582
Financial assets at fair value 46,144 41,487
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risks arise from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial 
institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. It is the policy of the Group to present the amounts in the 
balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and 
the current economic environment. The Group reviews the reliability of its customers on a regular basis and these reviews take 
into account the nature of the Group’s trading history with the customer.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the majority of funds are held with two banks with high credit-ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies. Management does not expect any losses from non-performance of these counterparties.
None of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
76 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Liquidity risk
The Group closely monitors its access to bank and other credit facilities in comparison to its outstanding commitments on a 
regular basis, to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet obligations of the Group as they fall due.
The Board receives regular debt management forecasts, which estimate the cash inflows and outflows over the next twelve 
months, so that management can ensure that sufficient financing is in place as it is required. Surplus cash within the Group is  
put on deposit in accordance with limits and counterparties agreed by the Board, the objective being to maximise return on  
funds whilst ensuring that the short-term cash flow requirements of the Group are met.
Detailed analysis of the debt facilities taken out and available to the Group are disclosed in note 21.

The above amounts reflect the contractual undiscounted cash flows, which may differ from the carrying values of the liabilities at 
the reporting date.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, in order 
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce 
the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debts.

Richard Kellett-Clarke stepped down as CEO on 9 November 2016. The Nomination & Remuneration Committee of the Idox 
Board agreed that on the anniversary of that date, namely 9 November 2017, Richard’s outstanding LTIP award of 1,900,000 
shares will become unconditional and therefore vest on that date. 
As part of the conditions of the LTIP under a Lock In deed, Richard is restricted from selling any or all of them, unless required to 
settle tax liability, for a further two years from that date.
Andrew Riley’s LTIP entitlement, consisting of 1,700,000 shares at an exercise price of 1p, was forfeited following the end of the 
year on account of the failure to meet all specified criteria for vestment. 
25 Acquisitions
6PM Holdings plc 
On 3 February 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of 6PM Holdings plc for a total consideration of £18.46m, being 
£13.63m in cash and £4.83m in shares. 6PM Group delivers healthcare solutions, principally to the NHS within the UK, using a 
combination of proprietary software, infrastructure, and professional services that enables healthcare organisations to enhance 
and optimise efficiency. The products consist of primarily Hospital Management Solutions, Clinical Systems and Mobile Health 
Solutions. The acquisition supports the Group’s strategy of expanding its health and social care presence.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of 6PM has been capitalised and consists largely of the workforce value, synergies and 
economies of scale expected from combining the operations of 6PM with Idox. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be 
deductible for income tax purposes. The purchase of 6PM has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
As the 6PM Group audit for the period ending 31 December 2016 has now concluded, the book value of the assets and liabilities 
of the 6PM Group has been updated from those previously reported in the Idox Group Interim Results.

25 Acquisitions continued
The revenue included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 3 February 2017, contributed by 6PM  
was £7,640,000. 6PM also made a loss after tax of £1,441,000 for the same period. If the 6PM Group had been included from 
1 November 2016, it would have contributed £9,103,000 to Group revenue and a loss after tax of £2,517,000.
Acquisition costs of £152,000 have been written off in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Halarose Holdings Limited
On 16 August 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Halarose Holdings Ltd (‘Halarose”) for a total initial 
consideration of £5.0m, being £3.5m in cash and £1.5m in shares. As Halarose was acquired on a debt-free and cash-free basis, 
the total consideration on acquisition rose to £8.1m due to the net assets acquired on completion. Halarose, originally established 
in 1978 and based in Oxfordshire, develops, markets, sells and supports a range of electoral back office software and services to 
UK local authorities. It enables its customers to be more efficient both in the production and management of the electoral register 
and in the running of elections and referenda. The acquisition is in line with Idox’s strategic focus on, and investment in, the public 
sector and will be fully integrated into Idox’s existing elections business unit, Idox Elections.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Halarose has been capitalised and consists largely of the workforce value, synergies 
and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of Halarose with Idox. None of the goodwill recognised is 
expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The purchase of Halarose has been accounted for using the acquisition 
method of accounting.

82 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Due to the timing of the acquisition, the fair values stated above are provisional based on management’s best estimate.  
The fair value adjustment for the intangible assets includes £3,852,000 in relation to customer relationships, software and  
brand & reputation. A related deferred tax liability has also been recorded as a fair value adjustment. 
The fair value of trade receivables is equal to the gross contractual amounts receivable. An initial review of trade receivables has 
not indicated any recoverability issues.
The revenue included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 16 August 2017, contributed by Halarose was 
£814,000. Halarose also made a profit after tax of £242,000 for the same period. If Halarose had been included from 1 November 
2016, it would have contributed £3,474,000 to Group revenue and a profit after tax of £1,310,000.
There is no earn out period for Halarose.
Acquisition costs of £84,000 have been written off in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Had the above acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the financial year, the revenue of the Group would be £93.0m and the 
profit after tax of the Group would be £2.5m.
Cloud Amber Limited
During the period the contingent consideration was adjusted from £478,000 to £250,000. The reduction was a result of 
missing the revenue target as set out in the Share Purchase Agreement. At the reporting date, the adjusted contingent 
consideration had been paid. The adjustment of £228,000 is included in ‘Acquisition costs’ in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Rippleffect Studio Limited
During the period there have been further fair value adjustments in respect of the acquisition of Rippleffect Studio Limited on 
22nd August 2016. The adjustments totalled £449,000. A number of adjustments were processed to align company policies 
with Idox Group policies. These included an adjustment of £18,000 in respect of accrued income and £467,000 in respect of 
deferred income.
In October 2017, due to the aforementioned fair value adjustments required to align revenue recognition with Group policy, there 
was a post completion adjustment which resulted in a settlement of £550,000 in favour of Idox plc. This inflow reduced the value 
of the investment in Rippleffect Studio Limited by £550,000 and, consequently, the value of the intangible assets allocated on 
acquisition by the same amount.

84 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Our opinion on the parent company financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Idox plc for the year ended 31 October 2017, which comprise 
the parent company Balance Sheet, the parent company Statement of Changes in Equity and notes to the financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion, the parent company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 October 2017;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the parent 
company financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the parent company in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the parent company financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is 
not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Overview of our audit approach
• Overall materiality: £1,638,000, which represents 1.5% of the company’s total assets
• Key audit matters were identified as carrying value of investments
• Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the company and its environment, including its internal controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement

Independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Idox plc for the year ended 31 October 2017 Key audit matters
• The graph below depicts the audit risks identified and their relative significance based on the extent of the financial statement 
impact and the extent of management judgement. 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the parent 
company financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matters How the matter was addressed in the audit
Carrying value of investments
The carrying value of investments is £114 million 
(2016: £93 million) with the significant uplift being 
driven by the acquisitions of 6PM Holdings PLC 
and Halarose Limited during the year. During 
the year end audit process, it was identified that 
£1.5 million of historic adjustments were made 
to offset share option reserve impact of share 
option exercises against fixed asset investment 
cost rather than a transfer to the retained earnings 
reserve. An adjustment has been processed in 
current year to correct this treatment, and the net 
impact is to increase investments and retained 
earnings by £1.5 million.
Investments are the largest asset on the balance 
sheet, and there is a risk that the carrying amount 
of individual investments is in excess of the net 
assets of the subsidiary or the net present value 
of future cash flows. We therefore identified the 
carrying value of investments as a significant risk, 
which was one of the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement. 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• Checking the details of the acquisitions in year to sale and purchase 
agreements;
• Comparing the carrying value of investments to the net assets of each 
subsidiary to identify any indicators of impairment; and 
• Assessing the value of the investment against the net present value 
of future cash flows to obtain evidence about any investments with 
indicative impairment triggers. 
The parent company’s accounting policy on the carrying value of 
investments is shown in note 2 to the financial statements and related 
disclosures are included in note 6. 
Key observations
We have completed our testing on the carrying value of investments, 
and noted no indicators of impairment or impairment triggers. We have 
obtained sufficient audit evidence to conclude that the carrying value of 
investments is materially correct.

86 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017
Independent auditor’s report continued
to the members of Idox plc continued Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, 
timing and extent of our work and in evaluating the results of that work.
We determined materiality for the audit of the parent company financial statements as a whole to be £1,638,000, which is 1.5% 
of the company’s total assets. This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because the company is a holding company 
with no trading revenue. Given the primary purpose of this company is to hold the investments in the group’s subsidiaries, we 
determined total assets to be the most appropriate benchmark.
Materiality for the current year is higher than the level that we determined for the year ended 31 October 2016 to reflect the 
significant acquisitions of 6pm Holdings plc and Halarose Limited during the year.
We use a different level of materiality, performance materiality, to drive the extent of our testing. This was determined to be 
£517,000. The graph below illustrates how performance materiality interacts with our overall materiality and the tolerance for 
potential uncorrected misstatements.
We also determine a lower level of specific materiality for Directors’ remuneration, related party transactions and auditor’s 
remuneration.
We determined the threshold at which we will communicate misstatements to the audit committee to be £81,900. In addition, we 
communicate misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the company’s business, its 
environment and risk profile and in particular included: 
• obtaining an understanding of the company and its environment, including its internal controls, and assessing the risks of 
material misstatement; 
• focusing our work on the carrying value of investments as the largest balance and most significant judgement in the financial 
statements; and
• there were no material changes in the overview of the scope of the current year audit from the scope of that of the prior year.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises theinformation included in the annual 
report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the parent company financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the parent company financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or 
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement of the parent company 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.

Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview
Financial Statements > Independent Auditor’s Report Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the parent company 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the parent company financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
 
Matter on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the Directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 31, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such 
internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of parent company financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the parent company financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the parent company financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these parent company financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the parent company financial statements is located on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Idox plc for the year ended 31 October 2017. That report 
includes details of the group key audit matters; how we applied the concept of materiality in planning and performing our audit; 
and an overview of the scope of our audit. The opinion in that report is qualified.

90 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Notes to the Company Financial Statements
1 Company Information
Idox plc is a company which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 2nd Floor, 1310 
Waterside, Arlington Business Park, Theale, Reading, RG7 4SA. The registered number of the Company is 03984070.
2 Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 – ‘The Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101). The principal accounting policies adopted in preparation of 
these financial statements are set out below. These policies have all been applied consistently throughout the year unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets 
and liabilities, being derivatives at fair value through profit or loss.
The financial statements are presented in sterling (£).
Disclosure exemptions adopted
In preparing these financial statements the Company has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions conferred by FRS101. 
Therefore, these financial statements do not include:
• A statement of cash flows and related notes
• Disclosure of key management personnel compensation
• Certain disclosure in relation to Share-Based payments
• Disclosures in relation to impairment of assets
• The effect of future accounting standards not adopted
Share-Based payment
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 November 2006 are 
recognised in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where 
employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by 
reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes 
the impact of non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
Employees to whom share options have been granted provide their services in subsidiary companies of Idox plc. All equity settled 
share-based payments are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account of the relevant subsidiary company. In Idox 
plc, the cost is allocated to investments in subsidiaries.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on 
the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any 
indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to 
vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options 
that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to reserves.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment. If there is a subsequent 
change in the total consideration paid, such as a refund received from the seller, then the Company will recognise an adjustment 
to the acquisition price which will reduce the cost, and consequently the next book value, of that investment. 
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its 
financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt instrument, 
those financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. 
Share capital is classed as an equity instrument where the contractual terms do not have any terms meeting the definition of a 
financial liability. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.
Interest and expenditure arising on financial instruments is recognised on the accruals basis and credited or charged to the profit 
and loss account in the financial period to which it relates.

Reserves
Equity comprises the following:
• “Capital redemption reserve” for the Company was created during 2003 when the entire deferred ordinary share capital was 
bought in exchange for one ordinary 1p share. 
• “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of 
expenses of the share issue.
• “Other reserves” arose as a result of share premium arising on consideration shares issued on the acquisition of 6PM Holdings 
plc and Halarose Holdings Limited.
• Treasury reserve” represents shares repurchased by the Company to be held for redistribution as share options. The cost of 
treasury shares is debited to the Treasury reserve.
• “Share options reserve” represents shares to be issued on potential exercise of those share options that have been accounted 
for under FRS 101.
• “Retained earnings” represents retained profits.
3 Directors and Employees
There are no wages and salaries paid by the parent company.
The Company has no employees and Directors are remunerated by other Group companies. Details of the remuneration for each Director 
are included in the Report on Remuneration which can be found on pages 27 to 28 but which do not form part of the audited accounts.

The parent company’s loss for the year was £1,209,000 (2016: profit £37,159,000). During the prior year, the Idox Group 
performed a review of intercompany balances and elected to waive various balances. This resulted in a credit of £32,816,000 to 
the Company’s profit for the year ended 31 October 2016.

92 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 On review of the treatment of share option exercises which had previously been treated as disposals of investments, we do not 
believe this reflects the substance of the transactions. As a result, we have processed a catch up amount of £1,462,000 which is 
not material. We have reviewed the revised investment value and do not consider this value has any indicators of impairment. 
The adjustment to the acquisition price of £550,000 (2016: £nil) was processed in the period in relation to a cash refund relating to 
the historical acquisition price of Rippleffect Limited.

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
During the year, no further options were granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
The Group recognised a total charge of £178,000 (2016: £178,000) for equity-settled share-based payment transactions 
related to the LTIP during the year. The total cost was in relation to share options granted and £nil (2016: £nil) related to share

As the LTIP share option scheme is a Group scheme, there has been no charge recognised in the parent Company accounts. 
Richard Kellett-Clarke stepped down as CEO on 9 November 2016. The Nomination & Remuneration Committee of the Idox 
Board agreed that on the anniversary of that date, namely 9 November 2017, Richard’s outstanding LTIP award of 1,900,000 
shares will become unconditional and therefore vest on that date. 
As part of the conditions of the LTIP under a Lock In deed, Richard is restricted from selling any or all of them, unless required to 
settle tax liability, for a further two years from that date.
Andrew Riley’s LTIP entitlement, consisting of 1,700,000 shares at an exercise price of 1p, was forfeited following the end of the 
year on account of the failure to meet all specified criteria for vestment. 
12 Related Party Disclosures
As permitted by FRS 101, related party transactions with wholly owned members of the Group have not been disclosed. Related 
party transactions regarding remuneration and dividends paid to key management of the Company have been disclosed in note 
29 of the Group financial statements.
13 Capital Commitments
The Company had no capital commitments at 31 October 2017 or 31 October 2016. 
14 Contingent Liabilities 
There were no material Company contingent liabilities at 31 October 2017 or 31 October 2016.
