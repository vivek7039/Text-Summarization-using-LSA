5 Group overview Our strategy
We have taken a number of key decisions during 2017 
that will support the delivery of a clear strategy that 
forms the platform for our growth in the coming years. 
Our strategic framework will ensure we continue to build 
strong partnerships, providing simple and compelling 
customer products and services, as well as generating 
stakeholder value. The principal pillars of our strategy are:
Focus on 
our partner 
relationships
Recognising that the B2B2C model provides the 
basis on which we can make the biggest difference, 
we will focus on deepening relationships with 
business partners to deliver compelling, 
innovative products and services to their 
customers  This model has been the foundation 
for the Group for over 30 years and has provided 
the model for the growth in our Indian and 
Turkish markets in 2017  
1
Investment in 
growth markets
We will focus investment in key markets where 
the greatest growth and strategic opportunities 
exist  This strategy has so far supported the 
transformational growth of India and Turkey 
and we are committed to continuing this 
investment to fuel growth 
We have made strategic investment in China 
with the development of a new IT platform 
and new office location 
Through Blink UK we will re-enter the UK market 
in 2018 with a revitalised distribution and product 
strategy which will be a significant milestone 
for the business 
3
International 
expansion
We will expand into new markets using 
established successful businesses as the 
leaders in a hub model  
The first of these market entries will be 
Bangladesh in mid-2018, managed through our 
successful Indian business hub  
5
Cultural and 
organisational 
change
We will operate a decentralised model that 
provides greater responsibility and accountability 
for local leaders and enables efficient delivery 
of services and products that meet local needs  
Our country teams will be better able to drive key 
strategies at a local level, taking advantage of local 
knowledge to design and deliver innovative 
products and services that meet local needs  
Our new International Support Centre, based 
in Leeds, will provide support where needed  
2
Realignment of 
mature markets
The effective management of our historic 
UK renewal books will enable us to maximise 
customer retention within an effective cost base  
We have made operational improvements in 
southern Europe, bringing Italy and Portugal into 
a hub model led by Spain, and we have brought 
our Malaysian operation into our Indian hub 
4
Driving 
innovation
We will invest in product, technology and the 
customer experience  This will include strategic 
partnerships or acquisitions where it will enhance 
the Group’s existing capability  Technology 
will focus on platform, with Blink being used 
as an innovation hub  
6
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 6 Our partners

investment in our flexible product portfolio to ensure we

“We have successfully implemented a 
multi-channel, multi-product strategy in 
our partnership with CPP Turkey, which 
has been going on for nearly 10 years  
Behind this success, 
confidence and team 
work have been the 
key factors.
CPP is one of the most important parts of 
our Bancassurance Non-Life Insurance, with 
effective use of branch, direct sales and outbound 
telemarketing channels along with successful 
campaign management ”
DenizBank
“Partnering with CPP India for the last three years has 
been a prolific journey  We have launched multiple 
products across customer segments, including 
FoneSafe and Asset Care and the partnership has 
grown significantly in that time and we expect our 
relationship to continue to be successful  
We are impressed by the 
product innovation that 
CPP has brought in our 
cross-sell business, 
by seamlessly stitching together consumer 
preferences and business partner objectives with 
governance framework  One of the barometers of 
our mutual success is the size of the business 
achieved in a short duration of time, despite a 
healthy competitive environment  I congratulate 
them on building an excellent management team, 
which is robust in its business approach yet agile 
to the ever changing business environment ”

9 Strategic report Sir Richard Lapthorne
Chairman
2017 has been an encouraging 
year for the Group. We have seen 
a return to overall revenue growth 
for the first time in five years, 
product innovation and international 
adaptation of new products is 
starting to take shape and a clear 
role has emerged for our reorganised 
central team, now located in Leeds. 
This has been accompanied by 
prudent management of our 
capital resources where we now 
have sufficient funds available to 
meet the up-front costs associated 
with our growth ambitions. 
Chairman’s statement
How we look at our business
The changing nature of the Group and how 
we manage its component parts has led to a 
reappraisal of how we measure our businesses  
Historically, the Group viewed its businesses 
by country and region with no differentiation 
reflecting the different nature of the businesses 
within each country  In 2018 we will refine this to 
show three different sources of revenue and cost  
These are the historic back book ‘Restricted 
Operations’ with activities in UK, Italy, Portugal, 
Malaysia and Hong Kong; the unconstrained 
operating businesses, ‘Ongoing Operations’, 
in each of these countries plus India, Turkey, 
Spain, Germany and Mexico; and a third category 
covering ‘Investments’ being made for new and/or 
expanded activities in the countries in our ongoing 
operations  This category currently includes China 
The back book businesses are run with the 
objective of effectively managing the customer 
experience and minimising the annual decline 
with low associated development costs  Equally, 
administrative costs will mirror any further 
declines in renewals  
The results from the operating businesses will 
be the key driver of value as they clearly show 
the true direction of travel in both revenue and 
margins and this assessment will be facilitated by 
investment costs being shown separately in the 
sector analysis  This treatment is necessary as 
we employ little fixed capital and consequently 
investments, which can be substantial, can have 
a negative impact on the income statement in the 
short term before any return is realised  Internally, 
all projects under this heading require full Board 
approval as if they were fixed capital investments 
The 2017 Accounts have been prepared using the 
prior system for sector analysis 
Progress to date
On completion of the major strategy review referred 
to in last year’s report, resources have been shifted 
away from a highly centralised style to one of 
providing appropriate support to all our businesses 
whether in the rapidly developing markets in India, 
China and Turkey, the more mature markets such 
as Germany and southern Europe, or the newly 
established UK business  This more decentralised 
model gives greater responsibility and 
accountability to the operational businesses 
In December 2017, Blink UK received permission 
from the FCA to commence trading as a regulated 
insurance intermediary and it is through this entity 
that we will seek to reinvigorate our UK presence  
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 10 We continue to see the UK market as an important 
component of our global business 
The technical expertise of Blink is also being used 
to help us develop innovative product solutions 
such as the recent launch of Owl in Turkey  We 
will continue to seek product extensions to our 
portfolio and, as a further example, we were pleased 
recently to announce our investment in a minority 
shareholding in KYND Limited (KYND), a business 
set up to address cyber security monitoring and 
diagnostics for large and SME businesses that are 
facing a critical need to address the risks involved 
within their IT infrastructures  
Culture and values
Our business distributes products through long 
term partnership arrangements, B2B2C  Quality 
of approach and high integrity are essential for 
sustainable success and, having made good progress 
in fundamentally changing the organisation, 
we recognise the need to ensure we have the right 
people in the right place in the right roles  The 
Board has approved significant investment in 
developing an open, honest and authentic culture 
that extends consistently throughout the business  
The Board
I was pleased to welcome two new Directors to 
the Board during the year, Oliver Laird as Chief 
Financial Officer and Tim Elliott as Non-Executive 
Director and Audit Committee Chairman  Oliver 
and Tim have both already made a significant 
contribution to the Board and the Group  
Governance
The Board remains committed to maintaining high 
standards of governance, both at a corporate level 
and operationally throughout the business  
Notwithstanding the increased autonomy of our 
individual businesses, the Board recognises the 
importance of retaining clear oversight and a ‘flat’ 
organisation structure, with Country CEOs reporting 
direct to the Group CEO, helps to ensure that this 
is the case  Other Board members also maintain 
regular contact with all parts of the business, with 
frequent visits to our overseas operations 
Performance
The Group’s revenue growth in the year has been 
largely driven by India, where we are beginning to see 
the fruits of strategies and investments implemented 
over the last 12 to 18 months  Although the Group 
profit before tax shows an increase compared to 
2016, underlying operating profit is lower  This is a 
result of the shift in revenue mix from high margin 
back book products in the UK and Spain, to primarily 
India where the strong trading performance comes 
from products which produce lower margins 
The planned change to our segmental reporting 
structure will, we believe, provide our stakeholders 
with a much clearer analysis of the Group’s progress 
over time 
The Board has approved this Annual Report & 
Accounts as being fair , balanced and understandable, 
providing the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy 
Looking ahead
Having already implemented a good proportion 
of the plans we made in 2016, the business is 
well placed to continue its growth in 2018 and 
beyond  Our simplified operating structure 
enables us to operate more efficiently with a lower 
cost base and the increase in available cash 
following the release of some of our regulatory 
restrictions and the sale of our York premises 
gives us the ability to seek expansion through 
organic product innovation, product acquisitions 
and new and/or expanded partnerships 
As well as continued growth in India, we see 
potential for substantial growth in China, and, with 
that in mind, have made a significant investment 
in standalone IT and digital capability and in 
expanding our team there  
During the middle part of 2018, we will 
incorporate CPP Bangladesh, a market which 
we have not previously explored and where we 
see great potential for our products, combined 
with our regional approach to marketing  Initially, 
significant support will be provided through 
the extension of our successful Indian 
business model to this market 
Once again, on behalf of the Board I would like 
to thank all our colleagues for their continued 
commitment, hard work and support during the 
year and look forward to working with you all as we 
continue to rebuild our business

We are pleased with the progress that has been 
made against the strategic priorities that were 
identified during 2016  
We have delivered year-on-year revenue growth 
for the first time since 2011 and have significantly 
increased our global customer base  This growth 
has primarily been achieved through the progress 
made in our Indian and Turkish operations  Both 
markets successfully demonstrate the benefits 
of our strategy to strengthen business partner 
relationships and develop bespoke product 
offerings that meet local consumer needs 
Innovation has continued at pace  In March 2017, 
we acquired Blink, an innovative product and 
systems developer based in Ireland  Since 
acquisition, we have continued to invest and grow 
the Blink business which is already delivering 
functionality for providing innovative product 
solutions into local market places  In time each 
market will have the capability to build new products 
locally for use on a new platform  The first product 
of this type was launched in late 2017 
Additionally, in December 2017, Blink UK received 
permission from the FCA to commence trading as 
a regulated insurance intermediary  It is through 
this entity that we will seek to reinvigorate our UK 
presence  We continue to see the UK market as an 
important component of our global business 
Cost control remains an integral part of the 
strategy  It is important that our cost base remains 
appropriate and is targeted in the right areas to 
enable additional investment into our markets to 
promote growth  We are always mindful of the 
importance of cost control as an integral part 
of our behaviours  In 2017 we carried out a 
fundamental redesign of our organisational 
structure, which as a result, will be more 
responsive to country needs and more effective in 
delivering the Group’s strategy  The new structure 
will also provide a lowering of overall cost 
However, there remains much work to do to 
realise the potential CPP has in a market place 
that is increasingly demanding the services and 
solutions that we provide  We continue to develop 
our presence as an international product 
innovation business  Our focus is on building 
strong trusted relationships with our network of 
business partners around the world and following 
some of the strategically important decisions we 
have made in 2017, we are in a stronger position to 
grow the business 
Organisational change
To promote a simplified business model 
and operating structure, we redesigned 
our organisational structure during 2017  
A decentralised model has been implemented 
which places greater operational responsibility 
on our country operations  This change allows 
our experts in country, who best understand local 
demands and opportunities, to lead in the key 
decisions that affect their business and customers  
The change has also led to less reliance on a large 
UK-based Group function, with the focus now on 
an efficient International Support Centre that will 
provide the appropriate level of support, oversight 
and governance across the Group  The reduction in 
the size of the Group functions and the creation of 
an International Support Centre will lead to cost 
efficiencies, the full benefit of which will be seen 
from 2018 onwards  
“ We have delivered year-on-year 
revenue growth for the first 
time since 2011 and have 
significantly increased our 
global customer base.”

13 Strategic report Our performance
2017 has been a good year with revenue 
growth of 24% over 2016  Revenue from our 
international operations grew by 54%, further 
reducing the historic dependency the business 
had on the restricted UK operation  Customer 
numbers have also increased significantly to 
5 5 million which represents growth of 26%  2017 
has been an excellent year for our Indian business, 
where new bespoke products and strong business 
partner relationships have contributed to revenue 
increasing by 164%  Turkey has also grown in the 
year, again through developing strong and trusted 
relationships with existing business partners and 
enhancing channel capability  Our restricted 
operations and certain other markets, whilst in 
decline, continue to contribute strong renewal 
rates that are higher than the Group rate of 74 8% 
(2016: 74 9%)  
Group revenue has increased by 24% to £91 4 million 
(2016: £73 6 million)  The growth in Indian revenue 
has more than compensated for the continued 
natural reduction in revenue from the renewal 
books in our restricted markets  Profit after tax of 
£4 6 million (2016: £0 5 million loss) has increased 
as a result of the reduction in one-off costs to the 
business  However , underlying operating profit has 
declined to £3 9 million (2016: £8 4 million) which 
reflects the shift in revenue mix from historically 
higher margins in our restricted operations to 
growth markets where margins on the products we 
sell in these markets are at a lower level  During 2018 
we anticipate revenue growth led by sales volumes in 
our international markets which, along with ongoing 
cost control, will contribute to improvements in 
underlying operating profit (on a constant 
GAAP basis) 
Investment platform
We made good progress in freeing up capital 
for the Group to reinvest into our markets or to 
enhance our capabilities through partnerships 
or acquisitions 
In the UK, as recognition that the historic issues 
the business faced are now in the past, the FCA 
agreed to lift the capital and asset restrictions 
placed on HIL and CPPL as part of the Voluntary 
Variation of Permission (VVOPs)  In the case 
of HIL, this has enabled the Group to develop 
a strategy which will see the release of further 
capital in the short to medium term  With most 
of the back book business ring-fenced within 
CPPL, new business opportunities in the UK 
will be focused through Blink UK 
The Group has also completed the sale and 
leaseback of its former Head Office premises in 
York  The sale proceeds were £5 3 million  As part 
of the change to ensure that the Group functions 
are focused on supporting the entire Group, the 
Global Head Office was renamed the International 
Support Centre and relocated to Leeds in 
November 2017 
The available capital created through these 
milestones will be used to support growth in 
our rapidly expanding international markets  
Enhanced investment plans have already been 
implemented in the key markets of India, Turkey 
and China  We also plan to re-enter the UK market 
during 2018  In addition CPP will look to acquire 
or partner with other innovation technology 
businesses to expand our product portfolio 
or to capitalise on distribution networks  
Blink and KYND are examples of this

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 14 International expansion
The Group’s focus is one of international growth 
which includes increased investment into existing 
markets to develop infrastructure, products and 
marketing channels  In addition we will also 
expand into new markets where we believe we can 
harness distribution channels to develop a strong 
regional network  We are building regional hubs 
that provide an efficient operating model and will 
also allow us to expand into adjacent and similar 
markets from a position of strength  We have 
already developed a regional hub for Spain, Italy 
and Portugal led from Madrid and will use India as 
a hub leader for Malaysia and the planned launch 
into Bangladesh in the middle part of 2018  
Customer
Our business partners’ customers are 
important to us  The work we undertake 
to improve our products and distribution 
channels is all designed with their customers as 
a central priority  We are focused on providing 
relevant and engaging services in channels that 
make it simple for customers to engage with 
our products  We will invest in the customer 
experience in 2018 to deliver an even better 
customer journey through increasingly 
digitally led channels 
People
Our colleagues are fundamental to the business 
growth strategy  A strong motivated team is 
crucial to providing great products and services 
to our partners and their customers  We are 
committed to colleague development and 
promoting good behaviours  These will continue 
to be an area of key focus in 2018 with a number 
of programmes in place to further embed this 
within the organisation  
Outlook
The transformation journey we have been on in 2017 has 
created the right environment for further growth  We have 
simplified our operating structure, been decisive with 
organisational change and clearly defined our strategy  
The Group is focused on its strategic priorities, which 
support its existing revenue, new revenue generation and 
growth ambitions  Good progress has been made in 2017  
The Group anticipates growing revenues in 2018 through 
our international markets leading to improvements in 
underlying operating performance (on a constant GAAP 
basis)  Our simplified operating structure, lower cost base 
and available cash resources provides the capability to 
expand through organic product innovation, product 
acquisitions or new partnerships  We have cash available 
that we can use to invest in the many exciting opportunities 
we have already identified, including further geographic 
expansion as well as additional product investments 
and acquisitions  
We are pleased in the direction the business is heading 
and the progress it is making

15 Strategic report Our people
A compelling culture for a global community
We are on a journey to establish a culture that 
brings out the best from everyone and are making 
a significant investment in our colleagues because 
we believe that to grow our business we must grow 
our people  
We have fundamentally reshaped the organisation 
to ensure we have the right people in the right place 
in the right roles, harnessing local knowledge of 
local markets to explore the many opportunities 
that exist to reach our ambitions  We have 
established a new operating model with our 
Country CEOs that focuses on what our customers 
in countries need to drive growth  
Our Country CEOs are critical to our success  We 
have invested in them and provided coaching in the 
psychology of cultural transformation to enable 
them to build a consistent CPP culture across our 
countries  This is all about role modelling authentic 
leadership and creating the conditions for our 
people to grow, which includes going out of our way 
to be open, honest and empowering because we feel 
this generates trust, belief and confidence in our 
people to deliver our plans 
Promoting flexible working and addressing any 
gaps in gender-related pay are becoming 
increasingly important to us because we want to 
create a fair culture that is socially responsible  We 
have evolved working practices to promote flexible 
working that suits lifestyles regardless of gender, 
level and role  We will continue to focus on this 
during 2018 because we believe it is the right 
thing to attract talent, enable existing talent to 
achieve their potential and ensure that colleagues 
are fairly rewarded for the work they do, regardless 
of their gender  A full gender pay gap report will be 
published on our website in April 2018  
We continue to invest in our colleagues with 
team-based coaching and a leadership development 
plan, which augments our Accelerant programme 
which is in its third year  
This programme is about developing our change 
agents to accelerate business performance and 
cultural transformation  Our Accelerants are high 
impact, high performing professionals from within 
the business who choose to opt-in and work 
together with sponsors and coaches to deliver 
significant change aligned to our ambitions  
Following the introduction of this programme in 
2016, we now have a strong alumni of graduated 
Accelerants that will join forces during 2018 to 
continue their role of delivering change and 
success to drive growth 
Just as our business is evolving, we have also 
evolved our co-created Values to ensure they 
reflect behaviours that will drive success  Our 
people told us they want a culture where we value 
five things – curiosity, working together, being 
brave, keeping things simple and when someone 
says they’ll do something you can ‘consider it 
done’  How our people demonstrate these are 
discussed in action-orientated great performance 
conversations and we take pride in acknowledging 
those who live our Values through meaningful 
reward and recognition 
The progress we have made on our transformation 
journey is tangibly demonstrated through the 
investment in our vibrant new work space that is 
home to our International Support Centre  We 
have created the right conditions for growth that 
embraces the spirit of our culture through the use 
of nature and design to provide an innovative, 
collaborative and inspirational environment that 
can be reflected in all of our countries to bring out 
the best in our people  
We believe this relentless focus on our people agenda 
and cultural transformation has been a significant 
factor in attracting and retaining colleagues who 
are powering our successes  
Our people continue to be the heart 
of everything we do. It’s important 
to us that we continue to create, 
support and reinforce a compelling 
and authentic culture that our 
people want to be part of.

I felt deeply valued to be part of this programme 
and a great team of Accelerants  What we learnt 
about culture and behaviours was invaluable, 
especially relating to our core Values of being 
collaborative, adopting a courageous approach 
at work plus building trust with colleagues and 
business partners  
Role modelling these practices and behaviours 
has certainly helped me build strong team support, 
deepen business partner engagements and 
ultimately improve business performance 
in CPP India, thereby creating commercial 
impact for the Group

Eleanor Sykes,  
Global Head of Internal Audit
I joined the company on a full time basis in 
November 2016 before changing contract to a part 
time basis  I wanted to retain my role as an active 
member of the senior leadership team based at 
the International Support Centre and continue 
to make a full contribution supporting our growth 
agenda, whilst balancing the needs of a young 
family  Reducing my hours to four days per week 
has provided me with the right balance where 
I’m able to continue developing in my role whilst 
being able to devote more time to being at home  
Luisa Cifuentes,  
Commercial Change Director
My journey at CPP has been and continues to be 
exciting and challenging  Living in the Netherlands 
where we do not have an office, I consider myself 
privileged to have been given the opportunity to 
perform a variety of international roles during 
my 20 years with the organisation  All of these 
responsibilities have been thought provoking 
and stimulating, which have underpinned my 
personal and professional growth  
For the last 12 years I have been home based, 
however through flexible working my career 
progression has continued to flourish  
Our aim for 2018 is to continue 
this relentless focus as we 
support, develop, recognise and 
reward those who are making a 
significant contribution to the 
delivery of our plans.

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 18 Investment for growth
In March 2017 we acquired Blink and its subsidary 
Blink UK to help spearhead a new era of innovation 
in product and technology within the organisation  
Blink UK were part of the first cohort in the FCA 
Innovate ‘sandbox’ programme in the UK with 
their ground-breaking data driven flight 
cancellation insurance product  
The acquisition of Blink was the first of what 
will be a number of investments and acquisitions 
that will be made by the Group as we look to bring 
in new innovative product and technology into 
the business to leverage our distribution network 
across the Group, whilst staying ahead of market 
trends to meet partner needs  
In March 2018 we also made a strategic 
investment in KYND, a London-based cyber risk 
start-up for the SME and Cyber insurance sectors, 
to add further to our innovative product catalogue  
This investment opens up a new fast-growing 
market for CPP internationally and will be one 
of the core propositions supporting our relaunch 
into the UK market  
We have also been busy investing and shaping a 
new proposition development platform to allow 
new products and services to be delivered into 
market at pace  
The 2018 Allianz Global Risk 
Barometer ranked cyber as the 
second most important business 
risk facing any organisation. It is 
estimated that almost 3 million 
British companies were hit by 
some sort of cyber-attack in the 
last 12 months, with costs 
totalling over £29 billion.
A strong existing portfolio
Our core products including Card Protection, 
Identity Protection and Mobile Phone Insurance 
continue to hold significant customer value across 
the countries we operate within  These products 
help to assist customers in their day-to-day online 
and mobile lives  This is evidenced through strong 
renewal performance and customer satisfaction 
levels seen across Europe and strong new 
business growth in key markets such as India and 
Turkey  We have further developed our Asset Care 
product in India which has grown significantly in 
2017  This product has benefited from an 
improved user experience and wider distribution 
through a strategic partner  
We have continued to invest in our core products 
in 2017 to ensure they remain relevant for 
customers including the addition of protection for 
mobile wallets and card-not-present transactions 
in India to meet changing consumer needs  
In 2018 we will develop our suite of cyber and 
identity products and services, including Owl, 
which help consumers and businesses monitor 
and protect their online world  In addition we will 
enhance our comprehensive range of products to 
help customers when they are on the move, 
including Blink flight cancellation and delay 
insurance and Lasu which prevents the loss of a 
wallet whilst giving consumers control to cancel 
their cards immediately 
 In 2018 we plan additional investment in these 
product lines to continue improving the relevance 
of our offering whilst enhancing the customer 
experience to drive value to partners and their end 
customers  This year will see a transformation in 
our online sales and servicing capability, further 
fuelling our growth

Connectivity and cyber
Connectivity is the new normal and the pervasive 
nature of the internet has transformed how 
consumers live their lives with more products and 
services being accessed and serviced online  
This has resulted in large amounts of information 
being accessible like never before, making 
back-end databases more attractive to hackers  
Whilst consumers want to continue with the 
benefits driven from this connectivity there is 
concern over the privacy and security implications 
associated with ever-growing connectivity  
On-demand consumers
Consumers increasingly demand value – this 
encompasses experience, quality, reliability, 
trust, convenience and price; challenging 
brands to stay relevant  We work with 
innovative new partners to deliver products that 
provide convenience and control, underlined 
with flexible business models to suit the needs 
of their customers 
These trends and the specific needs of our business 
partners are ever present in determining how we 
create our product and service propositions. This 
means we can continue to protect customers in an 
ever-growing online world, where they increasingly 
manage their lives on the go. This is delivered 
through a combination of in-house product 
development and strategic partnerships with 
innovation start-ups.

Financial performance 
Revenue has increased by 133% on a constant currency basis 
compared to the same period in 2016, to £42 2 million (2016: 
£17 3 million)  The underlying operating profit has improved 
to £1 8 million (2016: £1 6 million) 
Review
The main trading operations in our Asia Pacific region are in 
India, China, Malaysia and Hong Kong  These markets account 
for 46% of the Group’s full year revenue and for the first time 
represent the greatest revenue share in the Group, reflecting 
the continued growth experienced in this region  This growth 
has again been led by India which has had a record year, 
growing revenues by 152% on a constant currency basis and 
increasing profitability  India is the largest revenue generating 
market in the Group  The growth in India has been realised 
through the expansion of sales in Asset Care and FoneSafe 
with a leading non-banking financial company that started in 
late 2016, along with development and strengthening of 
other business partner relationships  We continue to invest 
in India to build upon the progress we have made and improve 
further our channel delivery, including digital  Focus and 
initiatives will continue on improving customer retention and 
profit margins 
China has continued to progress, with a number of new 
business partner contracts signed in 2017 that we expect to 
deliver in 2018  We have invested in China during 2017 with 
a major IT infrastructure project in progress that will improve 
our operating platform and digital capability enabling us to 
provide local solutions efficiently and independently  
This project is due to complete in late Q2 2018  In addition, 
we have improved the capability of the local management 
team, with the senior headcount increased to help drive the 
business forward in 2018 and capitalise on the significant 
opportunities that exist in the Chinese marketplace  
Renewal performance in Malaysia and Hong Kong has 
continued to perform in line with expectations  We continue 
to assess our commercial viability in Hong Kong 
2017 has been another 
year of significant growth 
in our Asia Pacific region,

Review
CPP’s Europe and Latin America region includes Spain, Italy, 
Portugal, Germany, Turkey and Mexico  Europe and Latin 
America represents 29% of the Group’s full year revenue  
Turkey has had a very strong year, growing revenues, profit and 
customer numbers  This growth has been achieved through 
building strong trusted relationships with business partners and 
developing profitable channel capability  Turkey has developed a 
sustainable model that is based on a multi-product, multi-partner 
and multi-channel approach  Additionally, in late 2017 we 
launched Owl in Turkey which has started well and we expect to 
continue to expand in 2018  
The core European markets delivered solid renewal 
performance, operational efficiencies and business partner 
engagement throughout 2017  These continue to be difficult 
markets in which to make quick progress and we continue to 
rely on their large, but declining renewal books  However, 
there has been positive progress during 2017 across these 
markets which we expect to generate new campaign launches 
and additional revenue 
We have implemented a change in operational structure in 
southern Europe whereby Spain, Italy and Portugal will 
operate as a regional hub led from Madrid  This has also 
enabled a reinvigoration of the sales environment in these 
markets as well as operational efficiencies  In Germany we have 
increased our growth capability through the appointment of 
senior business development and marketing roles  
Mexico has had a difficult year and although revenue has 
increased marginally this has not been through the new 
revenue growth we anticipated  Changes are being made to 
reinvigorate Mexico which remains a market in which we see 
good potential  
UK and Ireland
Financial performance 
Revenue for 2017 decreased by 22% to £22 3 million (2016: 
£28 8 million)  Underlying operating loss is £2 4 million 
(2016: £1 5 million profit) 
Review
The UK and Ireland region accounted for 24% of the Group’s 
full year revenue in 2017  New retail business performance in 
the UK and Ireland continues to be constrained by restrictions 
relating to the ongoing VVOP  As a result the UK services a 
renewal book where renewal rates have been strong and 
encouraging  Good governance and excellent customer service 
remains a priority to our legacy book 
The acquisition of Blink in March 2017 was an important step 
that has improved our IT development capability  Blink is in 
start-up phase and we have invested in developing it as an 
IT hub since acquisition  Blink is already demonstrating the 
enhanced capability it can bring to our delivery in market 
In addition, we have received FCA permission to commence 
trading as a regulated insurance intermediary through Blink 
UK and it is through this entity that we will seek to reinvigorate 
our UK presence 
23 Strategic report Our products and services help 
people protect and safeguard 
the things that are important to 
them in their everyday lives. High 
demand for these products in our 
principal overseas territories has 
seen the Group deliver robust 
growth in revenue and statutory 
operating profit in the latest 
chapter of its development.

The energy with which our teams have pursued 
our customer-centric strategic aims has propelled 
a rise in revenue for the first time since 2011  The 
24% increase in revenue has been underpinned by 
our rapidly expanding operations in India  Against 
a challenging macroeconomic environment, we 
undertook a number of key strategic changes 
during 2017 which will provide the resources to 
invest and position the business for continued 
success in the future 
The profile of the business has changed significantly, 
with reliance on our traditional European markets 
continuing to reduce  A number of our key strategic 
growth markets have expanded rapidly during 
2017  The Asia Pacific region has seen record levels 
of revenue growth of 144% and now represents 
the largest share of the Group’s revenue at 46% 
(2016: 23%)  We are also encouraged by the 
development of some of our other markets during 
the year which has led to 2017 being symbolic in the 
Group’s transformation to a truly global organisation 
where for the first time the UK does not represent 
the largest share of the Group revenue 
The Group’s administrative expenses 
(excluding exceptional items and MSP charges) 
have increased marginally in 2017 to £37 9 million 
(2016: £37 5 million)  This reflects the impacts 
of foreign exchange, investments in markets and 
one-time costs associated with implementing the 
redesign of the organisational structure  The cost 
savings from the reduction in the size of the 
International Support Centre are expected 
to be realised in future periods and will be 
approximately £2 million annualised 
Looking ahead, the progress and decisions taken in 
2017 will benefit the longer term prosperity of the 
Group  However, following the shift in the Group’s 
product mix and expansion in our Asian markets, 
gross profit margins are expected to remain lower 
than previous years in the medium term  This is 
due to lower profit margins in these products and 
countries compared to the high margin back books 
in our restricted operations  Plans are in place to 
improve the margin levels in these developing 
markets through a focus on renewal rates and the 
extension of new business into digitised products  
However, current margins are expected to be 
largely representative of the business in the future, 
with incremental improvements in profitability 
relying upon cost control, higher sales volumes 
and other management actions

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 24 Segmental review
As our business continues to develop and grow, 
it is important that we manage and analyse the 
business in line with the strategy that we have 
adopted  As a result it is our intention that during 
2018 we will change the way we report our 
financial performance, moving away from the 
historic regional analysis to reporting segments 
that reflect the way resources are now allocated by 
management  Our updated segmental categories 
will comprise; Restricted Operations, Ongoing 
Operations and Investments for Growth  
The Group has however continued to monitor 
financial performance through the year on the 
regional basis (see note 5 to the consolidated 
financial statements) and analysis of the 
performance drivers are therefore described 
on that basis in this report 
Result and profitability
Group revenue from continuing operations 
has increased by 24% to £91 4 million 
(2016: £73 6 million)  This increase reflects 
significant growth in our Indian operation where 
customer numbers have increased by 1 2 million 
partly offset by the continued reduction in the 
historic UK renewal book which is in managed 
decline  International revenue has grown by 54% 
in the year  On a regional basis revenue has grown 
in Asia Pacific by 144% (133% on a constant 
currency basis)  Revenue has reduced marginally 
in Europe and Latin America by 3% (5% on a 
constant currency basis) due to new business 
activity not yet replacing the reduction in the 
historic renewal books  The UK and Ireland region 
has declined by 22%  The growth in international 
revenue has increased the impact foreign 
exchange may have on our reported revenue 
with a weaker sterling continuing to benefit 
the Group in 2017 
Underlying operating profit from continuing 
operations for the year is £3 9 million 
(2016: £8 4 million) which is £4 5 million lower 
than 2016  This expected reduction in underlying 
operating profit reflects the shift in the revenue 
mix from our higher margin, renewal book focused 
European markets to growth markets, such as 
India  The percentage margins on the products we 
sell in our growth markets are at a lower level than 
those earned from the historically high margins 
earned from the restricted UK renewal books  In 
addition, cost control remains a priority for the 
Group  However 2017 has seen significant 
reinvestment in our markets along with additional 
costs associated with growing our Blink-led IT 
development hub and the operational restructure  
This expenditure supports the Group’s strategy 
and puts the business in a stronger position for 
the future  
Exceptional items in the year are much reduced 
and total £0 1 million (2016: £9 2 million) 
comprising impairment of the remaining IT 
core platform costs of £0 9 million; a credit of 
£0 5 million relating to impairment reversal on the 
freehold land and property and a further credit of 
£0 3 million relating to customer redress  The 
reduction in exceptional charges in the year 
mainly relates to costs associated with aborting 
the SSP-led IT platform in 2016 
Share-based payment charges relating to the MSP 
were £0 3 million (2016: £1 0 million)  Due to the 
one-off nature of this plan, MSP costs are 
presented separately from underlying operating 
results with the final impact being in 2018 
The exceptional items and MSP charges 
contribute to a reported operating profit of 
£3 5 million (2016: £1 8 million loss)  
Net interest and finance costs of £0 1 million 
(2016: £0 1 million) reflect the Group’s relatively 
low borrowing levels in the year 
As a result, the reported profit before tax from 
continuing operations was £3 4 million 
(2016: £1 9 million loss) and the reported profit 
after tax from continuing operations was 
£4 6 million (2016: £0 5 million loss) 
25 Strategic report Financial review continued
Result and profitability continued
There are no discontinued operations in the year  
The 2016 profit from discontinued operations of 
£0 6 million related to the final benefits from the 
closure of the Airport Angel business  
Basic earnings per share from continuing 
operations are 0 54 pence compared to a loss 
of 0 06 pence in 2016  
There has been a further weakening in sterling 
during the year against our main trading 
currencies the euro and Indian rupee  The impact 
on the Group has been to improve reported 
revenue and profits from our international 
operations  Revenue in the year improved by 20% 
on a constant currency basis, compared to 24% at 
actual exchange rates  Underlying operating profit 
declined by 57% on a constant currency basis 
compared to 53% at actual exchange rates  
The expected impact of Brexit on the Group is 
currently being assessed  With the exception 
of exchange rate fluctuations, the Group does 
not consider current operations will be materially 
impacted as business activities are mainly 
serviced within the country of operation 
Tax
In 2017 there was a tax credit on continuing 
operations of £1 2 million (2016: £1 3 million)  
The credit includes £1 6 million (2016: £0 3 million 
charge) arising in CPPL after a credit of £0 8 
million to the prior year and release of certain tax 
contingencies of £1 0 million  Profits arising in 
UK entities are fully covered by group relief from 
losses arising in UK entities  Charges on overseas 
profits arising in Spain, Turkey and Italy are 
effectively offset by the UK credits arising in the 
year  Due to the various movements noted, the 
effective tax rate for the year is not considered to 
be a representative measure 
Cash flow and net funds
The Group’s cash balances have increased in the 
year by £3 2 million (2016: £11 6 million decrease) 
following the sale of the Head Office in York  This 
positive cash impact has been partly offset by the 
acquisition and subsequent funding of Blink  Cash 
from operations amounted to £1 9 million (2016: 
£6 0 million used in operations) and results 
primarily from positive operating cash flows 
across the business  
The net funds position has improved in the year to 
£31 5 million (2016: £26 9 million) which reflects 
the positive cash flows in the year  
The Group currently has no drawn borrowings  
The net funds figure includes cash balances of 
£19 0 million held in the UK’s regulated entities, 
CPPL and HIL which, following the lifting of the 
VVOP asset restrictions, has improved the 
availability of cash resources for investment in the 
wider Group  
At 31 December 2016, £18 7 million was held in 
these regulated entities with any distribution 
requiring PRA or FCA approval  At 31 December 
2017 the only remaining restriction on our cash 
balances relate to HIL ’s regulatory capital 
requirements  However, other assets are in excess 
of our regulatory requirements and therefore no 
cash is required to satisfy the position  As a result, 
our unrestricted cash position of £31 5 million 
is £22 0 million higher than 31 December 2016  
The lifting of the capital restrictions represents 
significant progress in allowing the Group the 
flexibility to invest resources around the Group to 
capitalise on the opportunities that exist  
Dividend
The Directors have decided not to recommend the 
payment of a dividend  Furthermore, the Board 
continues to believe it is not appropriate to pay a 
dividend until cash generated by operations is 
more than adequate to cover the Group’s future 
investment plans 
Balance sheet and financing
At 31 December 2017 the Group had net assets of 
£15 0 million which is an increase of £4 9 million 
from the 2016 net asset position of £10 1 million 
following the Group’s profitable trading 
performance in the year  The balance sheet 
continues to strengthen with cash balances 
increasing and residual redress obligations 
complete  The Group has not drawn against its 
borrowing facility at the year end 
Subsequent to the balance sheet date the Group 
has extended its borrowing arrangements, in the 
form of a committed £5 0 million revolving credit 
facility (RCF), for a period of three years to 
February 2021  The RCF has been extended on 
improved terms with the margin decreasing to 
2 5% and certain other conditions being reduced 
or removed  
Events after the balance sheet date 
The Group completed a minority investment in 
KYND on 6 March 2018  The Group has acquired 
20% of the share capital of KYND for a total 
consideration of £1 2 million  The consideration 
is payable in two tranches with £0 5 million paid 
and a further £0 7 million payable following the 
satisfaction of certain conditions

the year has significantly reduced the 
Group’s restricted cash balances  
Restricted cash will now represent cash 
required to be held for regulatory

27 Strategic report Risk management  
and principal risks
The Group’s risk framework enables risks to be 
identified, measured, managed, monitored and 
reported consistently and objectively.
In assessing what constitutes reasonable assurance, 
the Board considers the materiality of financial and 
non-financial risks and the relationship between 
the cost of, and benefit from, the system of 
internal control 
Risk library 
The risk library supports the risk framework and 
allows risks to be discussed consistently, it allows 
the aggregation of risk at a country and Group level 
and it provides a complete view of exposures 
The library consists of a hierarchy of risk levels, with 
each level representing further granularity  Level 1 
represents the highest level of risk reporting in the 
Group  The Group has five Level 1 risks; financial, 
business, reputational, operational and conduct  
Level 1 risks are further subdivided to allow allocation 
of ownership throughout the countries and the 
International Support Centre 
Risk & Control Self-assessment
Central to the risk framework is the ability to identify 
and measure risks and controls and put in place 
appropriate actions to manage them  To achieve this 
a quarterly process has been embedded, where each 
country will consider its exposure and associated 
controls against the risk library; this is known as a 
Risk & Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)  The output 
of these are discussed at various committees 
including the Group Risk & Compliance Committee 
Risk environment
During the year we have continued to improve 
the Risk Management Framework and embed 
new processes which ensure risk and controls 
are discussed and managed throughout the 
organisation  As a business we recognise the 
importance of having an open and honest risk 
culture which encourages debate and discussion 
on the issues and risks affecting the business 
T o support the risk framework CPP operates a ‘three 
lines of defence’ model across the Group  Each 
country is responsible for the risk framework, with 
oversight and challenge from Group control 
functions and independent review carried out by 
Internal Audit 
The focus of our risk management framework is to 
ensure the Group is managed in a sustainable and 
controlled way, making risk-based decisions within 
our tolerance 
During the year the framework has been enhanced 
by introducing a risk library and embedding a risk 
and control self-assessment process 
Internal control and oversight
The Group Board has overall responsibility for the 
system of internal control and for monitoring its 
effectiveness  The Group Audit Committee and 
Group Risk & Compliance Committee operated 
throughout the year, each overseeing the 
system of internal control and the risk 
management framework 
Material risks or control matters, together with the 
appropriate management action plan, are reported 
to the Board via the Group Risk & Compliance 
Committee or the Group Audit Committee  The 
Board monitors the ongoing process by which 
critical risks to the Group are identified, evaluated 
and managed 
The system of internal control is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the 
Group’s objectives and provides assurance against 
material misstatement or loss  
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 28 Principal risks and uncertainties
Key risk Description Mitigation Status
FINANCIAL
Funding 
and liquidity
There is a risk that CPP cannot meet its 
actual or potential obligations in a timely 
manner as they fall due or CPP cannot 
maintain a diversified, stable and 
cost-effective funding base 
The overall liquidity profile is actively 
managed, ensuring that the business plans 
and strategy are effective and aligned  The 
FCA and PRA have lifted the capital and 
asset restrictions previously placed on the 
UK regulated entities, CPPL & HIL, and the 
Group has recently extended the term of its 
revolving credit facility  In addition the sale 
of certain capital assets has further enhanced 
the cash available to the business  
BUSINESS
Strategic 
execution
There is a risk that CPP is unable to execute 
its chosen Group and country level strategy  
This could be as a result of a change to external 
or internal factors such as capabilities and/or 
market conditions 
During the year the Group changed 
its operating model by devolving greater 
control and responsibility to the operations 
within country  In doing so the countries 
have reviewed their operating models and 
put in place the appropriate resources 
and frameworks locally 
A Group transformation programme 
(reviewed by Group Internal Audit) was 
put in place to support the devolution 
of responsibilities to country  This was 
accompanied by a people plan to embed the 
appropriate skills within each country and 
strengthen the operational capabilities 
Countries have been given support from the 
International Support Centre to ensure that 
this model is appropriate  It is recognised that 
these models are relatively new and could 
change further 
REPUTATIONAL
 Business 
reputation
There is a risk to CPP of reputational 
damage or credit loss arising from: the 
provision of products and services to 
customers that engage in activities that 
represent a reputational risk; the provision 
of inappropriate products or transactions 
(e g  complex structures, tax or regulatory 
arbitrage or avoidance); or from a lack of 
consistency across the Group 
High standards of conduct and a principled 
approach to regulatory compliance are integral 
to our culture and values  We consider key 
reputational risks when initiating changes 
in strategy, products or our operating model  
In addition, we have frameworks to address 
other risks that could affect our reputation 
such as conduct risk and operational risk 
Third parties 
and business 
partners
We have a number of key supplier relationships 
as part of our business model, particularly in 
respect of insurance underwriting, product 
distribution and operational call centres  
Third party business partner risk relates to 
the risk that partners may seek to end or 
change existing relationships or may not be 
able to meet their agreed service level terms  
There is a significant risk that without ongoing 
engagement with business partners our 
primary route to market could be constrained 
The Group continues to engage with 
business partners to ensure the smooth 
continuation of services while at the same 
time developing and monitoring plans 
for alternative arrangements and new 
distribution opportunities  Regular audits 
of third party suppliers are undertaken, 
and Group Internal Audit reviews internal 
procedures in respect of third party suppliers 
in line with Board approved plans

OPERATIONAL
Technology and 
infrastructure
The risk of technology failures as a result 
of ageing or out of support technologies, 
disrupting the business operations such as 
information security incidents or service outages  
During the previous year the Group exited its 
relationship with the external IT provider 
(SSP Limited) and embarked on an IT 
transformation plan to support its 2020 
vision and the devolved operating model  
Currently the Group’s IT services (systems 
and software engineering, applications 
support, data and BI management) are 
provided by an IT Hub  
The Group has a robust governance and delivery 
framework which is applied throughout its 
transformation  Progress and deliverables are 
regularly assessed to ensure they are being 
effectively managed and controlled  The Group 
has a Data Centre Migration programme 
underway which will update our IT estate and 
provide greater flexibility and improved 
resilience  Work is underway to deliver a 
standalone Chinese infrastructure and CPP’s 
purchase of Blink provides the opportunity to 
adopt alternative approaches to the delivery 
of software and services for new product 
where required  The IT transformation plan 
is being supported by an external consultancy 
to develop, articulate and validate the 
2020 vision 
Data governance There is a risk that CPP is unable to extract 
accurate and complete data to support 
operational decision making and accurate 
reporting and meet regulatory requirements 
Throughout 2017 the majority of countries in 
which CPP operates have been reviewing their 
data protection principles and introducing new 
reforms and legislation  This has particular 
significance for certain markets where General 
Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) 
compliance is mandatory  We continue to 
review the impacts of these reforms on our 
existing processes and procedures to 
ensure compliance 
The company has recruited a Group 
Head of Data Management (data protection 
officer) whose responsibilities include data 
management across the Group and managing 
the programme of work to ensure GDPR 
compliance  A funded programme of work 
is in place to review our data practices and 
ensure that we remain compliant with 
all applicable laws 
Business 
resilience
There is a risk that CPP is unable to prevent, 
detect, respond or recover adequately from 
disruptive or impactful events 
Business continuity management is a core 
management function, and an integral part 
of planning and management processes 
undertaken across the Group in respect 
of both the current and future capability 
The Group has initiated a programme of work 
to review existing continuity plans ensuring 
that they are tested and remain fit for purpose  
Additionally the Group has a data centre 
migration programme underway to change 
how our data is hosted improving data resilience 
while remaining fully PCI compliant

OPERATIONAL continued
People There is a risk that failure to attract and 
retain high performing individuals able to 
develop and train colleagues to discharge 
their obligations effectively, may lead to 
insufficient capacity to manage our critical 
systems and processes 
During the year the company has restructured 
the operating model to become more efficient, 
devolving responsibilities to the countries  This 
can represent a risk in terms of knowledge and 
experience lost and put increased demand 
on our remaining colleagues  There is a risk 
that any significant unplanned attrition of 
key individuals or delay in recruiting locally 
could adversely impact the business and 
its transformation 
The Group has identified key skills and role 
dependencies and takes steps to recruit and 
retain these within the business  The Group 
continues to be successful in recruiting 
and attracting fresh talent and new skill sets 
to ensure we continue to be able to deliver 
our plans  As a result of the new operating 
model, headcount has been reduced in the 
International Support Centre and investment 
made in each country to put in place the 
appropriate resources  
CONDUCT
Regulatory 
compliance,

lifecycle and

There is a risk of customer detriment arising 
from inappropriate conduct, practice or 
behaviour and failing to meet customer 
needs, interests or expected outcomes  
The risk of fines, penalties, censure or other 
sanctions arising from failure to identify or 
meet regulatory requirements  
The risk that new regulation or changes to 
existing interpretation has a material effect 
on the Group’s operations or cost base 
We promote a strong compliance 
culture across the Group, and put the 
interests of customers first and value 
good relationships with regulators in all 
our markets  Our compliance functions 
across the Group support local management 
in identifying and meeting existing and 
future regulatory obligations 
Our approach includes: a culture in which 
colleagues are encouraged to focus on good 
customer outcomes; a focus on simple 
innovative products that meet customer 
needs; and robust controls, governance, 
training and risk management processes  
Regulatory and legal change is monitored 
by compliance, legal and risk teams in 
country with oversight by the Group  
Work has been completed in the UK 
during the year to conduct product reviews, 
embed a conduct risk forum and to put in 
place supporting management information 
and a compliance dashboard  This will be 
progressed with other countries across 
the Group during 2018 
EMERGING
Emerging risks Emerging risks are those with uncertain 
impact, probability and time frame that could 
impact the Group  These are the hardest to 
define  We analyse each risk and, if needed, 
develop and apply mitigation and 
management action plans 
The external emerging risks that are currently 
our focus of attention include the impact of 
sustained volatility in our Turkish market and 
changes to the regulatory environment in 
India  We continue to consider the impacts 
of Brexit and the increase in cyber threats

33 Corporate governance Corporate governance report
Chairman’s introduction
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present 
our corporate governance report for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 . 
As your Chairman, I am responsible for 
ensuring that the Board operates within 
a sound governance framework and the 
following report outlines how the Group has 
applied the principles of the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code published by the Financial 
Reporting Council (the Code). The Board 
understands the importance of ensuring that 
there is a strong governance framework in 
place which underpins the Group’s ability 
to achieve its strategic goals. 
Although compliance with the Code is not 
mandatory for companies admitted to AIM, 
the Board acknowledges the importance of the 
principles set out in the the Code and continues to 
establish a framework of policies and procedures 
designed to comply with the Code as far as is 
reasonably practicable and appropriate for a 
company of its size and complexity.
The Board
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the strategic direction, 
management and control of the Group’s activities and remains committed 
to high standards of corporate governance. The Board was strengthened 
in 2017 by the appointment in September of Tim Elliott as an additional 
independent Non-Executive Director and we were pleased also to 
welcome a new Group CFO, Oliver Laird, in June.
Board evaluation
At the date of this report, the Board is carrying out an externally 
facilitated Board effectiveness evaluation with BP & E Global who has 
no other connection with the Group. The evaluation is expected to be 
completed during the second quarter of 2018.

and commercial strategy;
• material changes to the Group’s corporate structure, 
including any acquisitions or disposals;
• ensuring maintenance of a sound system of internal

35 Corporate governance How the Board operates
The full schedule of matters reserved to the Board is available on 
the Group’s corporate website international.cppgroup.com. 
Other powers are delegated to the various Board Committees and 
to senior management. Details of the roles and responsibilities 
of the Board Committees are set out on pages 38 to 43 and copies 
of all terms of reference are available on the Group’s website. 
Papers for Board and Committee meetings are circulated 
in advance of the relevant meeting. Board papers include 
reports from the Group CEO, Group CFO, People & Culture 
Director and Company Secretary. Any Director who is unable 
to attend receives a full copy of the papers and has the 
opportunity to comment on the matters to be discussed. 
The Board held seven scheduled meetings during the year, 
with additional ad hoc meetings and calls arranged 
as necessary.
All meetings of the Board and its Committees are minuted 
by the Company Secretary. In the first instance, minutes are 
reviewed by the Chairman of that meeting before being 
circulated to all Directors in attendance and then tabled 
for approval at the next meeting.
Each member of the Board has access to all information 
relating to the Group and to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary (who is responsible for ensuring that 
Board procedures are followed). All Board members also have 
access to external advice at the expense of the Group, should 
they need it. 
Chairman and Chief Executive 
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are 
separate, clearly defined in writing and have been agreed by 
the Board.
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board, 
ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role and setting 
its agenda. 
The Chief Executive is responsible for the day-to-day running 
of the business and is accountable to the Board for its 
operational and financial performance. 
The Role of the Chairman
• Leadership of the Board and setting its agenda.
• To ensure that the Board as a whole plays a full and 
constructive part in the development and determination 
of the Group’s strategy and overall commercial objectives.
• To act as guardian of the Board’s decision-making processes.
The Role of the Group Chief Executive
• Day-to-day running of the Group’s business.
• Proposing and developing the Group’s strategy and overall 
commercial objectives in close consultation with the 
Chairman and the Board.
• Implementing, with the support of the executive team, 
the decisions of the Board and its Committees.
Full details of the roles of the Chairman and Group 
Chief Executive are published on the Group’s website.
Board balance, independence and appointments
The Board’s primary role is to provide leadership to the Group, 
to set the Group’s long term strategic objectives and to develop 
robust corporate governance and risk management practices.
The Board aims to ensure that the balance between 
Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors reflects 
the changing needs of the business and allows the Board to 
exercise objectivity in decision making and proper control 
of the Group’s business.
As at the date of this report the Board comprises the 
Chairman, who, at the time of his appointment satisfied 
the independence criteria as set out in the Code, three 
Non-Executive Directors and three Executive Directors. 
During the year under review, Nick Cooper was not deemed 
to be independent in accordance with the Code due to his 
temporarily extended role, although the Board considered 
him to be independent in character and judgement; the 
extended role came to an end on 31 December 2017. 
The Board has reviewed the independence of each of the 
Non-Executive Directors and concluded that all are 
independent at the date of this report.
The Chairman holds regular informal meetings with 
Non-Executive Directors without the Executive 
Directors present.
On joining the Board, Non-Executive Directors receive a 
formal appointment letter, which identifies the estimated 
time commitment expected of them. A potential Director 
candidate is required to disclose all significant outside 
commitments prior to appointment and the Board requires 
disclosure and approval by the Board of all additional 
appointments for Executive or Non-Executive Directors. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors and service contracts of Executive Directors are 
available to shareholders for inspection at the Group’s 
registered office during normal business hours.
Information and professional development
The Board receives at its meetings detailed reports from 
senior management on the performance of the Group and 
other information as necessary. Regular updates are provided 
on relevant legal, corporate governance and financial 
reporting developments and Directors are encouraged to 
attend external seminars on areas of relevance to their role.
Appropriate training and induction is made available to any 
newly appointed Director, having regard to any previous 
experience they may have as a Director of a public company 
or otherwise. In addition to any guidance that may be given 
from time to time by the Company Secretary, Directors are 
encouraged to devote an element of their time to self-
development through available training.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. The removal and appointment of the 
Company Secretary is a matter reserved for Board approval. 
The Board also obtains advice from professional advisers as 
and when required.
Re‑election
All Directors are subject to retirement by rotation in 
accordance with the Articles of Association. Biographies 
for all Directors can be found on page 33.

Relations with shareholders
The Board is committed to maintaining good relationships 
with shareholders and the Chairman is responsible for 
ensuring that appropriate channels of communication are 
established between the Executive Directors and 
shareholders, ensuring that the views of shareholders are 
made known to the Board. 
Members of the Board maintain regular dialogue with the 
Company’s largest shareholders.
All shareholders have the opportunity to convey their views 
and make enquiries by email or telephone.
The Group maintains a corporate website 
(international.cppgroup.com) which complies with AIM 
Rule 26 and contains a range of information of interest to 
institutional and private investors, including the Group’s 
annual and half-year reports, trading statements and all 
regulatory announcements relating to the Group.
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) provides the Board 
with an opportunity to meet and communicate directly with 
private investors. Details of the AGM and the resolutions to 
be proposed are contained in the notice accompanying this 
Annual Report and available to download from our corporate 
website, international.cppgroup.com. Voting at the AGM 
will be conducted by a poll and the results announced to 
the market and displayed on the Group’s website as soon as 
possible following the meeting.
Internal control and compliance
The Audit Committee and the Risk & Compliance Committee 
have received regular reports on compliance with Group policies 
and procedures. On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee 
and the Risk & Compliance Committee confirm that, through 
discharging their responsibilities under their terms of reference 
as described on pages 38 and 39, they have reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls and 
are able to confirm that necessary actions have been or are 
being taken to remedy any failings or weaknesses identified.
Full details of the Group’s system of internal control and 
its relationship to the corporate governance structure are 
contained in the risk management and principal risks section 
of this report on pages 28 to 31.
Conflicts of interest
The Company Secretary keeps a record of any actual or 
potential conflict of interest declared by the Directors. 
Directors are required to declare any specific conflicts 
that arise from each Board agenda and a Director would 
be expected to refrain from voting on any matter that 
represented an actual or potential conflict of interest.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects 
of the Group over a three-year period. The Directors consider this 
to be an appropriate period of review for the following reasons: 
• it reflects the typical cycle of the Group’s borrowing 
arrangements; and
• it reflects the performance period in respect of the Group’s 
long term incentive plans.
The Group has a formalised process of budgeting, reporting 
and review along with procedures to forecast its profitability 
and cash flows. The plans provide information to the Directors 
which are used to ensure the adequacy of resources available 
for the Group to meet its business objectives, both in the short 
term and in relation to its strategic priorities. The Group’s 
revenue, profit and cash flow forecasts were subject to robust 
downside stress testing over the assessment period, which 
involved modelling the impact of a combination of plausible 
adverse scenarios. This was focused on the impact of the 
Group’s key operational risks crystallising.
In making the assessment the Directors acknowledge that, 
whilst the Group is operating from a stable financial platform, 
the strategy and longer term viability of the Group is based on the 
successful adoption of the Group’s operating strategy, leading to 
growth acceleration across key markets and some uncertainty 
in the medium to long term remains as this work is ongoing. 
Based on the results of the analysis performed, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over a period of at least three years.

Corporate governance report continued
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 38 Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present my first report since being 
appointed as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee in September 2017 . The 
Audit Committee has clearly defined 
terms of reference which set out its 
objectives and responsibilities. These 
will be kept under review to ensure that 
the Committee remains effective in 
fulfilling its duty to provide assurance 
to the Board as to the integrity of 
the financial statements and the 
effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls. 
Meetings and membership
Only Committee members are entitled to attend meetings. 
Others may attend by invitation of the Committee Chairman. 
During the year the external Auditor, the Executive Directors 
and the Head of Internal Audit attended most meetings to 
report to the Committee and provide clarification and 
explanations where appropriate. The Chairman of the Audit 
Committee also meets on a regular basis with the Head of 
Internal Audit and the external Auditor without executive 
management present. 
Each member is considered to possess up to date and 
appropriate financial or accounting experience and continues 
to be independent for the purposes of the Code. The Board is 
satisfied that the Audit Committee, as a whole, has sufficient 
experience and competence relevant to the Group’s business.
Main activities during the year
The Committee fully recognises its role of protecting the 
interests of shareholders and other stakeholders with regard 
to the integrity of published financial information and the 
effectiveness of the audit. The main activities of the 
Committee during the year were:
Financial statements
The Committee reviewed and discussed financial disclosures 
made in the annual results announcement, the Annual 
Report & Accounts and the half-yearly financial report, 
together with any related management letters, letters of 
representation and reports from the external Auditor. Key 
financial reporting and accounting issues are shown in the 
table on page 40.
External Auditor
The Committee has responsibility for overseeing the 
relationship with the external Auditor and approves the 
external Auditor’s engagement letter, audit fee and audit and 
client services plan (including the planned levels of 
materiality). The external Auditor attends meetings as 
appropriate and meets at least annually with the Committee 
without executive management present. The Chairman of the 
Committee also meets privately with the external Auditor 
from time to time.
During the year, the Committee received regular detailed 
reports from the external Auditor, including a formal written 
report dealing with the audit objectives, the Auditor’s 
qualifications, expertise and resources, the effectiveness of 
the audit process, the procedures and policies for maintaining 
independence and compliance with the ethical standards 
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. The Committee is 
satisfied with the performance of the external Auditor during 
the year and the policies and procedures in place to maintain 
its objectivity and independence. Having considered the 
quality, objectivity and independence of the audit teams and 
the quality of their work completed across the Group, the 
Audit Committee has recommended that Deloitte LLP be 
reappointed at the forthcoming AGM.
Auditor’s independence, objectivity and effectiveness
Fees paid to the external Auditor are shown in note 7 to the 
consolidated financial statements. The external Auditor may 
provide non-audit services from time to time. The Committee 
keeps under review the level of non-audit fees as a proportion 
of the total fees paid to Deloitte LLP and is satisfied that any 
non-audit work that has been carried out during the year 
is appropriate.

Auditor’s independence, objectivity and effectiveness 
continued
The following controls are in place to ensure that Auditor 
objectivity and independence are safeguarded:
• a policy on the use of the Auditor for non-audit work has 
been agreed by the Committee. This ensures that work 
would usually only be awarded when, by virtue of the 
Auditor’s knowledge, skills or experience, the Auditor is 
clearly to be preferred over alternative suppliers. This 
policy is appended to the Committee terms of reference 
which is available on the Group’s website;
• the Committee receives and reviews each year an analysis 
of all non-audit work awarded to the Auditor over the 
financial period; and
• the Committee receives each year a report from the 
external Auditor outlining any matters that the Auditor 
considers bear on its independence and which need to be 
disclosed to the Audit Committee. 
The Committee has a formal process to assess the 
effectiveness of the external Auditor, which is carried out 
on an ad hoc basis following the completion of the audit. 
It takes the form of a detailed questionnaire completed 
by members of the Committee and senior members of 
the finance team who regularly interact with the external 
Auditor. The results of the questionnaire are reported to 
and discussed by the Committee.
Internal audit
The Committee approves the annual internal audit plan 
and methodology, monitors progress against the plan and 
receives reports after each audit. Progress against actions 
identified in these reports is monitored by the Committee 
at regular intervals.
The Committee has assessed the resources the Internal Audit 
department has to complete its remit and has approved the 
use of external consultants to supplement it if necessary, 
particularly in areas requiring specialist skills. The appointment 
and removal of the Head of Internal Audit is the responsibility 
of the Committee. The Internal Audit department continues 
to have unrestricted access to all Group documentation, 
premises, functions and employees, as required. The Head 
of Internal Audit has direct access to the Board and the Audit 
Committee and is jointly accountable to the Audit Committee 
Chairman and Group CFO. 
Committee effectiveness
The Board effectiveness evaluation referred to on page 34 will 
include a review of the effectiveness of the Audit Committee.
Advice to the Board
The Board sought the advice of the Committee as to whether 
the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. The Committee 
adopted a formal process to enable it to satisfy itself that this 
was the case, before advising the Board.
Regular updates are provided to the Committee on 
developments in financial reporting and related legal and 
corporate governance matters.
The Committee has access to the services of the Internal 
Audit department and the Company Secretary and is 
authorised to obtain independent professional advice if it 
considers it necessary.
Key financial reporting and accounting issues
The primary areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the 2017 financial statements and how these were 
addressed by management are shown below:
Area of judgement Management action
Cessation of commission 
payments to certain business 
partners in the UK
The Committee has received explanations from executive management during the year 
in relation to continued correspondence with the affected business partners and potential 
exposures. The Committee has challenged the information and has determined it is 
comfortable with the Group’s position on the matter.
Recognition and impairment 
of retained capitalised 
software costs
The Committee receives reports from executive management detailing the Group’s non-current 
asset position and the support for carrying values. The Committee has challenged the papers 
assessing the adequacy of approach in relation to IAS 38 and IAS 36 and is comfortable that 
the balances are accurately reflected. 
Revenue recognition The Committee receives regular updates from executive management on the Group’s revenue 
recognition policies in relation to IAS 18 and has concluded that revenue recognition continues 
to be dealt with appropriately. This view is supported by the Auditor’s report.

Directors’ remuneration report
Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Directors’ remuneration report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 .
During the year the Remuneration 
Committee continued to review 
the Group’s long term and short term 
incentive arrangements. Details of 
these arrangements are summarised 
within this report and included 
in the detailed disclosure notes 
to the financial statements.
The following information on Directors’ 
remuneration is disclosed mindful of 
Rule 19 of the AIM Rules and the fact 
that, as the Company is listed on AIM,

Directors’ remuneration report continued
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 42 Current share plans
2016 Long Term Incentive Plan
This plan was introduced in January 2016, and options were 
awarded to the Executive Directors and certain members of 
the senior management team. A further, more limited, award 
was made under the plan in April 2017, which included a 
subsequent award made to Oliver Laird in November 2017. The 
options will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, 
subject to the achievement of specified performance targets. 
Matching Share Plan (MSP)
Under the MSP, which was introduced in June 2015, the then 
Executive Directors and certain members of the senior 
management team were given the opportunity to purchase 
shares for consideration of 3 pence per share (the ‘Investment 
Shares’). The price of 3 pence per share reflected that paid by 
the external investors at the time of the share placing in 
February 2015. For each Investment Share purchased, 
options over three ‘Matching Shares’ were awarded. These 
options, which have an exercise price of 1 penny, will vest over 
a three-year period – 25% vesting on the first anniversary of 
grant, 25% on the second anniversary and 50% on the third 
anniversary. The second tranche of awards made in June and 
November 2015 vested during the year. No performance 
conditions apply to these options, but participants must 
retain all of their Investment Shares for the full three-year 
period, otherwise any unexercised options will lapse. No 
further awards will be made under the MSP.
Clawback and malus provisions apply to both the above plans.
Legacy share plans
2010 Restricted Stock Plan (RSP)
The RSP was a non-performance-based share plan aimed at 
incentivising the second tier of management across the 
Group and Executive Directors were not eligible to participate. 
Employment was the only performance condition attached to 
this plan. All awards made under the plan are fully vested. 
Employee Share Ownership Plans
The Company has two further legacy share plans introduced 
prior to the IPO in 2010 (the 2005 Plan and the 2008 Plan), 
which have not yet expired. There are no performance 
conditions attached to these shares other than relating to 
employment. The exercise price for the 2005 Plan is £2.28 
and for the 2008 Plan £1.79. None of the current Directors 
hold options under either of these plans.
Shareholder dilution 
In line with the ABI guidelines, the rules of the current incentive 
schemes provide that commitments to issue new shares or 
reissue treasury shares, when aggregated with awards under all 
of the Company’s other schemes, must not exceed 10% of the 
issued ordinary share capital in any rolling ten-year period 
commencing on admission of the Group’s shares to AIM.
Newly issued shares or shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust 
(EBT) are currently used to satisfy the exercise of all employee 
and Executive options.
Directors’ shareholdings
The Directors who were in post at the end of the year under review held the following beneficial interests in the Company’s 
ordinary shares:

Company’s admission to AIM, for so long as Mr Ogston and 
any person or corporate body connected to him (a ‘Controlling 
Shareholder’) holds, in aggregate, 30% or more of the 
ordinary shares or the voting rights attaching to the shares, 
Mr Ogston shall not and shall procure that each Controlling 
Shareholder shall not:
• vote in favour of, or propose any resolution to amend the 
Articles of Association which would be contrary to the 
principle of the independence of the Company from the 
shareholder or any of the Controlling Shareholders;
• take any action which precludes any member of the Group 
from carrying on its business independently of Mr Ogston 
or any Controlling Shareholder; or
• take any action (or omit to take any action) to prejudice the 
Company’s status as a Company admitted to AIM or its 
suitability for admission to AIM or the Company’s 
compliance with the AIM Rules, other than in the 
circumstances of a takeover or merger of the Company.
Employee Benefit Trust
The total number of ordinary 1 penny shares held by the 
EBT as at 31 December 2017 was nil (2016: 4,051,126). 
(See note 30 to the Financial Statements.)
Going concern
In reaching their view on the preparation of the Group’s 
financial statements on a going concern basis, the Directors 
are required to consider whether the Group can continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group has continued to trade profitably during 2017 and 
taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, the forecasts show that the Group has the 
necessary resources to trade and operate within the level of 
its borrowing facilities. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.
Employees
The Group is committed to employment policies that provide 
equality of opportunity to all employees based only on their 
relevant skills and capabilities and that ensure no employee 
or applicant is treated unfairly on any grounds, including 
ethnic origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability. 
Every possible support will be offered to any employee who 
becomes disabled during the course of their employment, 
with reasonable adjustments made wherever possible.
The Group communicates with employees by means of 
regular business updates and weekly CEO blogs on the 
intranet. The CEO also holds informal ‘in-touch’ sessions 
with small groups of employees. 
Anti‑bribery and corrupation
The Group is committed to ensuring that it has effective 
processes and procedures in place to counter the risk of 
bribery and corruption. A formal anti-bribery policy is in 
place and appropriate training is provided according to 
the level of risk attached to a role.
Modern Slavery Act 
The Group has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery 
and will not knowingly support or deal with any business 
involved in slavery and/or human trafficking. Our Modern 
Slavery Policy reflects our commitment to maintaining 
ethical practices in all of our supply chains and across our 
business. The steps taken to help manage the risks outlined 
by the legislation are detailed in our Modern Slavery 
statement which will be published annually on our website 
and can be found at international.cppgroup.com/modern-
slavery-statement.
Auditor
Each person who is a Director at the date of approval 
of this report confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s Auditor is 
unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought 
to have taken as a Director in order to make him/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s Auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in 
office as Auditor. Accordingly, a resolution to reappoint 
Deloitte LLP will be proposed at the AGM.

45 Corporate governance Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report & Accounts in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the Directors are required to prepare the 
consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, including 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts until 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and 
the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for that period.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance 
with the specific requirements in IFRS are 
insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the Group’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
In preparing the Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether the Financial Reporting Standard 
101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ has been 
followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the Company financial statements 
on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial reporting 
framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit/loss of 
the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
• the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 46 Independent Auditor’s report
To the members of CPPGroup Plc
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of CPPGroup Plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
• the consolidated income statement;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated and Company balance sheets;
• the consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity;
• the consolidated cash flow statement; and
• the related notes 1 to 36.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law 
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 
the Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• cessation of commission payments to certain business partners (BPs) in the UK;
• recognition and impairment of retained capitalised software costs; and
• revenue recognition.
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was £1,050,000 which was 
determined on the basis of 1.2% of revenue.
Scoping The Group audit scope involved performing full audits on the Group’s significant components in the 
UK and Ireland, India and Spain, with audit of specified account balances in the components of Italy 
and Turkey. In aggregate our testing covered more than 90% of the Group’s revenue, 91% of the 
Group’s profit before tax and 92% of the Group’s net assets.
Significant changes  
in our approach
The key audit matters are consistent with those identified in the prior year, with the exception of 
the removal of going concern. During 2017 the restrictions on capital and assets held in the UK 
regulated businesses was lifted by the FCA and/or PRA which has enabled the Group to access 
sufficient cash to reduce the risk relating to going concern. 
47 Financial statements Independent Auditor’s report continued
To the members of CPPGroup Plc
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement in note 3 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to do so 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the Directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent 
with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the 
evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 28 to 31 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 37 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the Directors’ explanation on page 37 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we 
have nothing 
material to report, 
add or draw 
attention to in 
respect of these 
matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Cessation of commission payments to certain business partners in the UK
Key audit matter 
description
In 2015, the Group made the decision to cease the payment of commissions to certain BPs in the UK. 
The cessation of commission payments has been agreed with a number of the affected BPs, although 
the position with other BPs is not yet finalised.
We identified a key audit matter with regard to the judgements made by Management in relation to the 
timing of de-recognition of contractual liabilities, the quantification of costs relating to the settlement 
of contractual commission obligations with BPs and the disclosure of the matter under the requirements 
of accounting standard IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. 
Reference to this matter is included in the critical judgement and key sources of estimation note on 
page 64, the provision note at page 79 and in the Report of the Audit Committee at page 39. The Group 
has presented a provision in respect of this matter within trade payables and accruals. 
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 48 Cessation of commission payments to certain Business Partners (BPs) in the UK continued
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
We reconfirmed our understanding of Management’s process obtained through prior audit work to 
identify the key controls relating to this matter. 
We assessed the design and implementation of the governance review control in respect of the key 
judgements made.
We assessed the reasonableness of Management’s judgement by reviewing the legal contracts with the 
BPs and the correspondence received since the cessation of commission payments was communicated.
We assessed the quantification of potential exposure by independently determining a range of 
reasonable possible outcomes and reviewed the application of the limited disclosures made in the 
Annual Report and Accounts for compliance with the requirements in IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets for such legal matters.
Key observations We found the accounting and limited disclosure due to the risk of legal prejudice in relation to this matter 
to be in line with the requirements of IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Recognition and impairment of retained capitalised software costs 
Key audit matter 
description
In 2016 the Group abandoned an IT software development project to replace the current policy 
administration system with a customised ‘off the shelf ’ package to be delivered by a third party, SSP, 
in favour of an in-house solution. A significant impairment charge of £6.4m was recognised in 2016 as 
a result.
 The Group began 2017 with £1.3m of capitalised software costs relating to this matter retained in the 
balance sheet that it considered would generate future benefits in use through the in-house IT system. 
During 2017, the Group reassessed its strategy for IT system use and booked an impairment charge of 
£0.9m against costs that it did not consider would generate future benefit to the Group.
We identified a key audit matter with regards to the judgements taken by the Group in relation to the 
value of costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation detailed in IAS 38 – Intangible Assets, that have 
reusable value in the alternative software platform and the timing of when strategic decisions were 
made which trigger the timing that impairments have been recognised. 
The Group’s associated accounting policies are detailed on pages 58 to 63 with detail about judgements 
in applying accounting policies, in note 17 on page 73 Intangible Assets and in the Report of the Audit 
Committee at page 39.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
We understood Management’s process for assessing the re-usable element of capitalised costs by 
undertaking a walk-through to identify the key controls. 
We assessed the design and implementation of the governance review control in respect of key 
judgements in relation to the future benefits that will be generated from the workflows where costs 
have been capitalised. 
We reviewed the judgements made by the Group for each work stream in respect of the costs 
capitalised against the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting standard 
IAS 38 – Intangible Assets by testing a sample of costs to underlying supporting evidence. 
We assessed whether the alternative software platform was likely to be complete and the value of 
future benefits expected to be generated to the Group through review of internal meeting minutes and 
Group forecasts.
We also reviewed committee minutes and IT strategy documentation prepared in 2017 to assess if a 
change in Group strategy for the IT systems had occurred and whether it is appropriate for the 
impairment to be recognised in the current year. 
We evaluated the value of capitalised costs in the balance sheet against the results of our 
independent assessment.
Key observations We concluded that the accounting treatment of the impairment of capitalised costs by the Group 
is reasonable.
49 Financial statements Revenue recognition
Key audit matter 
description
There are significant judgements involved in applying the Group’s revenue recognition policies across 
multiple products, in particular:
• determining the revenue recognition policy for new products and where considered appropriate 
implementing the deferral of revenue where the Group has future servicing obligations to 
customers; and
• the allocation of revenue between introducing and servicing activities, particularly in India where a 
number of different customer benefits are bundled within products. 
In addition, the completeness and accuracy of revenue, in particular the quantification of revenue 
journals is reliant on IT system reports and automated controls operating effectively.
We have determined that revenue recognition is a key audit matter due to the level of judgement as 
described above in complying with IAS 18 – Revenue. 
The Group’s associated accounting policies are detailed on pages 58 to 63 and are discussed in the 
Report of the Audit Committee at page 39.

We understood Management’s process for recognising revenue by undertaking a walk-through to 
identify the key controls, and data flows. 
We assessed the design and implementation of key manual controls used to reconcile journal entries to 
underlying customer databases and cash received in the bank.
We tested the operating effectiveness of centrally managed group-wide key automated controls in the 
core administration systems used to trigger renewal and refund transactions and to generate journal 
entries to the general ledger. 
We also assessed the design and implementation of the governance review of revenue recognition 
policies for new products launched. 
We challenged the Group’s method of allocating revenue between introductory and servicing activities 
by reviewing the underlying evidence used to support this allocation.
We independently re-calculated the Group’s material revenue streams from an independent extraction 
of source policyholder data and substantively tested a sample of revenue entries to underlying 
supporting evidence. 
We evaluated the appropriateness of revenue recognition policies applied by reference to the terms 
and conditions of the underlying products and tested the reconciliation of recorded revenue against 
cash collection. 
Key observations We considered the revenue recognition policies to be compliant with IAS 18 – Revenue.

To the members of CPPGroup Plc
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 50 Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in 
planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Materiality £1,050,000 (2016: £820,000) £525,000 (2016: £410,000)
Basis for determining 
materiality
Below 1.2% of revenue (2016: below 1.2% 
of revenue). 
Company materiality equates to less than 1% of net 
assets (2016: below 1% of net assets).
Materiality has been capped at 50% (2016: 50%) of 
Group materiality to ensure appropriate coverage in 
the scope of our audit procedures when aggregated 
to a Group level.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We used revenue to determine the Group 
materiality because it has been the most 
consistent benchmark over recent years 
when profit before tax has been unusually 
volatile and is not considered to be the key 
benchmark at the current time. Revenue 
is also the key metric used by Management 
to measure the performance of new sales 
and the sustainability of renewal portfolios 
of the Group.
We used net assets to determine the Company 
materiality because it is the key benchmark for a 
holding company. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £50,000 
(2016: £16,400) for the Group and for the Company, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. The change in the reporting threshold has been made following our reassessment of what 
matters require communicating. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at five locations (the United Kingdom 
and Ireland, India, Spain, Italy and Turkey). Three of these were subject to a full audit (2017 and 2016: United Kingdom and 
Ireland, India and Spain), whilst the remaining two (2017 and 2016: Turkey and Italy) were subject to an audit of specified 
account balances where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the 
materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations. 
These locations represent the principal business units and account for 92% (2016: 93%) of the Group’s net assets, 90% (2016: 88%) 
of the Group’s revenue and 91% (2016: 95%) of the Group’s profit before tax. 
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement 
identified above. Our audit work at the five locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity 
which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from £420,000 to £570,000 (2016: £110,000 to £430,500).
At the Company level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion 
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining 
components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the 
Group audit team visits each of the locations where the Group audit scope was focused at least once every two years. We 
included a location visit to Spain in our planning of the audit; in 2016 we visited India. In years when we do not visit a significant 
component we will include the component audit partner and team in our team briefing, discuss their risk assessment, and 
review audit work performed and findings identified by component audit teams. 
51 Financial statements Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report including the Strategic Report and Corporate Governance 
Report, other than the financial statements and our Auditor’s Report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the 
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the 
Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.

57 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements
1. General information
CPPGroup Plc (the Company) is a public company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies 
Act 2006 and domiciled in the United Kingdom. Its registered office is 6 East Parade, Leeds LS1 2AD. The Group comprises 
CPPGroup Plc and its subsidiaries. The Group’s principal activity during the year was the provision of assistance products.
The consolidated and Company financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in the Companies Act 2006, Section 408, not to present its own income 
statement. The Company reported a loss after tax for the year of £1,565,000 (2016: £4,168,000). There have been no dividends 
received from subsidiary undertakings in either the current or prior year.
2. Adoption of new Standards
New Standards adopted
The following Standards and Interpretations have become effective and have been adopted in these financial statements. 
Their adoption has not had any material impact on the Group. No Standards or Interpretations have been adopted early in these 
financial statements.
Standard/Interpretation Subject
IAS12 (amendments) Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses
IAS 7 (amendments) Disclosure Initiative
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014–2016 cycle
Standards not yet applied
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following relevant Standards and Interpretations, which have not been 
applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU):
Standard/Interpretation Subject
Period first applies 
(year ended)
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 31 December 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 31 December 2018
IFRS 2 (amendments) Share-based payment transactions 31 December 2018
IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 31 December 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 31 December 2019
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts 31 December 2021
The Group has estimated applying IFRS 15 revenue from contracts with customers as materially impacting the accounting for 
deferred revenue in the case of certain contracts. It is anticipated that there will be a material impact on revenue recognition and 
profit across the Group. If IFRS 15 was applied to 2017 reported revenue under current contractual arrangements, the estimated 
impact would have been to increase revenue for 31 December 2017 in the range of £9 million to £11 million, and due to changes 
in timing of recognition of certain cost elements, a decreased profit in the range of £2 million to £3 million. The application 
of IFRS 15 may result in the identification of separate performance obligations in relation to future launched new products which 
could affect the timing of the recognition of revenue going forward. The application of IFRS 15 will change the timing of the 
Group’s profit performance. The overall lifetime profit margins associated with the Group’s contracts are not impacted. 
The Group plans to apply IFRS 15 initially on 1 January 2018, using the full retrospective approach. Therefore the comparative 
information will be restated in the 30 June 2018 interim financial statements.
3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements on pages 54 to 89 present the performance of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2017. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The consolidated financial 
statements have also been prepared under the historical cost basis. The comparative period balance sheet has been represented 
to separately disclose deferred revenue due to the material nature of this balance. Deferred revenue was previously presented 
within trade and other payables. 
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC). Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework as issued by the FRC incorporating the Amendments to FRS 101 issued by the FRC in July 2015 and July 2016. 
The Company financial statements have also been prepared under the historical cost basis.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to standards not 
yet effective, presentation of a cash flow statement, share-based payments and related party transactions.
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 58 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Going concern
The Board of Directors has, at the time of approving the consolidated financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus it continues 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Further details of the Directors’ 
assessment are set out in the Directors’ report on page 45. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash flows, assets and liabilities of the Company and the entities 
under its control. Control is achieved when the Company has power over the investee; is exposed or has rights to variable return 
from its involvement with the investee; and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies. 
This power is generally accompanied by the Group having a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The results 
of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal. Adjustments are made, where necessary, to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with Group policies. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income 
and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Exceptional items
Items which are exceptional, being material in terms of size and/or nature, are presented separately from underlying business 
performance in the consolidated income statement. The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide an indication 
of the Group’s underlying business performance.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured 
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a 
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable 
can be measured reliably.
Share-based payments
Subsequent to the transfer to AIM the Group has issued share options under the Matching Share Plan (MSP) and the 2016 
Long Term Incentive Plan (2016 LTIP). Costs in relation to the MSP and 2016 LTIP are disclosed within administrative expenses; 
however, MSP costs are not included in underlying operating profit due to the one-off nature of the plan. 
Prior to the Company’s shares being transferred to AIM, the Group had issued share options to certain of its employees through 
the Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) and the Restricted Stock Plan (RSP). There are no costs recognised in relation to these 
plans in the consolidated income statement. Options under these plans have vested and remain available for exercise. 
Share options are treated as equity settled if the Group has the ability to determine whether to settle exercises in cash or by the 
issue of shares. Share options are measured at fair value at the date of grant, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest, and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions each year. Non-market vesting conditions 
include a change in control of the Group and are considered by the Directors at each year end. The fair value of equity settled 
share-based payments is expensed in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, subject to adjustment for forfeited options.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair 
value of the liability. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the 
liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.
The fair value of share options is measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.

Revenue
Assistance products revenue
Revenue attributable to the Group’s assistance products is comprised of the prices paid by customers for the assistance 
products net of any cancellations, sales taxes and underwriting fees dependent on the terms of the arrangement. 
Revenue is generally recorded by the Group under two categories: as intermediary in the policy sale and administration process 
and for ongoing services where an obligation exists to provide future services. Fees receivable in the Group’s role as 
intermediary are recognised on inception of the arrangement. Service fees are deferred and recognised over the period of the 
underlying contract. Provisions for cancellations are made at the time revenue is recorded and are deducted from revenue.
For certain other of the Group’s assistance products, there are no introduction fees. In these arrangements, revenue is 
comprised of the subscriptions received from members, net of underwriting fees and exclusive of any sales taxes. These 
subscriptions are recognised over the life of the service provided.
Wholesale revenue is generally comprised of fees billed directly to business partners, exclusive of any sales taxes, and is 
recognised as those fees are earned.
Non-policy revenue is comprised of fees billed directly to customers or business partners for services provided under separate 
non-policy based arrangements. Such revenue is recognised, exclusive of any sales taxes, as those fees are earned.
Deferred revenue
The Group recognises deferred revenue on its balance sheet, relating to revenue for the obligation to provide future services, 
typically claims handling and policy administration services. In these situations an amount of revenue is deferred over the life of 
the policy sufficient to cover future claims handling and service costs and an appropriate profit margin. A cost plus margin 
approach is used to determine the appropriate level of deferment, due to there being no observable market value for such 
features. The assessment of future costs and expected number of incidences is validated by reference to experience of historical 
actual costs and volume. Service revenue is then recognised in equal instalments over the life of the policy.
Insurance revenue
Insurance contracts are those contracts that transfer significant insurance risk at the inception of the contract. Insurance risk is 
transferred when the Group agrees to compensate a policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (other than a change in a 
financial variable) adversely affects the policyholder.
Revenue attributable to the Group’s insurance contracts comprises premiums paid by customers and is exclusive of any sales 
taxes and similar duties. Premiums from insurance policies are recognised as revenue on a straight line basis over the life of 
the policy.
Provisions for unearned premiums are made, representing the part of gross premiums written that is estimated to be earned in 
the following or subsequent financial periods, on a straight line basis for each policy. The provision for unearned premiums is 
recorded under insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Acquisition costs are amortised over the life of the average policy. Acquisition costs which are expensed in the following or 
subsequent accounting periods are recorded in the balance sheet as deferred acquisition costs and include a proportionate 
allowance for commissions and post-sale set up costs incurred in respect of unearned premiums not amortised at the balance 
sheet date.
Insurance claims provisions
Claims incurred comprise the Group’s claims payments and internal settlement expenses during the period, together with the 
movement in the Group’s provision for outstanding claims over the period, including an estimate for claims incurred but not 
reported. Differences between the estimated cost and subsequent settlement of claims are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement in the year in which they are settled.
Discontinued operations
Operations are classified as discontinued when they are either disposed of, are part of a single co-ordinated disposal plan or are 
to be abandoned and represent a major line of business or geographical area of operation.
Business combinations
The acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for acquisition of 
a subsidiary are measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquired business. The acquired identifiable 
assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ are 
measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Notes to the financial statements continued
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 60 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually.
On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture operation, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 
gain or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
Externally acquired software
Externally acquired software is measured at purchase cost and is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
of four to five years.
Internally generated software
Internally generated intangible assets arising from the Group’s software development programmes are recognised from the 
point at which the following conditions are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified;
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and 
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated software is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of four to five years.
Contractual arrangements with third parties
The Group’s contractual arrangements can give rise to intangible assets. Where a contractual payment gives access to and 
control of future economic benefits, in the form of future renewal income streams, this amount is recognised as an asset and 
then amortised in line with the forecast benefits over the shorter of the contractual arrangement and the period when benefits 
are expected to arise.
Intangible assets arising from business combinations
Intangible assets arising from business combinations are initially stated at their fair values and amortised over their useful 
economic lives as follows:
• Business partner relationships: in line with the relevant projected revenues.
Business partner relationships represent the present value of net revenues and costs expected to arise from contractual 
arrangements and non-contractual relationships with existing and pipeline business partners at the date of acquisition.
Amortisation of contractual arrangements with third parties is charged to cost of sales. Amortisation of all other intangible 
assets is charged to other administrative expenses.
Impairment
Annually the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted at their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit may be increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash generating unit in prior years. 
61 Financial statements 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are shown at purchase cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the costs, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected 
useful life as follows:
Freehold property:  40 years straight line
Computer systems: 4 – 5 years straight line
Furniture and equipment: 4 years straight line
Leasehold improvements: Over the shorter of the life of the lease and the useful economic life of the asset
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits with a term from inception of three months or less, less 
bank overdrafts where there is a right to offset. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no 
right to offset with cash balances in the same currency.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation
Taxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior 
years. Taxation is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case the tax is also included within equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
year using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all taxable and deductible temporary differences at the balance 
sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised 
or liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiary undertakings 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority and the Group/Company intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Pension costs
Pension costs represent contributions made by the Group to defined contribution pension schemes. These are expensed as incurred.
Foreign currencies
In preparing the financial information of the individual entities that comprise the Group, transactions in currencies other than 
the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on 
the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences 
are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign entities are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and are translated at the closing rate.
On disposal of foreign operations, the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously recognised directly in equity 
for that foreign operation are transferred to the consolidated income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 62 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Trade receivables, loans, other receivables or cash and cash equivalents that have fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for any estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Investments in debt and equity securities are classified as either available for sale or fair value through profit and loss. 
Available-for-sale financial assets are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial asset. Financial assets held at fair value through profit and loss are initially recognised at fair value 
and transaction costs are expensed.
Where securities are designated as ‘fair value through profit and loss’, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are 
included in the income statement for the period. For ‘available-for-sale’ investments, gains or losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised in other comprehensive income, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which 
time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in the income statement for 
the period. Equity investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be 
reliably measured by other means are held at cost.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. They are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective 
yield basis.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of assumptions, estimates and 
judgements that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses. Actual results in the future may differ from those reported. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
Critical judgements
Revenue recognition
The Group has made judgements over the appropriate levels of recognition of revenue on inception of policies and the 
appropriate level of revenue to defer over the duration of the policies. Deferred revenue is based on the ongoing cost of call 
handling and service costs and an appropriate profit margin. Judgement is made over the levels of future costs likely to be 
incurred in providing ongoing services. Levels of revenue deferral vary dependant on contractual arrangements, country 
specific cost factors and experience of historical actual costs and volumes.
Classification of exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items that are required to be separately disclosed on the income statement by virtue of their size or 
incidence or have been separately disclosed on the income statement in order to improve a reader’s understanding of the 
financial statements. Consideration of what should be included as exceptional requires judgement to be applied. Exceptional 
items are considered to be ones which are material and outside of the normal operating practice of the Group.

Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
Contractual matters
The Group has made certain commercial and contractual decisions that are not yet agreed with all affected parties. The Group is 
satisfied with its position from both a legal and regulatory perspective. Appropriate financial provisions are in place in respect of 
these matters and are included in trade and other payables. The Group has taken advantage of the reduced disclosures available 
within IAS 37 as it does not consider it appropriate to disclose the detail of contractual matters as it may prejudice any future 
discussions.
The appropriate level of financial provision may vary and impact the consolidated income statement depending on the outcome 
of any future discussions with those parties affected.
Deferred tax asset
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of £1,554,000. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Due to the uncertainty associated with such tax items it is feasible that at a future date, on conclusion of possible taxable profit 
outcomes, the final utilisation may vary significantly. The value recognised as a deferred tax asset is a judgement within 
a range of reasonable future forecast sensitivities of up to £5,900,000 to a reduction in assets entirely. Deferred tax assets 
are currently recognised under the assumption of forecast profits on a short-term assessment basis. 
5. Segmental analysis
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are 
regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The Group is managed on the basis of three broad geographical regions:
• UK and Ireland;
• Europe and Latin America (Spain, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Mexico and Portugal); and
• Asia Pacific (India, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore).

Major product streams are disclosed on the basis monitored by the Board of Directors. For the purpose of this product analysis, 
‘retail assistance policies’ are those which may be insurance backed but contain a bundle of assistance and other benefits; ‘retail 
insurance policies’ are those which protect against a single insurance risk; ‘wholesale policies’ are those which are provided by 
business partners to their customers in relation to an ongoing product or service which is provided for a specified period of time; 
and ‘non-policy revenue’ is that which is not in connection with providing an ongoing service to policyholders for a specified 
period of time.
Disclosures in notes 8, 20 and 24 regarding accounting for insurance contracts provide information relating to all contracts 
within the scope of IFRS 4 and therefore include both retail insurance policies and the insurance components of retail assistance 
and wholesale policies.

Changes to the expected life of classes of policies will therefore impact the period in which these items are recognised.

UK corporation tax is calculated at 19.25% (2016: 20.00%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. Taxation for other 
jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. The UK Finance (No 2) Act 2015 was enacted on 
18 November 2015. It provided for a reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017. 
The UK Finance Act 2016 was enacted on 15 September 2016. It provides for a further reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020. 
As these rates were substantively enacted prior to 31 December 2017, they have been reflected in the UK deferred tax balance 
at 31 December 2017.

14. Earnings/(loss) per share
Basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’. Underlying 
earnings per share have also been presented in order to give a better understanding of the performance of the business. In 
accordance with IAS 33, potential ordinary shares are only considered dilutive when their conversion would decrease the earnings 
per share from continuing operations attributable to equity holders. The diluted loss per share is therefore equal to the basic 
loss per share in the prior year.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected 
to benefit from that business combination. The goodwill relates to Blink Innovation Limited (Blink).
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there is indication goodwill may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in 
use calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. 
Management estimates discount rates using rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks 
specific to the CGU. The growth rates are based on business plans and reflect the start-up nature of the CGU. The pre-tax rate 
used to discount the forecast cash flows of the CGU at 31 December 2017 is 12.0%.

The carrying value of the Group’s core platform in development has been reduced to its recoverable amount through recognition 
of a total impairment loss of £880,000 in its UK and Ireland segment. The impairment loss has been reflected against internally 
generated software (£259,000) and externally generated software (£621,000). The impairment loss has been included as an 
exceptional item on the consolidated income statement (refer to note 6). 
Impairment of an externally generated software intangible asset in its UK and Ireland segment representing capitalisation of a 
website has been identified. The carrying value of this asset has been reduced to £nil through recognition of an impairment loss 
of £440,000 against amortisation charges within administrative expenses. 
Externally acquired software additions of £319,000 in the year include £86,000 relating to the Blink website recognised 
on acquisition (refer to note 32).

During the current year the Group has recognised the reversal of prior year impairment in respect of the freehold land and property 
totalling £506,000. The reversal reflects a change in the basis of the recoverable amount to disposal value less costs to sell of 
£4,944,000. The impairment reversal has been recognised as an exceptional item through the consolidated income statement 
and relates to the UK and Ireland segment. The fair value basis is categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
On 30 June 2017, the Group disposed of the freehold land and property for total consideration of £5,325,000.

Amounts due from policyholders and intermediaries and amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent the total exposure 
to credit risk in respect of insurance activities.
Credit is not generally offered to retail customers on insurance premiums. No interest is charged on insurance receivables 
at any time.
Individually or collectively material insurance receivables are reviewed for recoverability when an adverse change in credit quality 
is identified or when they become overdue. Credit risk is reduced as insurance receivables are dispersed amongst a broad 
customer base. Credit risk is mitigated through maintaining and managing the customer base.
The Group’s insurance receivable balance does not include any debtors which are past due at the balance sheet date in either 
the current or prior year. 
There have been no overdue but unprovided debts in either the current or prior year.

Trade and other receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing.
The Group’s trade receivables relate to retail customer payments awaiting collection and wholesale counterparties. 
The Group is responsible for activating the collection process for our retail customers. The collection is received within 
a specified period of processing the transaction resulting in credit risk being considered low for these items. 
Where wholesale counterparty balances are individually or collectively material, they are reviewed for recoverability when an 
adverse change in credit quality is identified or when they become overdue. The Group has low historical levels of customer and 
counterparty credit defaults, due in part to the quality of the relationship it has with its counterparties and their credit ratings. 
Where credit is offered to customers, the average credit period offered is 26 days (2016: 21 days). No interest is charged on trade 
receivables at any time. Disclosures regarding credit risk relate only to counterparties or customers offered credit. 
Overall exposure continues to be mainly spread over a large number of customers but where concentration exists this is with 
highly rated counterparties.
There are no debtors (2016: £46,000) included in the Group’s trade receivable balances which are past due at the reporting date, 
for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group believes that the 
amounts are still recoverable. All balances in the comparative period had been past due for less than 90 days.

23. Cash and cash equivalents
Consolidated cash and cash equivalents of £31,465,000 (2016: £28,250,000) comprises cash held on demand by the Group 
and short term deposits.
Cash and cash equivalents includes no cash required to be maintained by the Group’s insurance business for solvency purposes. 
During the year the VVOP asset restrictions previously in place in the Group’s regulated entities, HIL and CPPL, have been lifted. 
The VVOP previously prevented cash held within HIL and CPPL being distributed to the wider Group without the appropriate 
regulatory approval. The comparative cash and cash equivalents therefore included £18,727,000 which was held in HIL and 
CPPL either for solvency purposes or due to the VVOP restrictions.
Concentration of credit risk is reduced, as far as practicable, by placing cash on deposit across a number of institutions with 
the best available credit ratings. The credit quality of counterparties is as follows:

2016

B 50 —
Rating information not available 1,729 137
 31,465 28,250
Ratings are measured using Fitch’s long term ratings, which are defined such that ratings ‘ AAA ’ to ‘BBB’ denote investment 
grade counterparties, offering low to moderate credit risk. ‘ AAA ’ represents the highest credit quality, indicating that the 
counterparty’s ability to meet financial commitments is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events.

The Group’s bank borrowing facility is in the form of a £5,000,000 revolving credit facility (RCF). The Group is entitled to roll over 
repayment of amounts drawn down, subject to all amounts outstanding falling due for repayment on expiry of the facility on 28 
February 2018. At 31 December 2017, the Group has £5,000,000 undrawn committed borrowing facilities (2016: £5,000,000).
The RCF bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 4%. It is secured by fixed and floating charges on certain 
assets of the Group. The financial covenants of the RCF are based on the interest cover and minimum total cash balance of the 
Group. The Group has been in compliance with these covenants since inception of the RCF . 
On 28 February 2018, the £5,000,000 RCF was extended for a three-year term to 28 February 2021. The extended RCF bears 
interest at a reduced variable rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.5%. The facility continues to be secured by fixed and floating 
charges on certain assets of the Group and has the same financial covenants as the previous facility.
The Second Commission Deferral Agreement related to an agreement with certain business partners to defer the payment 
of commissions for a period of two years to 31 January 2017. The agreement bore interest at a rate of 3.5% and was by secured 
charges over assets in CPPL. The Second Commission Deferral Agreement expired and was settled during the year.
The weighted average interest rates paid during the year were as follows:

The onerous leases and associated costs provision carried forward from the prior year reflected the future lease payments and 
associated costs in the expected non-utilisation period at a vacated office in the UK. This provision of £667,000 has been fully 
utilised in the year. During the year an onerous leases and associated costs provision of £490,000 was identified on a further 
office in the UK.
The customer redress and associated cost provision comprises anticipated compensation payable to customers through 
residual customer redress exercises and associated professional fees. 
The Group has made certain commercial and contractual decisions that are not yet agreed with all affected parties. The Group 
is satisfied with its position from both a legal and regulatory perspective. Appropriate financial provisions are in place in respect 
of these matters and are included in trade and other payables.
Provisions are expected to be settled within one year of the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are stated at tax rates expected to apply on the forecast date of reversal, based on tax laws 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where the Group or the Company is entitled to and intends to settle 
tax liabilities on a net basis. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes:

Deferred tax liabilities — (103) — — 
 1,554 715 514 346
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of £33,816,000 (2016: £35,033,000) available for offset against 
future profits. No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of these losses (2016: £1,406,000). No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of the remainder of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the underlying companies 
and restrictions on offset of taxable profits and losses between Group companies. Included in unrecognised deferred tax assets 
are losses of £4,631,000 (2016: £5,400,000) which, if not used, will expire between one to twelve years (2016: one to twelve years). 
Other losses will be carried forward indefinitely.
There is no deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings as the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At the balance sheet date the Company has unused tax losses of £17,202,000 (2016: £17,202,000) available for offset against 
future profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit 
streams in the Company and restrictions on offset of taxable profits and losses between Group companies. The losses can be 
carried forward indefinitely.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern.
The Group does not have a target level of gearing but seeks to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity while aiming 
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group’s principal debt facility during the year was 
a £5.0 million RCF with an expiry date of 28 February 2018. The £5.0 million RCF was extended on 28 February 2018 for a 
three-year term to 28 February 2021.
The Group makes adjustments to its capital structure in light of economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure 
the Group may adjust a dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Directors have 
considered the capital requirements of the Group, including the availability of cash reserves, and have not proposed a final 
dividend in respect of the current year.
Externally imposed capital requirement
Two of the Group’s principal subsidiaries, CPPL and HIL, have capital requirements imposed by the FCA and PRA in the UK. Both 
subsidiaries have complied with their respective imposed capital requirements throughout the current and prior year.
Card Protection Plan Limited
CPPL is regulated by the FCA as an insurance intermediary and is required to hold a minimum level of capital resources relative 
to regulated business revenue.
The ratio of current and future capital resources to regulated business revenue is reported monthly to management to ensure 
compliance. There have been no instances of non-compliance in either the current or prior years.
Homecare Insurance Limited
HIL is authorised and regulated by the PRA and regulated by the FCA as an insurance underwriter and therefore maintains its 
capital resources in accordance with the PRA ’s Rulebook. HIL and its immediate parent company, Homecare (Holdings) Limited, 
calculate their Solvency Capital Requirement using the Solvency II Standard Formula and report this quarterly to the HIL Board 
and to the PRA. As at 31 December 2017, HIL ’s ratio of eligible funds to meet its Solvency Capital Requirement was 203%. There 
have been no instances of non-compliance in either the current or prior year. 
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of non-derivative financial instruments is determined using pricing models based on discounted cash flow 
analysis using prices from observable current market transactions; hence, all are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
Financial assets and liabilities are carried at the following amounts:
Financial assets
 
2017
£’000
2016 
£’000
Loans and receivables 39,060 34,589
Loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, insurance assets and taxes receivable.
There is no significant difference between the fair value and carrying amount of any financial asset.
Financial liabilities
 
2017
£’000
2016 
£’000
Financial liabilities at amortised cost 29,944 43,869
Financial liabilities at amortised cost comprise borrowings, trade creditors, accruals, taxes payable, insurance claims and provisions.
There is no significant difference between the fair value and carrying amount of any financial liability, since liabilities are either 
short term in nature or bear interest at variable rates.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s activities expose it to the risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Board of Directors 
determines the Treasury Policy of the Group and delegates the authority for execution of the policy to the Group Treasurer. 
Any changes to the Treasury Policy are authorised by the Board of Directors. The limited use of financial derivatives is governed 
by the Treasury Policy and derivatives are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that short and medium term interest rates fluctuate. The Group manages 
this risk through the use of interest rate swaps, when appropriate, in accordance with its Treasury Policy. There has been no use 
of interest rate derivatives in either the current or prior year. The interest cover (being defined as the ratio of underlying EBITDA 
to interest paid) at 31 December 2017 was 52x (2016: 37x).

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to movements in LIBOR. The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 2% increase in LIBOR 
rates throughout the year. 2% represents the Directors’ assessment of a reasonably possible change in LIBOR rates. The sensitivity 
analysis includes the impact of changes in LIBOR on yearly average cash and bank loans.

Foreign currency risk
The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk where it has investments in overseas operations which have functional 
currencies other than sterling and are affected by foreign exchange movements. The carrying amounts of the Group’s principal 
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are as follows:

Eurozone sensitivity analysis
The Group operates in countries with euro denominated currencies. Following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union 
sterling has continued to weaken during the year against the euro exchange rate. As the UK moves through the exit process this 
has potential to result in further fluctuations in the euro which would impact the translation of the Group’s results and represents 
a risk to the Group. The Group’s ongoing Eurozone operations are in Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. A 20% deterioration 
in the sterling to euro exchange rate throughout the year would have decreased Group profits relating to these Eurozone entities 
by £350,000 (2016: £459,000). With the exception of foreign exchange movements, the Group does not consider operations to 
be significantly at risk following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. Current business activities are wholly serviced 
within the country of operation and are not extensively conducted under passporting arrangements. This should reduce the 
potential risk to the Group’s operations from the UK leaving the European Union.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group does not actively hedge its credit risk.
The Group’s retail trade and insurance receivables are mainly with a broad base of individual customers and are therefore not 
generally exposed to any one customer, resulting in low credit risk.
The Group’s wholesale activities can result in material balances existing with a small number of counterparties and therefore 
increased credit risk exists. The Group continues to maintain some wholesale contracts and considers that it mitigates this credit risk 
through good quality relationships with counterparties and only partnering with counterparties with established credit ratings. 
Counterparty credit limits are determined in accordance with the Treasury Policy for cash and cash equivalents and the Counterparty 
and Credit Risk Policy for receivables. Any balance that falls into an overdue status is monitored. Further details of the monitoring 
of and provision for overdue debts are outlined for insurance assets in note 20 and trade and other receivables in note 22.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 82 29. Financial instruments continued
Liquidity risk
The Group has a policy of repatriation and pooling of funding where possible in order to maximise the return on surplus cash 
or minimise the level of debt required. Group Treasury continually monitors the level of short term funding requirements and 
balances the need for short term funding with the long term funding needs of the Group. Additional undrawn facilities that 
the Group had at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk are included in note 26. 
Compliance with financial ratios and other covenant obligations of the Group’s bank loans is monitored on a monthly basis 
by Executive Directors and by the Board of Directors at each Board meeting.

Liabilities
The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities, based on the undiscounted

Insurance risk
The Group applies a prudent approach to its management of potential exposure to risks arising from its insurance contracts.
The lines of policies underwritten are limited to general insurance classes underwritten by HIL, an entity within the Group, which 
is authorised and regulated by the PRA and regulated by the FCA. The lines of risk underwritten are restricted by HIL to those 
lines where HIL has experience or lines that the Group wishes to move into where it can enter such a line of business in a 
risk-controlled manner after appropriate Board consideration and regulatory approval.
The Group’s lines of insurance business, and thus its insurance risk portfolio, are primarily focused on high volume, low transaction 
value, short term individual lines.
The Group’s policy is to establish a specific claims provision at any point in time on each line of business, based on claims 
reported up to and including the last day of each accounting period, including an element to represent claims incurred but not 
yet reported. Details of claims provisions carried are provided in note 24.
The Directors consider the following to be the principal insurance risks and actions taken, reducing risk to an acceptable level:
Changes in rates of claims
Trends in claim rates and other market data are reviewed on a regular basis and premiums for contracts are adjusted accordingly. 
Each class of contract has a large population of homogeneous policyholders and no insurance contracts are subject to 
concentration risk.
A 10% deterioration in the loss ratio during the year would have resulted in a £14,000 decrease in profit before tax and 
reduction in shareholders’ equity (2016: £37,000), 10% representing the Directors’ assessment of the reasonably possible 
change in the loss ratio.
Changes in settlement cost per claim
The quantum or nature of settlement amounts is specified in policy documentation and the Group is not exposed to significant 
open-ended commitments. Although settlement costs are not capped, they generally vary within a small range, limiting the 
Group’s exposure.
Reliance on key suppliers
The Group makes use of third party suppliers to fulfil the majority of claims. The performance and financial position of key 
suppliers are regularly monitored and alternative lines of supply are sourced as necessary.
The Group therefore considers its exposure to risk arising from its insurance contracts to be appropriately managed.

During the year, the Company issued 339,000 shares to option holders for total consideration of £3,397. Further details relating 
to share options are provided in note 31.
During the year 4,051,126 (2016: 711,874) ordinary shares held by the EBT were used to settle awards under the MSP and RSP. 
At 31 December 2017, the EBT holds no ordinary shares in the Company (2016: 4,051,126). The EBT has not purchased any 
shares in the current year. The value of shares held by the EBT to satisfy the MSP and RSP exercises has been recognised against 
the ESOP reserve. The increase in the ESOP reserve in the year is £327,000 (2016: £63,000 reduction).
Of the 856,820,499 ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 2017, 856,320,500 are fully paid and 499,999 are partly paid.
The ordinary shares are entitled to the profits of the Company which it may from time to time determine to distribute in respect 
of any financial year or period. 
All holders of ordinary shares shall have the right to attend and vote at all general meetings of the Company. On a return of 
assets on liquidation, the assets (if any) remaining, after the debts and liabilities of the Company and the costs of winding up 
have been paid or allowed for, shall belong to, and be distributed amongst, the holders of all the ordinary shares in proportion 
to the number of such ordinary shares held by them respectively.
Deferred shares have no voting rights, no rights to receive dividends and only very limited rights on a return of capital. 
The deferred shares have not been listed for trading in any market and are not freely transferable.
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 84 31. Share-based payment
Current share plans
Share-based payment charges comprise 2016 LTIP charges of £4,000 (2016: £582,000) and MSP charges of £277,000 
(2016: £902,000). These costs are disclosed within administrative expenses, although the MSP share-based payment charge 
forms part of the MSP charges which is not included in underlying operating profit. MSP charges in the income statement are 
different to the share-based payment charge due to the recognition of employer’s national insurance relating to future option 
exercises. There have been 16,197,000 options granted in the current year as part of the 2016 LTIP (2016: 26,050,000 options 
granted). There have been no MSP options granted in either the current or prior year.

shares are also subject to achievement of certain performance criteria including underlying operating profit targets and either 
a share price or non-financial events measure over the vesting period.
Options granted under the MSP have an exercise price of 1 penny and vest over a three-year period, with 25% vesting on the first 
anniversary of the grant date, 25% vesting on the second anniversary and 50% vesting on the third anniversary. Options lapse 
if not exercised within ten years of the grant date and will lapse if option holders cease to be employed by the Group or sell any of 
their investment shares. There have been no options granted in the current year (2016: nil) and options exercised in the current 
year total 4,385,000 (2016: 4,359,000).
The options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of two years (2016: two years) 
in the 2016 LTIP and no years (2016: one year) in the MSP.

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 86 32. Acquisition of a subsidiary
On 17 March 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Blink for initial cash consideration of £862,000 
(€1 million). The acquisition also allows for a further earn-out based on future profits and product development which is 
considered to represent remuneration rather than contingent consideration.
The net assets acquired and their provisional fair values at 17 March 2017 were:
Book value
£’000
Fair value

Intangible assets 17 — 86
Net assets acquired — 86

Acquisition costs 128
Cash acquired on acquisition —
Total cash outflow 990
On acquisition, the carrying value of the net assets of Blink was £nil. The Group has made a fair value adjustment of £86,000 to 
recognise an intangible asset relating to the development of the Blink website. The acquisition remains within the measurement 
period and the Group continues to evaluate all identifiable assets and liabilities.
Goodwill of £776,000 reflects the discounted future cash flows of Blink’s product offering (cancelled flight resolution), future 
development opportunities from the Blink team, as well as synergies to the Group from the acquired team’s expertise.
Acquisition costs of £128,000 have been recognised as an administrative expense through the consolidated income statement.
Included within the Group’s consolidated income statement is revenue of £nil and a loss before tax of £815,000 relating to Blink 
since the acquisition date and is the same as if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017.

89 Financial statements Glossary
Alternative performance measures
In reporting financial information, the Group presents alternative performance measures (APMs), which are not defined 
or specified under the requirements of IFRS. 
The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to be a substitute for or superior to IFRS measures, provide 
stakeholders with additional helpful information on the performance of the business. The APMs are consistent with how the 
business performance is planned and reported within the internal management reporting to the Board and Audit Committee. 
Some of these measures are also used for the purpose of setting remuneration targets.
The key APMs that the Group uses include: underlying operating profit and underlying earnings per share. Definitions of these 
are presented in the table below.
The Group reports revenue and underlying operating profit, on both a reported and constant currency basis. The constant 
currency basis, which is an APM, retranslates the current year reported revenues and underlying operating profits at the 
exchange rates applied in the prior year. This measure is presented as a means of eliminating the effects of exchange rate 
fluctuations on the year-on-year reported results.
