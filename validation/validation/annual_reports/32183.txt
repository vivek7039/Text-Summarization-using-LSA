I cannot believe the great 
service that I received from 
ao.com. I ordered my new 
washing machine at 1pm on 
Saturday and it arrived at 
1pm the next day. We were 
kept informed of delivery 
slots and the driver phoned 
half an hour before he was 
due to deliver so we could 
plan our Sunday. The 
delivery drivers were also 
really helpful. I would 
definitely use ao.com

First class 
delivery 
model
Our in-sourced seven-day 
delivery (six in Germany and 
the Netherlands) is first class. 
We offer our customers a wide 
range of delivery options 
including next-day and 
designated time slots so that 
they can pick the delivery that 
suits them. We can also install 
new appliances and remove 
and recycle the old ones too.
 
Having our own national delivery 
fleet operating out of a central 
distribution centre with a network 
of outbases, gives us control over 
our distribution chain. From the 
online purchase of a product 
through to its delivery to the 
customer and recycling of old 
products, we control all of the 
customer touch points

about The AO Way
 New washing 
machine
From placing the order , 
to tracking delivery online 
and installation, AO.com 
are the best company I 
have ever dealt with. I now 
don’t consider anyone else. 
This is the third white goods 
item I have bought from 
AO. Delivery guys were 
efficient and courteous in 
removing my old washing 
machine and installing my 
new one. Well done!!!

The  
AO Way
The AO Way is not any of these 
individual elements. It’s the way 
we stitch them all together through 
our bespoke infrastructure and 
our culture of simply caring more. 
Underpinning our business 
proposition is something that 
cannot be replicated: AO’s unique 
culture. As a business, we all live 
by our five values; bold, smart, 
driven, caring and fun. It’s 
important that people love what 
they do and strive to be the best 
they can be, whether that be our 
employees, the drivers or the 
manufacturers’ designers.  Geoff Cooper
Chairman
Over the past few months  
John (left) and Steve (right) have 
transitioned seamlessly into their  
new roles, each playing to their key 
strengths. Both remain as committed  
as ever to AO and to driving our  
unique culture.

Chairman’s statement
It has been a year of further progress for AO, with strategic 
developments on many fronts. 
AO has continued on its mission to become the best electrical retailer 
in Europe delivering on all aspects of its four pillar strategy, the 4Cs:
 – Developing new countries; 
 – Rolling out new categories in existing and new countries;
 – Delivering a market-leading proposition to customers; and
 – Developing and protecting our unique culture that underpins 
our brand.
Over the period, AO has established a new fully operational 
35,000 sq. metre Regional Distribution Centre in Bergheim, serving 
Germany and the Netherlands (which has now been trading for a full 
year); successfully launched new categories – audio‑visual (“AV”) in 
Germany and computing in the UK; maintained consistently high 
customer metrics and furthered our brand awareness.
In the last quarter of the financial year the Board reviewed the capital 
structure of the Group and raised, shortly after year end, c.£50m via a 
placing of new shares. This capital injection strengthens the balance 
sheet, provides flexibility to react to market opportunities and changes 
and, importantly, suitably capitalises the business to support our 
continued growth and increasing scale.
We have delivered another good year of top-line growth albeit with 
a challenging second half of the year which meant we missed our 
internal expectations. Group revenue increased by 17% to £701.2m. 
Year-on-year UK revenue was up 12.7% to £629.7m (with AO branded 
sales accounting for £557.9m, up 14.5% year on year). Revenue for our 
European segment was £71.5m/€84.7m; up 52.3% year on year on 
a constant currency basis.
Group Adjusted EBITDA losses for the period were £2.1m marking 
an improvement against prior year losses of £3.9m, with strong 
performance from the UK business more than offset by the trading 
losses incurred in our Europe business as we continue to build scale 
and achieve critical mass. UK Adjusted EBITDA was £24.4m, up 41.7% 
from the prior year and Europe Adjusted EBITDA losses were £26.5m, 
an increase of 25.5% against the prior year. On a statutory basis, our 
operating losses were £12m (such losses increasing 13.4% year on year 
due mainly to the share-based payment charge this year (with a credit 
in 2016)). Cash at year end was c.£29.4m, before taking account of net 
placing proceeds, which were received just a few days after the year end.
In February we announced a transition in our Executive Director roles, 
with Steve Caunce taking over as CEO and John Roberts assuming the 
role of Founder. This was a natural evolution and the Board is confident 
that Steve is the right person to take on the role from John to deliver the 
significant growth potential of the Group. John’s new role will enable 
him to continue to play to his strengths as an innovator and a visionary 
leader, helping develop and test high level strategy. Steve and John 
remain very much a partnership and together they will ensure that AO 
continues to deliver for customers, colleagues, suppliers and our investors.
There have also been some changes to the Board’s Non-Executive 
composition, following the retirement of Rudi Lamprecht as a 
Non-Executive Director and we are looking to appoint two further 
Non-Executives to the Board over the next few months. Further details 
are set out in the governance section on page 52.
In summary, the Group has continued to make good progress against its 
strategy. Whilst the Board continues to be cautious given the uncertain 
UK economic outlook and broadly expects the patterns of trading seen 
in the second half of FY2017 to continue into the year ahead (with UK 
business profits being reinvested in our European operations) the Board 
is confident of achieving its stated goals over the years ahead. 
Since taking the role of Chairman in July 2016 I have been impressed by 
the quality and enthusiasm of the Executive Directors and of the teams 
of people that support them and I look forward to working with them on 
their way to become the Best Electrical Retailer in Europe.

17 Dear Stakeholders,
Last month, I received a letter from a customer, Moira, with the subject 
title: “Love your company!” It’s quite long, but I’ve copied it opposite in 
full because it really gets to the heart of what I want to say in this letter.
At AO, we care more. It’s at the core of our business, it’s the reason 
we’ve succeeded, and it’s the reason we’ll continue to grow. It’s the 
thing that differentiates us. 
We have an amazing team of over 2,500 people in the business who 
live AO every day in a way that defines that difference; who understand 
our business from the customer’s point of view. But we’re not magicians; 
we don’t know what customers think through some special mind-reading 
method. Instead, we ask them, we listen to them, and then we innovate 
for them. 
You have to stay in touch with customers because they’re the ones 
who’ve got all the answers. I write a personal letter to every single 
customer who has written to me at AO with either a positive or a 
negative comment. I get amazing responses back because the 
customer feels a part of the movement we are creating.
But the biggest impact isn’t on them. It’s on us. We have to make 
sure that whatever we got wrong, we put right. We need to make sure 
they’re happy. We learn the lesson, and see it from their point of view. 
Like Peter, understanding and responding not only to Moira’s concerns, 
but applying it to the business as a whole to make things better for 
every one of our customers.
It’s not one silver bullet, but a hundred different things we just care 
more about. Being an AO’er is a lot more than a job – The AO Way is 
a way of life. It’s the backbone to our culture and, as we’ve grown and 
expanded into new territories, maintaining, cultivating and obsessing 
about this culture is critical. 
Earlier in the year, Steve succeeded me as Chief Executive Officer. This 
transition was the natural evolution of our succession planning work 
since IPO and reflects AO’s rapid growth and success. It ensures that 
we can capitalise on all the team’s strengths as we continue to grow – 
enabling me to focus on delivering for our customers and for AO’ers 
by playing to my strengths as an innovator, and enabling Steve to 
concentrate on strategy and performance delivery. He’s already 
making a big difference to how we operate as a business, and I’m 
immensely proud of our partnership. 
In my first letter to shareholders three years ago, I told you that we 
genuinely wanted to change the world of retail – to get customers to 
become intolerant of poor service and realise that they don’t have to 
accept it. That ambition hasn’t changed, and we’ve become relentless 
in our search for new markets, new ideas and new and better ways to 
serve our customers. Change is the only constant and we’re always 
thinking: “What’s next?”
So, what IS next? As I transition into the role of Founder , I want to look at 
how the next generation will shop and understand better what they’ll want 
and need from their experience. I want to examine how our brand partners 
are developing their technologies to stay relevant in a connected world 
and how we, as a business, can use innovative techniques to stay ahead 
of the competition whilst remaining true to our core values; harnessing 
technology, AI and digital channels to enhance the customer experience. 
And I want to explore how we can better empower and motivate our 
employees to innovate; encouraging our people to try new things and 
take new risks.
Steve and I also want to concentrate on our brand. A brand is what 
you are, who you are, why you are. The AO smiley face isn’t a bit of 
decoration; it says we want to make our customers smile and we want 
the people who sell to our customers to be smiling. We work very hard 
on making sure that our staff appreciate what we are trying to do. We 
are spread across many locations so only if everyone absorbs our 
brand values will we remain consistent. We’re making great strides 
across all our territories in brand awareness, but we’re not yet the 
household name we aspire to be. Honing in on our brand message, 
and getting it out there to people who haven’t used AO before, is one 
of our key challenges in the coming months. 
The sponsorship of this year’s Britain’s Got Talent has kick-started that 
challenge. It’s been an exciting project and has given us all something 
to smile about, especially those who’ve been lucky enough to star in 
some of the accompanying adverts. At AO, we’ve always maintained 
that happy staff equal happy customers. Underpinning our culture is 
the belief that you can’t pay people to care and you can’t tell people to 
have fun with customers; they’ve got to want to. Peter’s small gesture 
to Moira was unprompted, but it made a big difference to her overall 
customer experience. 
It is a story we need to tell better and to more people because AO.com 
really is a much easier way to shop for electricals and once people 
experience The AO Way they really get it. We have learned a lot of 
lessons on how to best tell that story over the last four years and we 
are getting better at it. It is by far our biggest single opportunity.
At AO, we want this ethos to go beyond the business, into the local 
communities in which we work. I’ve always believed that retailers have 
a responsibility to give back to their communities; that’s why we set up 
the AO Smile Foundation, providing support to disadvantaged young 
people across the UK. We actively encourage all our staff to get 
involved with the charity, and to make a positive impact within their 
local communities; each AO’er is able to take two “make a difference” 
days each year to work with a charity and last year they made over 
376 days of difference. I’m incredibly proud of that work. But I also 
believe that what you put in, you get back. In truth, we all get as much 
from our involvement with the AO Smile Foundation, as it gets from us. 
It’s another part of what makes AO such a great place to work. 
As Moira says, AO’ers are not people simply “going through the 
motions”, they are people who are inspired, empowered and happy 
in what they do. So a big thank you from Steve and me to the whole 
AO family, and a promise to keep on caring more as we continue on 
the next stage of the AO journey.

A letter from our Founder  
 
 
 
 
Love your company!
I recently purchased a fridge freezer from AO, primarily on the recommendation of a friend, and I wanted 
you to know it was the most positive customer experience I have had in a very, very long time.
 
Your website is good and easy to navigate, the choice of product is great, your prices are very competitive, 
your communications appropriate but most of all your people are fantastic. I had reason to “chat” on your 
website a couple of times and to call and speak to a customer service representative on two (or maybe 
three) occasions – not problems, just questions. Your staff could not have been more helpful, 
knowledgeable or “human” for want of a better word!
 
Of particular note was my conversation with your customer services representative Peter. For a start – 
all my phone calls were answered very promptly – quite a novelty in this day and age. I had a small 
concern re some of the wording in a confirmation email I received that seemed contradictory to your 
website information and I just wanted to clarify the actual installation service I was going to receive. 
Peter could not have been more helpful in investigating the concern and, upon agreeing the email wording 
was not right, advised me that “AO will probably have this template email corrected in a couple of hours 
so no further customers are confused.” Again, impressive. Peter went on to proactively give me a small 
refund as a “thank you” for bringing the matter to AO’s attention – a gesture that was unexpected but very 
much appreciated. If only all companies demonstrated their respect and appreciation for their customers 
so readily, unprompted and with good grace.
Towards the end of the conversation with Peter I told him how impressed I had been with all my contacts 
with AO and he told me how very much he enjoyed working for AO, that it is a great company and how 
he and his colleagues are treated as “human beings”, I think was the expression. 
These are not people “going through the motions”, they are clearly inspired, empowered and happy in 
their work. I thought that warranted comment. These days it is not often there is an opportunity to praise 
good customer service – I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed being able to write it.
Needless to say, I am telling all my friends to order from AO!
Kind regards
It’s great to get this type 
of customer feedback as 
it shows our customers 
recognise everything we 
have worked hard on 
over the years.

AO World Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
19 I’m pleased to report on the significant strategic and operational 
progress made during the financial year as we continue on our mission 
to be the best electrical retailer in Europe. This is the first time I’m 
reporting as CEO but, fundamentally, our approach has not changed 
and nor do I expect it or want it to: we remain relentless in pursuing 
our goal to be the best electrical retailer in Europe and, through 
focusing on our 4Cs strategy, we are confident we can deliver against 
that objective. 
We have a business model that differentiates us from our competitors, 
“The AO Way”, as set out on pages 36 and 37. While we obsess about 
each element, it isn’t the individual components of this model which 
give us our competitive advantage; it’s the way that we stitch them all 
together through our culture of caring more, making things easier for 
the customer and being exceptional in the moments that matter. That’s 
what makes us different. Our culture is absolutely crucial to us so, 
together with John, I’m looking to protect it, nurture it, and further 
embed it across the Group, particularly in our newer territories.
Looking back at the year, we have strengthened our foundations for 
future growth. In Europe, we opened our new regional distribution 
centre in Bergheim, near Düsseldorf; we have built a state-of-the-art 
recycling facility in the UK, we have added new categories to our 
offering in both the UK and Europe and, in launching computing, 
we have developed systems and infrastructure to operate a different 
distribution model, which we can leverage for future category 
roll-out across territories.
Trading this year has been mixed (particularly for our UK business). 
In the first half of the year, in the UK, our investment in marketing and 
brand translated into encouraging sales growth with some tailwinds 
from stamp duty changes in March 16. In the second half of the year, 
trading in the UK became more challenging as we began to feel the 
impacts of dampening consumer confidence following the UK’s vote 
to leave the EU, subsequent price inflation and a slow‑down in the 
UK housing market.
However, our customer service metrics remain exceptional across all 
of the countries in which we operate because we make it our mission 
to care more and we continue to innovate to create the best customer 
experience for tomorrow. This has helped us to continue to gain 
market share in our categories and countries, notwithstanding the 
challenging trading environment in the UK.
We remain as committed as ever to doing business The AO Way 
and continuing to deliver outstanding results for our customers, 
our people, our supplier partners and our investors. Our online 
market-leading proposition and the solid foundation we have built 
in mainland Europe have positioned us well for the future. Since year 
end we completed a share placing which will ensure our balance sheet 
is suitably capitalised to support our continued growth and increasing 
scale as we deliver our strategy. We will continue to be bold but 
responsible on where we allocate our resource.
In the past year we have demonstrated how to scale up in new 
countries and how to expand and grow product categories. When the 
time is right, we will replicate this approach in new geographies and 
categories. We have strengthened our foundations for growth and in 
line with our strategy we will continue to focus on and drive AO 
own-branded sales. Although our brand awareness has continued to 
grow during the period, it remains our greatest challenge and the key 
to longer-term success; we must push to drive this metric. We will 
achieve this through highlighting and explaining why customers 
should shop with AO: it’s simply that we care more. Going forward we 
will continue to work hard to ensure that AO becomes a household 
name and the obvious choice when shopping for electricals.
Further details on our performance in the year under review are set 
out in the next few pages. Put simply, I am proud to say that it has been 
another great year for AO thanks to our outstanding team of people. 
We will continue to execute our strategy in the year ahead and focus 
on demonstrating to more customers that The AO Way is the best way. 
It is easy, it can be trusted and we simply care more. This is 
our differentiator.

Chief Executive Officer’s Strategic Review
continued Culture & Brand
Our culture is our brand, our brand is our culture. 
T ogether, they are our greatest asset and provide us 
with a structural advantage over our competitors. 
Through nurturing and growing our culture we will be 
able to deliver the best customer experience, broaden 
our categories, expand into new countries, drive our 
operations and, ultimately, achieve our goal. 
We recruit and retain the best talent and look for people 
who are smart, bold and driven. They must care more, 
not only about our customers but other stakeholders of 
the business too, be it the manufacturers and suppliers, 
other employees and, of course, our drivers, and do it 
all with a sense of fun.
Our values can be found in every single one of our 
AO people. We hire and fire against them and they 
are everything our brand stands for; our culture and 
how our people act will be how our brand is 
perceived externally. 
The risks affecting our culture and brand are 
highlighted on pages 42 to 44.
Performance this year 
UK
Building brand awareness remains our biggest opportunity. During 
the year we continued to grow overall brand awareness and develop 
our brand strategy.
AO has historically been known for selling white goods and so, 
during the year, we have focused on educating our customers that 
AO is a multi-category electrical retailer, building momentum as we 
add more categories and products to our range. We sought to increase 
the effectiveness of our brand investment as we honed our TV adverts 
to illustrate the strong customer testimonials we receive. We also 
explored new advertising channels including radio, both national and 
local, together with print media through press advertising, billboards 
and other large formats. In the early part of the financial year we invested 
in those audiences where our sales profile was under‑indexed, 
in particular in Greater London and amongst male shoppers. 
Towards the end of the year we also commenced the process of 
significantly increasing the level of branding on our 3.5 tonne delivery 
truck fleet. This will continue to promote our brand on a daily basis 
across the country. 
As a result of the initiatives highlighted above our brand awareness 
continued to improve slightly over the period (including spontaneous 
and prompted awareness) although we did see a dip in the final 
quarter as marketing was postponed in anticipation of our Britain’s Got 
Talent (“BGT”) sponsorship – see further below. Our strong customer 
advocacy together with manufacturer endorsement (through joint 
advertising campaigns) have helped build trust in our brand and have 
helped to drive revenue growth. Our customer acquisition costs 
continued to fall during the 12 months to 31 March 2017 as we refined 
our online advertising strategy, improved our SEO (Search Engine 
Optimisation) rankings and benefited from an increase in direct traffic 
following our improved brand awareness and customer 
recommendations. 
However, more work needs to be done; our biggest opportunity 
remains for us to grow our brand to the recognition levels enjoyed 
by our competitors, and so, in March 2017 prior to our year-end, we 
agreed to sponsor the 11th series of BGT. The series has been aired 
over the past two months and our sponsorship deal included on-air 
and mobile companion app branding, plus numerous other 
opportunities to bring our sponsorship to life outside of the BGT TV 
show. This investment is designed to build long-term brand awareness 
rather than drive short-term sales as we seek to develop and instil trust 
and confidence. Going forward we must use our brand investment to 
very clearly highlight the difference of AO to the customer.
See how many you can 
now spot as you journey 
on our roads and 
motorways!

We are continuing to drive our market-leading 
proposition forward. Our key offering remains strong; 
our unbeatable prices, huge range, wide availability, 
smart and innovative web content and amazing service 
mean our customer satisfaction levels remain exceptional. 
Repeat customer metrics are healthy as are the number 
of new customers we are attracting to our brand.
The risks affecting our customers are highlighted on 
pages 42 to 44.
Performance this year
UK
We made good progress with our customer metrics over the reporting 
period. AO’s customer base is now a huge asset to the business as we 
approach four million UK customers (defined as an individual customer 
who has purchased from us) giving us a fantastic foundation from 
which to leverage our growth. Our repeat business remains very 
healthy and we continue to attract new customers. Notwithstanding 
progress this year whilst customers continue to repeat the time taken 
to repeat has fallen slightly which we think, in part, is driven by market 
dynamics. Growth in traffic remained encouraging during the 
12 months to 31 March 2017 and we experienced particularly strong 
growth in visits to our mobile site, although we have some work to 
do to increase our conversion rates to levels similar with those on 
Desktop and Tablet devices. 
We have worked hard to make the customer journey as easy and 
effortless as possible, whilst remaining personal. Our Customer Labs 
allow us to thoroughly research and understand our customers’ 
needs. In order to work towards our best service goal, we have 
continued to develop and enhance the retail experience. During the 
year we launched our app “MyAO”. This currently provides “track 
your order” functionality and will be developed further to provide 
transactional capability and to tie into the “My Account” feature 
launched last year. We have also streamlined our interactive voice 
response (“IVR”) system to take the customer through the most 
efficient route of service, based on the stage of the customer’s journey. 
This maximises efficiency and is part of our developing self‑service 
strategy, should customers choose to shop that way. We continue to 
ensure we have the best staff at the end of the phone to give a bit more 
of a personal touch. The use of functions such as Live and Nano chat 
(an automated alternative to live chat) together with the learnings 
identified from our Customer Labs really help us to understand our 
customers so we can meet their needs and tailor our offering 
appropriately. The way in which consumers shop is ever evolving 
and we must work hard to keep up with changing preferences.
During the year we invested further in our digital content team, 
which is now 40+ strong as we evolve our content strategy and apply 
the learnings from our Customer Lab sessions. The team creates 
innovative and essential content, for example through 3D videos and 
features, as we continue with our goal for our website to be the 
destination for information for customers. This content adds value 
to the customer journey and to the manufacturers we buy from and 
we are investing in rolling this out further. 
See one of our in-house created 3D videos here.
Our culture goes to the heart of our brand and is our greatest asset, 
providing us with a real advantage over our competitors; we continue 
to protect it fiercely. To achieve our goal we need to nurture it, 
attracting the best people who live our values and then, retaining 
them. That means being the best employer we can be for our people, 
so high employee engagement and development is fundamental to the 
growth of our brand, and ultimately, to the Group. Our emerging talent 
schemes, such as our Future and Star Programmes, Apprenticeship 
Schemes and Duke of Edinburgh scheme all progressed during the 
year. Each is sponsored by a member of the Group Executive Team 
(”GET”) in order to identify and develop our talent and ensure our 
winning team gets even stronger in the future. 
Europe
As planned, we limited our promotional activity during our period 
of consolidation with no TV exposure from April to October 2016. 
In the second half of the year we resumed limited activity such as joint 
TV advertising campaigns with manufacturers alongside some print 
media advertising and continued use of AO branded fleet, but beyond 
that advertising has been limited. Accordingly, there has been modest 
growth in brand awareness during the year to 31 March 2017. Despite 
this, our customer base is growing well, our direct traffic statistics are 
encouraging and repeat purchases are already coming through. 
Our sales growth is being driven by the strength of the customer 
recommendations we are receiving, replicating the evolution of 
our UK business, albeit at a faster pace. 
We are pleased that our culture and values have been fully embedded 
into our operations in Germany and the Netherlands, thanks in part to 
the use of a recruitment process focused on our central values. Our 
European team has also been restructured and during the year we 
were pleased to welcome a new European retail director into the team 
who is already making a difference to both culture and performance.
Priorities next year
Building brand awareness will continue to be a key focus for the year 
ahead; it remains our biggest weakness and therefore our biggest 
opportunity. We will do more to ensure that AO becomes a household 
name and the obvious place to shop for our products both in the UK 
and Europe. 
We are investing in new creative for our TV advertising, and this 
together with further branding of the AO fleet in the UK should help 
continue to drive awareness. 
In Europe, we will look to continue to drive our digital performance 
channels, increase our SEO rankings, build our social media audience 
and utilise local marketing channels, for example direct mail and CRM. 
We will also seek to increase local and national media through PR and 
will continue to use TV advertising tactically. 
With the support of our senior management over the next financial 
year we will continue to safeguard our culture, define its essence and 
embed it across the Group. As more and more people join the AO 
family it is critical that we do not lose sight of our values.
 Following my appointment as CEO 
we implemented some changes to 
the structure of our GET and senior 
management teams to ensure that we 
remain robust and scalable as our 
business continues to grow.

Chief Executive Officer’s Strategic Review
continued Our CRM strategy continues to evolve and we are keen to build on all 
aspects of the customer life cycle, not just the point of purchase. AO 
Life, our online lifestyle magazine, together with social media and 
personalised email programmes provide handy hints on how to use 
and maintain products. We have also been working on how to improve 
what happens when, unfortunately, products break down and to this 
end have renegotiated a deal with Domestic and General (“D&G”), our 
extended warranty partner. Our new pan-European 10 year deal will 
see some exciting developments in the extended warranties that we 
can offer to customers (as agent for D&G) that demonstrates our values 
and excels in service delivery and care, whilst at the same time ensuring 
that customers really do get value for money from this type of product. 
We added two additional outbases to our UK logistics infrastructure over 
the reporting period, one in Slough and the other in Dundee. This will 
help ensure resilience in our delivery network and maintain market-
leading product availability for customers, whilst reducing stem mileage 
and improving efficiencies in our logistics. Our premier fleet has grown 
significantly as we respond to increasing demand for more complex 
installation services. In addition to developing a trainee programme for 
newly‑qualified engineers, some of our self‑employed subcontractors 
now have the skillset to connect electric cookers and integrated products. 
Further, as part of our responsible retailing programme, we have now 
completed the build of our recycling facility at Telford. The official launch 
of AO Recycling will happen later in 2017 , but our state-of-the-art recycling 
plant is now operational and ensures WEEE is safely and properly disposed 
of and that re-use is optimised. This vertical integration ensures further 
end-to-end control of our reverse supply chain with the associated 
environmental benefits. It is another great example of how we have applied 
The AO Way to an underinvested section of the market which we believe 
can make a very exciting contribution to the business in the future. 
See the ins and outs of the recycling  
process on pages 34 and 45.
The results of the above initiatives can be seen in our Net Promoter 
Score (“NPS” an industry measure of customer loyalty and satisfaction) 
which over the year has been maintained at a consistently high level of 
over 80 and our UK Trustpilot score was an excellent 9.5 at the period 
end. In addition, we were proud to be voted 2nd best online retailer in 
the UK in the annual Which? Survey in October 2016 and just after our 
year end AO was named Best UK Retailer by the public in GlobalData’s 
2017 Customer Satisfaction Awards (previously the Verdict Retail 
Awards). There is no better testament to our service than the 
feedback from our customers and this award highlights the 
continuing strength of our commitment to ensure our customers 
receive the best possible service.
Europe
We are enjoying good customer feedback in both territories with NPS 
scores remaining outstanding at over 85. AO.de had a Trusted Shops 
score of 4.8 out of 5 and AO.nl had a Trustpilot score of 9.6 out of 10 at 
our year end and repeat business is already building momentum.
 
Our brand new regional distribution centre (RDC) in Bergheim, 
serving Germany and the Netherlands, became fully operational in 
September 2016. With 35,000m
2
 of warehouse space, the RDC allows 
us to improve product availability for our customers and promote 
brand awareness. The RDC comprises a head office allowing the retail 
and logistics divisions to become more cohesive, drive efficiencies 
and embed a consistent AO culture. With a capacity of five times our 
previous facility we are well resourced to fulfil our future growth.
We have partnered with third‑party logistics firms to better serve 
customers in more remote areas while also reducing delivery costs, 
working closely with them to ensure that their service meets our high 
expectations. As we increase scale and drive efficiencies, we plan to 
add additional outbases to our existing infrastructure, replicating our 
UK model.
To improve the customer proposition further during the year, we 
introduced electrical premium installations in Germany and plan to 
extend this offering in the Netherlands during the current financial 
year. We have also introduced Live Chat functionality and have 
launched the MyAO app. As in the UK, we also intend to implement 
Customer Labs into our European operations as we seek to 
understand customer needs and behaviours in these territories 
and tailor our offering accordingly.
As reported at the half year, the warranty product we offer on behalf 
of D&G has not achieved the volumes we were expecting in Europe, 
but as part of our new agreement with D&G, we are seeking to work 
together to develop the product and its promotion to be more effective 
in this market. We will also look to launch a Dutch warranty offering 
during the course of the year ahead.
Priorities next year
We will do more of the same. As we grow across categories and 
countries we need to ensure we do not lose our focus on delighting our 
customers. We are looking to build on the results of the Customer Lab 
and tailor the web journey to meet different customers’ needs; to build 
on the self-service strategy but to retain our personal touch. 
Development of the My AO app, to become fully transactional, is now 
in progress and we expect this to be launched in the coming months.
 
In conjunction with D&G, we will look to develop a better warranty 
product for our customers, with better benefits and a more digital 
offering. We will also seek to expand on the customer finance offering 
to provide customers with alternative ways to purchase our products.
We will strive to maintain our excellent NPS scores and market-leading 
Trustpilot scores. As we enter new categories we need to ensure that 
we continue to deliver a great proposition and the same level of 
exceptional customer service we offer in existing categories so that 
our reputation and industry-wide acknowledgements will be 
maintained and our brand never compromised and customers 
continue to make repeat purchase.

Customers tend to shop this category differently to others and we 
therefore had to develop ways of demystifying products to make 
them easier to understand to give customers the best choice, whilst 
changing our back-end operations to utilise drop-ship vendor 
methodology. Additionally, as there are different pre and post-sales 
requirements, we had to ensure that our call centre staff were trained 
to handle and deal with specific and sometimes rather technical 
queries. Product information and customer advice are the key areas 
where we believe AO can demonstrate a difference to the existing 
market and hardware and software brands have been supportive 
of our different approach to the category. 
We are now in the process of defining the next stage of the Computing 
category, making logical additions to our existing range. Research into 
new complementary areas continues and we are confident we can 
utilise the disciplines we have learnt from the launch of computing 
to bring more value to customers in the future.
We have seen some challenges in the MDA category over the past 
few months with market data suggesting the market in the UK has 
decreased year-on-year. However, we have continued to gain market 
share and our increasing importance as a channel to market for the 
leading brands has helped us grow product margin in this category. 
Whilst we had a strong performance in the first half of the year, in the 
second half MDA margin was under pressure following price inflation. 
Categories
AO is now an electrical retailer; not just a white goods 
one. We have continued to extend our MDA model to the 
SDA and AV categories in the UK and this year we have 
launched computing in the UK. In Europe, we now sell 
the AV category in addition to MDA and Floorcare. We 
believe we can replicate the model further and we are 
exploring other categories within the “electricals” sphere 
where we can leverage our existing relationships with 
the brands and also our infrastructure.
Risks affecting our category roll-out are discussed in 
the Risk Review on pages 42 to 44.
Performance this year
UK 
One of our greatest achievements during the reporting period was the 
successful launch of our computing category. We are delighted by our 
progress so far, leveraging the investments we have previously made 
in our web content, IT and product teams to add the category 
seamlessly to ao.com.

Chief Executive Officer’s Strategic Review
continued Countries 
Our ultimate goal is to become the best electrical 
retailer in Europe and we now operate in three countries, 
the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. Progress in 
Germany and the Netherlands gives us further confidence 
that the model can be successfully replicated and gives 
a very strong platform for future growth. 
The risks affecting our expansion are highlighted on 
pages 42 to 44.
Performance this year
We are continuing to drive our European operation responsibly with 
controlled growth. It has been a year of consolidation and whilst 
financial performance has not met our expectations (with investment 
losses being more than internally planned), we are nonetheless pleased 
with the strategic progress made and now have a firm foundation from 
which to further build our German and Dutch market offerings.
Our new territories are taking the same journey that our UK operation 
experienced in its infancy, which we communicated to analysts and 
investors at our Capital Markets Day in February. The strategy across 
Europe is identical to the focus we have in the UK; to develop the 
customer proposition, categories, culture and brand, to build and 
deliver a sustainable business. 
We launched in the Netherlands in March 2016 and have been 
extremely pleased with the way our brand has resonated with our 
Dutch customers over the full year of trading. We applied the learnings 
from our launch in Germany, for example, in terms of supplier 
engagement, the recruitment of key personnel and customer 
acquisition. This resulted in a smooth launch and we hit the ground 
running, giving us the confidence to replicate this bolt‑on model in 
other territories when appropriate. 
Priorities next year
Our research into further countries continues and we will pursue this 
strategy through continued careful assessment of the European 
electricals market, being selective of which opportunities to progress or 
put on hold, to ensure that we deliver the best possible proposition for 
our customers and maximise value in the long term for our stakeholders.
We have gained further market share in both SDA and AV as our 
credibility and authority, with both customer and manufacturers, 
in these categories continues to build momentum. We now have all 
major manufacturers on board in the SDA category and have grown 
further market share in the Floorcare sub-set of this category. 
In the UK, sales in our AV category have significantly increased year 
on year, helped by a wider product range including premium models 
with cutting-edge technologies and some exclusive branded products. 
We have also expanded the audio offering this year adding ultra-HD 
Blu-ray and turntables into our range.
Europe
We have made significant progress with our product manufacturers 
over the period as our local strategy gains momentum and 
relationships continue to improve. During the current financial year 
we will continue to build on our partnerships with them and further 
educate them about The AO Way. We will increase marketing 
campaigns to produce engaging content for their customers, build 
marketing support and leverage Group-wide media assets.
Category development has continued with the launch of AV on ao.de 
in early October 2016. We now sell TVs, home cinema equipment, 
satellite receivers and Blu-ray players and sales to date have been 
encouraging. We continue to build on the range, adding new brands 
and recently expanded the category to include audio headphones. 
We were able to apply our learnings from our roll-out in the UK: 
ensuring local to local supplier engagement with an AO industry 
expert, leveraging and utilising UK content at a low cost and drawing 
on UK knowledge and experience. The ability to utilise our existing 
UK content should help us attract additional support from the 
manufactures as we look to expand our categories and ranges. 
Priorities next year
In the year ahead we will continue to broaden ranges as far as possible 
within existing categories. 
In our computing category in the UK, at the time of writing, we have 
added a second drop ship vendor into our operation which will enable 
us to offer a wider range of computing products and will look to 
strengthen the relationships we have with the brands themselves, 
now we have demonstrated our retailing strengths. We will also 
continue to focus on expansion of our AV range – particularly in audio, 
looking to add additional premium brands to the mix. In MDA, we plan 
to focus on the built-in subset of MDA (which is a growing market 
opportunity), drive our installation capabilities and look to develop 
trade relationships.
In Europe we will be exploring opportunities in the AV category and 
building on our SDA range, adding small kitchen appliances to the 
floor‑care range already available on ao.de. In the Netherlands we 
will look to roll out AV and SDA.
We will continue to work in partnership with our manufacturers, 
sharing insight and knowledge, innovating categories and changing 
the normal course of retailing.
Our research of further complementary categories is continuing 
with the focus on mobile and gaming, portable tech and other 
smart/connected products, as we look to broaden our offering to 
give our customers more reasons to return to AO.

Strategy in action
Introducing Computing
(The AO Way)
In early 2016, we began our journey to launch a 
brand new category in the UK, Computing. Our mission; 
to transform the way this category was retailed by 
approaching it in The AO Way. Our aim; to create 
a new way of shopping that results in happy 
customers and manufacturers.
We extensively researched and created a better 
customer purchase journey. We made it informative and 
innovative, by using content that cuts through the jargon, 
helping customers choose the right product for them. 
January
2016
Lots to do – but a 
strong belief AO 
can once again 
change how people 
buy a product.
Research
We ran customer labs to 
understand how the customer shops 
this specific category.
We held an extensive number of 
customer labs to help us to really 
understand customers’ pain points 
when shopping this category online.
Learnings 
We showed customers how we can 
help and demonstrated our 
understanding.
The outcome of these labs was 
that customers had problems 
understanding the wording around 
products and what that meant for 
them, meaning they weren’t always 
buying the right product.
Solution: 
We decided to make the whole 
process EASIER by introducing a 
“help me choose” function which 
asks customers simple questions 
to ascertain what they really want 
and need.
Support 
We got manufacturer backing once 
we explained our unique way. 
Manufacturers were hugely 
supportive of the new way of thinking 
as they could see how AO’s new 
proposition cut through the jargon 
and helped to explain the benefits and 
features of their products. AO World Plc

Smart working
We streamlined our distribution 
processes to make our service as 
efficient as possible.
To ensure that we could deliver this 
category in an efficient way but still 
with the high standards that we live 
by, we linked this insight into the 
distributor to make sure they 
delivered in The AO Way.
Training 
We trained all our staff to be experts in  
the new category, helping customers  
make decisions.
Launching a new category means 
that there are new learnings and new 
customer emotions to understand, so 
we held training workshops for all our 
customer service teams to make sure 
they could help a customer at any 
point of their computing 
purchase journey.
Ready for take-off. October
2016
New category  
launched
(using our learnings and the 
systems we’ve developed, there 
are so many categories we can 
extend into).
We are delighted by  
our progress so far, 
leveraging the 
investments we have 
previously made in our 
web content, IT and 
product teams to add  
the category seamlessly 
to ao.com. 
See our computing 
launch video here. Our values  
are what  
set us apart.

Corporate Social Responsibility There’s lots here about  
“grass roots” and 
“pipelines”. In short, we 
select who we think are 
AO people, train, encourage 
and give them the  
chance they need.
Responsible retailing
The Board considers that the development, well-being and 
safe-keeping of people is central to supporting its strategy and 
this, coupled with our social and environmental credentials, 
is fundamental in creating a sustainable business.
People are our business
Creating the right environment for our employees
We continue to do what we believe is best for our employees, providing 
an environment in which they can really flourish and the ability to 
develop their skills. We want to encourage people as much as possible 
to collaborate and have open spaces for employees to share and create 
ideas and the new facility at Bergheim has been built to mirror the style 
of our facilities at Parklands and Crewe. We believe this type of 
environment really fosters the entrepreneurial spirit, creating a can-do 
attitude for all our people. And we empower them to do what they think 
is right, based on our values, rather than apply rigid rules that they must 
adhere to, giving them autonomy and ownership. 
This year we’ve updated our employee benefits (AO Perks), enhancing 
our parental leave policies, helping with eye-care funding and placing a 
real emphasis on employee wellbeing, giving employees the opportunity 
to purchase medical cover and gym membership at reduced rates and 
supporting employees through difficult times through our employee 
welfare programme. We’ve also arranged for a number of corporate 
discounts to be available to our employees, ranging from car-lease/hire, 
cinema tickets, air travel, hotels, cruises, electronics and event tickets. 
We’re also enhancing our learning and development function to be able 
to deliver online training modules and skills workshops.
Recently we supported National Learning at Work Week putting the 
spotlight on the importance and benefits of learning and development 
at work. We held sessions where, for example, employees shared some 
of their technical expertise – in areas such as Excel, social media, 
analysis and computer programming – and also delivered 
mindfulness workshops.
Employee engagement/nurturing our AO Culture 
Last year saw a huge focus on how we ensure our employees are 
inspired by the vision of our business and feel a part of what we are 
trying to achieve. We focused our attention on how we communicate 
these key messages to our employees and increased our efforts 
through a number of communication channels, including a reformed 
business‑wide “state of the nation” delivered in territory by both our 
CEO and Founder, management briefing sessions to our senior 
management team and a revamped intranet for all employees to keep 
up to date with business updates. This includes a regular blog by 
Founder, John Roberts. 
We also revived our “what we are doing workshops” this year, 
led by heads of departments giving real insight to specific areas 
of the business and bringing our teams closer together. 
Once again, we have carried out a robust employee survey to 
ensure employees are given a voice and to enable us to understand 
areas where we can improve as an employer. Our scores continue 
to grow year on year with our employees NPS question “would you 
recommend us as a place to work” increasing from 61 to 68. Specific 
actions resulting from this survey have seen us place more emphasis 
on development programmes for all our employees.
In January this year we launched our fourth save-as-you-earn 
scheme which was open to all employees who had passed their 
probationary period, building on the previous schemes in place, 
giving an opportunity to all our employees to share in the success 
of the Group as we grow.
As we continue to grow as a business we have repositioned our 
engagement activities and worked towards the objective of building 
relationships and driving collaboration across the business. All our 
development programmes now have an element of this placed in them 
and we encourage this through activities such as team building away 
days and incentives within the office.
Investing for the future
Our recruitment model at AO is simple – we always strive to recruit at 
a grass roots level and nurture talent through our leadership pipeline. 
We continue to initiate programmes specifically designed to build and 
nurture a future AO talent pool, strengthen our culture from within 
and to aid our succession planning to meet our needs as the business 
grows. These programmes are aimed at enabling technical capability 
and behavioural development aligned to the business’ goals. 
Our investment in emerging talent has seen an increased focus on 
apprenticeships across the business. We now run apprenticeship 
programmes across all core areas of our business including digital, 
marketing and finance and have c.40 apprentices in junior roles. 
As part of this programme to develop the next generation of leaders, 
we enrol our apprentices on the Duke of Edinburgh (“DofE”) scheme. 
This focuses on instilling the values and behaviours that make AO 
what it is and what it will be in the future. It enables employees to 
develop their own skills while also enabling them to give back to the 
local community. Following the success of the DofE scheme during 
the year we rolled it out to our full business with an additional 
60 employees taking part in our DofE Diamond Challenge.
Once again, our Star Programme has been rolled out across the 
business during the year, aimed at front-line (non-manager) 
employees who have been identified as “talent” and have the potential 
to be future managers at AO. The programme included Team Building, 
Business and Charity Projects, Business Updates and Self-Development 
with Skills Workshops designed to create lasting habits and behaviours 
that will ensure that our people perform at their best whilst consistently 
demonstrating our values. The programme proved a huge success in 
the business with 70% of our employees progressing in their careers 
following the programme. On top of this, we have invested further in 
our Future Programme, designed at helping our managers become 
the next leaders, centred around personal development, team 
development and inspiration and are looking to launch our very 
own AO Let’s Grow programme shortly. 
Equal opportunities
AO is committed to an equal opportunities policy. We aim to ensure 
that no employee is discriminated against, directly or indirectly, on the 
grounds of colour, race, ethnic or national origins, sexual orientation 
or gender, marital status, disability, religion or belief, being part time 
or on the grounds of age or frankly anything else and recruit on this 
basis. See pages 57 and 61 “Diversity” for further details.
Disabled persons have equal opportunities when applying for 
positions at AO and we ensure they are treated fairly. Procedures are 
in place to ensure that disabled employees are also treated fairly in 
respect of career development. Should an employee become disabled 
during their course of employment with the Group, we would seek 
whenever practical, to ensure they could remain as part of our team. 
In the opinion of the Directors, our equal opportunities policies are 
effective and adhered to.

31 Keeping people safe
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of Health 
and Safety practices for our employees, drivers, customers, visitors, 
contractors and anyone affected by our business activities. During the 
year, our Health and Safety risks increased with the commencement 
of operations at our recycling plant in Telford. Accordingly, over the 
year we further invested in various forms of recognised external 
training and education to ensure even more improvement in our 
Health and Safety culture. This enables us to have a workplace where 
employees take individual responsibility for reducing the risk to both 
them and their colleagues through: improved reporting of incidents 
and near-misses, regularly reviewing risk assessments, updating 
training and regular inspections of all sites and departments. We have 
redesigned the format of our Health and Safety inspections over the 
last year to ensure that all areas of the business are providing the best 
level of Health and Safety.
We have continued to expand our Health and Safety team in line with 
the growth in our business. Our established safety practices and ways 
of working have continued to be replicated across our new territories 
and our quarterly inspection procedures have been carried through 
to these new locations, across all of our operations. 
Our Health and Safety policies and procedures include:
 – Regular internal audits on our Health and Safety performance 
by an independent expert. The audit reviews legal compliance, 
best practice and maintaining a safe environment.
 – Managing risk and promoting Health and Safety culture in the 
Board’s agenda.
 – Seeking accreditation and aligning long-standing Company 
programmes and procedures to internationally recognised 
Quality Assurance standards.
 – Appropriate training and education of all staff to adhere to legal 
compliance and best practice.
 – Proactively creating a safe environment to significantly reduce 
occupational injuries or illnesses.
Supporting our communities 
AO actively encourages all employees to support and give back to their 
local community and the AO Smile Foundation continues to facilitate 
this. 65% of our UK employees make a regular monthly gift to the 
charity, and during the year over £60,000 was raised through payroll 
giving, which makes the process of giving as easy, flexible and tax 
efficient as possible. 
In recognition of AO’s commitment in fostering a culture of 
philanthropy and committed giving in the workplace we were 
delighted to once again received a Platinum Payroll Giving Award 
from HM Government and Institute of Fundraising.
Over the year we have continued to encourage colleagues to have a 
positive impact within their local communities with our focus this year 
driven by the “Gift of Time” and specifically our “make a difference” 
days and volunteering. Over the course of the year we have supported 
a number of charities and community projects, including:
 – Barnabus Homeless Shelter in Manchester
 – Rays of sunshine
 – Claire House Children’s Hospice
 – Wigan Youth
 – West Houghton Youth Project Landscaping Day
Further, our call centre was chosen to be an official call centre for Red 
Nose Day 2017. 110 of our people gave up their Friday night to man the 
phones and we helped collect a whopping £45,000 for the charity.
Business ethics
Our Modern Slavery statement for the year ended 31 March 2016 
was published during the year and we have continued to look at 
our due diligence processes in this area to ensure we are complying 
with the law but above all doing the right thing in accordance with 
our values. Our modern slavery statement can be found at 
http://ao.com/corporate/responsibility/modern-slavery-statement/
Building on our environmental credentials
We are mindful of the effects of our business on our environment. 
We are committed to meeting or exceeding legislative requirements 
across the board, in particular with regard to packaging and waste 
electrical and electronic equipment (“WEEE”) waste in the territories 
in which we operate.
To ensure minimum environmental impact all handling processes 
are developed to fully utilise supplier packaging with around 2% 
additional packaging added from receipt into our warehouses to 
delivery to our consumers. We offer customers an unpack and 
recycle service and are pleased with the level of take up. The majority 
of packaging collected during delivery to the consumer is recycled 
with more than 400 tonnes of card and plastic (including Expanded 
Polystyrene) recycled in the year to 31 March 2017 across all 
our operations. 
We offer a collection and recycling service to our customers for their 
old appliances (for a small transportation charge) or, alternatively, 
we accept any WEEE free of charge which is delivered directly to our 
warehouse. Old appliances are mostly broken down into recyclable 
parts. A proportion are refurbished and put back into the market; 
re-use is, after all, the ultimate in recycling. Last year over 37,000 
tonnes of WEEE was processed.
During the year we completed the build of our recycling facility at 
Telford giving us a state-of-the-art recycling plant which ensures 
WEEE is safely and properly disposed and that re-use is optimised 
giving rise to a number of environmental benefits. There is clearly an 
appetite from customers to recycle and re-use even if they don’t 
always put it into action – and don’t know how to. In the years ahead 
we will be focusing on this and will look to create a platform that would 
support a Group-wide sustainability drive (using the recycling 
business as a springboard and foundation for sustainability). Further 
details of our recycling facility are set out on pages 34 and 35.

Corporate Social Responsibility
continued Energy efficient operations
We aim to run our operations with a strong focus on environmental 
impact, fuel management and operational efficiency and constantly 
seek at both a corporate and local level to help improve our 
performance in all areas. 
In order to drive energy efficiencies:
 – Our home delivery fleet comprises 3.5 tonne “Hi‑Cube” trucks– 
these trucks are lighter and have a greater space and weight 
capacity; 
 – We have opened two new outbases in the UK during the year to 
service demand and improve the efficiency of our fleet; and
 – We also try to maximise our fuel efficiency by, for example, 
employing double-decker trunking so that we can deliver more 
products in one go to our outbases. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Statement
As AO is listed on the London Stock Exchange we are required to 
measure and report our direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. 
The methodology used to calculate our emissions is based on the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard and emissions reported 
correspond with our financial year. This year we have reported on all 
material emissions from both our owned and leased assets for which 
we are responsible across the UK, Germany and the Netherlands (the 
prior year period included less than one month of trading from the 
Netherlands). Emission factors used are from UK Government (Defra) 
conversion factor guidance current for the year reported with the 
exception of Germany and the Netherlands for which current 
conversion factors were unavailable and therefore the prior year’s 
factors have been used. Any changes in factors between the current 
and prior year reporting periods are considered minimal.
Our emissions predominately arise from the fuel used in the vehicles 
we use to deliver orders to customers and from gas combustion and 
electricity used at our offices, national delivery centres and outbases. 
In order to express our annual emissions in relation to a quantifiable 
factor associated with our activities, we have used revenue as our 
intensity ratio as this is a relevant indication of our growth and is 
aligned with our business strategy.

Responsible recycling
AO Recycling launches
(The AO Way)
AO Recycling carries out the large scale recycling of  
fridges and domestic appliances such as washing machines,  
tumble driers and dishwashers, sometimes known as WEEE 
(Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment). 
From its state-of-the-art facility in T elford in Shropshire, 
which opened in spring 2017 , AO Recycling is transforming 
the way this difficult waste stream is dealt with.
Since 2014, all newer fridges in the UK which contain 
pentane gases have been classed as hazardous waste. 
This means they cannot be recycled until the potentially 
flammable gases have been safely removed, along with 
refrigerant and oil contained in the fridge motor.
The issue
Over the last few years the UK has 
suffered from serious capacity issues 
in the fridge recycling sector. Put 
simply, far more fridges were 
entering the waste stream every year 
than the industry had the ability to 
process correctly and responsibly.
The risk is that the UK could see 
another repeat of the “fridge 
mountain” crisis of the early 2000s. 
Then, there was not enough capacity 
to safely process older CFC fridges 
– leading to mountains of fridges 
piling up at waste sites across the 
country.
The machine
The plant could process up to 100 
fridges an hour inside an enclosed 
metal chamber. The machine weighs 
more than 80 tonnes and works by 
smashing appliances into their 
constituent metals, plastics, and 
foam insulation using heavy duty 
rotating chains – a bit like a kitchen 
blender. The raw materials are then 
sorted into different metals, plastics 
and foam powder for reuse in new 
products – everything from kerb 
stones and garden furniture to 
new fridges.
Telford
The solution
AO wanted to recycle customers’ old 
products in the most efficient and 
environmentally friendly way as part 
of its aim to being a more sustainable 
business. AO plans to deliver a “step 
change” in the way fridges are 
recycled at end of life.
The new recycling facility in Telford 
was built and will be able to recycle 
more than 700,000 fridges a year. 
To put this in context, about 
3.5 million fridges are thrown away 
every year – so AO Recycling 
could be processing nearly one fifth 
of these. AO World Plc

Step 1
Firstly we strip down the fridge 
and dispose of the refrigerant and 
oil that fridge motors are full of. 
To do this we manually drill into 
the fridge’s internal workings to 
drain everything away. 
Step 2
The motor is then removed with 
some giant, heavy duty cutters 
and sent away for recycling.
Step 3
The rest of the fridge is then sent 
into a sealed chamber to extract 
the gases in the fridge’s insulation 
foam. T o do this oxygen is removed 
and replaced with nitrogen to 
prevent anything igniting.
Step 4
The fridge is then dropped into a 
big shredder, where heavy duty 
chains spin around at 500 rpm. 
This motion forms a vortex that 
breaks the outer shell of the fridge 
apart, into smaller pieces. This 
process also smashes the 
insulation foam into powder to 
release more of the gases.
Step 5
The rest of the fridge’s remains 
are dropped onto a heated 
conveyor belt below. Heat helps 
to release and neutralise any 
leftover gases.
How does it work? 
Old fridges and large domestic appliances will arrive at the site for 
recycling having been collected from AO customers when they 
purchase a new machine. Items which are still in working order will 
be checked and, where appropriate, refurbished and sold. Packaging 
from AO customers’ new appliances will also be brought to the Telford 
facility for recycling.
 
It will be as “closed loop” a system as possible – meaning nothing is 
wasted and every part of the old fridge is given a new lease of life. 
It’s safe, clean, efficient and more environmentally friendly than any 
other facility in the UK.
Step 6
At this point nitrogen is used to 
condense the gases into liquid so 
they can be safely sent away for 
disposal elsewhere.
Step 8
This makes it really easy to collect 
up the plastics and metals into 
individual storage containers that 
are now ready to be shipped on to 
be recycled into other household 
appliances, maybe another fridge!
Step 7
What’s left of the fridge’s remains 
are sent through four different 
filtration systems, to separate the 
different materials from each other .

How we will create value 
Our AO Way business model is scalable. Building customer, employee 
and supplier advocacy and replicating our proposition into other 
categories and territories will create long-term value as we seek to 
become the Best Electrical Retailer in Europe. Our brand and reputation 
will be our greatest asset as we become retailer of choice for customers 
in our chosen categories, attracting new and repeat custom, thereby 
growing market share, revenue and profits, in a responsible manner 
for the benefit of all our stakeholders. 
“Our Competitive Advantage” or “What sets us apart”
How we deliver The AO Way differentiates us from our peers. It isn’t 
the individual elements of our model that are unique. It’s how we stitch 
them together, coupled with the fact that we CARE more. 
All elements of our operations that have direct contact with the 
customer are either owned by AO or controlled (via SLAs) by us via 
a third party so we can ensure that the same high levels of service 
are given to all customers at each stage of their journey. Our fully 
in-sourced online proposition provides structural advantages over 
our competitors as it allows us to: 
 – Control the customer experience from order to delivery
 – Control the margin end-to-end from supplier to customer
 – Maintain a lower fixed‑cost base as compared to competitors 
with significant store‑based assets whilst providing customers 
with a simply better experience.
Our model is based on a wealth of knowledge and proprietary 
systems built and a culture embedded over many years. This creates 
a significant barrier to entry and makes it difficult for competitors to 
copy but easy for us to replicate in new categories and territories.
We believe that by delivering a better service, caring more and 
creating the easiest shopping experience we will become the Best 
Electrical Retailer in Europe with a financial output to match.
Who we benefit
Our customers
The customer is at the heart of everything we do. We provide them 
with a product and service both how and when they want it.
Our employees
Through creating an environment to allow them to flourish and be 
the best that they can be. We provide a sharesave scheme to allow 
employees to share in the Group’s success and offer a wide range 
of programmes and courses to allow them to develop. 
Our suppliers
We work with our suppliers to communicate the benefits of their 
products to our customers, and build long and lasting relationships.
Our communities
We are an employer of 2,500+ employees and contract with a large 
number of third parties. We invest time and money in local communities 
through employees volunteering and via the AO Smile Foundation. 
We pay our taxes and aim to retail responsibly, minimising our impact 
on the environment.
Our shareholders
The benefits we provide to other stakeholders drive the benefits to 
shareholders. We are a high growth company. Our profits generated 
from our UK operations are invested into building our European 
business, which we expect to achieve a profitable run rate during the 
financial year ending 31 March 2021. This should then lead to capital 
appreciation and future dividends for our shareholders.
 
The AO Way consists of the following elements: 
Largest available range
We offer an extensive range of MDA items – over 4,000 
SKUs in the UK and we are growing our range of SDAs, 
TVs and computing. In Germany we have almost 2,000 
MDA SKUs and a number of SDAs. Most of our SKUs are 
available for next day delivery – not many of our 
competitors can offer that.
First-in-class delivery model
Our in-sourced seven-day delivery (six in Germany and 
the Netherlands) is first class. We offer our customers a 
wide range of delivery options including next-day and 
designated time-slots, so that they can pick the delivery 
that suits them. We can also install new appliances and 
remove and recycle the old ones too. 
Amazing customer service 
Of course, we can claim that our service is wonderful 
but our independent customer feedback scores are 
exceptionally high. We give customers a flexible and 
personal approach and make clear commitments to 
them which we then deliver on. 
Not beaten on price
We aim to offer the best price and will match any price 
in the market but we are not a price leader.
Innovative online content
We ensure our on-site content is clear but detailed, 
explaining product benefits to customers better than 
anyone else, with feature-led reviews and 3D animation 
which tells the manufacturer’s stories. Offering this 
innovative content means that customers can make an 
informed decision on their purchase and are able to 
choose the right appliance for them.  AO World Plc

Manufacturer relationships
A trusted partner
We are reliant on our suppliers and see our role as being the 
most direct and smartest link between them and the end user 
– our customers.
There is considerable interdependence between us and the 
manufacturers and most of the relationships have been in place 
for many years in the UK. These relationships are becoming 
increasingly strategically important to our suppliers as we grow 
our customer base, sales volumes and influence on customer 
demand, but also to us as we seek to launch in new countries 
and try to leverage existing relationships. We aim to work in 
partnership with them, sharing insight and knowledge, innovating 
categories and changing the normal course of retailing.
Bringing products to life 
We understand they invest millions in research to develop 
product features so we think a lot about and invest in how we 
add value for supplier brands to be the trusted partner in our 
channel and we always think long term. Our joint advertising 
campaigns really highlight the benefits and key product features 
whilst driving brand awareness.
Our innovative content offers our manufacturers a great 
platform to showcase their products and deliver our brand 
messages as our 3D animation and feature-led reviews 
bring products to life. 
Customer relationships
Our online platform includes detailed technical information, 
customer reviews, product and price comparison tools and 
an enhanced retail experience, which are not always available 
in stores.
Destination for information
One of our aims is to become the “destination for information” 
helping our customers decide which product best matches their 
needs. We provide 3D animation and feature-led reviews to 
bring products to life, we simplify complex technologies, 
highlight user benefits and then deliver it to the customer with 
our market-leading standards. Our best service goal means that 
we aim to develop a retail experience which is as easy and 
effortless as possible, always maintaining a personal touch. 
We have the “MyAO” app which has track your order functionality 
and customers are now able to shop on their Desktop, Tablet or 
Mobile device and speak to an adviser on the telephone or via our 
Live chat function. We believe we care more about the customer 
than most of our competition.
We offer over 6,400 SKUs in the UK, nearly 2,700 in Germany

Strong management and culture
Our employees
Happy people care more and require a lot less management. 
So we make sure they’re happy by giving them autonomy where 
appropriate, support where needed and a great environment to 
work in. They are empowered; they are incentivised; and they 
know they are trusted. We love watching them grow and thrive.
Our values
We recruit and retain the best talent and look for people who 
are smart, bold and driven. They must care more, not only about 
our customers but other stakeholders of the business too, be it 
the manufacturers and suppliers, other employees and, 
of course, our drivers, and do it all with a sense of fun.
Our team
There are 10 of us on the Group Executive Team, including the 
Executive Directors, and we have an average length of service of 
over nine years. Our recent GET and senior management team 
restructure has given greater responsibility to key members of 
our team and further opportunities for career progression 
throughout the business.
Processes and systems
Distribution
Our UK in-house delivery network runs from Crewe and 12 
stockless outbases around the UK. We operate a similar model 
in Europe and currently have a European Regional Distribution 
Centre in Bergheim and a number of outbases and customer 
service centres across Germany and the Netherlands. 
Delivery and installation options, speed and reliability are 
important as are the removal and recycling of the old appliances.
IT
Our core IT systems have all been developed in-house. The 
systems are bespoke; built for and continuously adapted to fit the 
needs of the business. They are therefore not easily replicable by 
any competitor and they are scalable and resilient.
Our automated stock forecasting and ordering system is 
integrated with suppliers’ systems meaning that we can combine 
high levels of availability for next‑day delivery with the efficient 
use of working capital. It also means that we can optimise 
resources by, for example, loading trucks most efficiently.
We believe that the standard of the 
delivery service we provide is crucial 
given that the delivery teams are 
typically the only face-to-face 
interaction that customers have 
with the Group.

European MD talk 
about AO. In common with many businesses, AO faces a broad range of risks 
due to the scale and nature of our operations. These risks have varying 
likelihoods and impacts and range from operational risks in our 
day-to-day activities; strategic risks due to our high growth and 
international expansion strategy; and external risks such as the market 
environment and the regulatory frameworks to which we are subject. 
Effective risk management allows us to identify, appropriately monitor 
and mitigate, to the extent possible, these risks in line with our risk 
appetite so that we can deliver our strategic objectives and protect 
value for our key stakeholders.
How we manage risks 
We have developed a risk management framework with policies in 
place for identifying and addressing risks and with clearly defined 
lines of responsibility, accountability and delegation of authority. 
During the year under review, we have focused on enhancing our risk 
governance processes and ensuring it is truly embedded throughout 
the business, ensuring a more holistic approach to risk management.

Risk identification and assessment
Our risk register covers many risks that could affect our business, 
customers, supply chain and communities. We have a formal risk 
identification and management process to ensure that risks from our 
day-to-day operations and from the general economy and our sector, 
are continually identified, evaluated and, where possible, mitigated 
throughout all of our operations. Our Internal Audit function meets 
with AO team representatives on a bi-monthly basis to assess new and 
existing risks, how these are being mitigated and how changes from 
within the business or the wider corporate landscape may impact 
them. It is this risk assurance process which forms the basis of our 
Group Corporate Risk Register (“CRR”).

How we manage our risks Our Risk Management Committee, in which our Executives 
participate, meets regularly to review the status of the existing CRR 
and whether all risks are still current and relevant, and to appraise 
newly identified risks to determine whether these impact existing risks 
or require inclusion on the CRR in their own right. The review includes 
an assessment of how each risk is being mitigated, its inherent and 
residual risk and any changes. The likelihood and impact of each risk 
is assessed against the Group’s Risk Assessment matrix which 
determines its risk factor and resulting risk category which ranges 
from minimal to aggressive. This process allows us to regularly 
understand the strength and performance of the controls in place 
and to address any potential gaps and weaknesses.
The CRR is reviewed by the Audit Committee at least annually and it 
is notified of any significant changes in perceived risk as appropriate. 
Individual risks which are considered to be AO’s principal risks are 
reviewed by the Board annually and assessed against the Group’s risk 
appetite and capacity. The Audit Committee annually appraises the 
Group’s Risk Management and Internal Control Framework and 
makes a recommendation to the Board as to its effectiveness.

Whilst our risk management processes work well, the programme 
can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance that key risks 
are managed at an acceptable level.
Risk appetite
Overall, the Group has a “balanced” approach to risk taking; we will 
not be unduly aggressive with our risk taking but we may accept a 
limited number of significant risks at any one time in order to foster 
innovation and to facilitate growth. We recognise that it is not possible 
or necessarily desirable to eliminate some of the risks inherent in our 
activities. However, these must be reviewed against the assessment of 
other principal risks to ensure that the level of net risk remains within 
the overall accepted risk appetite. For example, where it has already 
accepted an aggressive or material risk, this would then limit the 
acceptance of additional material risks. 
The Risk Appetite Statement is reviewed annually, in line with 
the strategic direction of the Group, recent experience and the 
regulatory environment.
This year’s achievement and future actions 
This year we have continued to embed our Risk Management 
Framework across the Group, ensuring that all areas of the business 
understand our risk appetite and risk management processes and 
that there is a consistent approach to risk.
Risks on our risk register (and new risks identified through our 
processes) have been reviewed together with the controls we have 
in place to mitigate the impact should these risks develop.
We have seen a number of risk factors decrease over the year – 
for example, the opening of the second distribution centre in Crewe, 
reduced our reliance on the main (and previously sole) distribution 
centre and provided us with extra capacity for peak trade and the 
migration of our IT systems to a virtual platform has helped our 
systems become more agile whilst at the same time helping them to 
be robust against failure or attack. Conversely, we have seen some 
risks on our register increase: the gross risk to the Group of Health and 
Safety failures has increased now that the recycling facility in Telford 
is operational; we recognise that the employment status of our drivers 
is subject to increasing political pressure and media scrutiny and the 
risks of a data breach are considered to be increasing as hackers 
continually develop new ways to commit cybercrime. We have also 
spent some time considering the risks that have arisen and may arise 
following the UK’s decision to leave the EU.
 
Overall our scoring methodology has yielded a slightly lower overall 
risk factor score this year compared to last. For movements in our 
individual principal risk scores, please see the following pages.
In addition to our risk analysis work, a number of specific projects 
have stemmed from the work of the RMC, either to address new risks 
or improve our ability to mitigate risks. These include:
 – The establishment of an Insurance committee to ensure 
appropriate insurance is in place and to help address additional 
requirement on the Group arising from the Insurance Act 2015.
 – Enhanced business continuity planning to also include an 
assessment of the BCP procedures of some of our key suppliers.
 – Modern slavery due diligence improvements.
 – GPDR planning.
These projects will continue in the year ahead and we will continue 
to embed our risk culture throughout our Group, in all territories and 
areas in which we operate.
Principal risks
Our principal risk categories have been defined as: Culture and 
People; Failure of European Expansion, Brand Recognition and 
Damage; IT Systems Resilience; Compliance with Laws and 
Regulation, Business Interruption and the UK Economy. 
The table overleaf summarises our assessment of these risks and how 
we seek to mitigate them.

Culture and People
Impact on strategic 
objectives:
 – Culture & Brand
 – Customers
 – Categories
 – Countries
Impact on business model:
 – People
Culture is a key ingredient in the 
success of the business and a 
unique differentiator from our 
competitors. If we fail to maintain 
the culture in conjunction with 
our growth this could affect all 
areas of the business from our 
ability to attract customers, our 
dealings with suppliers and the 
way we deliver.
We rely on members of our 
Group Executive Team and 
Senior Management Team to 
provide strategic direction to the 
business. The loss of key 
member(s) of the team would 
have a significant impact on our 
strategy being realised.
 – AO culture is supported by a 
wide range of tools, workshops 
and events with a dedicated 
employee events team
 – Group Executive Team and 
senior management have a 
shared responsibility to drive 
culture throughout the business 
on the basis of AO’s values
 – Senior employees continue to 
receive attractive remuneration 
packages including long-term 
share options to encourage 
retention
 – Strengthened operational 
management teams in each 
territory give the benefit of 
localised decision making and 
reduce reliance on individuals
 – Succession planning is in place
Risk decrease
Our European businesses are 
now more established and 
have well developed teams 
who understand the culture 
and values and are able to 
nurture the culture amongst 
new recruits.
A restructure below Board 
into defined business units is 
allowing for greater room for 
career progression and also 
improvements in succession 
planning, although this still 
remains a significant risk.
Failure of European 
Expansion
Impact on strategic 
objectives:
 – Countries
Expanding into new territories 
is a key part of our strategy. 
Failure in these territories 
would limit our long-term 
growth and negatively impact 
the Group’s finances.
 – Expansion into new territories 
is only undertaken after 
extensive research 
 – Expansion leverages AO’s 
existing UK online retailing 
expertise and experience 
that has been built up over 
many years
 – Capital requirements are 
relatively low and investment 
is managed in stages
 – Specific targets are in place for 
new territories to enable focus 
on objectives and measurement 
of performance 
Risk decrease
Our German business is 
now approaching three years 
old and our business in the 
Netherlands is just over year 
old. Whilst there is still much 
to do, the building blocks are 
in place; our teams are now 
well established, the 
infrastructure to sustain 
growth is now built, the 
trajectory of progress with 
manufacturers is good and 
we have more confidence that 
the model can be replicated.
Brand Recognition and 
Damage
Impact on strategic 
objectives:
 – Customers
Impact on business model:
 – People
Damage to our brand or failing 
to achieve growing recognition 
would lead to a reduction in 
customer loyalty, a failure to 
attract new customers or 
suppliers or affect existing 
relationships.
 – There is a dedicated social 
media team in place to increase 
brand awareness and generate 
consumer interest in AO.com
 – Ongoing marketing campaigns 
to raise brand awareness 
through different mediums 
 – Rigorous monitoring of 
customer feedback through 
quality processes
 – In-house PR teams established 
to deal with press and events
No change
Brand awareness in the UK has 
increased slightly over the 
reporting period and customer 
NPS and trustpilot/trusted-shop 
scores show that our proposition 
resonates and customers 
continue to love our brand.
We still need to be vigilant and 
protect the brand at all times 
and increase our efforts to 
drive brand awareness and 
instil trust and confidence.

Impact on business model:
 – Infrastructure
AO’s main IT systems are 
interlinked and critical for ongoing 
operations. Therefore failure of 
one system may disrupt others.
The majority of customer orders 
are taken through our website 
AO.com and therefore significant 
downtime as a result of a 
successful systems breach or 
failure would affect the ability to 
accept customer orders and may 
affect customer loyalty, AO’s 
reputation or our competitive 
advantage and result in reduced 
growth.
The loss of sensitive information 
relating to strategic direction or 
business performance may 
compromise our future strategies 
or the loss of data relating to 
individuals may result in an ICO 
complaint and negative publicity.
 – Physical and system controls in 
place to minimise data breaches
 – There is a continual improvement 
cycle in respect of access levels, 
housing of critical data, 
encryption and penetration 
testing for customer data
 – Software is rigorously tested and 
follows a robust release process 
before being deployed in live 
environment
 – Operation of the IT environment 
is continuously monitored and 
disaster recovery plans are in 
place to ensure business can 
recover from any interruptions 
with minimal impacts 
 – The AO website and internal 
network are protected by a 
firewall, a holistic view of routers 
and switches with potential for 
individual configuration change, 
frequently updated anti-virus 
and penetration testing
No change
The risk of failure of IT systems 
was generally thought to have 
decreased with the migration 
to the virtual platform and new 
fail-over systems in place. 
However , the risk of cyber-crime 
is thought to have increased 
given recent attacks on other 
businesses over the year.

Changes in regulations or 
compliance failures may affect 
our strategy or operations, in 
particular to the following areas:
 – Health and Safety
 – Driver employment status 
 – Data protection 
 – The basis upon which the 
Company offers and sells 
product protection plans or 
the basis upon which revenue 
from the sale of such plans is 
accounted for.
 – Regulatory developments are 
routinely monitored both in the 
UK and in Europe to ensure that 
potential changes are identified, 
assessed and appropriate action 
is taken 
 – AO are supported by a Legal 
team who promote awareness 
and best practice and an Internal 
Audit team who provide 
assurance on compliance
 – Third-party legal advice is 
sought were necessary and any 
recommendations are 
implemented and subject to 
ongoing monitoring
 – AO’s business is supported by a 
qualified Health and Safety team 
 – Changes to the macro 
environment and legislation are 
monitored and implemented 
promptly
Risk increase
Whilst Health and Safety is a 
key priority of the Board and 
robust processes and 
procedures are in place, the 
commencement of operations 
at the Group’s new recycling 
facility in Telford has 
increased the overall Health 
and Safety risk to the Group.
Recent first tier tribunal 
decisions and increased 
scrutiny of the “gig economy” 
has increased the risk of 
legislation changing in this area.
The forthcoming GPDR poses 
potential challenges to working 
and marketing practices.

Group’s sites, including our main 
distribution centre in each of the 
UK and Germany, may affect the 
ongoing performance of our 
operations and negatively impact 
the Group’s finances and our 
customers.
 – Two NDCs in the UK reduce 
reliance on any one distribution 
centre and in Germany the 
distribution centre is separated 
into chambers to reduce the 
impact of fire or damage
 – Dedicated engineering teams 
on-site with daily maintenance 
programmes to support the 
continued operation of the NDCs 
 – A number of standalone controls 
are in place to mitigate a major 
event occurring at one of the 
Group’s sites
 – Enhanced business continuity

43 Assessment of Group’s prospects 
Viability assessment
In accordance with Code C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2014 (“the Code”) the Directors are required to assess the longer‑term 
viability of the Company taking into account the principal risks facing 
the Company.
The Directors have considered whether the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three‑year period ending 31 March 2020. This period was considered 
appropriate due to: the rapid growth plans of the Group and changes 
in its strategic opportunities; changes in the economic environment 
which may alter consumer demand patterns and the Group’s business 
planning processes which cover this period and help to support the 
Board’s assessment. 
In making its assessment of the longer-term viability of the Group, 
the Board have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency, or liquidity. These risks and 
how they are mitigated are set out above on pages 42 to 44 and in the 
Corporate Governance Statement on page 64. The Directors have also 
reviewed the Group’s annual and longer‑term financial forecasts and 
have considered the resilience of the Group using sensitivity analysis 
to test these metrics over the three-year period. This analysis involves 
varying a number of main assumptions underlying the forecasts 
(including, without limitation revenue, margin and working capital), 
and evaluating the monetary impact of severe but plausible risk 
combinations and the likely degree of mitigating actions available to 
the Company over the three-year period if such risks did arise.
Based on the Company’s current position and principal risks, together 
with the results of the assessment detailed above and the Group’s 
enhanced risk management processes (see pages 40 to 41) and 
internal controls (see page 62), the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of 
their assessment.
Going concern statement
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Strategic Report on pages 16 to 51. The financial position of the 
Company and its cash flows are described in the Chief Financial Officer’s 
Review on pages 45 to 51. In addition, the notes to the financial 
statements include the Company’s policies and processes for 
managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
In making their assessment of going concern, the Directors considered 
the Board‑approved budget, the three‑year business plan, cash flow 
forecast, the availability of a £30m Revolving Credit Facility, the proceeds 
raised from the placing of new shares in the Company completed in 
April 2017 and the Principal Risks set out on pages 42 to 44. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group as a whole have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months 
from the date of this Report. Accordingly, the financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis.
The external auditors have reviewed these statements and have 
nothing to report (see the Independent Auditors’ Report on pages 
85 to 87).

How we manage our risks
continued I am pleased to present the financial review for the Group for the year to 
31 March 2017. We maintained our focus on delivering value for all our 
stakeholders through our 4Cs strategy and have made good progress 
against all these objectives. Furthermore we have continued to grow 
Group revenue, increased profits across our core UK business and 
ensured we are suitably capitalised to continue to accelerate our growth 
across Europe. Going forward we will continue to increase sales and 
profits by leveraging the assets we have built, driving out further 
efficiencies and, in the short to medium term, reinvesting our free cash 
flow in the growth of our European operations. 
We experienced a strong start to our financial year, driven in part by the 
stamp duty change in March 2016 which had a positive impact on the 
overall MDA market. During the second half we began to feel the impacts 
of dampening consumer confidence and a reduction in consumer 
spending power as a result of growing inflationary pressures. Sterling 
deflation in our market saw cost prices increase by 10‑15% through 2016. 
Despite these factors and the impact of lower trading days against the 
prior year (due to 2016 being a leap year), we achieved a 17.0% increase 
in Group revenue to £701.2m. In the first half of the year the Group made 
a profit (on an Adjusted EBITDA basis) with UK profits exceeding Europe 
losses, however with margin pressures in the UK in the second half of 
the year our UK profitability growth reduced and Europe losses 
exceeded such profit giving an overall Group Adjusted EBITDA loss for 
the year. Nonetheless, we have grown market share across all countries 
and categories and have achieved a gross margin improvement of 0.7% 
across the Group due to product margin gains and increased efficiencies 
in our delivery network in Europe as our volumes build. We are 
confident that we will be able to drive further efficiencies and build 
margin by leveraging our increased scale, although in the UK product 
margins are under pressure as we enter the new financial year. 
In the UK, our focus on educating our customers that AO is a multi-
category electrical retailer began to deliver results as we experienced 
particularly strong performances in our SDA category where we have 
continued to expand our range. Sales in our new Computing category 
performed better than we initially anticipated further highlighting that 
our innovative way of retailing and demystifying products is resonating 
well with our customers and we continued to see ancillary sales 
(including that of product protection plans) perform well. 
The financial year was a period of physical consolidation for our 
European operations as we commenced operations from our new 
regional distribution centre in Bergheim. This resulted in us investing 
more than we had anticipated in Europe with operating losses 
increasing to £27.6m (2016: £23.0m). The gross loss in Europe reduced 
from £4.9m in 2016 to £4.0m in 2017, reflecting the significant progress 
we have made with our supplier relationships and improvements in 
delivery costs. Our increasing scale has helped to leverage European 
SG&A Costs which have reduced to 33.2% of revenue (2016: 44.4%), 
and we expect to make further progress in the year ahead as volumes 
increase. Over the next few years we will continue to apply our UK 
learnings in Europe and undertake initiatives to continue to improve 
product margins to a mature state, make supply chain and cost-to-
deliver efficiencies and utilise our UK assets where possible, leveraging 
our cost base through growth, as we set out at the Capital Markets Day 
in February 2017.
In March 2017 we announced that we had raised £50m of gross 
proceeds via a placing of new shares in the Company from both new and 
existing investors. The new shares were admitted to trading on 3 April 
2017 which was outside our reporting period and therefore the proceeds 
are not included in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2017 but are detailed 
within the “Events after the reporting period” note on page 111. The 
placing was undertaken to suitably capitalise the business to support 
our continued growth and increasing scale, providing us with the 
flexibility to react to market opportunities and changes whilst we 
capitalise on our increased brand awareness.
Our customer base and repeat purchase metrics are healthy, 
highlighting the benefits of our model which will help drive continued 
growth across our new territories. Our expanding range and categories 
ensures resilience as we broaden our revenue streams. This, together 
with our strong balance sheet and outstanding customer proposition, 
will ensure that we are well positioned to trade well through possible 
challenging market conditions.

Over the year to 31 March 2017 the total MDA market grew by 5%
2
 to 
£3.7bn inc VAT
6
. Strong market growth throughout the first half of the 
year tailed off as a result of reduced consumer confidence coupled 
with price rises within the market. Average prices are rising both as 
a result of a shift towards more premium and smart products and 
the adverse impact of the euro exchange rate. Built-in appliances 
experienced high growth levels of 16% throughout the year
2
. 
AO continues to have access to almost all major branded MDA 
suppliers, making up 98% of the major brands
9
 and we have further 
strengthened our relationships with the major MDA suppliers in the year. 
Notwithstanding the challenging economic conditions, AO’s share of 
the overall UK MDA market share increased slightly year on year. 
SDA 
The SDA market (comprising Small Appliances, Food Preparation and 
Floor Care) was worth £2.2bn inc VAT in the year to 31 March 2017
6
, 
declining 3% as a result of reduced food preparation sales
2
. However, 
the category experienced a significant level of online migration in the 
year driven, we believe, by increased choice of fulfilment options.
Our range now covers 92% of the market of major brands
9
, a marked 
improvement on this time last year. We continue to focus on the more 
premium end of the market, i.e. products over £30, which make up 
89% of the online market
9
 and as a result our average price is 152% 
above the market average. Our share of the overall SDA market has 
more than doubled, year on year.
AV 
The AV market was estimated to be worth £3.7bn inc VAT
6
, increasing 
c.4% year on year
2
. It currently has the lowest online penetration of 
AO’s four categories, but migration is significant with the online 
market having grown 17% over our reporting period
2
. 
There are two main trends being seen in the TV market currently, 
with products under 40" experiencing significant decline, while 
UHD/4K and screen sizes over 40" are seeing high growth levels. 
Within Audio, headphones with premium features such as noise 
cancellation & Bluetooth are growing strongly, as well as multiroom 
smart audio speakers. 
Our brand coverage of the TV market is now 99% of major brands
9
, 
and we are increasing our audio ranges. Overall our market share in 
AV has increased year on year.
Computing
The Computing market is estimated to be worth £3.6bn inc VAT
6
. 
Although the market declined slightly over the reporting period, 
primarily due to a lack of product innovation, PC gaming is estimated 
to be growing at a rate of 53% year on year
2
. Computing has the highest 
online penetration of any category we are present in
9
. 
We now have access to the majority of brands across the core three 
product areas (laptops, desktops and tablets), ranging c.88% of major 
brands
9
. We expect to gain further market share in this category in the 
current financial year.
Europe 
The combined size of the MDA, SDA, AV and Computing markets in 
Germany is €25bn inc VAT, 62% larger than the UK, and the 
equivalent in the Netherlands is €4.8bn inc VAT
6
. 
We have completed a successful first full year of trading in the 
Netherlands, and expanded our category offering further in Germany, 
launching into AV in October 2016. Further categories will follow and AO’s 
UK trends
Online migration is continuing in the UK across Retail as a whole
1
, with 
online penetration for electricals increasing further in the year from 
33% to 36% for the categories in which AO operates
2
. This ongoing 
migration allows AO’s addressable market size to continue to increase 
despite forecast decreases in the overall electricals market.

UK overview
With the launch of Computing in October 2016, AO now operates in 
four categories in the UK (Major Domestic Appliances “MDA”, Small 
Domestic Appliances “SDA”, Audio Visual “AV”, and Computing) with 
a combined market size estimated at £13.1bn
6
.
There are mixed expectations for the electricals market in 2017 from 
market intelligence agencies with Mintel predicting 2.3% growth while 
Retail Economics predict a decline of 0.5%, and BDO a decline of 0.7%
7
. 
The overall expectation is that any increase will be driven by inflation, 
with potential declines in volume as the gap between wage growth and 
inflation is shrinking leaving consumers with reduced disposable income.
Conditions in the housing market are expected to be tough given the 
forecast reduction in transactions
8
 by Royal Institute of Chartered 
Surveyors and Council of Mortgage Lenders. Whilst our MDA sales 
do correlate to the performance of the housing market, we are in part 
insulated from any downturn as we believe a substantial proportion 
of MDA sales are “distressed” purchases. Additionally, diversifying 
into further categories also allows us to lessen the impact of any one 
particular market declining, and as a result our sales mix of MDA 
products is reducing each year.

Computing
launch into Computing in the UK has provided us the learnings and 
systems infrastructure to launch this category in our European territories.
Online migration continues throughout Europe, as can be shown from 
the chart below presenting a significant opportunity for AO. 
Germany
With the launch of AV in October 2016, our addressable market in 
Germany now stands at €15.7bn inc VAT
6
 (comprising MDA, Floorcare 
and AV), of which 21% is traded online
9
.
As we have become more established in the German MDA market, we 
have broadened our brand offering and now range 86% of major brands
9
.
The Floorcare market grew 13% in the year
2
 to €0.8bn inc VAT
6
, 
experiencing strong growth in new technologies such as rechargeable 
handhelds and Robotic Vacuum cleaners. The remainder of the SDA 
market in which we do not currently operate is worth €2.0bn inc VAT
6
.
The AV market is worth €6.7bn
6
 inc VAT of which 22% is traded 
online
9
. The DVB‑T2 signal switch in March 17 has driven sales of TVs 
and Set Top Boxes and we have seen significant year‑on‑year 
increases in these categories. Our brand offering is increasing every 
month as we become more established in the market and gain share.
Online penetration rates are increasing in Germany, and there is still 
significant opportunity for growth, as rates generally remain behind 
the UK.
The Netherlands
In February 2016 we launched MDA in the Netherlands entering a 
€1.7bn inc VAT
6
 market of which 21% is traded online
9
. The market 
has grown by 10% in the year due to increased cooling sales
2
.
Throughout the year our brand and proposition offering has improved 
significantly with the addition of major manufacturers, and the 
introduction of pull switch installations which are specific to the 
Netherlands and give us access to another segment of the market. 
We have access to brands representing 79% of the major brands

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
47 Revenue (see table 1) 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 total Group revenue increased by 
17.0% to £701.2m (2016: £599.2m) missing our internal expectations. 
Revenue in the UK increased by 12.7% to £629.7m (2016: £558.5m) 
largely driven by a 14.5% increase in “AO” website sales, which 
includes AO.com and AO branded eBay shops which accounted for 
£557.9m of revenue (2016: £487.1m). This growth has been achieved 
through continuing to attract new customers to the website and our 
existing customers continuing to repeat, our investment to continue to 
raise awareness of the AO brand and our consistently strong customer 
proposition, all of which have helped ensure a good mix of demand 
from both new and repeat customers. It has, however, been hampered 
by some challenges in the major domestic appliance (“MDA”) category 
in the final few months of the year with overall market data suggesting 
the free-standing market in the UK has decreased year-on-year. 
In Europe, AO website sales from our German website, AO.de, and 
also our Netherlands website, AO.nl, totalled revenues of £71.5m 
(2016: £40.7m) equating to €84.7m (2016: €55.6m) and an increase of 
52.3% on a constant currency basis. This growth reflects (i) a full year 
of trading in the Netherlands (with AO.nl only being launched in March 
2016) and (ii) growth in our AO.de sales. Growth in the German 
operation is particularly pleasing as it has been achieved despite a low 
level of promotional activity during the year as we consolidated our 
cost base and opened our new regional distribution centre in 
Bergheim, currently serving both our German and Dutch markets. 
Growth in sales was therefore largely driven by the strong testimonials 
received from customers who have experienced The AO Way of 
shopping and digital marketing (Google, affiliates, etc).
AO branded website sales (including AO.com, AO.de, AO.nl and AO 
branded eBay shops) now account for 89.8% of total Group revenue 
(2016: 88.1%). 
Sales from third-party websites in the UK reduced to £46.0m (2016: 
£53.6m) as our focus remains on promoting the AO.com brand, 
eroding the market share of some of these clients and indicating the 
overall challenging market conditions. 
Included within “Other sales” is revenue from UK third‑party logistics 
services and, from this year, our recycling business. This segment 
experienced a 44.9% increase in revenue to £25.8m (2016: £17.8m) 
driven by revenue from the recycling business and as we benefited 
from the extension of a short-term logistics contract which 
commenced in the final quarter of the previous financial year. This 
contract has now expired and going forward we would expect to see 
revenue from third-party logistics services fall. Recycling income 
includes revenue from the sale of evidence notes following our 
treatment of WEEE, packaging recycling income and revenue from 
the sale of materials derived from the recycling process. The new plant 
at Telford became operational towards the end of the year and therefore 
we would expect revenue from this operation to increase going 
forward although it will be a very small part of overall Group revenue. 
“AO website sales” and, for the UK, “Third‑party website sales” 
includes revenue earned from the sale of physical products and also 
ancillary services such as delivery, the installation of products, unpack, 
inspect, together with commission earned from the promotion of 
Domestic and General’s product protection plans and, in the UK, 
customer finance. Revenue from such ancillary service sales in the 
period achieved growth consistent with product sales representing 
11.6% of total sales at £81.0m (2016: 10.6%, £63.7m).
The first full year of trading from our Recycling business generated 
£5.2m of revenue, comprising £3.9m from recycling and £1.3m from 
the sale of used product to third parties. At the time of our pre-close 
statement on 30 March 2017, the Group planned to include these 
amounts within AO website sales however it has since been deemed 
more appropriate to include the £3.9m revenue generated from 
recycling services within “Other sales” and the £1.3m in Third party 
website sales. The reclassification, together with a level of sales slightly 
higher than anticipated over the last few days of the financial year, 
means that overall there has been a 14.5% increase in AO website sales 
over the reported period compared to the prior year, versus c.16% 
indicated in the pre-close statement on 30 March 2017.
Gross margin (see table 2) 
Gross margin for the Group, which includes product margin, delivery 
costs, commissions from selling product protection plans and other 
ancillaries (which attract a higher margin as a percentage of revenue 
than product sales) grew to 18.4% for the reporting period. This was an 
improvement of 0.7ppts against the prior year with gross profit 
increasing by 22.0% to £129.2m (2016: £105.9m) largely driven by 
leverage in Europe.

Chief Financial Officer’s Report
continued In the UK, gross margin increased by 1.4ppts to 21.2% (2016: 19.8%). 
The improvement was predominately due to improved supplier 
product margin in our MDA and AV categories reflecting strengthening 
relationships with our product manufacturers and our ability to 
leverage our brand and scale. We also benefited from continuing 
volume efficiencies realised from our delivery bases as we continue to 
grow. However, we had margin headwinds during the second half of 
the year due to supplier pricing pressures following adverse currency 
movements post the Brexit referendum. 
In line with the increase in revenue relative to the prior period, in the 
UK the contribution from ancillaries increased slightly with additional 
next day delivery charges. The contribution to profit relative to revenue 
from other ancillaries increased slightly year on year reflecting the 
increase in delivery income described above. The contribution to 
profit from product protection plans and other ancillaries (excluding 
delivery) relative to revenue remained consistent with the previous year.
In Europe the gross loss reduced by 18.2% to £4.0m (2016: £4.9m) and 
gross margin improved by 6.5ppts to -5.6% (2016: -12.1%), with the 
losses and negative margin continuing to represent the early stage of 
these operations (with relatively low product margins and higher costs 
to deliver due to low drop densities at our current scale). However, 
during the period we have made significant progress with our supplier 
relationships resulting in solid improvements in product margin. In 
addition, our individual costs of delivery have improved following 
(i) internal efficiency drives (ii) a full year’s trading in the Netherlands 
which leverages our German infrastructure cost base (iii) increasing order 
levels which improved our drop densities and (iv) the use of a third‑party 
logistics delivery model in areas with very low population density.
Selling, General & Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”) 
(see table 3)
Total Group SG&A expenses increased by 22.2% over the year by 
£25.9m to £142.4m (2016: £116.5m). 
UK SG&A expenses for the year to 31 March 2017 increased by 20.6% 
to £118.6m (2016: £98.4m) and represented 18.8% of sales (2016: 17.6%). 
UK advertising and marketing expenditure as a percentage of revenue 
remained broadly unchanged year on year at 4.1% (2016: 4.3%) as we 
continue our strategy to grow brand awareness. We achieved a strong 
reduction across our traditional customer acquisition costs as a result 
of an increase in direct traffic (following improved brand awareness) 
and improved Search Engine Optimisation (“SEO”) performance. 
This has enabled us to further invest in TV and other advertising costs 
to accelerate our brand awareness strategy, which has continued into 
the new financial year with the sponsorship of Britain’s Got Talent.

  Adjustments is defined by the Group as set‑up costs and strategic post go‑live costs relating to overseas expansion and share‑based payment charges attributable to 
exceptional LTIP awards which the Board considers one-off in nature. 
UK warehousing costs increased by £6.2m to £27.3m (2016: £21.1m) 
representing 4.3% of revenue (2016: 3.8%) as we incurred a full year 
of trading from our second warehouse in Crewe and strengthened our 
distribution network via the opening of two new stockless outbases in 
Slough and Dundee. The additional outbases helped to reduce stem 
mileage thus creating further efficiencies in delivery costs reflected in 
gross margin and part of the cost of the second warehouse in Crewe 
was offset by the sub-let of part of it (the income from which sits in 
other Operating Income). As we continue to grow we should achieve 
greater efficiencies due to scale.
 
UK Other administration expenses increased by £9.0m to £61.4m 
(2016: £52.4m) and as a percentage of sales increased moderately to 
9.7% (2016: 9.4%). The increase largely related to investments made in 
trading teams for our new categories, our multi-media and IT teams, 
in advance of our anticipated further growth. 
UK Administrative expenses also includes £4.3m of cost in relation to 
(i) share-based payment charges which relate to a scheme introduced 
during the year which the Board considers one-off in nature and 
(ii) European set‑up costs (namely strategic post‑go‑live costs); 
(2016: £0.7m, which included a share-based payment credit of £0.4m).
Our increasing scale has helped to leverage European SG&A costs 
which have reduced to 33.2% of revenue (2016: 44.4%). Whilst this 
level of costs still reflects the relatively young nature of these 
operations we expect to make further progress in the year ahead as 
volumes increase and we continue to apply our well established UK 
business model, for example in respect of customer acquisition costs. 
We expect that such costs will not rise significantly going forward and 
we are ready for growth.
Europe advertising and marketing expenses have been held in line 
with the prior year at £6.2m (2016: £6.2m). This was a conscious 
decision by the Group to ensure a smooth transition as we consolidated 
our European operations. Warehousing costs incurred in our European 
operations increased by £1.8m in the period to £4.0m (2016: £2.2m) 
reflecting the opening of our Bergheim facility (although one chamber 
of the warehouse is currently sub-let) and we will continue to leverage 
this asset as we grow our volume. Other administration expenses 
increased by 59.8% to £13.6m (2016: £8.5m) as our headcount 
increased to a level ready for our next phase of growth.

49 Operating loss and Adjusted EBITDA (see table 4)
Operating Loss was £12.0m for the period, with operating losses 
increasing by £1.4m against the prior period. However, when 
reviewing profitability, the Directors use an adjusted measure 
of EBITDA in order to give a meaningful year-on-year comparison 
and it is a performance criteria for the purposes of both the Executive 
management’s annual bonus and recent LTIP awards. Whilst we 
recognise that the measure is an alternative (non-Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (“non‑GAAP”)) performance measure which is 
also not defined within IFRS, this measure is important and should 
be considered alongside the IFRS measures. The adjustments are 
separately disclosed below. 
Group Adjusted EBITDA losses reduced to £2.1m (2016: £3.9m losses)

£21.1m). In local currency (removing the impact of foreign exchange 
movements), European losses increased by 3.3% to €31.5m (2016: 
€30.4m), reflecting losses incurred in the Netherlands operation in 
its early stages of trading and further losses in the German business 
as we continue on our journey to build critical mass.
UK Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months to 31 March 2017 was £24.4m 
(2016: £17.2m) representing a significant increase of 41.7% against 
the prior year period following growth in sales and improvement 
in gross margin. 
Overall, Group Adjusted EBITDA missed our internal expectations 
but fell within our guided range.
Adjustments
Europe set-up costs
These are costs incurred in connection with our European expansion 
strategy prior to the “go‑live” of that territory, namely the launch of 
AO.de and AO.nl and our continuing research into other further 
countries along with strategic post “go‑live” costs. 
Exceptional share-based payment charges/(credits)
LTIP awards were made to a number of senior staff under the 
Performance Share Plan at the time of the Company’s IPO in 2014 and 
also under the Employee Reward Plan (ERP) in July 2016. The Board 
considers that the magnitude and timing of these awards are one-off 
in nature and so add-back any charge/(credit) in arriving at Adjusted 
EBITDA. The difference in the add‑back year on year reflects the 
cumulative adjustment to the LTIP charge based on the assessment 
of certain performance criteria during the period (with the credit in 
2016’s numbers reflecting the likelihood that the IPO award would not 
vest, whilst the charge this year relates to the ERP which, having been 
granted during the year under review, was not in the previous year).
AO Sharesave scheme charges and LTIP charges relating to the LTIP 
awards which are not considered to be one-off in nature are included 
in trading numbers. 
Depreciation, amortisation and profit on disposal of 
fixed assets
These are non-cash costs in relation to the Group’s tangible and 
intangible fixed assets which are added back to operating profit to 
arrive at EBITDA which is considered to be a relevant proxy for 
“cash operating profit”.
Profit on disposal of £0.3m (2016: £nil) represents the gain on the 
disposal of the Group’s existing trailers as part of our trailer 
replacement programme.
Taxation 
The tax charge for the year was £0.4m (2016: tax credit of £0.6m). 
The effective rate of tax for the year was -6.3% (2016: 9.2%). 
The Group is subject to taxes in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. 
Through its registered branch structure in Germany, the Group is able 
to fully offset its German losses against profits within the UK. Tax losses 
for prior years remain as carried forward losses within Germany. Due 
to the start-up nature and losses in Germany and the Netherlands, no 
overseas tax was attributable to the period. Losses to date not utilised 
that are subject to overseas tax are not recognised for deferred tax 
purposes on the basis that the Group does not expect these territories 
to be profitable until 2020. The above, along with the release of the 
deferred tax asset in connection with the IPO LTIP scheme results 
in a small Group tax charge despite the overall Group loss.

Chief Financial Officer’s Report
continued Retained loss for the year and loss per share
Retained loss for the year was £7.4m (2016: £6.1m). Basic loss per share 
was 1.56p (2016: 1.44p loss) which is positively affected by a foreign 
exchange gain of £4.4m (2016: £2.7m) arising from intra-Group 
funding arrangements. 
The foreign exchange gain has arisen as a result of the significant 
movement in the exchange rate between sterling and the euro in the 
period. This has impacted the value of intra-Group loans held in GBP 
in the European entities and EUR loans in the UK giving rise to the 
£4.4m gain referenced above. 
Below shows the adjusted basic loss per share excluding the foreign 
exchange gain mentioned above.

Adjusted basic loss per share (2.62) (2.07)
Cash resources and cash flow
Year-end net funds position was £12.0m (2016: £25.4m), as cash 
decreased to £29.4m (2016: £33.4m) principally reflecting capital 
expenditure in the UK and investment in the new RDC in Bergheim 
offset partly by a positive operating cash‑flow of £3.5m (2016: outflow 
of £3.5m), whilst total borrowings (comprising asset finance and bank 
borrowings) increased to £17.4m from £8.0m in 2016. The increase 
principally reflects the funding for investment in the UK’s logistics 
fleet and the new recycling plant in the UK.
In June 2016, the Group put in place a revolving credit facility of £30m 
with Lloyds Bank Plc and Barclays Bank Plc in order to fund UK 
working capital movements. 
Working capital (see table 5) 
At 31 March 2017, the Group had net current liabilities of £28.5m 
(31 March 2016: net current liabilities of £8.7m) principally as a result of 
improved terms with the Group’s suppliers and an increase in inventories.
As at 31 March 2017 UK inventories were £35.7m (2016: £30.9m) 
reflecting an increase in sales volumes and an increase in our 
stock‑holding to support the AV category which is generally only 
bought in bulk loads and to lock in prices prior to supplier price 
increases. As a result UK average stock days increased to 31 days 
(2016: 29 days).
UK trade and other receivables (both non-current and current) were 
£76.9m as at 31 March 2017 (2016: £59.3m) reflecting an increase in 
accrued income in respect of commissions due on product protection 
plans as a result of the higher retail volumes. UK trade and other 
payables increased to £129.0m (2016: £102.8m) reflecting increased 
inventory and manufacturers continuing to extend credit on the higher 
volume of sales.
At 31 March 2017, European inventories were £9.1m (2016: £3.1m) 
principally as a result of the increase in sales volumes in both 
territories during the year. This is also reflected in the increase in trade 
and other payables from £6.3m to £11.2m. Trade and other receivables 
remained broadly in line with the prior year at £4.0m (2016: £4.6m) 
with the increase in trade being offset by improvement in terms with 
certain payment providers.
Capital expenditure
Total capital expenditure for the year was £16.9m (2016: £8.7m), which 
comprised expenditure in relation to our new distribution centre in 
Bergheim and two new outbases in the UK, our recycling facility at AO 
recycling in Telford and the refresh of trailers in our logistics operation. 
£10.9m of such expenditure has been financed by financing leases.
Events after the reporting period
On 3 April 2017 we completed a placing of 37,735,849 new ordinary 
shares in the Company to raise £50m gross proceeds to suitably 
capitalise the business to support our continued growth and 
increasing scale.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
51 Dear shareholder
I am pleased to report to you on the Board’s activities and 
development during my first year as Chairman. 
Since IPO in March 2014 the Group has made great progress in 
developing its governance framework and, as your new Chairman, 
one of my key responsibilities will be to continue to build on this by 
supporting and promoting good practice and applying relevant 
requirements and guidelines in a pragmatic way to aid the long‑term 
success of AO. 
Following my appointment I conducted an in‑ depth review of the 
current workings of the Board, including its role in Group strategy, 
its composition and its strengths in debate and challenge. My findings 
were largely positive, and the Board as a whole believes that we have 
the right mix of skills to supervise our business and to meet our 
governance responsibilities. However, our business is developing 
and growing rapidly and whilst our key processes for audit, risk, 
remuneration and general Board governance are working well, the 
Board is aware that it does not currently meet The UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 (“the Code”) independence requirements in 
respect of the composition of the Board and the Audit and Nomination 
Committees. Under the recommendation of the Nomination Committee 
the Board has instructed a specialist search consultancy to identify 
two individuals with the experience to broaden and strengthen the 
Board and to support the executive team in achieving the Group’s 
strategic ambitions, whilst at the same time addressing our Code 
compliance issues. We expect the details of these appointments to 
be announced in the coming months.
My review also included an assessment of the Board’s role in strategy. 
To increase the Board’s focus on our future, Board strategy days have 
now been formally scheduled to allow focused time for enhanced 
debate, challenge and understanding of the opportunities ahead and 
how our strategy can be affected and complemented by the strategic 
aims of our chosen partners. 
As outlined elsewhere in this report there have been some important 
changes to the structure of the Board during the year. In February 2017 
we announced that Steve Caunce, previously Chief Operating Officer, 
would succeed John Roberts as Chief Executive Officer, and that John 
would adopt a new role on the Board as Founder, Executive Director. 
Steve will therefore be responsible for leading the Company, 
accountable for strategy and performance delivery. John will focus 
on innovation and inspiring AO’s people. Both will be responsible for 
maintaining and developing our unique culture. Since this change was 
a natural evolution of our executive team, the transition has been 
seamless, as expected, with no disruption to the business and with 
both Steve and John now comfortably executing their roles. 
My predecessor, Richard Rose, resigned from the Board as Chairman 
at the Company’s AGM in July 2016 after eight years with the Company, 
leading the Board through the Company’s rapid stages of growth and 
most significantly its IPO on the London Stock Exchange. In February 
2017, having served on the Company since its IPO in March 2014, by 
agreement, Rudi Lamprecht retired. On behalf of the Board I would 
again like to thank Richard and Rudi for their significant contributions 
to the business. 
Following Rudi’s departure, Brian McBride replaced him as a member 
of the Audit Committee and I became a member of the Remuneration 
Committee. I also succeeded Richard Rose as Chair of the Nomination 
Committee and whilst we are confident that both of these Committees 
are well constituted and working effectively, having regard to the 
requirements of the Code, we will review the composition of each 
following the appointment of our new Non-Executive Directors 
outlined above.
During the year we have continued to build our UK business and 
to grow into new territories where we can leverage our existing 
knowledge and skills. Our success will depend on our ability to deliver 
our four supporting strategic elements: culture & brand, customers, 
categories and countries. I believe that AO has strong governance 
foundations required for sustainable, long‑term success and over the 
coming financial year we will continue to work towards implementing 
the appropriate requirements and policies for the Company. 
As was the case last year, all Directors wishing to remain in office will 
seek election and re-election at the AGM.
Since my appointment in July last year, I have engaged with a number 
of AO’s shareholders and I look forward to meeting many more at our 
forthcoming AGM.

the main principles of the 
Code and its compliance with

Corporate Governance Statement
Chairman’s letter to shareholders Introduction
This Corporate Governance Statement explains key features of the Company’s governance structure and how it complies with The UK 
Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) published in September 2014 by the Financial Reporting Council. This Statement also includes items 
required by the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules. The Code is available on the Financial Reporting Council 
website at www.frc.org.uk.
Compliance with the Code
The Directors consider that the Company has, throughout the reporting period, complied with the provisions of the Code save as noted below:
Code provision Detail Explanation of non-compliance
A.4.2 
B.6.3
Led by the Senior Independent Director, the 
Non-Executive Directors did not meet 
without the Chairman present to appraise 
and evaluate his performance.
Geoff Cooper became Chairman at the conclusion of the 
Company’s AGM in July 2016. It was therefore not appropriate 
to appraise his performance until he had been in the role for 
an appropriate length of time. However, an appraisal of his 
performance was conducted by the Non-Executive Directors 
shortly following the Company’s reporting period in May 2017.
B.1.2 Less than half of the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, are independent Non-Executive 
Directors. 
Excluding the Chairman who was deemed independent on 
appointment, the Board currently has two experienced independent 
Non-Executive Directors. As discussed elsewhere in this report, 
the Board is currently seeking to add to its independent component 
through the appointment of two new Non-Executive Directors and 
therefore expects to comply with this Code provision in the near 
future. However, notwithstanding these appointments, the Board is 
satisfied that no individual has dominated its decision making, no 
undue reliance has been placed on particular individuals, there has 
been sufficient challenge of executive management in meetings of 
the Board and the Board has operated effectively. 
B.2.1 The Nomination Committee does not 
comprise a majority of independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
Only Brian McBride is considered independent and while Geoff 
Cooper, Chairman of the Company and the Committee, was 
considered to be independent on appointment, and remains so, 
the Code provides that thereafter the test of independence is not 
appropriate in relation to the Chairman. However, the Board 
considers that it has a strong independent non‑ executive 
component and that the continuity, experience and knowledge of 
Chris Hopkinson ensures that he made a significant contribution 
to the work of the Committee over the period under review. The 
composition of the Committee will be continually reviewed to 
ensure it remains effective.
B.6.2 An externally facilitated evaluation of the 
Board has not taken place within the last 
three years.
The Company had intended to conduct an externally facilitated 
evaluation of the Board during the reporting period; however, given 
the appointment of the new Chairman, Geoff Cooper, in July 2016, 
who conducted his own evaluation, this review was not considered 
necessary. The Board intends to conduct an externally facilitated 
evaluation during the year ending 31 March 2018.
C.3.1 The Audit Committee does not comprise 
three independent Non-Executive Directors.
Chris Hopkinson is not considered to be independent for the 
purposes of the Code given his long-term involvement with the 
business. The Board considers that the composition of the Audit 
Committee has a strong independent non-executive component 
and that the continuity, experience and knowledge of Chris 
Hopkinson ensured that he made a significant contribution to the 
work of the Committee and that it ran effectively over the period 
under review. The composition of this Committee will be 
continually reviewed to ensure it remains effective.
More information on our approach to governance is included in the introduction, the report on corporate governance and the reports of the 
Committees set out on page 53 to 79. These reports describe how we have applied the main principles of the Code. In addition this information 
is set out in detail on our website at www.ao.com/corporate.

The Board
Role of the Board
Our Board is collectively responsible for the Group’s performance 
and meets as often as necessary to effectively conduct its business. 
The Board is responsible for supervising the management of the 
business and approving the strategic direction of the Company with 
three Committees to which it delegates key governance and 
compliance procedures.
The Board has an annual rolling plan of items for discussion which 
is reviewed and adapted regularly to ensure all matters reserved to 
the Board, with other items as appropriate, are discussed. At each 
meeting, the Chief Executive Officer updates the Board on key 
operational developments, provides an overview of the market, 
reports on Health and Safety and other key operational risks and 
highlights the important milestones reached in the delivery of the 
Group’s strategic objectives. The Founder provides an update and 
insight on market dynamics and the Chief Financial Officer provides 
an update on the Group’s financial performance, banking 
arrangements and provides an update on AO’s relationships with 
investors and potential investors and shareholder analysis. Meeting 
proceedings and any unresolved concerns expressed by any Director 
are minuted by the Company Secretary who, as Director of Group 
Legal, provides the Board with an update on any legal issues. 
Members of the Group Executive Team are also invited to attend Board 
meetings to present on specific business issues and proposals. This 
way the Board is given the opportunity to meet with the next layers of 
management and gain a more in‑ depth understanding of key areas 
of the business. Additionally, over the current financial year, external 
speakers will be invited to present to Board on topical industry issues. 
All of these topics lead to discussion, debate and challenge amongst 
the Directors. 
The Company is led and controlled by the Board. The structure and business of the Board is designed to ensure that the Directors 
focus on strategy, monitoring, governance and the performance of the Group. The Board is collectively responsible to shareholders 
for the long-term success of the Company. The Board has delegated certain responsibilities to Board Committees to assist it with 
discharging its duties, and delegates the detailed implementation of matters approved by the Board and the day‑ to‑ day operational 
aspects of the business to the Executive Directors who cascade this responsibility to the Group Executive Team (“GET”) and 
throughout the Group. The Reports of each Committee can be found on pages 60 to 79. 
Overview of Governance structure
The formal schedule of matters reserved to our Board for decision 
making includes:
 – Setting and reviewing the Group’s long‑ term objectives, 
commercial strategy, business plan and annual budget.
 – Overseeing the Group’s operations and management.
 – Governance and risk control issues.
 – Major capital projects.
A full list of those matters reserved for the Board is available on the 
Company’s website at www.ao.com/corporate and from the Company 
Secretary upon request.
Current composition of our Board
As at the date of this Annual Report the Board comprises seven 
members: the Chairman, three Executive Directors and three 
Non-Executive Directors, which includes the Senior Independent 
Director. All our Directors served throughout the year, with the 
exception of Geoff Cooper who was appointed to the Board on 
1 July 2016 and became Chairman following the Company’s AGM on 
21 July 2016, succeeding Richard Rose. Further details of the relevant 
skills and experience of the Board are set out in their biographical 
details set out on pages 54 and 55. The Board regularly reviews its 
composition, experience and skills to ensure that the Board and its 
Committees continue to work effectively and that the Directors are 
demonstrating a commitment to their roles.

Corporate Governance Statement
continued On 22 February 2017 the Company announced that as part of the 
natural evolution of the Board and executive management structure, 
Steve Caunce would succeed John Roberts as Chief Executive Officer 
and John would adopt the new role of Founder, Executive Director, 
providing focus on innovation and inspiring AO’s people. On 
26 January 2017, the Company announced that the initial three-year 
term of Rudi Lamprecht’s appointment as a Non-Executive Director, 
by agreement, would not be renewed. On the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee, the Board has instructed a specialist search 
consultancy to identify two individuals with the experience and 
knowledge to broaden and strengthen the Board’s existing 
composition and to support the executive team in achieving the 
Group’s strategic ambitions whilst at the same time addressing its 
Code compliance issues. We expect the details of these appointments 
to the Board to be announced in the coming months.
Further details about these changes and the work of the Nomination 
Committee is disclosed on pages 60 and 61.
For information on our procedures concerning the appointment and 
replacement of Directors, please see the Directors’ Report on page 81.
Board meetings and attendance 
Nine Board meetings (scheduled in the ordinary course of business)

***  Rudi Lamprecht’s three-year term of appointment to the Board was not 
renewed with effect from 16 February 2017.
Where Directors are unable to attend meetings, they receive the 
papers scheduled for discussion at the relevant meetings, giving them 
the opportunity to raise any issues and give any comments to the 
Chairman in advance of the meeting.
Division of responsibilities
The positions of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are not 
exercised by the same person, ensuring a clear division of responsibility 
at the head of the Company. The division of roles and responsibilities 
between Geoff Cooper and Steve Caunce is clearly established.
As Chairman of the Board, Geoff Cooper is responsible for its leadership, 
setting its agenda, monitoring its effectiveness and ensuring good 
governance. He facilitates both the contribution of the Non-Executive 
Directors and constructive relations between the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. 
Steve Caunce and Mark Higgins are together responsible for the 
day‑ to‑ day running of the Group, carrying out our agreed strategy 
and implementing specific Board decisions. John Roberts is 
responsible for innovation and inspiring AO’s people. 
The Senior Independent Director (“SID”) is Brian McBride, who is 
available to shareholders if they have concerns that the normal 
channels of Chairman or Chief Executive Officer have failed to resolve, 
or for which such channels of communication are inappropriate. The 
SID also acts as an internal sounding board for the Chairman and 
serves as intermediary for the other Directors, with the Chairman, 
when necessary. The role of the SID is considered to be an important 
check and balance in the Group’s governance structure. In accordance 
with the Code, neither the Chairman nor the SID are employed as 
executives of the Group.
Diversity
We fully support the aims, objectives and recommendations outlined 
in Lord Davies’ Report “Women on Boards” and are aware of the need 
to increase the number of women on our Board and in senior positions 
throughout the Group. However, we do not consider that it is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders to set prescriptive 
targets for gender on the Board and we will continue to make 
appointments based on merit, against objective criteria to ensure we 
appoint the best individual for each role whilst maintaining an overall 
objective to have a Board of mixed gender and background that has 
an instinctive feel for our customers and people. As at 31 March 2017 
across our business there were 668 female employees out of a total 
of 2,490 employees and we have one female on the Board. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest 
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they have 
or may have interests that conflict with those of the Company, unless 
that conflict is first authorised by the Board. This includes potential 
conflicts that may arise when a Director takes up a position with 
another company. The Company’s Articles of Association, which are 
in line with the Companies Act 2006, allow the Board to authorise 
potential conflicts of interest that may arise and to impose limits or 
conditions, as appropriate, when giving any authorisation. Any 
decision of the Board to authorise a conflict of interest is only effective 
if it is agreed without the conflicted Directors voting or without their 
votes being counted. In making such a decision, the Directors must act 
in a way they consider in good faith will be most likely to promote the 
success of the Company. 
The Company has established a procedure for the appropriate 
authorisation to be sought prior to the appointment of any new 
Director, or prior to a new conflict arising and for the regular review of 
actual or potential conflicts of interest. An Interests Register records 
any authorised potential conflicts and will be reviewed by the Board 
on a regular basis to ensure that the procedure is working effectively.

Corporate Governance Statement
continued Board evaluation and effectiveness
The effectiveness and performance of the Board is vital to our success. 
An in‑ depth internal evaluation of the performance of the Board and its 
Committees was carried out by the Company’s new Chairman, Geoff 
Cooper during the year. As part of this process one-to-one meetings were 
conducted with all Directors who were given the opportunity to express 
their views about: 
 – The performance of the Board and its Committees, including how 
the Directors work together as a whole.
 – The balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
of the Directors.
 – Individual performance and whether each Director continues 
to make an effective contribution.
The results of the evaluation were collated by the Chairman who made 
appropriate recommendations which were considered by the Board. 
The results of the evaluation indicated that the Board is working well 
and that there are no significant concerns among the Directors about its 
effectiveness. Some actions were agreed and will be progressed over 
the coming year, for example strengthening the Non-Executive Director 
component of the Board to ensure the correct mix of skills and to provide 
appropriate support to the Executive Directors in pursuit of achieving the 
Group’s strategic objectives and scheduling a number of Board strategy 
days to enhance debate, challenge and understanding of the 
opportunities ahead.
During the year, the Chairman met with the Non-Executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors present to discuss Board balance, monitor 
the powers of individual Executive Directors and raise any issues between 
themselves as appropriate. Geoff Cooper became Chairman in July 2016 
and given the relatively short amount of time from his appointment to the 
end of the Group’s reporting period, an appraisal of his performance by 
the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, did 
not occur until shortly after the end of the reporting period.
Following evaluation, it was agreed that all Directors contribute effectively, 
demonstrate a high level of commitment to their role and together provide 
the skills and experience that are relevant and necessary for the 
leadership and direction of the Company.
Independence
For the purposes of assessing compliance with the Code, the Board 
considers that Marisa Cassoni and Brian McBride are Non-Executive 
Directors who are independent of management and free from any 
business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement. The Board also considers that 
Geoff Cooper, Chairman of the Company, was independent at the time 
of his appointment in July 2016 and remains so. As previously stated the 
Board is currently conducting a search for the addition of two independent 
Non-Executive Directors to broaden the skills of the Board and strengthen 
its independent component.
Having regard to the character, judgement, commitment and 
performance of the Board and Committees to date, and following the 
Board evaluation conducted during the year, the Board is satisfied that no 
one individual will dominate the Board’s decision taking and considers 
that all of the Non-Executive Directors are able to provide objective 
challenges to management. A key objective of the Board is to ensure that 
its composition is sufficiently diverse and reflects a broad range of skills, 
knowledge and experience to enable it to meet its responsibilities. As can 
been seen from the biographies on pages 54 and 55, the Chairman and 
the Non-Executive Directors collectively have significant industry, public 
company and international experience which will support the Company 
in executing its strategy.
Director election
Following the Board evaluation process and the subsequent 
recommendations from the Nomination Committee the Board considers 
that all Directors continue to be effective, committed to their roles and are 
able to devote sufficient time to their duties. Accordingly, all Directors will 
seek election and re-election at the Company’s AGM. 
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of the Company will take place at 11.00 am on Friday 21 July 2017 
at the Company’s registered office at AO Park, 5A The Parklands, Lostock, 
Bolton BL6 4SD. All shareholders have the opportunity to attend and vote, 
in person or by proxy, at the AGM. The notice of the AGM can be found in a 
booklet which is being mailed out at the same time as this Report and can 
also be found on our website www.ao.com/corporate. The notice of the 
AGM sets out the business of the meeting and an explanatory note on all 
resolutions. Separate resolutions are proposed in respect of each 
substantive issue.
Geoff Cooper, the Chair of each of the Committees and the Executive 
Directors will be present at the AGM and will be available to answer 
shareholders’ questions.
Information, support and development opportunities 
available to Directors
All Board Directors have access to the Company Secretary, who advises 
them on governance matters. The Chairman and the Company Secretary 
work together to ensure that Board papers are clear , accurate, delivered in 
a timely manner to Directors and of sufficient quality to enable the Board 
to discharge its duties. Specific business-related presentations are given 
by members of the Group Executive T eam when appropriate, and going 
forward it is also intended that external speakers will attend Board 
meetings to present on relevant topics. As well as the support of the 
Company Secretary, there is a procedure in place for any Director to take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in the 
furtherance of their duties, where considered necessary, for example 
New Bridge Street consultants advise on remuneration matters and Audit 
Committee members have received guidance from the external auditors 
on their duties as members of this Committee and new developments in 
reporting standards. As part of the Board Evaluation process, training and 
development needs are considered and training courses are arranged, 
where appropriate.
In line with the Code, we ensure that any new Directors joining the 
Board receives appropriate support and are given a comprehensive, 
formal and tailored induction programme organised through the 
Company Secretary, including the provision of background material 
on the Company and briefings with the Group Executive T eam where 
appropriate. Each Director’s individual experience and background are 
taken into account in developing a programme tailored to his or her own 
requirements. Any new Director will also be expected to meet with major 
shareholders if required.
External directorships 
Any external appointments or other significant commitments of the 
Directors require the prior approval of the Board. Details of the Directors’ 
significant external directorships can be found on pages 54 and 55. 
No new appointments were made during the year. 
While all Non-Executive Directors have external directorships, the Board 
is comfortable that these do not impact on the time that any Director 
devotes to the Company and we believe that this experience only 
enhances the capability of the Board. Save for Crystalcraft Limited, a 
dormant company, and the charities Onside Youth Zones and AO Smile 
Charitable Foundation, for which he receives no fees, John Roberts does 
not hold any external directorships. Save for Crystalcraft Limited and 
Aghoco 1283 Limited, dormant companies, and the AO Smile Charitable 
Foundation, for which he receives no fees, Steve Caunce does not hold 
any external directorships. Mark Higgins holds no external directorships.

year ended 31 March 2017 and their attendance at Committee meetings 
is as follows:

Geoff Cooper
Chairman, Nomination Committee
Report of the Nomination Committee The Code recommends that the Nomination Committee is comprised 
of a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors. Only Brian 
McBride is deemed as independent as whilst I was considered to be 
independent on appointment, the Code provides that thereafter the 
test of independence is not appropriate in relation to the Chairman, 
as was similarly the case with Richard Rose, my predecessor. Chris 
Hopkinson is not deemed as independent for the purposes of the Code 
due to his historic involvement with the Company. However, during 
the year the Board considered that it had a strong independent 
non‑ executive component and that the continuity, experience and 
knowledge of Chris made a significant contribution to the work of the 
Committee, ensuring the Committee is run effectively. 
Julie Finnemore (Director of Group Legal and Company Secretary) 
serves as Secretary to the Committee. By invitation, the meetings of 
the Nomination Committee may be attended by the Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Founder Executive Director and 
Marisa Cassoni. 
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Committee is responsible for regularly reviewing the structure, 
size and composition of the Board and has responsibility for 
nominating candidates for appointment as Directors to the Board, 
having regard to its composition in terms of diversity (including 
gender) and ensuring it reflects a broad range of skills, knowledge 
and experience to enable it to meet its responsibilities.
The Nomination Committee also makes recommendations to the 
Board concerning the reappointment of any Non-Executive Director 
as he or she reaches the end of the period of their initial appointment 
(three years) and at appropriate intervals during their tenure. The 
Committee also considers and makes recommendations to the Board 
on the annual election and re‑ election of any Director by shareholders 
including Executive Directors (and changes to the Group Executive 
Team), after evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience of each Director. Such appointments are made on merit, 
against objective criteria and with due regard to the benefits of 
diversity on the Board. The Company uses a combination of external 
recruitment consultants and personal referrals in making any 
required appointments to the Board.
The Nomination Committee takes into account the provisions of the Code 
and any regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Company. 
The Company had intended to conduct an externally facilitated 
evaluation of the Board during the reporting period in accordance 
with the provisions of the Code. However given that I conducted my 
own in‑ depth evaluation of the Board following my appointment, 
it was deemed appropriate to delay the externally facilitated review 
until the current financial year. The Nomination Committee will be 
responsible for ensuring that future external evaluations of the 
Board are carried out according to applicable regulations. 
The Chairman does not chair the Nomination Committee when 
it is dealing with the appointment of a successor Chair. In these 
circumstances the Committee is chaired by an independent member 
of the Nomination Committee elected by the remaining members.

Corporate Governance Statement
continued Main activities of the Committee during the year
A number of important changes have been made to the Board 
during the period under review. Having regard to the growth and 
development of the Company, it became apparent that some natural 
evolutionary changes to the roles of the Executive Directors were 
required and, following the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee, in February 2017 we announced that Steve Caunce, 
previously Chief Operating Officer, would succeed John Roberts 
as Chief Executive Officer, and that John would adopt a new role on 
the Board as Founder, Executive Director. Steve will therefore be 
responsible for leading the Company, accountable for strategy and 
performance delivery. John will focus on innovation and inspiring 
AO’s people. Both will be responsible for maintaining and developing 
our unique culture. As expected the transition has been seamless 
with no disruption to the business and with both Steve and John now 
comfortably executing their roles. 
The three-year initial term of the appointments of our Non-Executive 
Directors expired on or around February 2017 (the Directors having 
been first appointed shortly before the Company’s IPO). Marisa 
Cassoni and Brian McBride’s appointments were extended but by 
agreement, the three-year term of appointment of Rudi Lamprecht 
to the Board was not renewed. Led by myself as Chairman and in 
consultation with an external independent non‑ executive search 
consultancy (The Zygos Partnership) we are currently seeking the 
appointment of two new independent Non-Executive Directors. These 
appointments will seek to help expand the Board’s skill set in terms of 
internationalising the AO brand, providing a new avenue of thought to 
drive growth and increase Board diversity whilst also addressing our 
Code non-compliance issues with respect to independence criteria. 
We have been impressed by the calibre of candidates we have met 
with thus far, and hope to be able to announce these appointments 
over the coming months. 
During the year the Nomination Committee assessed the composition 
and effectiveness of the Board and its Committees, having regard to 
the internal Board evaluation carried out by myself, and considered 
renewal of appointments and the proposal for election and re‑ election 
of all the Directors at the forthcoming AGM. Feedback from my Board 
evaluation, which includes the views of Executive and Non-Executive 
Board members, was largely positive and did not expose major issues 
although highlighted a number of areas to be strengthened such as the 
Non-Executive component of the Board and more formalised Board 
strategy days. As outlined above these areas are being addressed and 
progress will be made over the coming year. The Committee also 
reviewed succession planning of senior management; it recognises 
that effective succession planning is fundamental to the success of the 
Company and that ensuring the continued development of talented 
employees and appropriately rewarding them helps to mitigate the 
risks associated with unforeseen events, such as key individuals 
leaving the business. Accordingly, below the PLC Board, our business 
divisions have been restructured giving more responsibility and 
accountability to members of the Group Executive Team and their 
respective management teams. This has helped highlight areas in 
need of strengthening and gaps in our succession plans. Our people 
and culture (including succession planning) will continue to be a key 
area of consideration in the year ahead. 
On the recommendation of the Nomination Committee and in line 
with the Code, all currently appointed Directors will retire at the 2017 
AGM and offer themselves for reappointment. The biographical 
details of the current Directors can be found on pages 54 and 55. The 
Committee considers that the performance of the Directors standing 
for election and re‑ election continues to be effective and that they each 
demonstrate commitment to their role and devote sufficient time to 
attend Board and Committee meetings and any other duties.
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors, 
including the expected time commitment, are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office.
Diversity
The Committee takes into account a variety of factors before 
recommending any new appointments to the Board, including 
relevant skills to perform the role, experience, knowledge, ethnicity 
and gender and concurs with the recommendations of Lord Davies’ 
review. The Company currently has one female Board member out of 
seven and AO endeavours to achieve appropriate diversity, including 
gender diversity, and notably, The Zygos Partnership (who we are 
currently working with to help identify two new Non-Executive 
Directors) are well-known for their work in the appointment of women. 
However, the most important priority of the Committee has been and 
will continue to be ensuring that members of the Board should 
collectively possess the broad range of skills, expertise and industry 
knowledge, and business and other experience necessary for the 
effective oversight of the Group. 
Our policy is, therefore, to ensure that the best candidate is selected 
to join the Board and this approach will remain in place going forward, 
without prescriptive or quantitative targets.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions on the work of 
the Nomination Committee.

Overview   Strategic Report   Our Governance   Our Results   Shareholders’ Information Internal controls
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls and it receives 
regular reports from management identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks within the business. The system of internal 
controls is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
This system of internal controls complies with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Internal Control: Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting. The Audit 
Committee reviews the system of internal controls through reports 
received from management, along with those from both internal and 
external auditors. Management continues to focus on how internal 
control and risk management can be further embedded into the 
operations of the business and to deal with areas of improvement 
which come to the attention of management and the Board. 
The Board and the Audit Committee review on an ongoing basis the 
effectiveness of the system of internal controls and did so during the 
year ended 31 March 2017 and for the period up to the date of approval 
of the consolidated financial statements contained in the Annual 
Report. The review covered all material controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management systems. 
The Board confirms that no significant failings or weaknesses have 
been identified from its review of the system of internal control. This 
has involved considering the matters reported to it and developing 
plans and programmes that it considers are reasonable in the 
circumstances. The Board also confirms that it has not been advised 
of material weaknesses in the part of the internal control system that 
relates to financial reporting.
The key elements of the Group’s system of internal controls, which 
have been in place throughout the year under review and up to the 
date of this report, include:
 – Risk management: Our Risk Management Committee has a clear 
framework for identifying, evaluating and managing risk faced by 
the Group on an ongoing basis, both at an operational and strategic 
level. This internal control process starts with the identification 
of risks through regular routine reviews with our AO team 
representatives facilitated by our internal audit team with 
appropriate action taken to manage and mitigate the risks 
identified. These risks are recorded in the Group’s Corporate Risk 
Register and the implications and consequences for the Group 
together with the likelihood of occurrence are assessed. This 
register is reviewed and discussed at least quarterly by the Risk 
Management Committee and follow-up actions are assigned as 
appropriate. The Risk Management Committee issues a report to 
the Audit Committee and the key risks are included within the 
Group’s Corporate Risk Register which is then reviewed and 
scrutinised by the Board and from which the Group’s principal 
risks are determined. For further details of our risk management 
and risk appetite please see pages 40 to 44. 
 – Management structure: There is a clearly defined organisational 
structure throughout the Group with established lines of reporting 
and delegation of authority based on job responsibilities and 
experience. Within the businesses, Group Executive Team 
meetings occur regularly to allow prompt discussion of relevant 
business issues and to ensure alignment on strategy. Please see 
page 56 for further details on our management structure.
 – Financial reporting: Monthly management accounts provide 
relevant, reliable and up-to-date financial and non-financial 
information to management and the Board. Analysis is undertaken 
of the differences between actual results and budgeted results on 
a monthly basis. Annual plans, forecasts, performance targets 
and long-range financial plans allow management to monitor the 
key business and financial activities, and the progress towards 
achieving the financial objectives. The annual budget is approved 
by the Board. The Group reports half-yearly based on a 
standardised reporting process.
 – Information systems: Information systems are developed to 
support the Group’s long‑ term objectives and are managed 
by professionally staffed teams. The integration of Microsoft 
Dynamics, our new financial reporting system, is continuing and 
is working to improve internal controls and the efficiency of our 
processes, assist with the segregation of duties and standardise 
procedures across the Group. Appropriate policies and procedures 
are in place covering all significant areas of the business.
 – Contractual commitments: There are clearly defined policies 
and procedures for entering into contractual commitments. 
These include detailed requirements that must be completed 
prior to submitting proposals and/or tenders for work, both in 
respect of the commercial, control and risk management aspects 
of the obligations being entered into. Significant contractual 
commitments, capital projects and acquisitions and disposals 
require Board approval.
 – Monitoring of controls: The Audit Committee receives regular 
reports from the internal and external auditors and assures itself 
that the internal control environment of the Group is operating 
effectively. There are formal policies and procedures in place to 
ensure the integrity and accuracy of the accounting records and 
to safeguard the Group’s assets. There are formal procedures by 
which staff can, in confidence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in financial and pensions administration and other 
matters – often referred to as “whistleblowing” procedures.

Corporate Governance Statement
continued I am pleased to report on the role and activities of the Audit Committee 
for the year.
Composition and attendance of the Committee
The members of the Audit Committee who served during the year 
ended 31 March 2017 and their attendance at Committee meetings is 
as follows:
Meetings 
eligible to 
attend
Meetings 
attended
Marisa Cassoni Chair 5 5
Chris Hopkinson Non-Executive Director 5 5
Brian McBride* Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director 1 1
Rudi Lamprecht** Independent 4 3
* From his appointment to the Committee with effect from 16 February 2017.
** Until the expiration of his tenure on the Board with effect from 16 February 2017.
Two meetings are scheduled per year to review each of the Annual 
Report and Accounts and the half-yearly report. Other meetings are 
scheduled as required. 
The Code recommends that the Audit Committee should comprise 
at least three members, all of whom should be independent 
Non-Executive Directors with at least one member having recent and 
relevant financial experience. I am the independent Non-Executive 
Director considered to have recent and relevant financial experience 
and am pleased to confirm that all members have had extensive and 
relevant experience (Directors’ biographies appear on pages 54 and 55). 
Report of the Audit Committee Following Rudi Lamprecht leaving the Board on 16 February 2017, 
Brian McBride, Senior Independent Non-Executive Director replaced 
him as a member of the Audit Committee. Chris Hopkinson is not 
regarded as an independent Non-Executive Director for the purposes 
of the Code and therefore during the year the Committee was not fully 
compliant in this respect. However, Chris’ financial experience and 
knowledge is valuable to the Committee and will help to ensure that 
the Committee is run effectively.
 
Julie Finnemore (Director of Group Legal and Company Secretary) 
serves as Secretary to the Committee. By invitation, the meetings of the 
Audit Committee may be attended by the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Director of Financial Control and the 
Head of Internal Audit. The external audit engagement partner and team 
are also invited to attend Audit Committee meetings to ensure full 
communication of matters relating to the audit. As Chair of the Audit 
Committee, I met regularly with both the internal and external auditors 
during the year.
Role of Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has particular responsibility for monitoring the 
Group’s financial reporting process, the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
operation of internal controls and the integrity of the financial statements. 
This includes a review of significant issues and judgements, policies and 
disclosures. The Committee reviews the Company’s risk management 
and viability disclosure for recommendation to the Board for approval. 
Our duties also include keeping under review the scope and results of the 
audit and its cost effectiveness, consideration of management’s response 
to any major external or internal audit recommendations and the 
independence and objectivity of the internal and external auditors.
Additionally, the Board requests that the Audit Committee advises 
whether we believe the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair , balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. 
A forward agenda will be used for the coming year’s activities focused 
around the review of the annual financial statements, the results of the 
external annual audit and interim reviews and internal audit quarterly 
updates, relevant interim financial reporting and the external audit plan; 
review of risk management reports; review of internal audit plans and 
findings and recommendations.
A key responsibility of the Audit Committee is to ensure that the external 
audit process and audit quality are effective. We do this by relying on: 
(i)  the engagement with the Audit Committee Chair and the lead 
audit engagement partner which will generally be through 
face‑to‑face meetings; 
(ii)  the reports which are brought to the Committee by the lead audit 
engagement partner and other senior members of the audit team; 
(iii)  the quality of the management responses to audit queries; meetings 
held with the Chief Financial Officer, Director of Financial Control and 
the Chairman with the lead audit engagement partner which are 
reported to myself as Audit Chair and the Committee; and 
(iv)  a review of the independence and objectivity of the audit firm and 
also the quality of the formal audit report given by the Auditor to 
shareholders. Feedback is also sought from members of the finance 
team, the Company Secretary and the Group Internal Audit Manager. 
Audit Committee meetings are generally scheduled to take place in 
advance of a Company Board meeting. As the Committee’s Chair, I report 
to the Board as part of a separate agenda item on the activity of the

during the year
Review of the 2017 Financial Statements
During the year to 31 March 2017 the Audit Committee reviewed 
and endorsed, prior to submission to the Board, full-year financial 
statements and the preliminary, interim results and trading update 
announcements. We considered internal audit reports and risk 
management updates, agreed external and internal audit plans, 
approved the review of accounting policies and ensured appropriate 
whistleblowing arrangements and associated policies were in place.
The internal audit annual plan was reviewed and approved by the 
Committee and all reports arising therefrom were reviewed and 
assessed, along with management’s actions to findings and 
recommendations. 
In reviewing the financial statements with management and the 
Auditors, the Committee has discussed and debated the critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty set 
out in note 4 to the financial statements. As a result of our review, the 
Committee has identified the following issues that require a high level 
of judgement or have significant impact on interpretation of this 
Annual Report.
Significant financial accounting matters
Revenue 
recognition, 
debtor 
recoverability 
and legal risk 
in respect of 
product 
protection 
plans
The Company sells product protection plans 
to customers purchasing electrical appliances, 
as agent for Domestic and General, who 
administer the plans, collect money from the 
customers and pay a commission to the 
Company for each plan sold. Commission 
receivable for sales of product protection plans 
for which the Group acts as an agent are included 
within revenue based on the estimated fair value 
of future commissions receivable over the life 
of the product protection plan. Revenue is 
recognised up front on the basis that the Group 
has fulfilled its obligations to the customer in line 
with accounting standards relating to revenue 
recognition. The fair value calculation takes into 
consideration the anticipated length of the plan 
and the historical rate of customer attrition and 
is discounted to reflect the time value of money 
but also risks around the recoverability of the 
receivable balance attributable to the product 
protection plans. 
The Company accounts for this income on the 
basis that it is agent. The basis upon which the 
Company offers and sells product protection 
plans could change due to (i) a change in law or 
regulation or the interpretation of existing law or 
regulation, or (ii) a change in how the plans are 
managed or controlled or the level of risk that the 
Company assumes in relation thereto. Any such 
change could affect the Company’s accounting of 
such income and/or could subject the Company 
to claims or proceedings in relation to such 
product protection plans.
Whilst this is an area of estimate and judgement, 
the management team has prepared detailed 
policies setting out the key assumptions in the 
model. The Committee has reviewed the 
judgements made in this area by management 
and following appropriate challenge, we consider 
the policy and practice appropriate. 
Significant financial accounting matters
Commercial 
income 
arrangements 
The Group has a number of contracts with its 
suppliers where additional discounts can be 
applied based on purchase levels. The Group 
accrues the additional discounts by reference 
to the expected level of purchases. The 
percentage discount accrued may differ to the 
current run rate of purchases as the calculation 
takes seasonality into account. There is a risk 
therefore that the level of discounts provided 
for at the year‑ end could materially differ from 
the actual number of purchases when compared 
to assumptions made by management.
The management team has prepared detailed 
policies setting out the key assumptions and 
judgements in this area. The Committee has 
reviewed the judgements made in this area by 
management and, after due challenge and 
debate, was content with the assumptions 
made and the judgements applied.
Training
During the year the Audit Committee members have received 
guidance from the external Auditors on their duties as members 
of this Committee together with advice on new developments in 
reporting standards.
Going Concern Assumption and Viability Statement
The Committee reviewed the Going Concern Assumption and Viability 
Statement reported by the Group, as required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014. Further information on the Going Concern 
Assumption can be found on pages 44 and 94. The Committee was 
satisfied that the Viability Statement, noted on page 44 of the Strategic 
Report, presented a reasonable outlook for the Group to March 2020.
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
The Committee has reviewed the financial statements together with 
the narrative contained within the Strategic Report set out on pages 
16 to 51 and believes that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable. In arriving at this 
conclusion the Committee undertook the following: 
 – review of early drafts of the Annual Report and Accounts, 
providing relevant feedback;
 – regular review and discussion of the financial results during the year; 
 – receipt and review of reports from the external and internal Auditors. 
The Committee advised that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, were fair, balanced and understandable at a meeting of the 
Directors on 5 June 2017.

continued Internal Audit 
The Committee receives reports from the Internal Audit department 
and reviews the internal audit process and effectiveness as part of the 
Group’s risk assessment programme and as part of its sign off on 
internal controls. An annual programme of internal audit assignments 
is reviewed by the Committee. The Committee met with the Head of 
Internal Audit without the presence of the Executive Directors on three 
occasions during the year.
External Auditor
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for leading the 
process for selecting the external Auditor. It is required to make 
appropriate recommendations on the external Auditor through the 
Board to the shareholders to consider at the Company’s AGM. 
Following approval by shareholders at the AGM held on 21 July 2016, 
KPMG LLP was appointed as AO’s external Auditor for the financial 
year ending 31 March 2017. The Committee has been satisfied with the 
quality of the audit provided, as well as with the independence of 
KPMG as Auditor. During the year, KPMG charged the Group £0.3m 
(2016: n/a) for audit-related services.
 
Internal controls 
During the year the Committee continued to oversee and review 
AO’s internal financial controls and risk management processes, 
risk appetite statement and principal risks, details of which are set 
out in the Risk section of the Strategic Report on pages 40 to 44. 
Non-audit services
The Company’s external Auditor may also be used to provide 
specialist advice where, as a result of their position as Auditor, they 
either must, or are best placed to, perform the work in question, 
subject always to EU audit rules surrounding prohibited non-audit 
services. The Company’s general policy is not to use the appointed 
external Auditor for any non‑ audit services, however, a formal policy 
is in place in relation to ad‑ hoc occurrences to ensure that there is 
adequate protection of their independence and objectivity and any 
such use requires approval of the Audit Committee. Further, any fees 
for non-audit services must fall within the limits specified by EU 
legislation, and various services are wholly prohibited; including tax, 
legal, valuation and payroll services.
Fees charged by KPMG in respect of non‑ audit services generally 
require the prior approval of the Audit Committee. A breakdown of 
the fees paid to KPMG during the year is set out in note 9 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
KPMG charged the Group £42,750 plus VAT for non-audit related 
services relating to the year under review. £12,750 of these fees related 
to some customer insight analysis performed by KPMG Nunwood, a 
customer experience consultancy and a member of the KPMG group, 
which is distinctively separate from KPMG’s audit arm and £30,000 
related to the half-year review.
It is the Company’s practice that it will seek quotes from several firms, 
which may include the incumbent Auditor, before work on non‑ audit 
projects is awarded. Contracts are awarded to our suppliers based on 
individual merits. 
We receive advice from other firms for specific projects. In particular, 
the Company will regularly seek advice from an independent third 
party on tax matters.
I will be available at the Company’s forthcoming AGM to answer any 
questions on the work of the Audit Committee.

Overview   Strategic Report   Our Governance   Our Results   Shareholders’ Information The Company recognises the importance of communicating with 
its shareholders to ensure that its strategy and performance are 
understood and that it remains accountable to shareholders. The 
Company has established an Investor Relations function, headed 
by the Chief Financial Officer. 
The Investor Relations function deals with queries from individual 
shareholders with support as appropriate from the Executive 
Directors. The Investor Relations team ensures that there is effective 
communications with shareholders on matters such as strategy and, 
together with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
is responsible for ensuring that the Board understands the views of 
major shareholders on such matters.
There is an ongoing programme of dialogue and meetings between 
the Executive Directors and institutional investors, fund managers 
and analysts. This includes formal meetings with investors to discuss 
interim and final results and maintaining an ongoing dialogue with 
the investment community through regular contact with existing and 
potential shareholders, attendance at investment conferences and 
holding investor roadshows as required. At these meetings, a wide 
range of relevant issues including strategy, performance, management 
and governance are discussed within the constraints of information 
which has already been made public. The Board is aware that 
institutional shareholders may be in more regular contact with the 
Company than other shareholders, but care is exercised to ensure 
that any price‑ sensitive information is released to all shareholders, 
institutional and private, at the same time in accordance with legal 
and regulatory requirements. 
All shareholders can access announcements, 
 investor presentations and the Annual Report  
on the Company’s corporate website  
(www.ao.com/corporate).
The Senior Independent Director, Brian McBride, is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which cannot be raised through 
the normal channels or if such concerns have not been resolved. 
Arrangements can be made to meet with him through the 
Company Secretary.
Following his appointment as Chairman, Geoff Cooper met with 
a number of key shareholders to introduce himself and discuss 
governance and strategy and to feedback any key issues such 
shareholders raised to the Board. He also attended a number of 
roadshow meetings and intends to continue to attend investor 
meetings as appropriate, particularly where new major investors 
come on board.
 
The Board obtains feedback from its joint corporate brokers, 
J.P . Morgan Cazenove, Jefferies Hoare Govett and Numis Securities, 
on the views of institutional investors on a non‑ attributed and 
attributed basis. Any concerns of major shareholders would be 
communicated to the Board by the Executive Directors. As a matter 
of routine, the Board receives regular reports on issues relating to 
share price and trading activity, and details of movements in 
institutional investor shareholdings. The Board is also provided 
with current analyst opinions and forecasts.

continued Report of the Remuneration Committee
Our Remuneration Policy was last approved by shareholders at the 2014 
AGM when it received a positive vote in favour of 99.6%. This Directors’ 
Remuneration Report sets out details of the proposed remuneration 
policy for Executive and Non-Executive Directors for the next three 
years, as set out in full on pages 69 to 74, that will be the subject of a 
binding vote at the Company’s forthcoming AGM on 21 July 2017.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report includes the Annual Report on 
Remuneration (on pages 75 to 79) which discloses the amounts paid to 
the Executive and Non-Executive Directors for the financial year ended 
31 March 2017 under the current Remuneration Policy that was put in 
place at IPO and approved by shareholders at our AGM on 17 July 2014.  
It also describes how the proposed new policy will be implemented in 
the year ahead, and will be subject to an advisory vote at the 
forthcoming AGM along with the Remuneration Committee  
Chairman’s Annual Statement. 
Annual Statement by the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for our financial year ended 31 March 2017.
Proposed Remuneration Policy
At our IPO, we undertook a full review of our remuneration structure 
to ensure that, as a public company, we would be operating within a 
framework consistent with best practice, while being mindful of the 
need to pay no more than is necessary to retain and attract high‑ quality talent. It has been three years since the policy was approved 
and accordingly, during the year, we have assessed its effectiveness 
and the levels of remuneration paid thereunder, in particular to the 
Executive Directors, mindful of the changing landscape surrounding 
Executive Pay and increased shareholder and proxy body activism in 
this field. In particular, we have considered whether the policy truly 
supports the delivery of our strategy, sustainable growth and 
shareholder returns whilst properly rewarding and incentivising our 
executives, whether it has been optimally implemented and whether 
alternative pay models would be more suitable.
Following the review, we have concluded that, whilst we believe 
that there are benefits in using an alternative model for AO World 
in view of the difficulties in forecasting robust long-term targets, it is 
not the right time to introduce a markedly different policy this year, 
given volatile market sentiment. The Committee is therefore 
considering an alternative approach to setting three‑ year targets for 
financial measures based around cumulative annual measurement, 
or similar methodologies that help reduce the sensitivity of vesting 
to “forecasting error”, but we are still forming our thinking on this 
and will consult with shareholders prior to any implementation. 
The Committee is aware that the executive remuneration landscape 
is changing, and will continue to monitor developments as they 
arise – the possibility of introducing an alternative pay model will 
be re-visited at a later date should it become appropriate. 
Accordingly, it is proposed to continue with substantially the same 
policy for 2017 but with key proposed changes to introduce some of 
the latest developments in best practice, as follows: 
 – Increase to shareholding guidelines – the minimum level of 
shareholding which the Executive Directors will be expected to 
build up will be increased from 100% to 200% of base salary; and
 – Requirement for any bonus earned above 100% of salary to be 
delivered in shares to be held for two years.
We believe that the above proposed changes strike an appropriate 
balance between properly incentivising our Executives and 
alignment with shareholders, however we are aware that the 
executive remuneration landscape is evolving and will continue 
to assess this over the years ahead, mindful of the desire to align 
Executive and shareholders as much as is reasonably practicable.
This proposed revised policy (“the Policy”) continues to be 
straightforward, transparent and aligned with the strategic and 
financial objectives of the business; it delivers market competitive 
packages to the senior executives at base level and rewards the 
achievement of stretching targets at the other end. The aim is simple 
– to align executive pay with the interests of shareholders and to 
promote the long-term success of the AO Group for all stakeholders. 
Put simply, we pay for performance and we will not reward failure.
Performance and reward for 2016/17
The Annual Report on Remuneration (set out on pages 75 to 79), 
describes how the policy put in place at IPO has been implemented 
in the year under review. It will be the subject of an advisory vote at 
the forthcoming AGM. 
Whilst the Group performed well over the financial year, with total 
Group revenue increasing by 17% to £701.2m and Group Adjusted 
EBITDA losses cut by over 40% to £2.1m, our overall expectations 
of financial performance were not met. However, good progress 
was made against the Company’s strategic objectives, notably with 
the launch of additional categories in both the UK and Europe which 
is a fundamental part of our 4Cs strategy and should deliver both 
revenue and profit growth. The year’s annual bonus scheme 
consisted mainly of financial targets, addressing both top-line 
growth and profit. For Group revenue, the threshold target (at which 
a quarter of the applicable bonus would be payable) was £705m, 
which was narrowly missed. Similarly for Group Adjusted EBITDA 
the threshold target (again at which a quarter of applicable bonus 
would be payable) was losses of £300,000, which was missed and 
the year-end cash balance of £29.4m did not meet the required 
target of £32m. Nonetheless, our Executive Team has continued to 
focus on the execution of our 4Cs strategy and solid performance has 
been achieved (see pages 23 to 27 and page 76). Accordingly, 10%  
of the maximum bonus was payable for launching our computing 
category, which was achieved in October 2016 and which is trading 
well. Details of bonuses paid are disclosed on page 75 and 76.

Overview   Strategic Report   Our Governance   Our Results   Shareholders’ Information
Directors’ Remuneration Report This is the first year we have had a completed PSP award cycle, with 
the performance period of our IPO LTIP Award spanning the three 
financial years ended 31 March 2017. Both Steve and John waived their 
entitlements to participate in this award back in 2014, given their gains 
from the IPO itself, however Mark Higgins, who was not a member of 
the PLC Board at the time, did participate. The stretching targets set at 
IPO, which encompassed an absolute TSR element (requiring the 
share price to increase from £2.85 by 33% for a quarter to vest and by 
100% for full vesting) and an EPS growth element (requiring adjusted 
earnings per share to increase from £1.50 by 66% for a third to vest 
and by 200% for full vesting), were not met (with the share price 
currently tracking below £2 and the Company delivering adjusted loss 
per share) and therefore no awards have vested.
During the course of the year, there was a transition in the roles of our 
Executives with Steve Caunce taking over from John Roberts as CEO, 
and John moving to an Executive Director role, as Founder. Whilst the 
Committee reviewed the CEO package, it was felt there was no need 
to make any changes, it being already appropriately competitive. 
However, the Founder role needed greater consideration and the 
Committee spent time understanding what this new role would 
encompass and how remuneration would be best structured. The 
package agreed for John delivers (i) a reduction in basic pay and 
(ii) a significant reduction in total reward. The change to base salary is 
reflective of a reduction in formal responsibilities, whilst appropriately 
remunerating him for being a fundamental component of our 
Executive team. We also agreed that, going forward, John’s 
remuneration should not contain any variable elements. Given his 
significant shareholding already aligns his interests with longer-term 
performance of the Company and shareholders, the Committee 
believes he is sufficiently incentivised. The overall effect of these 
changes will mean shareholders see an extremely dedicated and 
ambitious Executive Team, playing to their respective strengths, but 
with total on target remuneration costs of c.£427,000 less per annum 
(see charts on page 73 for the Executive remuneration opportunities 
at target which equate to £2.758m in aggregate compared to the prior 
year on target remuneration total of £3.185m).
Approach to Remuneration for 2017/18
Executives
As discussed above, for the year ahead base salaries have been 
reviewed and, following his promotion to CEO, Steve Caunce will 
receive a salary commensurate with that of the previous CEO, an 
increase of 15% on his previous salary as COO. This increase relates 
to the increased responsibility, scope and complexity of his role as 
a result of his promotion to CEO. John Roberts will receive a salary 
reduction of 13% to reflect his reduced responsibilities as his role 
transitions from CEO to Founder Executive Director. The Committee 
has reviewed the base salary level for Mark Higgins and increased it 
to £340,000 (from £300,000). On his promotion to CFO in July 2015, 
Mark’s salary was set at below market‑ competitive levels for the role 
and, as I set out last year, we anticipated increases to the level of basic 
salary over the two to three years following his appointment as Mark 
continues to grow into the role and gains experience and to ensure his 
salary level (and package overall) are positioned at the appropriate 
level relative to executive colleagues. The further increase to Mark’s 
pay this year stems from that and his individual performance 
demonstrated over the last year (notably the completion of the 
revolving credit facility, the recent equity placing and progress made 
within our investor relations function), and is supported by an external 
benchmarking exercise. In particular, the successful facilitation and 
implementation of the Revolving Credit Facility has enhanced the 
working capital available to the Group and this together with the 
strengthened balance sheet (following the equity-raising) have 
greatly improved the financial position of the Company and given the 
directors the ability to drive growth in the right way for shareholders. 
In addition, the successful facilitation and implementation of the 
Revolving Credit facility has enhanced the working capital available 
to the Group and this together with the strengthened balance sheet 
following the equity raising) have greatly improved the financial 
position of the company and given the directors the ability to drive 
growth in the right way for shareholders. We would not expect to 
make increases of this magnitude in the future, rather would expect 
increases in salary in line with the broader workforce. Other elements 
of fixed pay remain unchanged.
In terms of variable pay, the Executives (other than John Roberts) will 
be entitled to participate in the annual bonus scheme where, as last 
year, performance conditions have been set in line with the Company’s 
strategic and financial goals. Financial metrics – including revenue, 
Group Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow – represent the majority of 
targets, with the remainder based on achievement of key strategic 
milestones (see page 77 for further details). The bonus opportunity will 
be unchanged from last year at 150% of salary, and any bonus earned 
above 100% of salary will be delivered in shares to be held for 
two years.
Steve, CEO, will be entitled to participate in our long-term incentive 
plan as last year with an award level unchanged at 150% of salary. 
For Mark, CFO, we believe it is appropriate to make one further award 
at the 300% level of salary. As I explained last year, following Mark’s 
promotion to the Board, the Committee was minded to approve an 
enhanced level of awards for the first two years he was in the role 
(reflecting his initial below-median salary positioning and so ensuring 
that in achieving a market competitive overall package, a higher 
proportion of his overall remuneration is share‑ based and subject to 
long-term performance). We have reconsidered this intention in the 
light of the strategic progress made by the Company and individual 
performance, as noted above, over the last year, taking into account 
feedback from shareholders around our AGM last year. As noted 
above, Mark’s promotion and his role on the Board have proven to 
have a significant impact on the business and the Committee believes 
he is critical to the successful execution of our strategy going forward. 
Accordingly, we believe a further award at the enhanced level is 
appropriate in the circumstances and will give an opportunity for 
Mark’s interests and those of shareholders to be further aligned. This 
is the final year we are intending to make an award at this enhanced 
level, with his awards returning to normal levels in future years.
The PSP performance conditions will continue to comprise a relative 
TSR metric, Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth targets (see page 
77 for further details). The Committee believes these metrics provide 
the appropriate balance vis‑ à‑ vis the long‑ term growth of the 
Company and shareholder return. 
Further details of the variable elements of remuneration for the 
Executive Directors are set out on page 77.
Non-Executives
The base fee for the Non-Executive Directors (excluding the 
Chairman) has been reviewed during the year and has been kept 
unchanged at £50,000. Fees for additional responsibilities (such as 
chairing committees and for holding the role of Senior Independent 
Director) remain unchanged. Geoff Cooper’s fee, as Company 
Chairman, also remains unchanged at £165,000 per annum. This is a 
consolidated all‑ inclusive fee for all Board responsibilities, including 
chairing the Nomination Committee.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
continued This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the 
remuneration policy for the Company (“the Policy”) and has been 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Schedule 8 of 
The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the UKLA’s Listing 
Rules. The Policy has been developed taking into account the 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) as it 
currently applies.
This Policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM 
and, subject to approval, will take formal effect from that date. Whilst 
it is currently intended that the policy will apply for three‑ years 
following approval, as noted in the Remuneration Committee 
Chairman’s introduction, the Policy will be kept under review given 
the volatility and uncertainty in the executive remuneration landscape 
which may result in a new Policy being required before the end of the 
three-year period.
Role of the Remuneration Committee in setting policy
The Committee is responsible for determining, on behalf of the Board, 
the Company’s policy on the remuneration of the Executive Directors, 
the Chairman and other senior executives of the Group.
The Committee’s overarching aims in setting the remuneration policy 
are to attract, retain and motivate high‑ calibre senior management 
and to focus them on the delivery of the Group’s strategic and business 
objectives, to promote a strong and sustainable performance culture, 
to incentivise growth and to align the interests of Executive Directors 
and senior managers with those of shareholders. In promoting these 
objectives the Committee aims to ensure that no more than is 
necessary is paid and has set a policy framework that is structured 
so as to adhere to the principles of good corporate governance and 
appropriate risk management. The Committee also recognises the 
importance of promoting a strong “collegiate culture” and this is 
reflected in the approach to consistency in the application of the 
policy across the whole senior management population.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account
The Committee understands that constructive dialogue with 
shareholders plays a key role in informing the development of a 
successful remuneration policy and will seek to actively engage 
with shareholders in these matters. The Committee will consider 
shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year. 
Any such feedback, plus any additional feedback received from time 
to time, will be considered as part of the Company’s annual review 
of the policy. 
In addition, when it is proposed that any material changes are to be 
made to the remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee
Chairman will inform major shareholders of these in advance and will 
ensure that there is opportunity for discussion, in order that any views
can be properly reflected in the policy formulation process.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Group
The Company does not formally consult with employees on executive 
remuneration. However, when setting the remuneration policy for 
Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the overall 
approach to reward for, and the pay and employment conditions of, 
other employees in the Group. This process ensures that any increase 
to the pay of Executive Directors is set in an appropriate context and 
is appropriate relative to increases proposed for other employees. 
The Committee is also provided with periodic updates on employee 
remuneration practices and trends across the Group.
Consideration of the impact of remuneration on risk
The Committee is committed to keeping the balance between reward 
and risk under review to ensure the remuneration policy is aligned 
appropriately with the risk appetite of the Company. The Committee 
remains satisfied that the proposed Policy is appropriately aligned 
with the risk profile of the Company and that the remuneration 
arrangements do not encourage excessive risk taking.
The Committee’s terms of reference  
are available on the Company’s website  
at www.ao.com/corporate.

Overview   Strategic Report   Our Governance   Our Results   Shareholders’ Information Changes to the proposed Remuneration Policy from the 
current Policy
Following a comprehensive review of remuneration over the last year, 
supported by independent external advice, the Committee 
determined that there should be no significant changes to the Policy, 
including to variable pay opportunities. The changes in the proposed 
Policy are largely to incorporate the latest developments in best 
practice, including the following:
 – Requirement for any bonus earned above 100% of salary to be 
delivered in shares to be held for two years; and 
 – Increased share ownership guidelines of 200% of salary for all 
Executive Directors.
Awards granted prior to the effective date
For the avoidance of doubt, authority is given to the Company to 
honour any commitments entered into with Directors prior to adoption 
of the Policy.
 
Annual bonus plan and PSP policy
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according 
to the rules of each respective plan and taking into account normal 
market practice and the Listing Rules, including flexibility in a number 
of regards. While it does not intend to alter the operation of these plans 
frequently, the Committee retains discretion over the following areas 
(working within the Policy): 
 – Who participates in the plans.
 – When to make awards and payments.
 – How to determine the size of an award, a payment, or when and 
how much of an award should vest.
 – How to deal with a change of control or restructuring of the Group.
 – Whether a Director is a good/bad leaver for incentive plan 
purposes and whether and what proportion of awards vest at the 
time of leaving or at the original vesting date(s).
 – How and whether an award may be adjusted in certain 
circumstances (e.g. for a rights issue, a corporate restructuring or 
for special dividends). 
 – What the weighting, measures and targets should be for the annual 
bonus plan and PSP from year to year.
The Committee also retains the discretion within the policy to adjust 
targets and/or set different measures and alter weightings for the 
annual bonus plan and to adjust targets for the PSP if events happen 
that cause it to determine that the conditions are unable to fulfil their 
original intended purpose.
Choice of performance measures and approach to 
target setting
The performance metrics and targets that are set for the Executive 
Directors via the annual bonus plan and PSP are carefully selected to 
align closely with the Company’s strategic plan.
In terms of annual performance targets the bonus is determined on the 
basis of performance against specific performance indicators and 
strategic objectives set annually. The precise metrics chosen, along 
with the weightings of each, may vary in line with the Company’s 
evolving strategy from year to year. The Committee will review the 
performance measures and targets each year and vary them as 
appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.
In terms of the long‑ term performance targets, PSP awards will be 
set at the time of each grant but will normally include a majority based 
on financial performance in line with our key objectives of delivering 
profitable growth and delivering superior returns to our shareholders. 
Where possible, the Committee will disclose the targets for each of 
the Executive Directors’ awards in advance in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, but targets will generally be disclosed retrospectively 
where they are considered to be commercially sensitive. The 
Committee will review the choice of performance measures and the 
appropriateness of the performance targets prior to each PSP grant 
and will consult with major shareholders in the event of any significant 
proposed change.
Challenging targets are set whereby modest rewards are payable for 
the delivery of threshold levels of performance, rising to maximum 
rewards for the delivery of substantial out‑ performance of our 
financial and operating plans.
Share ownership guidelines
The Committee’s policy is to have formal shareholding guidelines for 
the Executive Directors which create alignment between their interests 
and those of shareholders. 
The required level is set at at least 200% of salary. Where the holding 
is not already attained it is required to be achieved through retention 
of at least 50% of shares or the vesting of awards (on a net of tax basis) 
from share plans. 
Differences in remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors compared to other employees
The Committee has regard to pay structures across the wider Group 
when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. The 
Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader 
workforce when determining the annual salary review for the 
Executive Directors. 
Overall, the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more 
heavily weighted towards performance‑ related pay than for other 
employees. In particular, performance-related long-term incentives 
are generally not provided outside of senior management as they are 
reserved for those considered to have the greatest potential to 
influence overall levels of performance. That said, whilst the use of the 
PSP is confined to the senior managers in the Group, the Company is 
committed to widespread equity ownership, and it has historically 
rolled out, and intends in the future to roll-out, an all-employee SAYE 
scheme on an annual basis, in which Executive Directors are eligible 
to participate on a consistent basis to all other employees.
The level of performance‑ related pay varies within the Group by grade 
of employee, but the Policy is applied consistently across each grade 
of the senior management population.
Reward scenarios (Unaudited)
Under the Policy, a significant proportion of remuneration received 
by Executive Directors is variable and dependent on the performance 
of the Company. The charts opposite illustrate how the total pay 
opportunities for the Executive Directors vary under three different 
performance scenarios: below target, on‑ target and maximum, based 
on implementation of the bonus and PSP for the year ahead.

Assumptions:
 – Below threshold = fixed pay only (i.e. basic salary, benefits 
and pension).
 – Target = fixed pay plus 45% of maximum bonus payout and 
50% vesting under the PSP .
 – Maximum = fixed pay plus 100% of bonus payout and 100% 
PSP vesting.
 – Fixed pay includes the base salaries for each Executive Director 
applying on 1 April 2017 together with pension (at 12.75% of base 
salary), a car allowance of £12,000 for each Executive Director and 
the value of other taxable benefits (such as gym membership and 
medical cover) based on the cost of supplying those benefits in the 
2017 financial year. 
 – Maximum bonus is equivalent to 150% of salary and PSP award 
level is equivalent to 150% of base salary, save for Mark Higgins 
where the PSP award in respect of the current financial year is 
300% of salary.
Service contracts and loss of office payments 
Service contracts normally continue until the Executive Director’s 
agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree. The 
Company’s policy is that Executive Directors’ service contracts must 
provide that no more than 12 months’ notice to terminate employment 
(by either party) must be given.
A Director’s service contract may be terminated without notice and 
without any further payment or compensation, except for sums 
earned up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain 
events such as gross misconduct. The circumstances of the 
termination (taking into account the individual’s performance) and 
an individual’s duty and opportunity to mitigate losses are taken 
into account by the Committee when determining amounts payable 
on/following termination. Our Policy is to reduce compensatory 
payments to former Executive Directors where they receive 
remuneration from other employment during the notice period. 
The Committee will consider the particular circumstances of each 
leaver on a case-by-case basis and retains flexibility as to at what 
point, and the extent to which, payments would be reduced. Details 
will be provided in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration 
should such circumstances arise.
In summary, the contractual provisions are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months from both the Company and the 
Executive Directors
Termination 
payment
Payment in lieu of notice of 115% of base salary, 
which is calculated so as to cover the value of 
contractual benefits and pension, normally 
subject to mitigation and paid monthly*
In addition, any statutory entitlements would 
be paid as necessary
Change of control There will be no enhanced provisions on a 
change of control
*  The Committee may elect to make a lump sum termination payment (up to a 
maximum of 12 months’ base salary and contractual benefits) as part of an 
Executive Director’s termination arrangements where it considers it appropriate 
to do so.
Annual bonus on termination
There is no contractual entitlement to any part of the annual bonus on 
termination. At the discretion of the Committee, in certain circumstances 
(where the leaver is considered by the Committee to be a “good leaver” 
(determined on the same basis as it is determined in connection with 
the PSP – see overleaf)) a pro-rata bonus may become payable at the 
normal payment date for the period of active service only. In all cases 
performance targets would apply, normally measured over the whole 
financial year.
The charts are indicative 
as share price movement 
and dividend accrual have 
been excluded.
AO World Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
73
Overview   Strategic Report   Our Governance   Our Results   Shareholders’ Information PSP on termination
Any share-based entitlements granted under the Company’s share 
plans will be determined on the basis of the relevant plan rules. In 
determining whether an Executive Director should be treated as a 
good leaver under the plan rules the Committee will take into account 
the performance of the individual and the reasons for their departure. 
The default position is that where employment ceases due to injury or 
disability, redundancy or retirement, the transfer of employment in 
connection with the disposal of the whole or part of a Group business 
division or otherwise where the employing company ceases to be a 
Group company, the “leaving” employee will be deemed to be a good 
leaver. In all other circumstances (unless the Committee has exercised 
its discretion to the contrary) the “leaving employee” will be classed as 
a bad leaver (in which case PSP awards lapse). In the event that the 
Committee does class an Executive as a good leaver, the Committee 
will set out its rationale in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
following departure. For good leavers, awards will continue to vest in 
accordance with the original vesting date unless the Committee 
determined that they should vest as soon as is reasonably practicable 
following the date of cessation. Further awards ordinarily vest on a 
time pro‑ rata basis subject to the satisfaction of the relevant 
performance criteria with the balance of the awards lapsing. The 
Committee retains discretion to alter the basis of time pro-rating if it 
deems this appropriate. However, if the time pro-rating is varied from 
the default position, an explanation will be set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration following departure. For the avoidance of doubt, 
performance conditions will always apply to awards for good leavers, 
although the Committee may determine that it is appropriate to assess 
performance over a different period than the default three-year period.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for any new Executive Director would 
be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. In addition, 
with specific regard to the recruitment of new Executive Directors 
(whether by external recruitment or internal promotion), the 
remuneration policy will allow for the following: 
 – Where new joiners or recent promotions have been given a starting 
salary at a discount to the mid‑ market level, a series of increases 
above those granted to the wider workforce (in percentage of salary 
terms) may be awarded over the proceeding few years, subject to 
satisfactory individual performance and development in the role.
 – The Policy permits PSP awards of up to 300% of salary in 
exceptional circumstances such as recruitment. The Committee 
may also offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when 
it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and 
shareholders. Any such additional payments would be based 
solely on remuneration relinquished when leaving the former 
employer and would reflect (as far as possible) the nature and time 
horizons attaching to that remuneration and the impact of any 
performance conditions. Replacement share awards, if used, will 
be granted using the Company’s PSP (up to the plan limit of 300% 
of salary) to the extent possible. Awards may also be granted 
outside of the Company’s existing PSP if necessary and as 
permitted under the Listing Rules. Shareholders will be informed 
of any such payments at the time of appointment. 
 – The maximum variable pay that could be awarded (excluding 
buy-out awards) is 450% of salary (bonus of 150% of salary and 
PSP of 300% of salary).
 – The annual bonus would operate in accordance with the terms 
of the approved policy then in force, albeit with the opportunity 
pro-rated for the period of employment. Depending on the timing 
and responsibilities of the appointment it may be necessary to set 
different performance measures and targets in the first year. 
 – For an internal executive appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the former role would be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the 
appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment would continue. 
 – For external and internal appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses 
as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved fee 
structure policy in force at that time.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ letters 
of appointment
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service 
contracts with the Company, but instead have letters of appointment. 
The letters of appointment are usually renewed every three years. 
Termination of the appointment may be earlier at the discretion of 
either party on three months’ written notice. None of the 
Non-Executive Directors is entitled to any compensation if their 
appointment is terminated. Appointments will be subject to 
re-election at the AGM.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees policy is described below:
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Fees To recruit and retain high calibre 
non‑ executives
 – Fees are determined by the Board, with Non-Executive 
Directors abstaining from any discussion or decision in 
relation to their fees.
 – Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual fee and do 
not participate in any of the Company’s incentive 
arrangements or receive any pension provision.
 – The Chairman is paid a consolidated all-inclusive fee 
for all Board responsibilities.
 – The Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board 
fee, with additional fees payable for chairing the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees and for 
performing the Senior Independent Director role. 
 – The fee levels are reviewed on a periodic basis, with 
reference to the time commitment of the role and market 
levels in companies of comparable size and complexity.
 – Non-Executive Directors shall be entitled to have 
reimbursed all fees (including travel expenses) that 
they reasonably incur in the performance of their 
duties, including tax.
There is no cap on fees. 
Non-Executive Directors are 
eligible for fee increases 
during the three‑ year period 
that the remuneration policy 
operates to ensure they 
continue to appropriately 
recognise the time 
commitment of the role, 
increases to fee levels for 
Non-Executive Directors in 
general and fee levels in 
companies of a similar size 
and complexity.

  Steve Caunce became CEO of the Company in February 2017 and John Roberts transitioned to the role of Founder. Accordingly the basic salary reported for Steve Caunce 
is calculated at 11 months’ pay at the COO/£390,000 rate of pay and one month pay at the CEO/£450,000 rate of pay. Similarly, the basic salary reported for John Roberts 
is based on 11 months’ pay at the CEO/£450,000 rate and one month at the Founder/£390,000 rate.
2
  For John Roberts and Steve Caunce, benefits include gym membership, medical and life assurance and a car allowance of £12,000 paid in cash for both years reported. 
For Mark Higgins, benefits include gym membership, medical and life assurance, car allowance and private fuel since his appointment on 1 August 2015. Benefits for the 
Non-Executive Directors are the values of expenses incurred in connection with attending Board meetings and Company events which the Company has paid for, and in 
the case of Richard Rose, the value of assets given for private use.
3
  Executive Directors are entitled to Company pension contributions of 12.75% of basic salary. However given the new pension rules only £10,000 is paid into a pension 
and the balance is paid in cash (after deducting employer National Insurance contributions at 12.8%).
4
  Bonuses are paid post year end but relate to the year under review (and include an attendance bonus of £200 which is paid Group-wide to employees with the relevant 
attendance). Bonuses were calculated on salaries in force prior to the change in CEO (given this was when the bonus objective was achieved).
5
  John Roberts participated in full in the 2017 AO Sharesave Scheme (launched in January 2017) on the same basis as other employees and was granted 12,080 SAYE 
options. Steve Caunce participated in full in the 2016 AO Sharesave Scheme (launched in January 2016) on the same basis as other employees and was granted 14,400 
SAYE options. Mark Higgins has not participated in any SAYE Schemes. In all cases the SAYE value is calculated by multiplying the number of shares under option by the 
value of discount (in pounds) at the time the scheme was launched. The exercise price for each award was set at 80% of the market value of the share price prior to the 
scheme launch.
6
  The performance conditions relating to the IPO LTIP were not met and accordingly no share options vested in year 2016/2017 (and in any event neither John Roberts nor 
Steve Caunce participated in the IPO LTIP). Mark Higgins participated in the PSP prior to his appointment to the Board. 
7
  Geoff Cooper was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2016 and took the role of Chairman following Richard Rose’s retirement at the AGM, on 21 July 2016. 
His aggregate salary therefore reflects a period at the basic Non-Executive Director rate and the relevant period at the agreed Chairman fee of £165,000 per annum. 
8
  Mark Higgins was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company on 1 August 2015. Reported remuneration for 2015/16 is that earned in that year since the date of 
his appointment. The figures for 2016/17 reflect a full year in the role.

  Richard Rose stepped down as Chairman and Director of the Company on 21 July 2016.

Annual bonus payments
The targets for the annual bonus scheme for the year ended 31 March 
2017 were weighted towards financial metrics, with 35% of maximum 
bonus subject to Group Revenue performance conditions, 35% of 
maximum bonus subject to Group Adjusted EBITDA performance 
conditions, 10% of maximum bonus subject to a cash flow target with 
the remaining 20% subject to the achievement of strategic objectives, 
split equally against the achievement of a successful launch of a new 
category and growing brand awareness to 35% or more. The strategic 
targets of growing, brand awareness and rolling out new categories 
are critical drivers of sustainable growth. Brand awareness is a lead 
indication to future sales and is a direct driver for long-term growth. 
We look to incentivise our Executives to drive this long-term metric 
(which does not necessarily increase short-term revenue or profits). 
Rolling out new categories should increase overall sales and gives us 
the ability to cross‑ sell to customers on our database whilst, from a 
customer point of view, gives a much broader offering.
For Group Revenue, the threshold target (at which a quarter of the 
applicable bonus would be payable) was £705m, which was narrowly 
missed. Similarly for Group Adjusted EBITDA the threshold target 
(again at which a quarter of applicable bonus would be payable) was 
losses of £300,000, which was missed and the year-end cash balance 
(£29.4m) did not meet the required target of £32m. (Targets above the 
threshold are still considered to be commercially sensitive and should 
be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report.)

However, the Company has seen great success with the launch of the 
computing category, which is critical to future success for the reasons 
given above. Therefore, the Committee has decided to award 10% of 
the maximum bonus available for this measure. Please refer to the table 
“Bonus Targets and Performance” for a summary of the performance 
conditions, performance achieved against them and accordingly 
bonus payments made. 
Long-term incentive payments
The IPO LTIP Award was subject to performance over the three-year 
period ended 31 March 2017. Both John and Steve waived their 
entitlement to participate at the time, but Mark Higgins was granted 
options over 526,315 shares whilst in his previous role before joining 
the Board. The stretching targets set at IPO were based two-thirds on 
absolute TSR (requiring the share price to increase from £2.85 by 33% 
for a quarter to vest and by 100% for full vesting) and one-third on EPS 
growth (requiring Adjusted EPS to increase from £1.50 by 66% for a 
third to vest and by 200% for full vesting). These targets were not met 
and therefore no awards have vested.
Details of long-term incentive awards granted 
during 2016/17
In the year, the Committee made awards to Executive Directors under 
the PSP , see table 1 below.
The awards were granted on 21 July 2016 and will, subject to 
performance, vest three years after the grant date. Performance will 
be assessed over the three financial years starting on 1 April 2016 and 
ending on 31 March 2019, and the measures, weightings and targets 
are as set out in table 2, below.
Implementation of remuneration policy for 2017/18
Salary
Following the transition of the roles of John Roberts and Steve Caunce 
in February 2017, the Committee approved an increase to Steve’s base 
salary to be commensurate with what John Roberts was paid as CEO, 
reflecting his promotion and the resulting increased responsibility, scope 
and complexity of his role, and a decrease in John’s salary to £390,000 
to reflect the reduction in responsibility but acknowledging that his 
Founder role is still an important component of our Executive team.

During the annual salary review, these salaries were reviewed but 
no further increases were awarded, however, the Committee has 
approved a salary increase for Mark Higgins for the current financial 
year, based on his broadening duties as CFO and performance over 
the year (notably the completion of the revolving credit facility, the 
recent equity placing and progress made within our investor relations 
function), as further set out in the Chairman’s letter, as further set out 
in the Chairman’s Letter. The Board continues to see Mark as hugely 
important to the execution of our strategy moving forward. He has 
developed significantly over the last 12 months and fully stepped up 
to fulfil the role of CFO. Ongoing, we see him as an important partner 
to Steve (having recently stepped up to the CEO role) due to their 
collaborative working relationship, thorough understanding of each 
other’s skill set and mutual respect. In combination the Committee 
believes Steve and Mark will drive the future success of the business 
creating sustainable value for shareholders.
The Executive Directors will next be eligible for a salary review in early 
2018, with any changes effective from 1 April 2018. For comparison, 
the average salary increase provided to UK employees in the 2016 
financial year was 3%. 
The current salaries as at 1 April 2017 (and those as at 1 April 2016) are 
as follows:
Individual Role
Base salary at 
1 April 2017
Base salary at 
1 April 2016

John Roberts** Founder £390,000 £450,000 -13%
Mark Higgins CFO £340,000 £300,000 13%
*  Steve Caunce’s salary as COO was £390,000 and this was increased on his 
promotion to CEO, to be commensurate with the salary of the previous CEO, 
from 1 March 2017
**  John Roberts became Founder Executive Director on 22 February 2017 and his 
salary was reduced from £450,000 following the transition of his role from CEO, 
effective from 1 March 2017
Pension and other benefits
Executive Directors will continue to receive an employer’s pension 
contribution (or a cash allowance in lieu of pension) at the rate of 
12.75% of base salary. 
Executives will also continue to receive benefits comprising a car 
allowance of £12,000 each, private family medical cover, gym 
membership and death in service life assurance and the Company 
will continue to pay for Mark Higgins’ private fuel. 
Annual bonus
The operation of the bonus plan for 2017/18 will be consistent with the 
framework detailed in the proposed Policy. For Executive Directors 
(excluding John Roberts), the maximum bonus opportunity for 2017/18 
will be capped at 150% of basic salary. Any bonus earned above 100% 
of salary will delivered in shares to be held for two years.
Performance measures have been selected to support the key 
strategic objectives and goals of the Company. 
For 2017/18, three financial metrics will be used to determine the 
bonus payments of the Executive Directors, split as follows:
35% of the maximum bonus will relate to Group Revenue achievements, 
35% to Group Adjusted EBITDA and a further 10% to a cash-flow 
performance target. In addition, 20% of the notional bonus pool will be 
subject to an assessment of performance against key strategic 
milestones; being the delivery of an international transactional mobile 
application and brand awareness growth. As mentioned previously, 
growing brand awareness is critical to delivering sustainable growth 
and is one of our strategic pillars for growth. Improving the mobile 
journey for our customers across the Group is also key to development 
of our offering for customers which we see as a long‑ term driver of 
revenue. The performance metrics are stand-alone and will be 
assessed independently. 
In accordance with Policy, no more than 25% of the maximum bonus 
entitlement will be payable at threshold level; for “on target” 
performance across the Group 45% will be payable, rising to 100% of 
maximum on a straight-line basis for significantly outperforming the 
Group’s plans and consensus forecasts, based on the Committee’s 
assessment of achievement against the targets set.
The Committee considers that the targets themselves, in relation to the 
2017/18 financial year, are commercially sensitive and therefore plans 
to disclose them only on a retrospective basis. Details of the targets, 
performance against those targets, and any payments resulting, will 
be disclosed, as far as possible, in next year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration, save where they remain commercially sensitive.
As part of the remuneration package agreed by the Committee 
following the transition in roles, John Roberts is not entitled to 
participate in the annual bonus scheme.
Long-term incentives
It is intended Steve Caunce will be granted a PSP award with a value 
equivalent to 150% of salary at the award date, in line with the normal 
application of the Policy. However, for Mark Higgins, as discussed in 
last year’s Annual Report, the Committee intends to make a further 
enhanced award of 300% of salary as part of his remuneration 
package for the reasons set out in the Chairman’s statement at the 
start of this report. 
The performance conditions proposed this year comprise a relative 
TSR metric together with Revenue and Group Adjusted EBITDA 
targets. The Committee believes these metrics provide the appropriate 
balance vis a vis long-term growth of the Company and shareholder 
return and that the targets themselves are suitably stretching and in 
line with the Company’s three-year plan. 
The relative TSR measure is calculated based on three‑ year 
performance against the general retailer constituents of the FTSE 250, 
with vesting commencing at median (25% of this part of the award) and 
with full vesting at upper quartile levels. For the Group Adjusted 
EBITDA (“GAE”) and revenue growth measures, we have set targets 
having regard to the Company’s three year plan. Details of these 
targets are set out below. Awards will vest on a straight-line basis 
between the different levels of performance, see table 3 below.

Remuneration Committee membership
The members of the Committee were for the year in question Brian 
McBride (Chairman), Marisa Cassoni, Rudi Lamprecht (until his 
retirement in February 2016) and Geoff Cooper (since Rudi’s 
retirement) on an interim basis as we conduct a search for two new 
Non-Executive Directors. All current members of the Committee are 
deemed to be independent. Accordingly, the Committee continues to 
comply with the independence requirements set out in the Code.
During the year to 31 March 2017 there were four formal meetings of 
the Remuneration Committee, all of which achieved full attendance 
by the relevant committee members.
The responsibilities of the Committee are set out in the Corporate 
Governance section of the Annual Report on page 58. The Executive 
Directors may be invited to attend meetings to assist the Committee in 
its deliberations as appropriate. The Committee may also invite other 
members of the management team to assist as appropriate. No person 
is present during any discussion relating to their own remuneration or 
is involved in deciding their own remuneration.
Advisers to the Committee
New Bridge Street (“NBS”) provides advice in relation to remuneration 
and share plans both for Executive Directors and the wider senior 
management population and was appointed by the Committee. 
NBS are signatories to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of 
Conduct and any advice provided by them is governed by that code. 
NBS’s terms of engagement are available on request from the 
Company Secretary. NBS is a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited (an 
Aon Plc company) which, other than acting as independent consultant 
to the Committee, provided no further services to the Company during 
the year. The Committee is committed to regularly reviewing the 
external advisor relationship and is comfortable that NBS’s advice 
remains objective and independent. For the year under review NBS’s 
total fees charged were £29,301 plus VAT.

financial statements on pages 105 to 107.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on 21 July 
2017 the Directors will seek authority from shareholders to allot shares 
in the capital of the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£763,882.82 (305,553,127 shares (representing approximately 66.6% 
of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital)) of which 152,776,563 
shares (representing approximately 33% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares)) can only be allotted 
pursuant to a rights issue.
Authority to purchase own shares
The Directors will seek authority from shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting for the Company to purchase, 
in the market, up to a maximum of 45,878,848 of its own ordinary 
shares either to be cancelled or retained as treasury shares. The 
Directors will only use this power after careful consideration, taking 
into account the financial resources of the Company, the Company’s 
share price and future funding opportunities. The Directors will also 
take into account the effects on earnings per share and the interests 
of shareholders generally.
Rights attaching to shares
All shares have the same rights (including voting and dividend 
rights and rights on a return of capital) and restrictions as set out in 
the Articles, described below. Except in relation to dividends which 
have been declared and rights on a liquidation of the Company, the 
shareholders have no rights to share in the profits of the Company. 
The Company’s shares are not redeemable. However, following any 
grant of authority from shareholders, the Company may purchase or 
contract to purchase any of the shares on or off‑ market, subject to 
the Companies Act 2006 and the requirements of the Listing Rules.
No shareholder holds shares in the Company which carry special 
rights with regard to control of the Company. There are no shares 
relating to an employee share scheme which have rights with regard to 
control of the Company that are not exercisable directly and solely by 
the employees, other than in the case of the AO Sharesave Scheme, 
the AO Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) and the Employee Reward 
Plan (“ERP”) where share interests of a participant in such scheme 
can be exercised by the personal representatives of a deceased 
participant in accordance with the Scheme rules.
Voting rights
Each ordinary share entitles the holder to vote at general meetings 
of the Company. A resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be 
decided on a show of hands unless a poll is demanded. On a show 
of hands, every member who is present in person or by proxy at a 
general meeting of the Company shall have one vote. On a poll, every 
member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for 
every share of which they are a holder. The Articles provide a deadline 
for submission of proxy forms of not than less than 48 hours before the 
time appointed for the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting. 
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting either in 
person or by proxy, in respect of any share held by him unless all 
amounts presently payable by him in respect of that share have been 
paid. Save as noted, there are no restrictions on voting rights nor any 
agreement that may result in such restrictions. 
Restrictions on transfer of securities
There are no restrictions on the free transferability of the Company’s 
shares save that the Directors may, in their absolute discretion, refuse 
to register the transfer of a share: 
(1)  in certificated form which is not fully paid provided that if the share 
is listed on the Official List of the UK Listing Authority such refusal 
does not prevent dealings in the shares from taking place on an 
open and proper basis; or
(2)  in certificated form (whether fully paid or not) unless the 
instrument of transfer (a) is lodged, duly stamped, at the Office or 
at such other place as the Directors may appoint and (except in the 
case of a transfer by a financial institution where a certificate has 
not been issued in respect of the share) is accompanied by the 
certificate for the share to which it relates and such other evidence 
as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer; (b) is in respect of only one class of 
share and (c) is in favour of not more than four transferees; or
(3)  in uncertificated form to a person who is to hold it thereafter in 
certificated form in any case where the Company is entitled to 
refuse (or is excepted from the requirement) under the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations to register the transfer; or
(4)  where restrictions are imposed by laws and regulations from time 
to time apply (for example insider trading laws).
In relation to awards/options under the PSP , ERP and the AO 
Sharesave Scheme, rights are not transferable (other than to a 
participant’s personal representatives in the event of death).
The Directors are not aware of any arrangements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights. No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
Change of control
Save in respect of a provision of the Company’s share schemes which 
may cause options and awards granted to employees under such 
schemes to vest on takeover, there are no agreements between the 
Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation 
for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, 
purported redundancy or otherwise) because of a takeover bid.
Save in respect of the Company’s share schemes and also the 
revolving credit facility agreement entered into with Lloyds Bank Plc 
and Barclays Bank Plc on 3 June 2016, there are no significant 
agreements to which the Company is a party that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control.

Overview   Strategic Report   Our Governance   Our Results   Shareholders’ Information Disclosure of information to Auditor
Each of the Directors has confirmed that:
(i)  So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware; and
(ii)  The Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken 
as a Director to make him/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware 
of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of 
the Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on 
the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent 
company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 – state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU; and 
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect 
of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 – the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, 
in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Product protection plans accrued 
income (£50.9m accrued income; 
2016: £39.0m accrued income) 
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 97 (accounting policy) and page 103 
(financial disclosures). 
Accrued income is recognised based on 
the fair value of commissions due over the 
expected life of the plans.
Data capture
Completeness and accuracy of data used in 
the model used to calculate the fair value 
because of the complexities and manual 
nature involved in the data transfer into the 
model.
Calculation error
An arithmetic error in the model.
Subjective estimate
Subjective inputs into the product protection 
plan accrued income calculation, such as 
the life of the plans and cancellation rates 
require judgement.
Our procedures included:
Data comparisons: With the assistance 
of our own data modelling specialists we 
performed reconciliations between the third 
party data to the database system which 
stores this data and onwards into the model. 
We agreed a sample of new plans to both bank 
statements and the database system.
Methodology implementation: With the 
assistance of our own data modelling 
specialists we examined whether the model 
appropriately applies the relevant principles.
Historical comparisons: Evaluating the 
historical accuracy of the model with 
reference to past data e.g. cumulative cash 
received.
Benchmarking assumptions: Assessing 
the directors’ assumptions behind the average 
life of the products against externally available 
market data.
Sensitivity analysis: Performing sensitivity 
analysis on judgemental assumptions.
Assessing transparency: Assessing the 
adequacy of the group’s disclosures about of 
the subjectivity of the unobservable measures 
and the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
calculation to changes in key assumptions 
reflected the risks inherent in the valuation 
of accrued income.

(£9.6m; 2016: £8.5m ) 
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 97 (accounting policy) and page 103 
(financial disclosures). 
Data capture 
Completeness and accuracy of data used in 
the calculations including supplier turnover 
and agreed contractual percentages 
because of the complexities and manual 
nature of the data transfer.
Subjective estimate 
Volume rebates recognised are significant 
and the receivable outstanding at the year 
end represents an estimate for amounts 
receivable based on forecasts in relation to 
factors such as future volumes.
Our procedures included: 
Control reperformance: Testing the 
operating effectiveness of controls over 
supplier statements reconciliations to 
evidence that the costs and related rebates 
are being monitored and reconciled on a 
regular basis.
Historical comparisons: Evaluating the 
accuracy of the Group’s product volume 
forecasting against actual out-turns.
Tests of detail: Recalculate a sample of 
rebates based on agreed supplier turnover 
and the contractual percentages. Agree a 
sample of the year end receivable back to post 
year end confirmatory evidence, including 
credit notes and supplier email confirmation 
to assess the accuracy of the estimate.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £2.0 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of total revenues 
of £701.2 million, of which it represents 0.3%.
We consider total revenues to be the most appropriate benchmark as it provides a more stable measure year on year than group loss or profit 
before tax. This reflects the growth stage of the business and management’s focus on growing the brand and expanding into Europe.
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.1 million, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the group’s 9 components, we subjected 5 to full scope audits for group reporting purposes, all of which were performed by the group audit 
team. We performed a review of financial information (including enquiry) on 1 component which was not individually significant enough to 
require an audit for group reporting purposes but a review was performed in order to provide further coverage over relevant account balances. 
For the 3 remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement within these.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated on the right.

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the members of AO World Plc only continued 4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements. 
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and from reading the Strategic Report 
and the Directors’ Report: 
 – we have not identified material misstatements in those reports; and
 – in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 – the directors’ statement of Viability Assessment on pages 44, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, 
the directors’ assessment and expectations of the group’s continuing in operation over the 3 years to 31 March 2020; or
 – the disclosures in note 3of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other 
information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
 – we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or
 – the Report of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2017
1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement 
of compliance with IFRSs
AO World Plc is a public limited company and is incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The Company’s ordinary 
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. The Group’s 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 31 March 2017, and as such comply with Article 4 of 
the EU IAS regulation.
The address of the registered office is given on page 119. The nature of 
the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 20 
and in the Strategic Report on pages 16 to 51.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (£m) 
because that is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Group operates.
2. Adoption of new and revised standards
The accounting policies set out in note 3 have been applied in 
preparing these financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following standards, amendments and 
interpretations which have not had a significant impact on the 
Group’s results:
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure initiative
Amendments to IAS 16 
and IAS 38
Clarification of acceptable methods of 
depreciation and amortisation
Annual improvements 
to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle (Sept 2014)
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following 
standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some 
cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts
IFRS 15 Revenue From Customers With Contracts
IFRS 16 Leases
Amendments to IFRS 
10, IFRS 12, and IAS 28
The application of the investment entities 
exemptions
Amendments to  
IFRS 10 and IAS 28
Sale or contribution of assets between an 
investor and its associate or joint venture
Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for acquisitions of interest in 
joint operations
Amendments to IAS 27 Equity method in separate financial 
statements
Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee 
Contributions
Management are reviewing the impact of the above on the Group’s 
financial statements. The main changes which may have an impact are:
IFRS 9
IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” is effective for periods commencing on 
or after 1 January 2018. The revised standard replaces IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and introduces new 
guidance for classification and measurement, impairment of financial 
instruments and hedge accounting. We intend to quantify the impact of 
the changes (if any) no later than in the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements for the year ended 31 March 2018.
IFRS 15
IFRS 15, “Revenues from Contracts with Customers” is effective for 
periods commencing 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 introduces a five-step 
approach to the timing of revenue recognition based on performance 
obligations in customer contracts. We are assessing the impact of IFRS 
15 and conducting a systematic review to ensure that the impact of the 
new standard is fully understood in advance of the effective date. 
We intend to quantify the impact of the changes (if any) no later than 
in the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 
31 March 2018.
IFRS 16
IFRS 16, “Leases” provides guidance on the classification, recognition 
and measurement of leases to help provide useful information to the 
users of financial statements. The main aim of this standard is to ensure 
material leases will be reflected on the balance sheet. The new standard 
will replace IAS 17 “Leases” and is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2019 unless adopted early. We anticipate the 
changes will have a significant impact on the financial statements and 
are currently carrying out a review to quantify this.
3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate those of the Company 
and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group has 
control. The Group controls an entity where the Group is exposed to, 
or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct 
the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are 
deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
Subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are recorded 
under the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of the acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate fair value of the consideration given. 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 “Business 
Combinations” are recognised at their fair value at the date the Group 
assumes control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Any non-controlling interest acquired on acquisition of a subsidiary 
is recognised at the proportionate share of the acquired net assets. 
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling 
interest equals the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus 
the non-controlling share of changes in equity since acquisition. Total 
comprehensive income is attributed to a non-controlling interest even 
if this results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
in full.
A list of all the subsidiaries of the Group is included in note 20 of the 
Group financial statements. All apply accounting policies which are 
consistent with those of the rest of the Group. AO World Plc

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2017 continued
3. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, 
a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period 
of not less than 12 months from the date of this Report. This takes into 
consideration the forecasted cash flow of the Group, the availability 
of a £30.0m Revolving Credit Facility and funds from the £50.0m 
(gross) share placing (see note 37). Thus they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements. Further detail on this and the viability statement is 
contained in the Directors’ Report on page 80.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the value of goods and services delivered to 
the customers during the year, net of value added tax. Revenue is 
recognised on orders received when the goods and related services 
have been delivered to customers. The exception to this is revenue 
in respect of product protection plans and commercial income which 
is dealt with in the section below. 
Commission receivable
Commission receivable for sales of product protection plans for which 
the Group acts as an agent (on the basis that the plan is a contract 
between the customer and Domestic and General and the Group has 
no ongoing obligations following the sale of such plans) is included 
within revenue based on the estimated fair value of future 
commissions receivable over the life of the product protection plan. 
Revenue is recognised on the basis that the Group has fulfilled its 
obligations to the customer. The fair value calculation takes into 
consideration the length of the plan and the historical rate of customer 
attrition and is discounted (see note 23).
Commercial income
At the year-end the Group is required to estimate supplier income due 
from annual agreements for volume rebates, which span across the 
year-end date. Estimates are required where firm confirmation of 
some amounts due are received after the year-end. Where estimates 
are required these are calculated based on historical data, adjusted for 
expected changes in future purchases from suppliers, and reviewed in 
line with current supplier contracts.
Commercial income can be recognised as volume rebates or as 
strategic marketing investment funding. Volume rebates are 
recognised in the income statement as a reduction in cost of sales in 
line with the recognition of the sale of a product. Strategic marketing 
investment funding is recognised in one of two ways:
 – in advertising costs to offset directly attributable marketing costs 
incurred by the Group on behalf of the suppliers; and
 – the remainder of funding is recognised in revenue.
Finance income and costs
Finance income is recognised in the consolidated income statement in 
the period to which it relates using the effective interest rate method.
Finance income comprises of:
 – Interest receivable which is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement as it accrues using the effective interest method
 – Income arising from the unwinding of the accrued income in 
relation to product protection plans in excess of their previously 
recognised fair value
 – Movement in the valuation of the put and call options
 – Foreign exchange gains arising on financing (principally 
intra-Group loans)
Finance costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement 
in the period in which they occur.
Finance costs comprise of:
 – Foreign exchange losses arising on financing (principally 
intra-Group loans)
 – Movement in the valuation of the put and call options
 – Finance costs incurred on finance leases are recognised in profit 
or loss using the effective interest method
 – Financing costs of raising debt
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at the 
consideration less attributable transaction costs.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows 
that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which 
the asset belongs.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually, 
or more frequently where there is an indication that the goodwill may 
be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to each of the Group’s CGU expected to benefit from 
synergies of the combination. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the 
greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset. 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its 
CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of 
CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the 
other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of 
other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior years are assessed 
at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased 
or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss 
had been recognised.
Goodwill impairment review
Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually. Impairment 
testing on goodwill is carried out in accordance with the methodology 
described in note 16. Such calculations require judgement relating to 
the appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent in a 
particular market as well as short and medium-term business plans. 
The Directors draw upon experience as well as external resources in 
making these judgements.
Intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the total consideration transferred 
for an acquired entity, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of 
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is 
stated at cost. Goodwill is allocated to CGUs and is not amortised but 
is tested annually for impairment. AO World Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Overview   Strategic Report   Our Governance   Our Results   Shareholders’ Information
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement in 
administrative expenses on the basis stated below over the estimated 
useful lives of each asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Asset Class Amortisation method and rate
Domain names 5 years straight-line
Computer software 3 to 5 years straight-line
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed 
at each statement of financial position date. 
Property, plant and equipment
All fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of 
assets (other than freehold land) less their residual values over their 
useful lives on the following bases:
Asset Class Depreciation method and rate
Property alterations 10 years straight-line or over the life of the 
lease to which the assets relate
Fixtures, fittings and 
plant and machinery
15% reducing balance or 3 to 10 years straight 
line
Motor vehicles 2 to 10 years straight-line
Computer equipment 3 to 5 years straight-line
Office equipment 15% reducing balance or 3 to 5 years straight 
line
Leasehold property Depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
life of the lease
Freehold property 25 years straight-line
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method 
are reviewed at the end of each reporting year, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected 
useful lives on the same basis as owned assets.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the 
disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in 
the income statement. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises direct purchase cost net of rebates. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated and 
directly attributable costs of selling and distribution. Net realisable 
value includes, where necessary, provisions for slow-moving and 
damaged inventory. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities comprise trade and other receivables, 
cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, trade and other 
payables and call and put options.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recorded at fair value which is 
estimated to be equivalent to book value, less any impairment. Further 
information is included within the revenue recognition policy and note 
4, critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty. A provision for bad and doubtful debt is made when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all of the 
amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. Bad debts are 
written off when identified. 
For other receivables arising from commission for sales of product 
protection plans, measurement is at fair value. This is based on the 
Group having a contractual right to receive cash (in the form of 
commission following the sale of a plan) and a financial asset is 
recognised in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments 
Presentation. Any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is 
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement 
within revenue. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recorded at fair value which is estimated 
to be equivalent to book value. 
Financial liabilities and equity components
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities 
or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement and in conjunction with the application of IFRSs. Financial 
instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent 
that they meet the following two conditions:
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or 
Group as the case may be) to deliver cash or other financial assets 
or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another 
party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the 
Company (or Group); and 
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own 
equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own 
equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial 
assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are 
classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes 
the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in 
these financial statements for called-up share capital and share 
premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
Call and put option
The fair value of the call and put options (arising on the acquisition of 
TRG) are based upon an independent valuation at the year-end using 
the Monte Carlo model.
The carrying value of the put option is based on an estimate of the 
maximum amount payable over the life of the option based on 
discounted future cash flows.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation.  AO World Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
96
3. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the 
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the statement 
of financial position date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties 
surrounding the obligation. The estimated cash outflow is discounted 
to net present value.
Leases
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance 
leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting 
treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. 
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount 
equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, each determined 
at the inception of the lease and depreciated over their estimated 
useful lives or the lease term if shorter. Finance charges are charged 
to income over the year of the lease in proportion to the capital 
element outstanding. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the fixed term of the lease. 
Benefits received or receivable as an incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also spread straight-line over the lease term. 
 
Sublease rent is credited to the income statement in other 
operating income.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred 
tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it 
is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable 
income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment 
for items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years or that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following 
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of 
goodwill; and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect 
neither accounting nor taxable profit (other than in a business 
combination) to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on 
the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle 
its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Employee benefits
The Group contributes to a defined contribution pension scheme, for 
employees who have enrolled in the scheme. A defined contribution 
scheme is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group 
pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or 
constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for 
contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as 
an expense in the income statement in the years during which services 
are rendered by employees.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2017 continued
Share-based payments
The cost of share-based payment transactions with employees are 
measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the 
date on which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over 
the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant 
employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate 
pricing model (see note 32). In valuing equity-settled transactions, no 
account is taken of any service and performance (vesting) conditions, 
other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of 
the Company (market conditions). Any other conditions which are 
required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to 
an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Like market 
performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into 
account in determining the grant date fair value.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual 
number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount 
ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards 
that do meet the related service and non-market performance 
conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with 
non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based 
payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no 
true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
At each statement of financial position date before vesting, the 
cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate of 
the achievement or otherwise of service and non-market vesting 
conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest or, in the case of cancelled options in the AO Sharesave scheme, 
be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in cumulative 
expense since the previous statement of financial position date is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement with a 
corresponding entry in equity. 
Foreign currency translation
The individual financial statements of each Group company are 
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the 
consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position 
of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is 
the presentational currency of the Group and its consolidated 
financial statements.
The trading results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are 
translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the period. 
The Statement of Financial Position of each overseas subsidiary is 
translated at year-end exchange rates with the exception of equity 
balances which are translated at historic rates. The resulting exchange 
differences are recognised in a separate translation reserve within 
equity and are reported in other comprehensive income.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated into functional currency at the rates of 
exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences on monetary 
items are recognised in the income statement.
Intra-Group loans are translated at the year-end exchange rate with 
the resulting exchange differences recognised within interest. AO World Plc

Non statutory measures 
One of the Group’s key performance indicators is Adjusted EBITDA. 
When reviewing profitability, the Directors use an adjusted measure 
of EBITDA in order to give a meaningful year-on-year comparison 
and it is a performance criteria for the purposes of both the Executive 
management’s annual bonus and recent LTIP awards. Whilst we 
recognise that the measure is an alternative (non-Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”)) performance measure which is 
also not defined within IFRS, this measure is important and should be 
considered alongside the IFRS measures. 
EBITDA is defined by the Group as earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, amortisation and profit/loss on disposal. EBITDA is 
adjusted for one off items that do not reflect the underlying trading 
of the business. Such adjustments are:
 – LTIP awards were made to a number of senior staff under the 
Performance Share Plan at the time of the Company’s IPO in 2014 
and also under the Employee Reward Plan (ERP) in July 2016. The 
Board considers that the magnitude and timing of these awards are 
one-off in nature and so add-back any charge/(credit) in arriving at 
Adjusted EBITDA. The difference in the add-back year on year 
reflects the cumulative adjustment to the LTIP charge based on the 
assessment of certain performance criteria during the period (with 
the credit in 2016’s numbers reflecting the likelihood that the IPO 
award would not vest, whilst the charge this year relates to the ERP 
which, having been granted during the year under review, was not 
in the previous year). AO Sharesave scheme charges and LTIP 
charges relating to the LTIP awards which are not considered to 
be one-off in nature are included in trading numbers.
 – Europe set-up costs are costs incurred in connection with our 
European expansion strategy prior to the “go-live” of that territory, 
namely the launch of AO.de and AO.nl and our continuing research 
into other further countries along with strategic post “go-live” costs.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are 
described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and 
other factors that are considered to be relevant and are reviewed on an 
on-going basis. Actual results could differ from these estimates and any 
subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect on income at the 
time such updated information becomes available.
The most critical accounting policies in determining the financial 
condition and results of the Group are those requiring the greatest 
degree of subjective or complex judgements. These relate to the 
revenue recognition and recoverability of product protection plans 
and commercial income as set out below.
Revenue recognition & recoverability of income from 
product protection plans
Revenue recognised in respect of commissions receivable over the 
lifetime of the plan for the sale of product protection plans is recognised 
at fair value, when the Group obtains the right to consideration as a 
result of performance of its contractual obligations (acting as an agent 
for a third party). Revenue in any one year therefore represents the fair 
value of the commission due on the plans sold, which management 
estimate reliably based upon a number of assumptions including the 
length of the policies, the commission rates payable and the historical 
rate of customer attrition. Reliance on historical data assumes that 
current and future experience will follow past trends. The Directors 
consider that the quantity and quality of data available provides an 
appropriate basis for making these estimates.
Commission receivable depends for certain transactions on customer 
behaviour after the point of sale. Assumptions are therefore required, 
particularly in relation to levels of customer default within the contract 
period, expected levels of customer spend, and customer behaviour 
beyond the initial contract period. Such assumptions are based on 
extensive historical evidence, and provision is made for the risk of 
potential changes in customer behaviour, but they are nonetheless 
inherently uncertain. Changes in estimates recognised as an increase 
or decrease to revenue may be made, where for example more reliable 
information is available, and any such changes are required to be 
recognised in the income statement. The commission receivable 
balance as at 31 March 2017 was £50.9m (2016: £39.0m). The discount 
rate used to unwind the commission receivable is 4.6% (2016: 4.9%).
Commercial income
Commercial income comes from two major sources: volume rebates 
and strategic marketing investment funding. 
Volume rebates are deducted from cost of sales in line with the sale 
of the product to which the rebate is attributable. Calculation of the 
volume rebate for the final month of the financial year includes 
judgements for expected rebate values. Volume rebates receivable at 
31 March 2017 are £9.6m (2016: £8.5m). At 31 May 2017 the balance 
outstanding was £1.1m.
Strategic marketing investment funding is recognised in revenue and 
cost of sales. Where incremental third-party costs are incurred as a 
result of marketing support, revenue is offset against these costs. 
The remainder of the strategic marketing fund is recognised in 
revenue as it represents part of the ordinary activities of the business. 
Calculation of the revenue recognised requires judgements to be 
made which include forecasting expected total marketing funding 
and third-party expected marketing spend. At 31 March 2017 £1.4m 
remains as an outstanding receivable (2016: £0.9m). As at 31 March 
2017 the Directors do not believe that there is a material risk regarding 
the judgements made for the purposes of calculating both volume 
rebates and the strategic marketing fund. At 31 May 2017 the 
outstanding balance was £nil.

6.  Segmental analysis
The Group has two reportable segments, online retailing of domestic appliances to customers in the UK and online retailing of domestic 
appliances to customers in Europe (excluding the UK).
Operating segments are determined by the internal reporting regularly provided to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The 
Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identified as the Executive Directors and has determined that the primary segmental reporting format of the Group is geographical by customer 
location, based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.
Transactions between segments are undertaken on an arms-length basis using appropriate transfer pricing policies.

Profit/(loss) after tax 16.7 (24.1) (7.4) 14.1 (20.2) (6.1)
The Group uses alternative performance measures which are not defined within IFRS, as well as IFRS measures.
One of the Group’s key performance indictors is Adjusted EBITDA and each segment is measured by the Chief Operating Decision Maker on this 
basis. The use of this measure is also evidenced by executive management bonus targets and Long Term Incentive Schemes being measured in 
relation to adjusted EBITDA, amongst other factors. As such, these measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures. 
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected 
infrequency of events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to better understand the financial performance 
of the Group in the period.
The adjustments are:
 – LTIP awards were made to a number of senior staff under the Performance Share Plan at the time of the Company’s IPO in 2014 and also 
under the Employee Reward Plan (ERP) in July 2016. The Board considers that the magnitude and timing of these awards are one-off in 
nature and so add-back any charge/(credit) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA. The difference in the add-back year on year reflects the 
cumulative adjustment to the LTIP charge based on the assessment of certain performance criteria during the period (with the credit in 
2016’s numbers reflecting the likelihood that the IPO award would not vest, whilst the charge this year relates to the ERP which, having been 
granted during the year under review, was not in the previous year). AO Sharesave scheme charges and LTIP charges relating to the LTIP 
awards which are not considered to be one-off in nature are included in trading numbers.
 – Europe set-up costs are costs incurred in connection with our European expansion strategy prior to the “go-live” of that territory, namely the 
launch of AO.de and AO.nl and our continuing research into other further countries along with strategic post “go-live” costs.

Corporation tax is calculated at 20% (2016: 20%) of the taxable profit

Provisions to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% 
from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020 are contained within the 
Finance Act 2015 and the Finance Act 2016 respectively. Under IFRS, 
companies are required to measure deferred tax at the rate at which it 
is most likely to reverse based upon rates substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. As both Finance Acts received royal assent prior to 
the end of the year, deferred tax has been measured at either 19% or 
17% depending on the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability 
is expected to be reversed.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing 
in the respective jurisdictions.

Impairment of goodwill
At 31 March 2017, goodwill acquired through UK business 
combinations was allocated to the UK cash-generating unit (“CGU”) 
which is also the UK operating segment. 
This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill 
is monitored for internal management purposes.
The Group performed its annual impairment test as at 31 March 2017. 
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on 
the value in use calculations. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts 
derived from the most recent approved financial budget and financial 
plan, for three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following 
years, up until year five, based on an estimated growth rate of 1%. 
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the 
market. The final year cash-flow is used to calculate a terminal value.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to this CGU. In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use, 
we adjust the CGU’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 10% to 
reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the cash flows. The 
weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 
10.8% (2016: 11.1%). 
The key assumptions, which take account of historic trends, upon 
which management have based their cash flow projections are sales 
growth rates, selling prices, product margin and discount rates.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the 
above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to 
exceed its recoverable amount.
17. Acquisition of subsidiary – prior year
On 6 November 2015, the Group acquired 60% of the issued share 
capital of The Recycling Group Limited (TRG). AO World Plc 
subscribed for 300 shares at nominal value paying £3 in aggregate at 
the date of acquisition with the remaining 200 shares being retained 
by the founders. 
 
AO World Plc also entered into a put and call option agreement in 
relation to the remaining shares held by the founders, which provides 
for their shares to be bought/sold in five separate tranches under five 
put and call options to be exercised following the approval of accounts 
for the financial years ending 31 March 2017 to 31 March 2021 inclusive. 
As at 31 March 2017 the option agreement was re-drafted to apply to 
the 5 year period ended 31 March 2022. This is subject to certain 
performance conditions.
TRG specialises in the collection and recycling of Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and other recycling initiatives. It holds 
fully licensed waste permits which allow transportation and 
processing of non-hazardous and hazardous WEEE. This includes 
waste commercial refrigeration equipment and household fridges. 
Prior to the acquisition, AO held a commercial relationship with TRG 
whereby TRG collected and treated all AO’s UK WEEE with AO being 
TRG’s single largest supplier of WEEE. This relationship had been in 
place since 2009. 
Management considered whether any previously unrecognised 
intangible fixed assets should be recognised on acquisition but, 
following review, concluded that none arose. 
The table below details the amounts recognised in respect of the 
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on acquisition. 
Other than property, plant and equipment which included an 
adjustment to reflect the alignment of depreciation to the AO Group 
accounting policies (£0.1m), book value equates to fair value.

The goodwill recognised as a result of the business combination represents 
the anticipated synergies which AO have gained from the combination. 
A non-controlling interest in the net liabilities was recognised at the 
acquisition date, based on the proportionate share of the net liabilities 
acquired (being 40%). Acquisition related costs of £0.02m were 
recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
At the acquisition date, the Group recognised a financial asset of £0.8m 
in relation to the fair value of the call option and a gross liability of 
£2.8m in relation to the put option in place to acquire the remaining 
40% of TRG issued share capital.
In accordance with IAS 32, the fair value of the put option is also 
recognised within the parent company balance sheet as described in 
note 35. An external independent valuation was used to determine the 
fair value of the put and the call option. The difference between the gross 
and fair valuation of the put option, is recognised in other reserves on 
acquisition (£2.1m). Subsequent changes to the carrying value of the 
asset and liability are recognised within the income statement.
TRG contributed revenue of £2.4m and a loss of £0.1m to the Group 
between the date of acquisition and 31 March 2016. If the acquisition 
had been completed on the first day of the 2016 financial year, Group 
revenues for the year ended 31 March 2016 would have been £601.6m 
and Group losses would have been £7.6m.

Other accrued income (see note below) 0.1 0.4
Balance carried forward 51.4 39.4
Accrued income principally represents the expected future commission 
payments in respect of product protection plans. As set out in note 4, 
the Group recognises revenue in relation to these plans when it obtains 
the right to consideration as a result of performance of its contractual 
obligations (acting as an agent for a 3rd party). Revenue in any one year 
therefore represents the fair value of the commission due on the plans 
sold. To calculate the fair value of the revenue and hence the accrued 
income the Group uses historical empirical data accumulated over 10 
years based on over 1.2m plans sold to date of which 0.6m plans are active.
The fair value calculation takes into consideration the following level 3 
unobservable data:
 – length of individual plans with a range of c.7-16 years included in 
the calculation;
 – historical rate of customer attrition ; and 
 – contractually agreed margins based on actual historical margins earned.
Expected future commission payments in respect of product 
protection plans are discounted at 4.6% (2016: 4.9%). 
Other accrued income relates to Expert Logistics revenue from third 
parties not invoiced at 31 March 2017 of £0.5m (2016: £0.4m). 
There has been no change to the fair valuation methodology adopted 
in the year ended 31 March 2017.
Sensitivity analysis has been conducted to assess the effect on the 
accrued income balance:

(excluding share-based payment reserve and translation reserve) are 
set out below. 
The merger reserve arose on the purchase of DRL Limited (now AO 
Retail Limited) in the year ended 31 March 2008.
The capital redemption reserve arose as a result of the redemption of 
ordinary and preference shares in the years ended 31 March 2012 and 
2014 respectively. 
The other reserve arose on the acquisition of TRG (see note 17) and 
relates to the difference between the gross and fair valuation of the 
put option.  AO World Plc

There were no awards exercisable as at 31 March 2017. 
Employee Reward Plan (ERP)
During the year the Group made conditional awards of nil-cost options 
to select members of senior management and Directors. 
The Awards are based on one performance condition which requires 
that the Company’s Sales growth over the performance period be 
greater than 10% per annum compound. 
The fair value was determined to be the share price at grant date of £1.48.  AO World Plc

AO Sharesave scheme (referred to as SAYE scheme)
The Group has a savings-related share option plan under which 
employees save on a monthly basis, over a three-year period, towards 
the purchase of shares at a fixed price determined when the option is 
granted. The price is set at a discount being 20% of the average share 
price during a specified averaging period prior to the grant date. The 
option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the SAYE 
contract, otherwise it lapses.
As per IFRS 2, these grants have been valued using a Binomial (2014 
and 2015) and a Black-Scholes (2016 and 2017) model. The difference 
in valuations for the 2014 and 2015 schemes between the Binomial and 
Black-Scholes model is not significant.

by the Group and amounted to £2.8m (2016: £2.1m).
Contributions totalling £0.3m (2016: £0.2m) were payable at the end 
of the year and are included in accruals.
35. Financial instruments
a) Fair values of financial instruments 
Receivables and payables
For receivables and payables classified as financial assets and 
liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, fair value is estimated to be 
equivalent to book value. These values are shown in notes 23 and 25, 
respectively. The categories of financial assets and liabilities and their 
related accounting policy are set out in note 3. 
Cash and cash equivalents
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying 
amount.
Call and put option
The fair value of the call and put options (arising on the acquisition 
of TRG in 2016) are based upon an independent valuation at the 
year-end using the Monte Carlo model.
The carrying value of the put option is based on an estimate of the 
maximum amount payable over the life of the option based on 
discounted future cash flows.
Borrowings
The fair value of interest-bearing borrowings is calculated based 
on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, 
discounted at the market rate of interest at the date of inception. AO World Plc

Fair value hierarchy
Financial instruments are measured at fair value and are split into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine 
fair value. The hierarchies are:
 – Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 – Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
 – Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

b) Credit risk
Financial risk management
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, 
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers, with a maximum exposure equal to the book value of these assets.
The Group’s receivable balance primarily comprises accrued income representing the expected future commission payments in relation to the 
product protection plans sold by the Group on behalf of one customer. The Directors have assessed and considered the credit risk in respect of 
this amount and do not consider it to be of significance. The Group’s trade receivable balances comprise a number of individually small amounts 
from unrelated customers, operating within the same industry but over a number of geographical areas. Concentration of risk is therefore 
limited. Sales to retail customers are made predominantly in cash or via major credit cards. It is Group policy that all customers who wish to 
trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. New credit customers are assessed using an external rating report which is 
used to establish a credit limit. Such limits are reviewed periodically on both a proactive and reactive basis, for example, when a customer 
wishes to place an order in excess of their existing credit limit. Receivable balances are monitored regularly with the result that the Group’s 
exposure to bad debts is not significant. Management therefore believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the 
normal provision for doubtful receivables.

c) Liquidity risk
Financial risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. 
It is Group policy to maintain a balance of funds, borrowings, committed bank and other facilities sufficient to meet anticipated short-term and 
long-term financial requirements. In applying this policy the Group continuously monitors forecast and actual cash flows against the maturity 
profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Uncommitted facilities are used if available on advantageous terms. It is Group treasury policy to ensure 
that a specific level of committed facilities is always available based on forecast working capital requirements. Cash forecasts identifying the 
Group’s liquidity requirements are produced and are stress tested for different scenarios including, but not limited to, reasonably possible 
decreases in profit margins and increases in interest rates on the Group’s borrowing facilities and the weakening of sterling against other 
functional currencies within the Group.

d) Market risk
Financial risk management 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments (and hence no sensitivity analysis is performed). 
Foreign currency risk
Refer to note 35f.
Interest rate risk
The principal interest rate risks of the Group arise in respect of borrowings. As the interest expense on variable rate financial instruments 
is immaterial, the Group does not actively manage the exposure to this risk.
At the statement of financial position date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Fixed and variable rate instruments
Finance lease liabilities 13.1 5.5
Bank loans 4.3 2.5
17.4 8.0
e) Capital management
It is the Group’s policy to maintain an appropriate equity capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
the future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of the net cash (borrowings disclosed in note 26) and equity of the Group. The Group is not subject 
to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The Board has delegated responsibility for routine capital expenditure to the management of the business. All significant expenditure is 
approved by the Board.

f) Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies, 
consequently exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
 
The Group’s presentational currency is sterling; as a result the 
Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk due to 
movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of 
non-sterling assets and liabilities.
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated 
monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are 
as follows:
Liabilities Assets
2017
£m
2016
£m
2017
£m
2016
£m
Euros 68.6 29.0 11.5 10.2
The balances shown above include intercompany loan balances held 
between Group companies which create a foreign currency exposure 
to the income statement. These differences are recognised in finance 
income or costs.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase 
and decrease in sterling against the relevant foreign currencies. 
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the Director’s assessment of a 
reasonably possible change. The sensitivity analysis includes only 
outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and 
adjusts their translation at the year-end for a 10% change in foreign 
currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well 
as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination 
of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the 
borrower. A positive number below represents an increase in profit 
before tax.
Euro currency impact
2017
£m
2016
£m
Sterling strengthens by 10% (5.2) (1.7)
Sterling weakens by 10% 6.3 2.1
The Group’s sensitivity to foreign currency has increased during the 
current year due to increasing trade in Europe. The impact above is 
mainly as a result of intercompany loans held in a foreign currency. 
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative 
of the inherent foreign exchange risk as the year-end exposure does 
not reflect the exposure during the year.

 – Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
