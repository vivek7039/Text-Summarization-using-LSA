Adding to our marketed products
As part of a new commercial collaboration with AstraZeneca 
we have added chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
treatment Tudorza
®
 to our portfolio in the United States, alongside 
our NIOX
®
 asthma management products. We also added 
late-stage COPD product Duaklir
®
, and with its US clinical 
development now complete we look forward to its filing  
in the near future.
NIOX
®
 and asthma
Our market-leading NIOX
®
 system 
is used by physicians around the 
world to help improve asthma 
diagnosis and management. Our 
current generation NIOX VERO
®
 
device is available across major 
markets, including the US, Europe, 
Japan and China. 
Tudorza
®
, Duaklir
®
 and COPD
As part of a transformational 
partnership with AstraZeneca 
we commercialise the COPD 
treatment Tudorza
®
 in the United 
States. We also have the US 
commercial rights to COPD 
combination therapy Duaklir

opportunity, with inhaled therapies accounting 
for estimated revenues of approximately $20 billion 
in 2017. 
2.4%
At the end of the year, Tudorza

prescriptions accounted for approximately 
2.4% of this market. Just a modest 
increase in market penetration would 
represent a major increase in revenues 
for Circassia. 
$2.6bn
US sales of respiratory treatments containing 
long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) 
reached an estimated $2.6 billion in 2017 .

CIR_AR17_intro_v17.indd   9 25/04/2018   17:15 Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report that Circassia made good progress  
in 2017, achieving significant growth following the major 
changes to its business the prior year. With its investment 
in the allergy field halted, Circassia has focused resolutely 
on building its respiratory franchise, and consequently has 
transitioned into a very different business in a relatively short 
period. Circassia is now highly commercially focused, with  
a broad sales infrastructure, which it plans to expand further 
through a refocused investment strategy, and a portfolio  
of marketed products. 
Building strategic momentum
In 2016, the Board reviewed and reconfirmed Circassia’s strategy of 
building a self-sustaining specialty pharmaceutical company focused 
on respiratory disease. At the end of 2016, the Company significantly 
expanded its US commercial platform, both to increase revenues  
from its in-house NIOX
®
 products and to attract in-licensing, partnering 
and acquisition opportunities. This growth strategy proved successful, 
and in 2017 Circassia established a flagship US partnership with 
AstraZeneca for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
products Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
. With the collaboration making good 
progress, Circassia plans to build on this momentum by deploying  
a refocused investment strategy pursuing a similar approach in China. 
By leveraging its existing presence in the country to establish an initial 
sales force, Circassia plans to boost its NIOX
®
 revenues and provide  
a commercialisation option for third-party products in this major market. 
Refocused investment strategy
Under its refocused strategy, Circassia intends to reallocate  
its resources and complete its transformation into a commercial 
business. The Company plans to fund commercial investment  
through a combination of growing revenues, corporate cost 
containment and reductions in research and development (R&D) 
expenditure by seeking to out-license / partner its respiratory pipeline 
of directly substitutable generic products and novel formulations of 
currently approved drugs. These development candidates are based 
on approved molecules, thereby reducing their risk profile, and the 
Company plans to initiate discussions with a number of potential 
partners. This strategy will allow Circassia to retain a stake in the 
products’ future potential success whilst utilising third-party financing 
to progress the programmes through development. The Company 
will continue to invest in its R&D, medical affairs, pharmacovigilance, 
quality and regulatory activities supporting its US COPD products  
and global NIOX
®
 franchise.  
Circassia has focused resolutely on building  
its respiratory franchise, and consequently  
has transitioned into a very different business  
in a relatively short period.

CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   10 25/04/2018   19:19 Dr Francesco Granata
Chairman
During the past year Circassia has made significant strategic  
progress, and with its refocused investment strategy the Company 
plans to complete its transition into a commercial business in the 
coming months. As a result, in a period of just two years Circassia  
will have transformed from an R&D-focused organisation into  
a growing commercial business with increasing revenues  
and global commercial infrastructure. 
Significant operational progress
Throughout 2017 , the Company’s operational execution has 
underpinned this strategic progress. Following the establishment  
of its collaboration with AstraZeneca, Circassia rapidly doubled the 
size of its US field force, recruiting, training and launching the enlarged 
team in under two months. This new sales team has performed well, 
and at the end of the year Tudorza
®
 prescriptions were significantly 
ahead of the declining trend established prior to Circassia’s full 
promotion and are set for future growth. In parallel, Circassia’s global 
commercial team continued to grow NIOX
®
 revenues, while the 
R&D team filed for additional NIOX
®
 approvals. The Company also 
advanced its broader pipeline, in-licensing novel nebuliser technology 
from Philips and preparing several programmes for clinical studies, 
positioning the products for potential out-licensing / partnering under 
Circassia’s refocused investment strategy. 
Evolving team
The rapid changes to Circassia’s business are reflected in the make-
up of its team. During 2017 , the commercial group grew substantially, 
accounting for over 75% of the Company’s headcount at the end of 
the year, while the R&D team was reduced by approximately 40%. 
This changing profile also extends to the Board. Circassia recently 
welcomed new Non-Executive Directors Jo Le Couilliard, Sharon 
Curran and Dr Heribert Staudinger, who bring significant commercial, 
specialty pharmaceutical and respiratory development experience to 
the Company. At the same time, the Board thanks Dr Jean-Jacques 
Garaud and Marvin S Samson for their invaluable advice and strategic 
counsel, and wishes them well on their retirement at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. 
Positioned for growth
With a period of extensive change nearing completion, Circassia  
is emerging as a strong, commercially-focused specialty pharmaceutical 
business. The Company’s revenues doubled in 2017 and are positioned 
for further growth. During the coming year, Circassia plans to drive  
sales in its NIOX
®
 franchise, building on positive new recommendations 
issued by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE). The Company will also benefit from a full year’s revenues from 
its Tudorza
®
 collaboration. In the coming year, Circassia anticipates 
exercising its option to acquire the full US commercial rights to  
Tudorza
®
 from AstraZeneca and looks forward to its partner filing  
for Duaklir
®
 approval. 
During 2018, Circassia intends to leverage the ongoing momentum  
in its business, continuing its transition towards self-sufficiency. It plans  
to extend its commercial platform in China and seek additional third-party 
products to commercialise through its specialty infrastructure. Having 
undergone a period of difficult decisions and great change, Circassia’s 
ambition to build a world-class global specialty pharmaceutical company, 
creating significant shareholder value, remains stronger than ever.

CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   13 25/04/2018   19:19 Chief Executive’s review
2017 was a period of major transformation for Circassia,  
with the Company making good progress to becoming  
a commercially-focused specialty respiratory business.  
During the year our market-leading NIOX
®
 asthma 
management products continued their strong growth,  
and in November we welcomed new NICE recommendations 
that are highly supportive for our products. We also 
established a major US collaboration with AstraZeneca 
for COPD products Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
, and markedly 
expanded our specialty sales infrastructure in the United 
States. The partnership is making good progress, and with 
Tudorza
®
 US prescriptions well ahead of the trend prior to  
our involvement, we aim to increase uptake in the coming year. 
We also received compelling clinical data from large trials of 
both COPD products, and we look forward to filings seeking 
Duaklir
®
 approval and an extension to Tudorza
®
’s label.
With our revenues doubling in 2017 and our cost containment 
measures delivering tangible savings, we are driving our 
business towards self-sustainability. We intend to maintain 
this progress during 2018. We have refocused our investment 
strategy to support the ongoing expansion of our commercial 
platform, particularly in China, whilst reducing our R&D  
and corporate costs. During 2018, we will benefit from  
a full year’s contribution from our enlarged US sales team  
and our collaboration with AstraZeneca, ‘locking in’ significant 
growth potential. With a strong commercial infrastructure, 
compelling portfolio and increasingly attractive platform  
for third-party products we look forward to the coming  
year with great optimism.
Period of transformation
During the past year Circassia successfully underwent a number 
of major changes, as part of the Company’s transition into a 
commercially-focused specialty pharmaceutical business. Following 
disappointing allergy clinical results in 2016, we took the difficult 
decision to switch investment to our respiratory assets and focus on 
expanding our business. This strategy has produced positive results, 
and with our portfolio of marketed products and commercial platform 
now significantly broader, our 2017 revenues were 100% ahead  
of the previous year. 
Commercial growth
In the last 12 months we have expanded our commercial presence 
dramatically. In the United States we established a transformational 
commercial collaboration with AstraZeneca, and subsequently 
doubled the size of our field force to promote the COPD treatment 
Tudorza
®
 alongside our NIOX
®
 asthma management products. 
We also increased our commercial support capabilities, and the 
team, which includes marketing, market access, training, analytics 
and commercial operations, is now more than 50 strong. With our 
US commercial platform acting as an important factor in attracting 
AstraZeneca as a strategic partner, we plan to mirror this strategy 
in China. By building an initial sales force alongside our existing 
distributor base we plan to rapidly grow our NIOX

CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   14 25/04/2018   19:19 Broadening the portfolio
As well as adding Tudorza
®
 to our portfolio, our AstraZeneca 
collaboration brought the US commercial rights to late-stage  
COPD therapy Duaklir
®
. At the end of 2017 , the product successfully 
completed its US clinical development programme. As a result,  
we look forward to its filing in the first half of 2018, potentially  
further broadening our portfolio of marketed respiratory treatments. 
During 2017 we also took steps to advance our in-house pipeline, 
licensing smart nebuliser technology to incorporate in our LAMA / 
LABA novel formulation development programme. We now plan  
to out-license / partner this and our other pipeline products based  
on currently approved drugs, to leverage third-party funding for  
their development. This refocused investment strategy will enable  
us to rapidly complete our transition into a fully commercially-focused 
business, whilst retaining a financial stake in the potential future 
success of our pipeline products. 
‘Locking in’ future growth
The significant investments we made in 2017 , expanding our 
commercial infrastructure and establishing our AstraZeneca 
partnership, are designed to ‘lock in’ growth in the coming years. 
During 2018 we will benefit from a full year’s contribution from our 
Tudorza
®
 collaboration, as well as broader promotion of our NIOX
®
 
products in the United States. We also anticipate having the first 
opportunity to acquire the full US commercial rights to Tudorza
®
 
during the year. In 2019, we anticipate a full year of Tudorza
®
 revenues, 
increased NIOX
®
 sales in China, and initial sales of Duaklir
®
 following 
US approval. Alongside this growth, we plan to continue our business 
development activities, seeking to further expand our portfolio through 
in-licensing, acquisition or partnering. 
Positive outlook
Having transformed our business during the past year, we look 
forward to the future with optimism. We anticipate ongoing significant 
revenue growth from our commercial portfolio, we plan to continue 
expanding our commercial platform and we expect to fund any 
payment to AstraZeneca for the full US commercial rights to Tudorza
®
 
through third-party financing or a vendor loan. With our cost 
containment measures delivering savings and our investment strategy 
focused on our commercial business we are building a strong and 
highly differentiated company. With continuing robust sales growth,  
a portfolio of exciting products and expanding commercial presence, 
we are highly positive about the coming year.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 18
Strategic objectives
Marketing specialty products direct to customers  
in key markets 
We market our NIOX
®
 asthma management products directly  
in the key United States market, as well as promoting COPD treatment 
Tudorza
®
 under our commercial collaboration with AstraZeneca.  
We also sell NIOX
®
 directly to customers in the United Kingdom  
and Germany, and have a commercial team based in Beijing 
managing our local distributors in the Chinese marketplace.  
Elsewhere we have a network of international partners that sell  
our NIOX
®
 products in more than 35 additional countries. 
Building a broad and balanced portfolio
We have a number of respiratory products in our portfolio.  
Our COPD treatment Duaklir
®
 is awaiting filing for approval  
in the United States and we are developing an evolutionary update  
to enhance our currently marketed NIOX VERO
®
 product. In addition, 
we are increasingly well positioned to attract third-party products  
to our portfolio through in-licensing, acquisition or partnering, 
exploiting our expanding commercial capabilities. 
Delivering pipeline products
We aim to advance our pipeline of asthma and COPD treatments, 
while also maintaining our focus on cost control. In the first half  
of 2018 we look forward to the US filing of our lead COPD product 
candidate Duaklir
®
. We also aim to advance our products targeting 
direct substitution of leading respiratory medicines, as well as our 
specialty COPD products based on novel formulations of currently 
approved drugs, through out-licensing / partnering. 
Achieving our strategic objectives involves risks and 
uncertainties, which are detailed in the ‘Risks and risk 
management’ section.
Circassia has three strategic objectives as part of its 
overarching ambition to become a leader in its field.  
The Company aims to build significant shareholder value by:  
i) promoting its specialty products direct in key markets;  
ii)  developing a broad portfolio of treatments; and  
iii)  delivering its pipeline. By delivering against each  
of these three objectives, Circassia intends to build  
a highly attractive business. 
Circassia’s goal is to build a self-sustaining, 
world-class specialty pharmaceutical business.

Deliver the pipeline
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 19
Delivering the pipeline
Alongside our 2017 commercial progress we also advanced  
our pipeline. We received FDA clearance for our NIOX VERO
®
  
six second test mode and filed the product for approval in  
a number of additional territories. We completed EU certification  
for our NIOX VERO
®
 primary ciliary dyskinesia screening application, 
which we launched at the European Respiratory Society meeting  
and subsequently received clearance for its use in Australia and  
South Korea. We also continued to progress our other respiratory 
pipeline programmes, in-licensing smart nebuliser technology from 
Philips for use in our LABA / LAMA novel formulation product, which 
targets specialist COPD treatment. We plan to out-license / partner 
these programmes as part of our refocused investment strategy,  
to leverage third-party financing for their development. 
Progress in 2017
During the past year we continued to make good progress  
towards each of our strategic objectives. We dramatically increased 
our commercialisation capabilities, particularly in the United States, 
and we established a collaboration with AstraZeneca expanding  
our portfolio with COPD products Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
.  
We also continued to advance our pipeline, in-licensing smart 
nebuliser technology from Philips to incorporate into one  
of our development programmes. 
Marketing products directly
In the past year we substantially increased our commercial presence 
in the key US market, doubling the size of our field force and boosting 
our support capabilities. Our enlarged US sales team now promotes 
COPD product Tudorza
®
 as part of our commercial collaboration with 
AstraZeneca, alongside our NIOX
®
 products. In the UK, our direct 
field force performed well during its first full year and as a result UK 
revenues were 134% ahead of 2016. Revenues in Germany declined 
somewhat due to local restructuring, which is now delivering results. 
In the coming year we intend to build on our momentum, launching 
a sales force in China to extend our NIOX
®
 sales. This commercial 
expansion will also build a platform to attract third-party products  
in this important market. 
Building the portfolio
During 2017 we made good progress broadening our portfolio 
of marketed and late-stage products. In April, we established a 
transformational partnership with AstraZeneca for COPD products 
Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
. Under the terms of the agreement,  
we promote Tudorza
®
 direct to physicians while AstraZeneca  
is responsible for manufacturing, supply, pharmacovigilance and 
regulatory activities. The partnership is progressing well. During the 
year Tudorza
®
 achieved compelling positive results in a large-scale 
post marketing study and the product’s prescription levels are  
well ahead of the trend established prior to Circassia’s involvement.  
In addition, Duaklir
®
 completed its US clinical development 
programme, achieving positive phase III results, and awaits  
filing in Q2 2018. 
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   19 25/04/2018   19:19 Operating review
NIOX
®
 asthma management products
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is an important biomarker 
of underlying Th2 airway inflammation, and its measurement is 
increasingly recognised as a valuable component of asthma diagnosis 
and management. NIOX
®
 is the leading point-of-care FeNO testing 
system available across major markets and the current VERO
®
 
generation is sold in a large number of countries, including  
in the US, Europe, Japan and China. 
Strong sales performance
NIOX
®
 revenues continued to grow strongly during 2017 , increasing 
18% to £27 .3 million (12% at CER). Sales for clinical use (ie excluding 
sales to pharmaceutical companies for use in clinical trials) increased 
at a faster rate, growing 26% worldwide (20% at CER), 34% in the 
United States (27% at CER) and 44% in China (36% at CER). In the 
UK, revenues more than doubled compared with 2016, increasing 
134% during the first full year since the Company established its direct 
sales capability. Revenues in Germany declined by 5% (11% at CER) 
due to local restructuring to focus on market access and revised 
pricing to encourage greater test usage, which is now delivering 
results. Research sales to pharmaceutical companies also offset the 
growth in clinical sales to some extent, with these less controllable 
revenues decreasing 8% (13% at CER) in 2017 compared with the 
prior year. 
Expanding access
In 2017 , Circassia continued to expand market access for its NIOX
®
 
products. In the United States, we established new agreements 
with over 50 major healthcare providers and recently signed an 
Innovative Technology contract with Vizient Inc., the largest member-
owned healthcare company in the country. In parallel, our market 
access team extended NIOX
®
 coverage to an additional nine million 
Americans and at the beginning of 2018 Medicare increased  
its FeNO testing reimbursement rate. 
Circassia made significant progress during the past 
year, continuing its transition into a commercial specialty 
pharmaceutical business focused on respiratory disease. 
The Company established a transformational US commercial 
collaboration with AstraZeneca for the COPD products 
Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
 and its NIOX
®
 asthma management 
franchise continued to grow strongly. Circassia expanded  
its commercial growth platform, doubling its US sales force 
to promote both Tudorza
®
 and NIOX
®
, and its UK direct sales 
team performed well during its first full year since launch.  
As a result, the Company’s revenues grew by 100%,  
while in parallel, Circassia’s cost control measures  
delivered savings.

Improving distributor performance
We sell NIOX
®
 directly in the US, UK and Germany, and in a large 
number of additional countries through a network of international 
partners. During 2017 , we extended our distributor base in the Middle 
East and we continue to review commercialisation opportunities in 
Canada and South East Asia. We are also undertaking initiatives 
to assist our distributors’ performance, including the provision of 
dedicated NIOX
®
 training to improve local promotion. We intend to 
continue this distributor support in 2018 with the provision of tailored 
marketing materials. 
Expanding NIOX
®
 clearances
As part of our NIOX
®
 growth strategy, we are seeking product 
clearances in additional territories and for new applications in existing 
markets. During 2017 , we submitted regulatory filings for NIOX VERO
®
 
in Singapore and South Korea, and recently we received approval 
from the authorities. We also plan to complete submissions in Mexico, 
Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. In Europe, we launched a primary ciliary 
dyskinesia screening application for NIOX VERO
®
 at the world’s largest 
respiratory conference, the European Respiratory Society International 
Congress. This new application was subsequently cleared for use in 
Australia and South Korea. We also made regulatory progress in the 
United States, where the VERO
®
’s six second test mode received 
FDA clearance, providing physicians with an additional option that  
can be easier for children to use. 
NIOX
®
 brand strategy development
As well as extending access to NIOX
®
, our commercial team  
has evolved the product’s brand strategy to enhance its promotion.  
As part of a new 2018 marketing campaign, we have developed 
revised selling materials, customer economic modelling tools, pricing 
and payment options and enhanced visual aids. We plan to roll out 
a digital promotional strategy, which includes the use of targeted 
channels alongside a relaunch of our flagship NIOX.com web portal. 
The 2018 campaign will also include updated advertising, which is 
built around a new core theme: “If you could see it you would treat  
it differently”. Creative work and market testing of potential adverts  
is nearing completion and roll out is planned for the coming months. 
New publications support FeNO testing
At the end of November, the UK’s National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) published new clinical guidelines 
recommending the use of FeNO testing as a key component  
of asthma diagnosis. The guidelines call for the establishment  
of diagnostic hubs to achieve economies of scale when implementing 
the new recommendations. This provides Circassia with the 
opportunity to target Clinical Commissioning Groups throughout 
the UK to help implement the NICE guidance locally. As a result, 
we plan to assess opportunities to expand our current commercial 
organisation to leverage these recommendations. 
The new NICE guidelines were subsequently complemented  
by publications in the US and Germany. In the United States,  
the government Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
published an evidence report that highlights the use of FeNO testing 
as a valuable part of asthma diagnosis and management. In Germany, 
new guidelines issued by leading German and Austrian respiratory 
societies confirmed the important role FeNO testing can play  
in assisting asthma assessment and treatment. 
NIOX
®
 product evolution
During 2017 we completed market research with NIOX
®
 users  
to identify potential improvements to the system. The results  
revealed strong satisfaction with the current VERO
®
 device,  
as well as uncovering a number of areas where we could enhance 
the NIOX
®
 user experience without requiring modifications to the 
core technology. As a result, we plan to introduce a rapid evolution 
to the current product, incorporating enhancements to the screen, 
user interface and power consumption. This update will also exploit 
NIOX
®
’s existing Bluetooth capability and cloud connectivity, providing 
additional iOS and Android functionality. Development work for this 
evolution is underway and we plan to launch the new upgrade in 2019 
in Europe.

AstraZeneca US commercial collaboration
In the first half of 2017 , we established a transformational commercial 
collaboration with AstraZeneca in the United States. Under the  
terms of the agreement we have an initial profit share arrangement  
for the COPD mono-therapy Tudorza
®
, with an option to acquire  
the full commercial rights exercisable from H2 2018. In addition, we 
acquired the commercial rights to the late-stage COPD combination 
product candidate Duaklir
®
. 
The transaction structure is attractive, with AstraZeneca taking a 14% 
equity stake in the Company as upfront consideration of $50 million. 
Further payments are deferred with the exact level payable dependent 
on the success of the two products, and will be based on Tudorza
®
’s 
in-market sales and Duaklir
®
’s approval. Acquisition of Tudorza
®
’s full 
US commercial rights will trigger a payment of between $5 million 
and $80 million, and a further $100 million will be payable on Duaklir
®
 
approval, or at the end of H1 2019 if earlier. We anticipate satisfying 
these payments through third-party financing, and have agreed  
a vendor loan with AstraZeneca as a back stop. 
AstraZeneca has agreed to increase its equity stake in Circassia. As a 
result, Circassia intends to issue AstraZeneca additional ordinary shares 
in the Company’s share capital, subject to shareholder approval, such 
that AstraZeneca will increase its holding from 14.2% up to a maximum 
of 19.9%. Circassia will use the proceeds to fund a deferred R&D 
contribution of $20 million, which is payable by the end of 2018 under 
the agreement with AstraZeneca, and part fund a final R&D contribution 
of $25 million payable by the end of 2019. Additionally, AstraZeneca 
has agreed to include any remaining R&D contribution not paid by 
the end of 2019 in the loan arrangements in the existing development 
and commercialisation agreement. Circassia anticipates receiving 
approximately $9 million of tax credits relating to these R&D  
contribution payments.
Tudorza
®
 commercial progress
Tudorza
®
 contains the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) 
aclidinium bromide. It is indicated for the long-term maintenance 
treatment of bronchospasm associated with COPD, including chronic 
bronchitis and emphysema. This twice-daily inhaled therapy is 
approved in the United States, and is available under a number of 
brand names in many countries around the world. Under our Tudorza
®
 
profit share arrangement we have responsibility for the product’s 
promotion while AstraZeneca manages manufacturing, supply, 
regulatory and pharmacovigilance activities. 
During the first year of our collaboration, Tudorza
®
 has made good 
progress. By early June 2017 we had doubled the size of our sales 
force, completing the recruitment and training in under two months. 
We subsequently reached and exceeded our call targets well ahead 
of schedule and continue to regularly complete over 6,000 sales calls 
per week. Our 200-strong sales force is now supported by a team 
of over 50, including marketing, analytics, market access, training 
and medical affairs experts. Our Tudorza
®
 promotional plan is highly 
focused, targeting the majority of existing customers and the modest 
number of physicians who account for the highest number of COPD 
prescriptions. The plan includes a significantly increased intensity 
of sales calls, with Tudorza
®
 featuring in the number one product 
detailing position. 
Less than a year since we began promoting Tudorza
®
, prescription 
rates have begun to respond positively. By the end of the 2017 , 
previous declines were stabilising and prescriptions were more  
than 50% above the 2017 trend established prior to Circassia’s  
full promotion of the product. As a result, we received £19.0 million 
in revenues from the profit share arrangement for the period from 
the completion of the transaction in April to the end of the year. 
Prescription levels continue to respond to promotion, and during  
the first quarter of 2018 we halted the previous decline and 
prescriptions are now stable at approximately 4,700 per week.  
During 2018 we plan to build on this progress and aim to increase 
product uptake. We recently began to roll out a new Tudorza
®
 
“TUNIGHT + TUMORROW” marketing campaign, which includes  
a range of new sales materials highlighting the benefit of twice-daily 
dosing, significantly improving lung function with an evening  
and morning dose. 
Tudorza
®
 offers Circassia a significant growth opportunity.  
With over 15 million Americans diagnosed with COPD, the disease  
is the third leading cause of death in the United States. As a result,  
the US pharmaceutical treatment market was estimated to exceed  
$5 billion in 2017 . At the end of the year, Tudorza
®
 accounted  
for approximately 2.4% of US LAMA-containing prescriptions.  
A modest increase in market share would substantially increase 
Circassia’s revenues and third-party estimates suggest the  
product has annual peak sales potential of over $90 million.

 clinical progress
In December 2017 , Tudorza
®
 successfully completed a phase IV 
post-marketing study requested by the FDA. This large study, which 
was conducted in approximately 3,600 patients with moderate-to-very 
severe COPD and cardiovascular risk factors, met its primary efficacy 
and safety endpoints. Secondary endpoints included the rate of 
hospitalisations due to COPD exacerbations. The results demonstrate 
that alongside background therapy Tudorza
®
 is effective at reducing 
exacerbation rates in patients with cardiovascular disease or risk 
factors. AstraZeneca plans to present these compelling data at a 
forthcoming medical meeting, and to submit them to the FDA seeking 
inclusion in the product’s label. If successful this would present  
a competitive advantage for Tudorza
®
 as other LAMAs do not have 
these cardiovascular safety data in this at-risk population included  
in their prescribing information. 
Duaklir
®
 progress
Duaklir
®
 is a twice-daily inhaled fixed-dose combination COPD 
product. It contains the same LAMA as Tudorza
®
, aclidinium bromide, 
in combination with the long-acting beta agonist (LABA) formoterol 
fumarate. The product is approved in a number of countries under 
several brand names, and during the second half of 2017 , the  
US development programme made significant clinical progress. 
The product successfully completed its phase III study, AMPLIFY, 
in which it met both co-primary efficacy endpoints achieving 
significant lung function improvements compared with the individual 
LAMA and LABA components. Additionally, a sub-study of 24-hour 
bronchodilation showed that twice-daily products Duaklir
®
 and 
Tudorza
®
 demonstrated significantly greater night-time bronchodilation 
than once-daily Spiriva
®
. These positive results were supported by 
data from the ACHIEVE dose-ranging study, which showed Duaklir
®
 
contains the optimal dose of formoterol. AstraZeneca plans to 
incorporate these clinical studies in a New Drug Application (NDA) 
for Duaklir
®
, which it intends to submit to the FDA in the first half of 
2018. Duaklir
®
 targets a significant market opportunity, with third-party 
estimates suggesting annual peak sales potential of over $180 million.
Commercial platform expansion
In 2017 , our newly-expanded US commercial platform was an 
important factor in attracting AstraZeneca as a partner. In the coming 
year, we intend to pursue this strategy beyond the United States, 
expanding our infrastructure to drive NIOX
®
 growth and facilitate further 
in-licensing, partnering or product acquisition. To lead this expansion, 
we recently recruited the Head of Commercial Operations, Asia Pacific 
from Takeda, who has taken up the newly-created role of Senior Vice 
President, Commercial for Europe and Rest of World. 
As part of our expansion strategy, we recently initiated a recruitment 
campaign in China and established a local subsidiary alongside  
our existing representative office. In the coming weeks, we plan  
to increase our Beijing-based team, which currently manages local 
distributors, and establish a commercial ‘back office’. This will be 
complemented by a team of sales managers targeting new customers 
in key regional centres, enabling us to accelerate NIOX
®
 sales in this 
important market. Later in the year we intend to recruit a modest sales 
force, which will complement our existing distributor base. 
This new team will allow us to target top grade hospitals that are not 
currently NIOX
®
 customers. We anticipate this strategy will substantially 
increase our China revenues beyond the £3.5 million achieved  
in 2017 , which was itself an increase of 44% on the previous year.  
In addition, we anticipate our expanded capabilities will offer potential 
partners a commercialisation alternative in this major market. 
Respiratory pipeline portfolio
Circassia’s pipeline includes a number of respiratory products based 
on approved molecules, which are currently in clinical development 
or positioned to move into the clinic. Under our refocused investment 
strategy we now plan to out-license / partner these substitutable 
generic products and novel COPD treatment formulations to leverage  
third-party funding while retaining upside potential. 
Our newly-expanded US commercial platform 
was as an important factor in attracting 
AstraZeneca as a partner.

Substitutable generic products
Circassia’s portfolio of substitute products target a number  
of marketed asthma and COPD treatments, exploiting regulatory 
processes that permit approval based on the demonstration  
of equivalence. 
 — The most advanced of these products is a particle-engineered 
formulation of the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone propionate, 
which targets direct substitution of GlaxoSmithKline’s Flixotide
®
 / 
Flovent
®
 pMDI. Prior to Circassia’s ownership the product was 
out-licensed in key territories, including Europe and the US. With 
the United States remaining the main commercial opportunity, 
we sought to regain rights for the more modest European market. 
However, we did not reach agreement and the product rights 
remain with our partner. 
 — Our combination formulation containing fluticasone propionate  
and the LABA salmeterol xinafoate targets direct substitution of 
GSK’s Seretide
®
 pMDI. This targets a major market opportunity 
with GSK’s product in pMDI and DPI formats achieving global sales 
of over $4 billion in 2017 . During 2017 we initiated an additional 
pharmacokinetic study having further adjusted the product 
following previous iterative studies, and we anticipate receiving  
the results in the near future. 
 — Our formulation of tiotropium bromide targets direct substitution of 
Boehringer Ingelheim’s LAMA, Spiriva Handihaler
®
. This represents 
a significant commercial opportunity, with Spiriva
®
’s total global 
revenues estimated to total over $3 billion in 2017 . We recently 
completed manufacture of stability batches of our formulation in 
preparation to begin an initial pharmacokinetic clinical study. 
Novel COPD treatment formulations
Circassia’s development candidates targeting the specialist  
treatment of COPD are based on novel formulations of approved 
drugs. The most advanced of these, a combination LAMA / LABA, 
incorporates mesh nebulisation technology in-licensed from medical 
innovation company, Philips Respiratory Drug Delivery. This next 
generation hand-held nebuliser is battery powered, easy-to-clean, 
Bluetooth enabled and features a breath actuation algorithm  
to improve usability. Our development programme advanced  
during 2017 and we recently completed manufacture of stability 
batches in preparation for a dose-ranging clinical study of the  
mono-components. 
Our second development programme focuses on a novel formulation 
of an approved product that targets the treatment of severe COPD 
in patients with a history of exacerbations. Circassia’s development 
programme aims to improve the efficacy and tolerability profile of the 
marketed product for use in this at-risk population. 
Cost containment
Following receipt of disappointing allergy clinical results in 2016 and 
2017 , we moved quickly to halt investment in the field and contain 
costs in our R&D activities and administrative functions. This included 
consolidating our facilities in the US, UK and Sweden and reducing 
the size of our R&D team. These measures have resulted in significant 
savings. Our G&A costs decreased over 25% during 2017 following 
the closure of our offices in Chicago and Solna, Sweden. In addition, 
we reduced our in-house R&D expenditure, with R&D headcount 
approximately 40% lower at the end of the year. 
Refocused investment strategy
During the coming year, we intend to build on these cost containment 
measures as part of a refocused investment strategy. This strategy is 
designed to complete our transition into a fully commercially-focused 
specialty pharmaceutical business, with rapidly growing revenues, 
strong commercial platform and expanding product portfolio. The 
strategy has a number of key elements:
1. Commercial expansion
We plan to continue investing in our commercial platform to  
drive revenues from our existing portfolio and attract additional  
third-party products through acquisition, in-licensing and partnering.  
In particular, we are building an initial sales force in China to rapidly 
increase our sales and build on the 44% growth achieved in 2017 .  
We also intend to review opportunities to expand our UK sales 
organisation to leverage the opportunity created by the publication  
of new NICE guidelines in 2017 .
5, US sales force doubled
Our 200-strong sales force is now 
supported by a team of over 50, 
including marketing, analytics,  
market access, training and  
medical affairs experts.
6, Targeting leading asthma and 
COPD products
The most advanced substitute product 
is a particle-engineered formulation 
targeting direct substitution of 
GlaxoSmithKline’s Flixotide

 pMDI.

CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   24 25/04/2018   19:19 7
2. R&D refocusing
We intend to reduce our R&D investment and focus on supporting 
regulatory, medical affairs, pharmacovigilance, quality and supply 
chain activities for Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
 and developing a near-term 
evolution of NIOX VERO
®
 and subsequent next generation NIOX
®
 
product. In parallel, we plan to out-license / partner our respiratory 
pipeline portfolio based on currently approved products, which will 
allow us to retain potential financial upside whilst leveraging third-party 
funding for their development. A number of these candidates are 
positioned to enter the clinic, and clinical pharmacokinetic results  
are anticipated for the Seretide
®
 pMDI substitute in the coming weeks. 
3. Cost containment programme
Alongside the reductions in our R&D activities we plan to continue  
our broader programme of cost containment. In particular, we plan  
to decrease corporate overheads and reduce expenditure at our 
Oxford headquarters, including further consolidation of our facilities. 
By implementing this investment strategy we plan to drive continued 
revenue growth from our portfolio of marketed products, while 
providing the financial flexibility to pursue additional product and 
geographical expansion opportunities. As a result of these measures, 
we expect annualised cost reductions of approximately £5 million in 
our R&D and approximately £2 million in our corporate expenditure, 
while increasing our 2018 sales and marketing investment by 
approximately £7 million. 
Summary and outlook
During the past year, Circassia made significant progress in its transition 
to a fully-fledged commercial specialty pharmaceutical business focused 
on the respiratory field. With sales of our NIOX
®
 asthma management 
products growing strongly, our flagship COPD collaboration with 
AstraZeneca making good progress and our commercial platform 
expanding, we are building a highly attractive business. 
In the coming year, we plan to capitalise on this momentum to 
complete our commercial transformation. Our China expansion  
is progressing well, and we intend to substantially increase NIOX
®
 
sales while seeking additional products to commercialise through 
our platform. In the United States, we look forward to regulatory 
submissions for Duaklir
®
 approval and to extend Tudorza
®
’s label. 
We will continue our focus on growing Tudorza
®
 revenues, leveraging 
our new marketing campaign and established field force, while also 
exploiting our commercial capabilities to promote NIOX
®
 to a larger 
potential customer base. In parallel, we plan to progress development 
of our NIOX VERO
®
 evolution, while seeking partners for our 
respiratory pipeline.
During 2018, we anticipate continued strong revenue growth building 
on the significant increase we achieved in 2017 . With a full year’s 
contribution from our Tudorza
®
 collaboration and rapidly growing 
NIOX
®
 sales we have significant growth potential ‘locked in’. During the 
second half of the year, we anticipate the opportunity to acquire the 
full US commercial rights to Tudorza
®
, which we intend to fund through 
third-party financing, and we look forward to updating the market on 
this important milestone. 
Overall, Circassia has a clear strategy. Since the Company’s founding 
we have worked hard to build a strong specialty pharmaceutical 
business, commercialising novel products in key markets with a broad 
and balanced portfolio. Circassia has made good progress towards 
this objective during the past year, and with compelling products  
and robust commercial growth platform we are closer than ever  
to achieving our goal. 
 
7, China expansion
Our China expansion is progressing 
well, and we intend to significantly 
increase NIOX
®
 sales and seek 
additional products to commercialise 
through our platform.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 25
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   25 25/04/2018   19:19 The financial results for the year reflect a period of transition 
for Circassia. The Company increased its revenues by 100%  
to £46.3 million (2016: £23.1 million) while reducing its in-house 
research and development (R&D) and underlying general 
and administrative (G&A) costs and increasing its sales and 
marketing investment to support its growing commercial 
platform. As a result, its underlying operating loss reduced 
to £39.6 million (2016 restated: £43.8 million) and the Group 
loss for the financial year from underlying activities was 
£36.9 million (2016 restated: £35.9 million). This is welcome 
progress, and a reduction in the net loss is expected in 
2018 as a result of ongoing cost containment measures and 
increased revenues. The total loss for the period decreased 
to £99.1 million (2016: £137.4 million). Explanations of the 
difference can be found in this review. 
The table on page 28 sets out results for the year ended  
31 December 2017 for the Group separated into continuing and 
discontinued operations. Continuing operations are further divided 
into underlying and non-underlying operations. Underlying continuing 
operations include revenues and costs derived from the collaboration 
with AstraZeneca, as well as sales of NIOX
®
 and costs for the existing 
underlying Circassia business. These are the measures primarily used 
by management to manage the business and measure performance. 
Significant irregular items are classified as non-underlying. In 2017 
these include R&D contributions to AstraZeneca and impairments. 
Discontinued operations include direct costs and overheads 
associated with allergy programmes following the decision to stop  
all further development in the field in April 2017 . The presentation  
of the results for the year ended 31 December 2016 has been 
restated in accordance with IFRS 5 to provide a clearer comparison.
Revenue
Circassia’s revenues for the year increased by 100% to £46.3 million 
(2016: £23.1 million). These include NIOX
®
 sales, which increased  
by 18% (12% at constant exchange rates (CER)) to £27 .3 million  
(2016: £23.1 million), and revenues of £19.0 million from the 
partnership with AstraZeneca for the sale of Tudorza
®
, which were 
recognised from 12 April 2017 when the companies’ collaboration 
agreement became unconditional.
NIOX
®
 revenues include sales for use in clinical practice, which grew 
by 26% (20% CER) to £22.8 million (2016: £18.0 million), sales for 
use in pharmaceutical company research, which decreased by 8% 
(13% CER) to £4.1 million (2016: £4.5 million), and other revenues of 
£0.4 million (2016: £0.6 million), which include freight. NIOX
®
 clinical 
revenues increased by 34% (27% CER) in the United States, 44% 
(36% CER) in China and 134% in the UK. Revenues in Germany 
decreased by 5% (11% CER) following restructuring to focus on  
market access and revised pricing to encourage greater test usage.
Tudorza
®
 revenues reflect 50% of the joint profit arrangement  
with AstraZeneca from sales of the product. AstraZeneca records  
in-market sales, cost of sales and other operational costs while 
Circassia records the costs of the field force and promotion.
Financial review
The financial results for the year reflect  
a period of transition for Circassia. 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 26
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   26 25/04/2018   19:19 Gross profit
Gross margin increased from 65% to 78%. This was mainly due  
to the contribution of revenues from the AstraZeneca collaboration. 
The gross margin was higher in H2 2017 than in H1 2017 based on 
these revenues for the full six month period. Gross profit on NIOX
®
 
sales was £17 .3 million (2016: £15.1 million), with a gross margin  
of 63% (2016: 65%). This decrease mainly reflects the weakening  
of sterling.
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing costs increased to £49.6 million (2016 restated: 
£27 .2 million). This was mainly due to an increase in the size of the 
US field force from 100 to 200 as part of the collaboration agreement 
with AstraZeneca. When including discontinued operations total sales 
and marketing costs decreased to £50.1 million (2016: £104.7 million), 
following a goodwill write-down of £74.5 million in 2016.
R&D activities
R&D expenditure for underlying continuing operations decreased to 
£15.3 million (2016 restated: £17 .3 million). This includes development 
work on NIOX
®
 and the respiratory portfolio. In-house R&D, which 
better reflects expenditure at the time of operation by including 
underlying and discontinued operations and excluding impairments, 
decreased by 54% to £20.9 million from £45.9 million in 2016. 
R&D expenditure for non-underlying continuing operations increased 
to £82.1 million (2016 restated: £0.5 million), which includes one-
off costs of £45.1 million ($62.5 million) for the R&D contributions 
to AstraZeneca, all of which have been expensed in the income 
statement in 2017 . The remainder is due to impairments of product 
candidates in the respiratory portfolio. This includes the Seretide
®
 
pMDI substitute, for which the impairment reflects a decrease in  
the market potential following delays in product launch as a result  
of negative PK study results in the previous two years. It also 
includes the Flixotide
®
 pMDI substitute (EU rights) and a partnered 
particle-engineered version of salmeterol xinafoate which are no 
longer being pursued.

Seretide
®
 pMDI substitute 31.0

Total 37.0
Costs of £5.6 million (2016: £28.4 million) are included in discontinued 
operations, following the halting of expenditure on allergy programmes. 
Administrative expenditure
Administrative expenditure from continuing operations decreased 
by 27% to £10.9 million (2016 restated: £14.9 million). This reflects 
a number of cost saving measures, including the closure of the 
Company’s sites in Solna, Sweden and Chicago, US and decreased 
expenditure on patent maintenance.  
Other gains and losses
Other gains for the Group increased to £10.4 million  
(2016 restated: £5.2 million). Included in this figure are £8.3 million 
(2016: £nil) of foreign exchange gains on payables to AstraZeneca  
due to weakening of the US dollar against sterling.
Net finance income 
Net finance costs were £2.4 million (2016 restated: £0.8 million 
income) for the year. Finance costs of £2.7 million (2016: £nil) reflect 
a charge to the income statement, which is based on the difference 
in the time value of money on the discounted $100 million deferred 
consideration payable to AstraZeneca at the year end.

Financial review continued
The outlook for 2018 is positive, reflecting the 
Company’s increasing focus on commercial 
expansion and its intention to build on the cost 
containment measures achieved in 2017 .
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 28
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   28 25/04/2018   19:19 Taxation
Taxation for the year was a £21.0 million credit (2016: £7 .5 million 
credit). The main component was the R&D tax credit on qualifying 
expenditure, which was £13.8 million (2016: £8.6 million). Of this  
£3.5 million (2016 restated: £1.9 million) is included in underlying 
continuing operations and has increased because of growth  
in expenditure on the respiratory programmes. 
Included in non-underlying continuing operations is a tax credit  
of £16.5 million (2016: £nil). Of this, £10.2 million is an R&D tax  
credit (2016: £nil) for R&D contributions to AstraZeneca.  
The remaining £6.3 million credit relates to the reduction  
of a deferred tax liability as a result of impairment of intangible  
assets in the respiratory portfolio.
Loss after tax and loss per share
The loss per share for continuing operations was 29p  
(2016 restated: 13p), reflecting a loss for the financial period  
of £93.6 million (2016 restated: £36.9 million), with the increase  
mainly the result of non-underlying items of £82.1 million, which 
include the R&D contribution to AstraZeneca and impairment  
of intangible assets in the respiratory portfolio. Basic loss  
per share for the period was 31p (2016: 48p) reflecting a loss  
for the financial period of £99.1 million (2016: £137 .4 million).
Statement of financial position
The Group’s net assets at 31 December 2017 were £224.8 million 
(2016: £280.7 million). An increase in non-current assets is offset by  
a similar increase in non-current liabilities and the remaining decrease 
mainly reflects the decrease in the Company’s cash balance.
Non-current assets have increased to £312.5 million (2016: £195.7 million).  
This is mainly due to the recognition of assets giving rights to 
collaborate with AstraZeneca on the commercialisation of Tudorza
®
  
in the United States and an increase in intangible assets relating  
to the acquisition of Duaklir
®
.
Non-current liabilities have increased to £146.8 million (2016:  
£31.9 million). This is mainly due to the $100 million consideration 
payable to AstraZeneca and recognition of the future royalties payable  
on Duaklir
®
 sales.
Cash flow
The Group’s cash position (including short-term deposits)  
decreased from £117 .4 million at 31 December 2016 to £59.5 million 
at 31 December 2017 . The main cash outflow was £57 .6 million cash 
used in operations (2016: £56.7 million). Cash used in operations 
decreased in H2 2017 to £23.3 million (H1 2017: £34.3 million).  
H2 2017 included receipt of an R&D tax credit of £8.9 million  
and payment of an R&D contribution to AstraZeneca of £13.1 million 
as well as payments for discontinued operations.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 29
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   29 25/04/2018   19:19 Financial review continued
Outlook
The outlook for 2018 is positive, reflecting the Company’s increasing 
focus on commercial expansion and its intention to build on the cost 
containment measures achieved in 2017 . With anticipated savings  
in R&D and administration, together with the benefit of a full year  
of Tudorza
®
 sales and growing NIOX
®
 revenues, the overall net loss  
in 2018 is expected to decrease significantly. 
With this revenue growth potential in effect ‘locked in’ in 2018, Circassia 
also anticipates the first opportunity to acquire the full US rights to Tudorza
®
 
in the second half of the year. If this option is exercised, Circassia will make 
further payments to AstraZeneca of between $5 million and $80 million 
dependent on Duaklir
®
’s approval and Tudorza
®
’s US sales. Circassia 
anticipates utilising third-party financing to satisfy the consideration,  
and a vendor loan is in place in the event this cannot be secured.
During 2018, the Company also plans to implement its refocused 
investment strategy. As a result, sales and marketing costs are 
expected to increase by approximately £7 million in 2018, with the 
expanded US field force in the marketplace for the full year and the 
Company building a sales force in China. As part of this refocusing, 
annualised savings of approximately £5 million are expected in 
R&D expenditure compared with this year’s underlying continuing 
operations. The reduction in R&D activities will also enable the 
Company to reduce its corporate and facilities overheads in Oxford, 
reducing anticipated G&A expenditure by approximately £2 million 
on an annualised basis. In addition, as a result of this change there 
may be an impairment in the carrying value of the respiratory cash 
generating unit in 2018.
Additionally, Circassia intends to issue further ordinary share 
capital to AstraZeneca, subject to shareholder approval, such that 
AstraZeneca’s holding will increase from 14.2% to a maximum of 
19.9%. Circassia will use the proceeds to fund a deferred R&D 
contribution of $20 million, which is payable by the end of 2018 
under the agreement with AstraZeneca, and part fund a final R&D 
contribution of $25 million payable by the end of 2019. AstraZeneca 
has agreed to include any remaining R&D contribution not paid by 
the end of 2019 in the loan arrangements in the existing development 
and commercialisation agreement. Circassia anticipates receiving tax 
credits totalling approximately $9 million on the R&D payments.
With sales growth potential in place, cost containment measures 
delivering results and a refocused investment strategy targeting 
commercial expansion, we look forward to 2018 with optimism.

Health and safety
The Group is committed to protecting the health and safety  
of its employees and endeavours to maintain an effective health  
and safety culture.
The Group provides ongoing training to individuals who are 
responsible for health and safety and all staff are notified of health  
and safety practices. The Group continuously monitors its health  
and safety policy and practices to ensure they are robust, appropriate, 
and reflect changes in best practice.
Ethical and social policies
The Group is a pharmaceutical and medical devices group  
and accordingly operates in a highly regulated ethical framework.  
It complies fully with these laws and regulations. The Company  
has a clear anti-bribery policy which is monitored by the  
Compliance department.
Sunshine Act
The Group is committed to promoting transparency of its relationships 
with healthcare providers. It collects, tracks and reports payments  
to healthcare professionals and organisations in compliance with  
the US Physician Payment Sunshine Act and equivalent legislation  
in other countries such as France.
Human rights
The Group support the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and recognises the obligation to promote universal respect for and 
observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without 
distinction. The Group complies with all applicable human rights laws.
Product development
The Group commissions third-party laboratories to conduct the 
minimum necessary pre-clinical product safety testing in animal 
models as required by regulatory authorities before commencing 
clinical studies. The Group works according to the 3Rs policy  
relating to preclinical testing (Refine, Reduce, Replace).
Environment
The Group is committed to minimising the impact of its activities  
on the environment. The majority of the Group’s employees operate 
out of modern office suites, although it also occupies laboratory space 
in Oxford and has warehouses in Uppsala, Sweden and Morrisville, 
USA. Accordingly, the Group believes that efficient use of energy and 
materials in those premises, and responsible disposal of hazardous 
waste, are the most important means of climate protection currently 
available to it. Office-based initiatives to reduce waste have also been 
adopted, which include recycling of paper waste, cans, plastics, 
batteries and printer toners / cartridges. The Group does not possess 
or make use of corporate jets or private planes.
Greenhouse gas emission
This section of the Annual report constitutes the Group’s disclosure 
of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
Regulations 2013).
The Group considers that its current activities have a low environmental 
impact. Nonetheless, it still actively seeks to make energy savings  
in a fashion which is environmentally responsible and cost effective.
Emissions for 2017 are in line with those in 2016, reflecting the fact  
that they are largely a function of the heating and lighting of leased  
office premises.

GHG emissions are reported in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalents and calculated using the Defra conversion factors.
Gas and electricity usage information has been obtained from 
purchase invoices and verified by reference to meter readings.
In order to express annual emissions in relation to a quantifiable factor 
associated with the Group’s business, an intensity ratio has been 
calculated which shows emissions reported per square metre of the 
office space occupied by the Group. This is shown in the table above.
Political and charitable donations
The Group does not make political or charitable donations, although 
charitable fundraising by employees is encouraged.
Slavery and human trafficking statement
The Group is committed to combatting slavery and human trafficking. 
As part of its initiative to identify and mitigate risks it performs 
due diligence on potential suppliers and distributors and protects 
whistleblowers, who can raise concerns anonymously through an 
externally provided reporting service. The Group’s suppliers and 
distributors are provided with its Partner Code of Conduct which 
makes it clear that the Group expects them to comply with the 
requirements of the Modern Slavery Act.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 32
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   32 25/04/2018   19:19 Risks and risk management
The management of risks is a key responsibility of the Board 
of Directors of the Company. The Board ensures that the risks 
taken by the Group are understood, and are appropriate in the 
light of its strategy and objectives, and that internal controls 
are in place to effectively identify, assess, and manage 
important risks.
The risk management strategy adopted by the Company has  
a number of facets. A risk register has been created and is updated 
on an annual basis by those individuals in the business who manage 
risks on a day to day basis. This identifies each risk, assesses the 
likelihood of its occurrence and the level of impact on the business. 
This process is coordinated by the Chief Financial Officer. The register 
is reviewed by the Senior Management Team and subsequently 
reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and reported to the Board. 
There is a particular emphasis on ensuring that the risk appetite of 
the Board is fully understood by the Senior Management Team. 
The register also sets out activities and controls which are designed 
to mitigate the identified risks, and again the Board and the Senior 
Management Team analyse these mitigation strategies and ensure 
that the approach taken is consistent with the nature and degree 
of risks which are considered acceptable by the Board. Aside 
from the review, risk owners across the business are responsible 
for reporting any significant issues on an ongoing basis up to the 
Senior Management Team and for ensuring that other members of 
their teams are aware of the risk management process. The Senior 
Management Team, which meets weekly, receives summary weekly 
updates and more detailed monthly reports from all areas of the 
business, and updates the Board on a timely basis where important 
developments occur. Within the R&D function, project team meetings 
take place once a month at which the progress and risks of each 
individual project are discussed and detailed reports are circulated. 
The Quality Team, Compliance Committee, and Health and Safety 
Committee also meet regularly. These discussions are documented  
in reports which are circulated to the Senior Management Team.
The risk management system is designed to manage risks, rather 
than eliminate them at the expense of achieving corporate objectives. 
Accordingly, it can only provide a reasonable and not an absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The scope of the Group’s commercial risk management activities 
increased significantly during 2017 following the commencement  
of the collaboration with AstraZeneca relating to Tudorza
®
.  
Accordingly, the Compliance function has been expanded  
and a Director of US Compliance appointed to oversee the risks 
associated with the promotion and sale of both medical devices  
and pharmaceutical products.
Principal risks
The main risks relevant to the Group have been identified below, 
together with an explanation of how they are managed and controlled. 
Some risks are common across the pharmaceutical industry, while 
others reflect the Group’s specific strategy. The Company considers 
all of these risks relevant to any decision to invest in it.
Commercial success
The Group’s competitors – many of whom have considerably greater 
financial and human resources – may develop safer or more effective 
products or be able to compete more effectively in the markets targeted 
by the Group. New companies may enter these markets and novel 
products and technologies may become available which are more 
commercially successful than those being developed by the Group.
During H1 2017 the Group commenced its collaboration with 
AstraZeneca to sell the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), 
Tudorza
®
 in the United States. There are currently three other LAMA 
products marketed in the United States, namely Spiriva
®
 (sold by 
Boehringer Ingelheim), Incruse
®
 (sold by GSK), and Seebri
®
 from 
Sunovion. Tudorza
®
 competes directly with all these products. 
Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Group will be able  
to increase its share of the LAMA market. AstraZeneca’s rights  
to Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
 are the subject of a head licence between 
AstraZeneca and Almirall and Circassia has a sub-licence under this 
head licence. Both the licence and sub-licence contain customary 
diligence obligations. A continued failure to perform these diligence 
obligations could ultimately lead to termination of the head licence 
or sub-licence. The provision of Tudorza
®
 samples to healthcare 
practitioners is currently managed by AstraZeneca. However,  
as and when the Group exercises its option to take full ownership  
of the product it will need to implement its own sample  
management programme.
The Group may not be able to sell its products profitably  
if reimbursement from third party payers such as private health 
insurers and government health authorities is restricted or not  
available because for example it proves difficult to build a strong 
enough economic case based on the burden of illness and  
population impact. Third party payers are increasingly attempting  
to curtail healthcare costs by challenging the prices that are charged 
for pharmaceutical products and denying or limiting coverage and  
the level of reimbursement. Moreover, even if the products can  
be sold profitably, they may not be accepted by patients and  
the medical community.
The Group’s NIOX MINO
®
 and NIOX VERO
®
 devices compete  
in Europe with products made by Bedfont Limited, Bosch 
Healthcare Solutions GmbH (based in Germany), and Spirosure Inc. 
(headquartered in the United States). In China, a competing product  
is supplied to the market by Sunvou Medical. None of these competing 
products are currently available in the US.
Outside the US, UK and Germany the Group relies on distributors 
to sell its NIOX
®
 devices and such relationships must be carefully 
managed in order to ensure the services provided are of a sufficiently 
high quality and an appropriate level of resources is applied by the 
distributor to the marketing of the devices.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 33
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   33 25/04/2018   19:19 Risks and risk management continued
The successful commercialisation of the Group’s fluticasone 
propionate product will, if launched, be largely dependent upon  
its partner Mylan which has the exclusive rights to sell the product  
in most major markets. Moreover, this product and certain other drug 
products being developed by the Group for treatment of asthma, 
such as its fluticasone / salmeterol combination product, are generic 
products and so will compete with the innovator products as well  
as potentially generics from other third parties.
Other factors that may undermine the Group’s efforts to commercialise 
its products include: the inability to train and retain effective sales and 
marketing personnel; a failure to persuade prescribers to prescribe 
products; and higher costs of marketing and promotion than are 
anticipated by the Group.
Mitigating activities
The Group and its partner AstraZeneca are implementing a jointly 
agreed Promotional Plan for Tudorza
®
 and this is reviewed at regular 
meetings of the Joint Commercialisation Committee. Promotional 
efforts are focused on higher volume prescribers and the Group's 
sales representatives promote Tudorza
®
 as the primary product in 
the majority of health care professional (HCP) calls. A dedicated 
team concentrates on selling the product to larger public and 
private institutions under fixed term contracts. To mitigate the risks 
of termination of the head licence or the sub-licence, Circassia and 
AstraZeneca have both agreed to use all reasonable efforts to ensure 
the relevant obligations under the head licence from Almirall are 
performed. Both the head licence and sub-licence contain customary 
provisions relating to cure periods and dispute resolution.
With regard to its NIOX
®
 franchise, the Group continues to apply 
increasing resources to sales of the device. By the end of 2017  
there were approximately 200 sales representatives selling NIOX
®
  
in the United States, double the number at the end of 2016.  
Distributor markets are managed by an experienced Director of 
Distributor Management and the resources available to this team  
have also increased in the course of the year.
With respect to the Respiratory franchise, the Group’s agreement  
with Mylan contains provisions which offer remedies in the event  
that insufficient diligence is applied to the development and marketing 
of its fluticasone propionate products. A joint steering committee 
oversees this project.
Compliance with healthcare regulations
The Group must comply with complex regulations in relation to  
the marketing of its device and drug products. These regulations  
are strictly enforced. Failure by the Group (or its commercial partners) 
to comply with the US False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute and  
the US Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act and regulations relating 
to data privacy (amongst others) and similar legislation in countries 
outside the US may result in criminal and civil proceedings against  
the Group.
Mitigating activities
The Group has an internal Compliance function which has been 
extended and restructured in the course of the year. Two regional 
heads of Compliance, one focused solely on the United States,  
and the other on territories outside the US now report to the General 
Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer. The General Counsel and 
Chief Compliance Officer has a direct reporting line to the Chair of 
the Audit and Risk Committee. A Compliance Committee oversees 
activities in this area and meets on a quarterly basis. The Compliance 
function works with a network of external advisers in the relevant 
territories to ensure local regulations are comprehended and that 
strategies are in place to support products in development as well  
as those already approved and sold. Robust processes are in place  
to ensure that sales compliance requirements are met and any failures 
or allegations of failure are swiftly investigated. This includes training  
of employees, ride-alongs with sales representatives, due diligence  
on distributors and suppliers prior to contracting with them, and  
audits of distributors and suppliers.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 34
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   34 25/04/2018   19:19 Regulatory approvals
The Group may not obtain regulatory approval for those of its products 
which are in development. Even where products are approved, 
subsequent regulatory difficulties may arise, or the conditions relating 
to the approval may be more onerous or restrictive than the Group 
expects, or existing approvals might be withdrawn.
The pharmaceutical and medical device industries are highly 
regulated. Regulatory authorities across the world enforce a 
range of laws and regulations which govern the testing, approval, 
manufacturing, labelling and marketing of such products. Stringent 
standards are imposed which relate to the quality, safety and efficacy 
of these products. These requirements are a major determinant  
of whether it is commercially feasible to develop a drug substance  
or medical device given the time, expertise, and expense which must  
be invested. Moreover, approval in one territory offers no guarantee 
that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other territory.
In order to obtain regulatory approval for the Group’s products, it will 
be necessary to successfully complete supporting clinical studies. 
Clinical studies are typically expensive, complex and time-consuming, 
and have uncertain outcomes. Conditions in which clinical studies 
are conducted differ, and results achieved in one set of conditions 
could be different from the results achieved in different conditions or 
with different subject populations. Regulatory authorities or institutional 
review boards may suspend or terminate clinical studies at any time 
if the subjects participating in such studies are being exposed to 
unacceptable health risks or may require additional studies to be 
performed. Difficulties or delays in the enrolment of subjects could 
result in significant delays in the completion of those studies and  
even in their abandonment.
The Group already holds regulatory approvals for its NIOX MINO
®
  
and NIOX VERO
®
 devices in certain key countries such as the  
United States, Japan, China, the UK and Germany but approvals  
are still pending for the VERO
®
 in a number of other countries.  
Delays or complications in any of these regulatory applications  
could adversely affect the Group’s business.
The Group also has an exclusive licence to commercialise Duaklir
®
  
in the United States. This product is not yet approved, although clinical 
studies have been successfully completed and filing for a New Drug 
Application is currently anticipated in H1 2018.
During 2017 , the Group also received the results of a Phase IV post-
marketing study relating to Tudorza
®
. This met both its primary efficacy 
endpoint and its primary safety endpoint thereby eliminating a risk 
which had been highlighted in last year’s report and accounts.
The Group is currently awaiting results from a clinical trial for one  
of its respiratory products. The respiratory programme seeks 
to develop a substitute for Seretide
®
. However, there can be no 
guarantee that this trial will meet its endpoint or that the product 
will ultimately be approved. Similarly, its nebulized LABA/LAMA 
formulation, which is being developed for use with smart nebulizer 
technology in-licensed from Philips and its generic tiotropium 
programme are still at an early stage. In order to extract value from 
its in-house respiratory programmes in the near term, the Group is 
seeking to out-license / partner these programmes to third parties. 
There is, however, a risk that the Group will not be able to negotiate 
such licence agreements.
The Group relies on third party sub-contractors and service providers 
for the execution of most aspects of its development programmes. 
Failure of these third parties to provide services of a suitable quality 
within acceptable timeframes – for example due to technical reasons 
or bankruptcy of the provider – may cause the failure or delay of these 
development programmes.
Even where approval is obtained, regulatory authorities may still 
impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of 
a product or impose costly, ongoing requirements for post-marketing 
surveillance or post-approval studies, or may even withdraw the 
approval if new concerns over safety and efficacy arise.
Mitigating activities
The Group manages its regulatory risk by employing highly 
experienced clinical managers and regulatory affairs professionals 
who, where appropriate, will commission advice from external  
advisers and consult with the regulatory authorities on the design  
of the Group’s pre-clinical and clinical programmes. These in-house 
experts ensure that high quality protocols and other documentation 
are submitted during the regulatory process, and that well-reputed 
contract research organisations with global capabilities are retained  
to manage the trials. The clinical studies which took place with 
Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
 during 2017 have been managed by 
AstraZeneca which is a global leader in the development of respiratory 
drugs. AstraZeneca will also take the lead on the regulatory activities 
which flow from the successful outcome of those studies.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 35
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   35 25/04/2018   19:19 Risks and risk management continued
Unforeseen side effects
Unforeseen side effects may result from the use of the Group’s 
products or product candidates.
There is a risk of adverse reactions with all drugs and there is a risk 
that the malfunction of a medical diagnostic or device may have an 
adverse impact on patients. If any of the Group’s products are found 
to cause adverse reactions or unacceptable side effects or risk of 
misdiagnosis, then product development may be delayed, additional 
expenses may be incurred if further studies or product development 
work are required, and, in extreme circumstances, it may prove 
necessary to suspend or terminate development. This may occur 
even after regulatory approval has been obtained, in which case 
additional trials may be required or the approval may be suspended  
or withdrawn or additional safety warnings may have to be included  
on the label.
Adverse events or unforeseen side effects or device malfunction may 
also potentially lead to product liability claims being raised against the 
Group as the developer of the products and sponsor of the relevant 
clinical trials.
Mitigating activities
The Group conducts pre-clinical and clinical trials which test for and 
identify adverse side effects of the pharmaceutical products which 
it is developing. Its medical devices are subject to rigorous testing 
procedures. A robust pharmacovigilance plan is in place to ensure any 
safety issues are identified and reported. Insurance is in place to cover 
product liability claims which may arise during the conduct of clinical 
trials or sales of the Group’s NIOX MINO
®
and NIOX VERO
®
 products 
and sales of Tudorza
®
.
AstraZeneca administers the global safety database for Tudorza
®
 and 
a Safety Data Exchange agreement is in place between the parties.
Supply Chain
The Group relies on third parties for the supply of key materials  
and services. Problems at these contractors, such as technical 
issues, contamination, and regulatory actions may lead to delays 
or even loss of supply or inadequate supply of these materials and 
services either prior to launch or thereafter. Some materials may only 
be available from one source, as is currently the case for the NIOX 
MINO
®
 and NIOX VERO
®
 devices and the sensors contained in those 
devices, and regulatory requirements may make substitution costly 
and time-consuming.
The supply chain for Tudorza
®
 continues to be controlled by 
AstraZeneca. Even after exercise by the Group of the option to acquire 
full rights to the product, AstraZeneca will remain the sole source of 
supply for this product, and for Duaklir
®
 if approved.
Mitigating activities
Audits of sub-contractors are routinely conducted according  
to procedures set out in the Group’s Quality system. Dual sourcing  
is investigated where this is practicable. Manufacturing sites are well 
established FDA-approved facilities. AstraZeneca has an established 
global supply chain in place for Tudorza
®
 and at the point when the 
Group is able to acquire the full rights to the product the existing 
arms’-length supply agreement negotiated by the parties will come 
into full effect.
Research and development risks
The Group may not be successful in its efforts to out-license / partner 
its pipeline of respiratory products. This could have a material impact 
on the long-term success of the business. Failure of programmes 
could result from lack of resources or capabilities, or from not 
obtaining the desired pre-clinical and clinical results.
In addition, the Group is dependent upon external collaborators  
for the development of its NIOX
®
 devices. The Group relies upon its 
collaborations with Panasonic Healthcare Co., Ltd for the development 
of the devices themselves and upon IT Dr. Gambert GmbH for the 
development of the sensors contained in those devices.
Research and Development activities associated with Tudorza
®
 and 
Duaklir
®
 will continue to be led by AstraZeneca, although the Group 
will have input through the steering committees which have been 
formed to govern the collaboration.
Mitigating activities
The Group has recruited highly experienced R&D executives. Projects 
are closely monitored against goals and regularly reported to the 
Senior Management Team and the Board, and external resources  
are retained where this is deemed appropriate.
The development collaborations with Panasonic and AstraZeneca 
are managed by steering committees which include representatives 
from the Group. In addition, the Group will seek, through business 
development activity, to identify opportunities which would expand 
and diversify its portfolio.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 36
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   36 25/04/2018   19:19 Intellectual property, know how, and trade secrets
The Group may be subject to challenges relating to the validity of  
its patents. If these challenges are successful then the Group may  
be exposed to generic competition.
The Group could also be sued for infringement of third party patent 
rights. If these actions are successful then it would have to pay 
substantial damages and potentially remove its products from the 
market. Such litigation, particularly in the US, involves significant costs 
and uncertainties.
It is possible that the Group will not be able to secure intellectual 
property protection, or sufficient protection, in relation to products 
which are acquired or in development. Similarly, a failure by the Group 
to maintain or renew key patents would lead to the loss of such 
protection. In both cases the potential of the Group to earn revenue 
from its products could be compromised as it would be less difficult 
for third parties to copy the products.
The Group may rely upon know how and trade secrets to protect 
its products and maintain a competitive advantage. This may be 
especially important where patent protection is limited or lacking. 
Conversely, the Group may be subject to claims that its employees  
or agents have wrongfully used or disclosed the confidential 
information of third parties which could lead to damages or injunctions 
which affect particular products.
The Group licenses certain intellectual property rights from third 
parties. The rights which are licensed to the Group as part of the 
collaboration with AstraZeneca relating to Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
  
fall within this category. If the Group fails to comply with its obligations 
under these licence agreements it may enable the other party  
to terminate the agreement. 
Mitigating activities
Important products are covered by more than one patent family 
and attacks on patents are defended using expert external patent 
attorneys and lawyers. A robust system is in place which ensures 
patents are renewed on time. Third party patent filings are monitored 
to ensure the Group continues to have freedom to operate and 
oppositions are filed where this is considered expedient. Confidential 
information (both of the Group and belonging to third parties) is 
protected through use of confidential disclosure agreements with 
third parties, and suitable provisions relating to confidentiality and 
intellectual property exist in the Group’s employment contracts. 
Licences are monitored for compliance with their terms.
Organisational capabilities and capacity
The Group may be unable to successfully implement its plans for 
growth if it does not attract and retain employees with the requisite 
capabilities and experience, in appropriate numbers. The Group 
depends on the skills and experience of its current management team 
and employees, and is generally subject to competition for, and may 
fail to retain, skilled personnel.
Existing employees, investigators, consultants and commercial 
partners may engage in misconduct or improper activities, including 
non-compliance with regulatory standards and laws.
Where the Group acquires complementary technologies, products, 
or businesses it may not be able to integrate those acquisitions 
effectively or realise their expected benefits.
The Group may be vulnerable to disruption and damage as a result  
of failures of its computer systems.
Mitigating activities
Remuneration packages for employees are competitive, and incentive 
plans based on the contingent award of shares, are in place to attract, 
motivate and retain staff.
Disciplinary and whistleblowing policies exist to address misconduct 
by employees and officers, and committee structures exist with the 
Contract Research Organisations instructed by the Group, to monitor 
and manage the conduct of the Group’s clinical trials.
To address IT and cyber risks, a disaster recovery plan has  
been developed.
Data is backed up daily on off-site servers and the Group  
operates from a number of physically separate sites. In addition,  
the Group maintains up to date anti-virus, anti-malware and  
anti-spyware software.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 37
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   37 25/04/2018   19:19 Risks and risk management continued
Free float
The UK Listing Authority requires listing issuers to maintain at least 
25% free float in their listed shares. At 29 March 2018 the Company 
had a free float of approximately 11.9%. The proposed issue of new 
shares to AstraZeneca will reduce the free float to approximately 
11.2%. If the level of free float cannot be increased to 25% then the 
UKLA can require the Company to cancel its listing on the premium 
segment of the Official List and move its listing to another market in 
London. This might adversely affect the ability of new and existing 
shareholders to buy Ordinary shares and of holders to sell them.
Mitigating activities
At the time of publication of its prospectus announcing its collaboration 
with and the issue of shares to AstraZeneca, on 17 March 2017 , the 
Company obtained a derogation from the UKLA in respect of the 
Free Float requirement for a period of 12 months. During this period 
the Company has been in dialogue with the UKLA to discuss various 
ways in which the free float can be increased such as: (i) discussing 
with Shareholders who own more than 5% of the issue share capital 
of the Company whether any of their holdings can be disaggregated 
because decisions are being taken by independent investment 
managers within that Shareholder’s organisation; and (ii) discussing 
with such Shareholders the prospect of reducing their holding below 
5%. The Company's advisers are in continuing dialogue with the FCA 
regarding these matters.
Financial operations
The Group has incurred significant losses since the inception of its 
various businesses and anticipates that it will continue to do so for a 
further period due to the high level of expenditure required to develop 
its NIOX
®
 business, to promote Tudorza
®
, and launch Duaklir
®
.
Foreign exchange fluctuations may adversely affect the Group’s 
results and financial condition. The Group records its transactions and 
prepares its financial statements in pounds sterling, but a significant 
proportion of its expenditure is in US dollars, Swedish krona, or Euros.
Adverse decisions of regulators, including tax authorities, or changes 
in tax treaties, laws, or the interpretation of those laws, could reduce 
or eliminate research and development tax credits which the Group, 
currently receives in the United Kingdom.
Mitigating activities
The Group's Viability Statement which appears on page 39 sets 
out the considerations relevant to solvency and liquidity. Forward 
purchases of foreign currencies are made when exchange rates  
are favourable to provide for expenditure in those currencies. Markets 
are constantly monitored and an external commentary is provided by 
Investec on a daily basis. If tax credits are lost in the future then action 
would be taken to reduce discretionary expenditure in order to ensure 
there remained sufficient cash to support the business through  
to profitability.
Brexit
At the referendum which was held on 23 June 2016, the UK voted 
to leave the EU. The Group faces a range of risks associated with 
this decision. For example, the vote to leave the EU may lead to 
changes in the regulatory system by which medical devices and 
pharmaceutical products are approved for use. The Group’s NIOX
®
 
product is currently CE marked in accordance with European 
regulations and it is possible that this registration will need to be 
changed in some way once the UK has left the EU, to permit sales 
of the device to continue across Europe. The Group will also seek 
partners for its respiratory pipeline products in the future, and the 
optimal regulatory pathway for the approval of these products after 
Brexit cannot yet be determined.
Brexit may also result in restrictions on the movement of people which 
make it harder for the Group to attract the talent it needs to support 
the business. The general economic uncertainty created by the 
process may also make it harder to enter into strategic partnerships 
with European companies.
The announcement of Brexit also caused a significant depreciation in 
the value of sterling and may lead to further foreign exchange volatility. 
This may affect the Group as indicated in the more general risk relating 
to Financial Operations set out above.
Mitigating activities
The Group continues to monitor developments relating to Brexit and 
receives updates from its legal and regulatory advisers on a frequent 
basis. The Group does already have established subsidiaries in 
Sweden (Circassia AB) and Germany (Circassia AG) and so will still 
have a corporate presence in the EU even after Brexit comes into 
effect. The risks relating to currency volatility are mitigated through  
the actions described above under the Financial Operations risk.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 38
CIR_AR17_front_v18.indd   38 25/04/2018   19:19 Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three year 
period to 31 December 2020, taking account of the Group’s current 
position and the potential impact of the principal risks identified. Based 
on this assessment the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities  
as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2020.
In making this statement, the Directors have considered the robustness 
of the Group, taking account of its current position, potential future 
developments, the principal risks facing it, and the effectiveness of 
mitigation plans and controls. Their assessment has encompassed  
the potential impact of significant credible scenarios on the business 
model, future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period to  
31 December 2020.
The Directors have determined that a three year period is the 
appropriate length of time over which to provide its viability statement. 
The Board first considers annually, and on a rolling basis, a detailed 
annual budget and 10 year plan for the Group and then uses the 
output from that review to inform its viability statement. For the 
purposes of the viability statement, the Board’s review is limited  
to three years given the nature of the business and uncertainty.
The Group’s annual budget was approved by the Board at its 
December 2017 meeting and the 10 year plan was reviewed  
at the same meeting.
In addition, after the year end, the Board reviewed a revised 10 year 
plan and approved the further cost containment measures as part  
of a focused investment strategy aimed at commercial expansion  
and refocusing of R&D expenditure as explained in the operating 
review. This also included the changes in the payment terms of the 
R&D AstraZeneca collaboration which have been recently negotiated.
This has been built from the bottom up and stress tested for the 
following key scenarios:
 — Reasonable delays in key product launches
 — Reasonable reductions in sales growth targets in combination  
with the above
In each case, there was sufficient headroom to ensure the solvency 
and liquidity of the Group to at least 31 December 2020. In addition, 
further mitigating actions could be taken to increase the size of the 
contingency.
This 10 year plan was reviewed by the Board and approved on  
23 April 2018. 
The Directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the  
financial statements on the going concern basis, as explained  
in the Basis of Preparation paragraph in note 1 of the consolidated 
financial statements. 
The Strategic report on pages 01 to 39 has been approved  
by the Board.

Corporate governance report
Dear Shareholders
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Circassia’s Corporate governance report for the year ended 31 December 2017 . It describes 
how the Board and its Committees apply the principles of good corporate governance set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”).
High standards of corporate governance are fundamental to our business and are implemented and supported through appropriate internal 
policies and procedures. The responsibility for ensuring this framework is effective lies with the Board, and we are constantly striving to improve 
standards while building a successful company.
One area on which the Board has focused in particular since Listing relates to its composition and it has been looking to steadily increase  
the proportion of Independent Non-Executive Directors who sit on the Board. The changes to the Board which have occurred in 2017  
and early 2018 have been consistent with this goal and with the evolution of the Company.
In the course of 2017 , two of our long-serving Non-Executive Directors, Mr Charles Swingland and Dr Tim Corn, retired from the Board. We are 
very grateful to Charles and Tim for their significant contributions over the years. In addition, Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud and Mr Marvin Samson 
have announced their intention not to stand for re-election at the 2018 Annual General Meeting. We also extend our thanks to Jean-Jacques  
and Marvin for the excellent support and guidance they have provided.
We are delighted that we have been able to appoint three new independent Non-Executive Directors: Ms Jo Le Couilliard, Ms Sharon Curran, 
and Dr Heribert Staudinger. Their skills and experience will complement those of the existing Board members and ensure the Board is well 
equipped to help the Company realise its goals.
Maintaining good communication with our Shareholders is extremely important to us. During the year, Steven Harris, our CEO has held a 
number of meetings with investors and current shareholders, and presented at several conferences which were attended by existing and 
potential Shareholders. Communications with Shareholders are coordinated by the Head of Corporate Communications, who reports directly 
to the CEO.
Dr Francesco Granata
Chairman
Corporate governance report
Statement of Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) sets out the principles of good practice in relation to corporate governance which should  
be followed by companies with a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Code is published by the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”)  
and the most recent edition (April 2016) can be found on their website (www.frc.org.uk).
The principles of the Code are divided into five sections. Each section sets out the main principles relating to Leadership; Effectiveness; 
Accountability; Remuneration; and Relations with Shareholders.
This report explains how Circassia has applied these principles. 
Until September 2016, Circassia was included in the FTSE 350. However, following the fall in its share price after the disappointing cat allergy 
results in June 2016, this was no longer the case. The Code requires that at least half the Board of FTSE 350 companies should comprise 
independent Non-Executive Directors. A smaller company, which is defined in the Code as one that is below the FTSE 350 throughout the 
year immediately prior to the reporting year, should have at least two independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Directors support high standards of corporate governance. However, as is explained below, the Company has not complied with  
the recommendations of the Code that at least half the Board should comprise independent Non-Executive Directors although it has met  
the requirement applicable to Small Cap companies.
At the beginning of 2017 , the Board consisted of ten members, the Chairman (who was independent on appointment), three Executive 
Directors, and six Non-Executive Directors. Of the six Non-Executive Directors, three were considered by the Board to be independent, namely 
Lota Zoth, Dr Jean Jacques Garaud and Marvin Samson. The independence ratio of the Board (excluding the Chairman) was therefore 33%  
at the beginning of the year, but, following the departures of Charles Swingland and Tim Corn after the Company’s Annual General Meeting  
in May 2017 , it had risen to 43%.
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud had participated in the Company’s unapproved share option scheme before the Initial Public Offering of the Company  
in 2014. However, this scheme is unrelated to performance, such participation was historic, and no further share options will be granted to him. 
For this reason, Dr Jean Jacques Garaud is considered to be independent. Dr Garaud exercised all of his options in June 2017 .
As noted earlier in this report, the Company appointed three new independent Directors to the Board on 8 February 2018. Following these 
appointments, the Board has grown to eleven members of whom six are considered to be independent. From this date, the independence 
ratio of the Board (excluding the Chairman) has therefore been 60%.
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud and Marvin Samson have indicated that they do not intend to stand for re-election at the Company’s 2018 Annual 
General Meeting. Accordingly, following this meeting, the Board will consist of nine members. These will be the Chairman (who was independent 
on appointment), three Executive Directors, and five Non-Executive Directors. Of the five Non-Executive Directors, it is anticipated that four will be 
independent, namely Lota Zoth, Jo Le Couilliard, Sharon Curran, and Dr Heribert Staudinger. The independence ratio of the Board (excluding the 
Chairman) will therefore be 50% and the Board will meet the requirement that a FTSE Small Cap company should have at least two independent 
Non-Executive Directors (which it is expected will be the applicable requirement for the reporting year 2018).
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 42
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   42 25/04/2018   18:36 The Board believes that at this point in the Group’s development it is important that it has access to the expertise and knowledge  
of its remaining non-independent Non-Executive Director.
The composition of the three Board Committees throughout the year and the extent to which their composition complied with the provisions  
of the Code, was as follows:
Nomination Committee
 The Code requires that a majority of the members of the Committee should be Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Committee 
should be chaired by the Chairman or an Independent Non-Executive Director. Throughout the year, the Committee was composed of the 
following members:
 — From 1 January 2017 until 26 May 2017 the Committee was comprised of Dr Francesco Granata (Chairman and Chair of the Committee); 
Dr Tim Corn, and Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud. As Dr Jean Jacques Garaud was the only Independent Non-Executive Director, a majority of 
the Committee was not therefore made up of Independent Non-Executive Directors, and the composition of the Nomination Committee 
therefore did not comply with the recommendations of the Code.
 — Dr Tim Corn did not seek re-election at the 2017 Annual General Meeting, and his position on the Nomination Committee was taken by 
Marvin Samson who is an Independent Non-Executive Director. In addition, effective from 26 May 2017 , Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud resigned 
from the Committee and his position was taken by Lota Zoth, who is also independent. Therefore from 26 May 2017 up to the date of this 
report, the composition of the Nomination Committee has complied with the recommendations of the Code.
Remuneration Committee
The Code requires that the Committee should comprise a minimum of three Directors, all of whom should be independent.
 — For the period from 1 January 2017 until 26 May 2017 ,the Committee members were: Marvin Samson (Chair of the Committee); Dr Tim Corn 
and Lota Zoth. Marvin Samson and Lota Zoth are both considered to be independent. However Dr Tim Corn was not considered independent. 
Therefore, from 1 January 2017 until 26 May 2017 , the composition of the Committee did not comply with the membership requirements of the 
Code insofar as they relate to independence.
 — Dr Tim Corn did not seek re-election at the 2017 Annual General Meeting, and his position on the Remuneration Committee was taken effective 
from 26 May 2017 by Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud who is an Independent Non-Executive Director. Therefore from 26 May 2017 up to the date 
of this report, the composition of the Remuneration Committee complied with the recommendations of the Code, as they apply to FTSE 350 
companies. The Remuneration Committee also complies with the smaller company requirement that it consist of at least two independent  
Non-Executive Directors which has applied to the Company since 1 January 2018.
Audit and Risk Committee
 The Code requires that the Committee should comprise a minimum of three Directors, all of whom should be independent. 
 — For the period from 1 January 2017 up to 26 May 2017 , the Committee was made up of three members: Ms Lota Zoth (Chair of the 
Committee); Dr Tim Corn; and Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud. Lota Zoth and Dr Jean Jacques Garaud are considered independent, however 
Dr Tim Corn was not considered independent. Therefore, from 1 January 2017 until 26 May 2017 , the membership of the Audit and Risk 
Committee did not comply with the membership requirements of the Code insofar as they relate to independence.
 — Dr Tim Corn did not seek re-election at the 2017 Annual General Meeting, and his position on the Audit and Risk Committee was taken 
effective from 26 May by Marvin Samson who is an Independent Non-Executive Director. Therefore the Audit and Risk Committee has been 
fully compliant with the recommendations of the Code, as they apply to FTSE 350 companies, from 26 May 2017 up to the date of this report. 
The Audit and Risk Committee also complies with the smaller company requirement (relevant in 2018) that it consist of at least two independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
 The Board confirms that in all other respects, the Group has fully complied with the principles of the Code throughout the year to 31 December 2017 
and up to the date of this report. Details of Directors’ remuneration, as required by the Code and Part 4 to Schedule 8 of the Large- and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, are set out in the Remuneration Committee report.
 The Group’s Auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , is required to review whether this Corporate governance statement properly reflects the 
Group’s compliance with certain provisions of the Code and to report any non-compliance. The Group confirms that no report of non-compliance 
has been made other than in respect of the matters identified above in relation to Board composition.

Leadership
The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the leadership and long-term success of the business. It has a schedule of matters which are reserved for its review. 
These include the review and approval of strategic plans, financial statements and budgets, financing, acquisitions and disposals, major capital 
expenditure, dividend policy, making key risk decisions, monitoring risks and compliance, monitoring health, safety and environmental performance, 
and Executive remuneration and appointments.
At each meeting, the Board assesses the progress of the Group when measured against its objectives, particularly those which relate  
to its commercial performance, and reviews financial performance against the budget.
Roles and responsibilities
The Board is currently composed of the Chairman, three Executive Directors, and seven Non-Executive Directors. The biographies of the current 
members of the Board are set out on pages 40 to 41 of this report.
The Executive Directors have direct responsibility for the business operations of the Company. The Non-Executive Directors, by virtue  
of their wide range of industry experience and skills, bring an informed view to the decision making process.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are clearly delineated. This division of responsibilities has been set out in writing  
and approved by the Board.
Chairman
Dr Francesco Granata, Chairman, is responsible for the leadership of the Board and its effectiveness by ensuring that:
 — the agenda for meetings is appropriate, and the Board is provided with the information it needs for high quality decision making in a timely 
fashion;
 — the Board plays a full and constructive role in shaping the strategy of the Group;
 — the Board environment is productive and utilises the skills and experience of all members;
 — the Board complies with the appropriate standards of corporate governance;
 — the Committees are properly structured and resourced;
 — the performance of the Board, its Committees, and individual Directors are evaluated each year; and
 — there is effective communication with Shareholders.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met in the absence of the Executive Directors at the end of each Board meeting which 
occurred in 2017 .
Chief Executive Officer
Steven Harris, Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the day to day management of the Group and for implementing the strategy which  
has been reviewed and approved by the Board. He is also responsible for ensuring effective communication with Shareholders, brokers,  
and analysts.
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud has been Senior Independent Non-Executive Director since 21 February 2014. He works closely with the Chairman 
to resolve any significant issues which may arise and is responsible for the annual evaluation of the Chairman’s performance, for leading  
the other Non-Executive Directors in their oversight of the Chairman, and for ensuring there is a clear division of responsibilities between  
the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. He is available to communicate directly with Shareholders if they have concerns which cannot 
be resolved through the normal channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, or Chief Financial Officer.
Non-Executive Directors
The role of the Non-Executive Directors, and of the Committees of which they are members, is to scrutinise the performance of management, 
satisfy themselves that the financial and risk control mechanisms are robust, and determine appropriate levels of Executive pay. They have 
wide ranging experience of industry and bring their judgement to bear in the decision making process of the Board.
Their seniority and range of skills ensure that no one individual can dominate this process.
Board Committees
The Board has three Committees: the Audit and Risk Committee; the Nomination Committee; and the Remuneration Committee, to which 
it delegates specific responsibilities. The reports of these Committees and details of their composition form part of the Corporate  
governance report.
Each Committee has full terms of reference which have been approved by the Board and also appear on the website at www.circassia.com. 
These terms of reference are reviewed annually. The Board provides the Committees with sufficient resources, including access to external 
advisers, as may be required in order to fulfil their roles.

Effectiveness
Independence
The Board reviews the independence of its Non-Executive Directors each year. For the period 1 January 2017 to 26 May 2017 , excluding  
the Chairman, three of the nine Board members were Non-Executive Directors who were considered by the Board to be independent.
For the period from 26 May 2017 to 31 December 2017 , excluding the Chairman, three out of seven Board members were considered  
to be Independent Non-Executive Directors.
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud had participated in the Company’s unapproved share option scheme before the Initial Public Offering of the Company  
in 2014. However, this scheme is unrelated to performance, such participation was historic, and no further share options will be granted. Dr Garaud 
exercised these options in May 2017 and no longer holds any options over shares in the Company. The Board has therefore determined that it 
regards Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud as an Independent Non-Executive Director within the meaning of “independent” as defined in the Code for the 
period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 .
The Board also carefully reviews any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may arise due to the commercial interests of Non-Executive 
Directors and they are required to make a declaration in respect of any such situations. The Board can confirm that no new conflicts of interest 
arose in the year.
Russ Cummings was an employee of Touchstone Innovations plc which is a shareholder and was therefore not considered independent 
during 2017 . In addition, he has served on the Board for more than nine years, and so is not considered independent due to length of service. 
Charles Swingland was not considered independent as he previously served as an Executive Director, General Counsel, and Company 
Secretary of the Company. Dr Tim Corn was not considered to be independent as he had served as a Director of the Company for more  
than nine years.
It is confirmed that none of the Independent Non-Executive Directors have served for a period of more than nine years. The Board further confirms  
that Dr Francesco Granata was independent upon his appointment.
Appointments to the Board
The procedure for appointment of new Directors to the Board is formal, rigorous and transparent. The process is led by the Nomination 
Committee which comprises the Chairman and Independent Non-Executive Directors. Shortlisted candidates are interviewed by members  
of the Committee before a recommendation is made to the Board.
Diversity
The Board recognises the value of diversity at all levels of the Group. The Group has an Equal Treatment, Equal Opportunities and Diversity 
policy which extends to the Board.
Induction and training
Upon appointment, each Director receives a comprehensive induction package which includes written materials relevant to their 
responsibilities. In addition, meetings are organised with other Board members and with members of the Company’s management team.
All Directors have direct access to the advice of the Company Secretary. Whenever it is considered necessary, the Company Secretary  
can arrange the appointment of professional advisers at the Group’s expense to assist Board members in their roles.
Directors receive frequent updates on commercial developments affecting the business as well as regulatory and legislative changes.  
Directors are invited, during the annual evaluation procedure, to identify any training which they feel might benefit them.
Information
In advance of each Board Meeting, Directors receive a full agenda and a comprehensive set of papers which include commercial and 
functional reports. A procedure is in place to ensure that these materials are delivered to the Board in a timely fashion. Senior employees  
of the business regularly attend meetings in order to enhance the Non-Executive Directors’ understanding of current issues and give them  
the opportunity to ask detailed questions.
Commitment
The Board is satisfied that the other commitments of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors – which are set out in their biographies – leave 
them with sufficient time to diligently perform their role for the Group.
Performance evaluation
Formal Board evaluations are carried out once a year, and informal evaluations are carried out on a continuing basis throughout the year. 
The formal evaluation commences with the circulation of a written questionnaire which is prepared by the Company Secretary. This invites 
Directors to rate and comment on the performance of the Board in a number of areas, including the conduct of Board meetings; the standard 
and timeliness of information; the balance of skills of the members of the Board; the roles and responsibilities of individual Directors; and 
compliance with good corporate governance practices. A detailed, anonymised analysis of these responses is then prepared by the Company 
Secretary and reviewed and discussed by the Board who then debate the responses and agree upon the actions required.
The Board subjects itself to an external review every third year. An external review was performed in 2016. Accordingly, the Board did not carry 
out an external review in 2017 .
Re-election
All Directors have service contracts which are capable of termination on giving a fixed period of notice. In the case of the Executive Directors 
this notice period is twelve months and in the case of the Non-Executive Directors and Chairman it is three months. All Directors are subject  
to re-election by Shareholders on an annual basis.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 46
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   46 25/04/2018   18:36 Accountability
The Board acknowledges its duty to present a fair, balanced and understandable view of the Group’s position and prospects. A description  
of the Group’s business model is contained in the Strategic report. The Statement of Directors’ responsibilities sets out information regarding 
the Directors’ responsibility to prepare financial statements. The Independent Auditors’ report includes a statement by the Auditor on its 
reporting responsibilities.
The role of the Audit and Risk Committee is set out in detail in the Audit and Risk Committee report.
The Board is responsible for determining the significant risks which the Group is prepared to take in order to attain its strategic objectives,  
and keeps the risk management procedures and internal controls of the business under regular review. The Board confirms that it is satisfied 
that the current procedures and controls are sufficient to ensure compliance with the Code.
After taking advice from the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board is able to confirm that the Annual report and accounts, taken as a whole  
is fair, balanced, and understandable and provides the information necessary for Shareholders to judge the Group’s strategy, business model, 
position and performance.
Viability statement
The Company prepares a 10 year plan which was reviewed and approved by the Board at its meeting on 5 December 2017 . This was updated 
and reviewed by the Board and approved on 23 April 2018.
The plan also contains a sensitivity analysis which allows the Board to assess the potential financial impact of certain significant potential 
scenarios which might arise. This process informs the Viability Statement which the Board gives on page 39 of this report.
Risk management system
A description of the risk management system is set out in the Strategic report. The system is designed to manage risks, not to eliminate  
them completely, and can only provide a reasonable degree of assurance against material misstatement or loss. Inherent in the concept  
of reasonable assurance is the recognition that the cost of a control procedure should not exceed its anticipated benefits. The principal risks 
facing the Group are set out in the Strategic report.
The Board confirms that it has conducted a review of the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls and has found them to be effective.
Internal controls
The Audit and Risk Committee reviews the Group’s financial controls on an annual basis and makes recommendations to the Board  
where improvements are required. The efficacy of control systems are reviewed by the full Board as required by the FRC Guidance  
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting.
The Group’s primary risk control systems are as follows:
Management structure
 — There is a management structure with clear lines of responsibility and accountability. Employees are recruited when they have  
the appropriate skills and experience to perform their intended roles.
 — The Board sets the overall strategy and reviews the performance of the Group.
 — The Group’s Senior Management Team, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for day to day operations.
 — Other team members comprise the Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President R&D, Senior Vice President US Commercial,  
Senior Vice President EU/RoW Commercial, Vice President Human Resources, and General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer.  
This team meets weekly.
Written policies and procedures
 — There are documented quality procedures which ensure regulatory compliance. Regular reviews take place to ensure standards are 
maintained and the Company is fully prepared for a regulatory inspection. The Quality Assurance team monitor internal and external 
(Contract Research Organisation and Contract Manufacturing Organisation) compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice, Good Clinical 
Practice, and Good Laboratory Practice and organise training for employees.
 — The Compliance function maintains policies and delivers training which relate to healthcare compliance, including but not limited to the 
Group’s Whistleblowing policy (which enables employees to communicate concerns regarding improper activity to a trusted individual 
who is not their line manager or a member of the senior management team), the Group’s Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption policy, 
and the Group’s privacy and data protection policies. Since the Group has commenced promotion of Tudorza in the United States a 
number of policies specifically related to this promotional activity have been implemented and appropriate training delivered to the sales 
representatives. The Compliance function also works with Human Resources to curate the Group’s Code of Conduct. This is updated  
on an annual basis and training delivered. The Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, meets on  
a quarterly basis.
 — Promotional materials relating to the Group’s products are reviewed by a Promotional Review Committee and non-promotional materials  
(for example material used by the Medical Affairs team) are reviewed by a Non Promotional Review Committee. Requests for research 
grants and support for investigator initiated studies are channeled through a Grants Committee.
 — There are controls in place which determine how financial information is validated, consolidated and reviewed.
 — There are specific controls on expenditure. Material investments or capital expenditure must be approved by the Board. Normal expenditure 
is controlled by setting limits which are determined by the CEO and CFO within a general framework approved by the Board.
 — Detailed management accounts are prepared on a monthly basis and reviewed by the Senior Management Team. Accompanying reports 
will explain any variances between these results and the budget.

Corporate governance report continued
 — The R&D Committee meets on a weekly basis to review performance of the various clinical trials and implement action plans  
to prevent delays.
 — The Patents Committee meets regularly to assess the scope of protection provided by pending and granted patents, organise  
the defence of granted patents, and plan new filings where appropriate. This group also manages registered trade marks.
 — There are physical and electronic procedures in place to ensure the security and integrity of data and confidential information.
 — An established policy exists for share dealing by employees or connected persons. This was revised in June 2016 to reflect the coming  
into force of the Market Abuse Regime in the UK. The format and keeping of insider lists has also been reviewed in the light of MAR.
 — The Health and Safety Policy is maintained and reviewed by the Health and Safety Committee.
 — There is a Disclosure Committee, as required by the Market Abuse Directive, comprising the Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel,  
and the Head of Corporate Communications. Under the direction of this Committee an Insider List is maintained recording employees  
and external parties who may have access to inside information. Individuals are notified of their addition to and removal from the list  
and are appraised of their responsibilities.
No failure of controls or breach of internal policies was recorded during the year to 31 December 2017 and up to the date of this report.
Remuneration
The Board adopted a remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM. As the remuneration policy should be approved by 
shareholders every 3 years, the policy has been updated and will be presented for approval at the 2018 AGM. The Board believes the revised 
policy is sufficient to attract, retain, and motivate Directors of the quality required to run the Group successfully, but which does not result in 
payment of more than is necessary for this purpose. A significant proportion of Executive Directors’ pay is linked to corporate and individual 
performance. Full details of the policy are set out in the Remuneration Committee report.
Relations with Shareholders
Dialogue with Shareholders
The Board maintains regular communication with Shareholders. Meetings between material Shareholders and the Executive Directors take 
place throughout the year. The Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and other Directors are available to meet with major 
Shareholders on request.
All meetings with Shareholders are held in a manner which ensures price sensitive information which has not been made available  
to Shareholders generally, is protected from disclosure.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer give annual and six-monthly presentations to institutional investors, analysts, and the 
media. These presentations are available on the website. Annual and Interim reports and all press releases are also published on the website 
as are the terms of reference of the three Board committees. Paper copies of the report and accounts are mailed to those Shareholders who 
have elected to receive them in hard copy.
The Directors receive a report from the Corporate Communications department at each Board Meeting giving information on material changes 
in shareholdings and collating feedback from the Company’s brokers and investors.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM provides an opportunity for all Shareholders to meet Board members and have the opportunity to ask about the proposed 
resolutions and the business in general.
Notice of the AGM is posted to Shareholders not less than 21 clear days prior to the date of the AGM and is also available to Shareholders  
on the website at www.circassia.com. The letter accompanying the Notice will include details of the proposed resolutions and an explanation 
of their content.
At the AGM the number of proxy votes cast for, against, or abstaining from each resolution will be disclosed. Results of voting are announced 
to the market and posted on the website as soon as possible after the AGM.
The Group does not currently consider it appropriate to introduce mandatory poll voting on all resolutions put to the Shareholders but will keep 
this position under review.

Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present Circassia’s Audit and Risk Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2017 .
The Audit and Risk Committee is the key independent oversight Committee at Circassia. It monitors and reviews the effectiveness  
of the Group’s risk management framework and internal controls.
This report sets out how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities under the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”).  
It also contains a summary of the activities of the Committee throughout the year.
Lota S Zoth
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee
24 April 2018
Responsibilities
The Committee has responsibility for monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group, and for reviewing the effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal control systems and risk management systems, including reviewing its risk profile.
Accordingly, the Committee performs a review of the interim and annual financial statements, considering whether the accounting policies 
have been applied properly and consistently and whether the disclosures made in the Annual report and accounts are compliant with financial 
reporting standards, and with corporate governance and regulatory requirements.
The Committee also manages the relationship with the external Auditors on behalf of the Board. It monitors the independence of the Auditor 
and reviews the effectiveness of the audit procedure. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board regarding the appointment of the 
external Auditors and reviews their terms of engagement. The Committee has access to the services of the external Auditors and, if necessary, 
may appoint external accounting and legal advisers to assist it with its work.
The Group markets approved medical devices to healthcare professionals in a number of markets around the world and following the 
commencement of the collaboration with AstraZeneca to market Tudorza
®
, the Group also promotes an approved drug in the United States. 
Compliance with healthcare laws and regulations has therefore become and will continue to be a key risk area for the business. The Chief 
Compliance Officer has a direct reporting line to the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and provides updates in this area to her.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s website. They cover issues such as membership and the  
frequency of meetings, together with requirements for a quorum and the right to attend meetings. The duties of the Committee as set  
out in the terms of reference include financial and regulatory reporting; internal controls; internal audit; external audit; risk management;  
and reporting responsibilities.
Membership
The names of the members of the Audit and Risk Committee, their dates of appointment, and the number of meetings attended during  
the year are set out in the table below:

Audit and Risk Committee report
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 49
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   49 25/04/2018   18:36 The Code provides that all members of the Audit and Risk Committee should be Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers 
that Lota Zoth and Jean-Jacques Garaud are independent. However as Tim Corn was not independent, the recommendation of the Code has 
not been met for the period from 1 January 2017 to 26 May 2017 . However, following the appointment of Marvin Samson on 26 May 2017 , this 
requirement has been satisfied.
Ms Zoth has significant recent and relevant financial experience. She is the Board Chair at Aeras. She is a Non-Executive Director, Compensation 
Committee Member and the Audit Committee Chair at NewLink Genetics Corporation, Orexigen Therapeutics and Zymeworks. She is also  
a Non-Executive Director and the Audit Committee Chair at Spark Therapeutics. She was also Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  
at MedImmune, LLC from 2004 to 2007 .
The Company Secretary acts as the Secretary to the Committee. The CEO attends Committee meetings at the invitation of the Chair.  
The Chair of the Committee meets with the external Auditors at least once a year in the absence of management.
A summary of the matters considered by the Committee since the last financial statements is shown in the table below and explained  
in further detail in the subsequent text:

CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   50 25/04/2018   18:36 Accounting for the Collaboration with AstraZeneca
Following the collaboration and profit share arrangement with AstraZeneca, a Purchase Price Allocation exercise was performed focusing  
on the following key accounting areas:
 — Determination and allocation of the consideration 
Under the terms of the agreement to secure certain US commercial rights to Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
, a maximum total consideration  
of $230 million plus future sales-based royalties is payable to AstraZeneca. For the purposes of IFRS 3, the total consideration included  
in the valuation consists of $50 million for shares issued to AstraZeneca, $100 million deferred non-contingent consideration and the fair 
value of royalties payable to AstraZeneca. It does not include the amount (up to $80 million) that would be paid to exercise the Tudorza
®
 
option, which will be accounted for once exercised. The allocation of consideration between both products was based on a relative fair 
value approach. This was determined using a bottom-up business valuation for both products and allocating the amount expected  
to be paid for both products proportionately between both products.
 — Initial valuation and subsequent measurement of Duaklir IPR&D 
The Excess Earnings Method approach was determined to be the most appropriate methodology to use for the valuation of the In-Process 
Research & Development (IPR&D). The IPR&D asset was valued at $41.6 million with a remaining useful life of 17 years from the commercial 
launch date of Duaklir
®
. At 31 December 2017 , management performed an impairment review of the IPR&D, using a Net Present Value 
(NPV) methodology and concluded there was sufficient headroom in the AstraZeneca cash generating unit to not warrant an impairment.
 — Initial valuation and subsequent measurement of Royalties 
As part of the transaction, Circassia will pay royalties to AstraZeneca on future sales of Duaklir
®
 in the United States. Under IFRS 3, these 
royalties have been classified as additional consideration and initially recognised as an IPR&D asset with a corresponding contingent 
liability. The IPR&D is subsequently amortised over its remaining useful economic life, and the contingent liability is revalued at the end of 
each period with gains/losses recognised through the profit and loss. The value of the IPR&D asset was calculated by management using 
a tax-effected NPV of the the future royalty cash outflows at the date of the transaction and at 31 December 2017 . An IPR&D asset and 
corresponding contingent liability of $49.7 million was recognised on the balance sheet at the date of acquisition. At 31 December 2017  
the contingent liability was revalued at $45.3 million due to a reduction in the cash flows used in the NPV model.
Goodwill and intangibles impairment assessment
In line with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the carrying value of each cash generating unit (CGU) including the allocated goodwill was tested for 
impairment. Impairment assessments were performed on each CGU (NIOX
®
, Respiratory and AstraZeneca) and Management concluded no 
impairment to be required after comparing the carrying values of each CGU to their individual value in use calculation. In addition Management 
performed an impairment analysis at each identifiable individual intangible asset level. Impairment triggers were identified relating to three 
intangible assets and impairment charges were recognised on each. See note 16 for further details.
Going concern and cash flow
Following review of Group cash flows over a three year period to 31 December 2020, taking account of the Group’s current position and  
the potential impact of the principal risks identified earlier in this report the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be  
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2020.
In making this statement, the Directors have considered the robustness of the Group, taking account of its current position, potential future 
developments, the principal risks facing it, and the effectiveness of mitigation plans and controls. Their assessment has encompassed the 
potential impact of significant credible scenarios on the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period to 31 
December 2020.
The Directors have determined that a three year period is the appropriate length of time over which to provide its viability statement. The Board 
first considers annually, and on a rolling basis, a detailed annual budget and 10 year plan for the Group and then uses the output from that 
review to inform its viability statement. For the purposes of the viability statement, the Board’s review is limited to three years given the nature  
of the business and uncertainty.
The Group’s annual budget was approved by the Board at its December 2017 meeting and the 10 year plan was reviewed at the same meeting.
In addition, after the year end, the Board reviewed a revised 10 year plan and approved the further cost containment measures as part  
of a focused investment strategy aimed at commercial expansion and refocusing of R&D expenditure as explained in the operating review.  
This also included the changes in the payment terms of the R&D AstraZeneca collaboration which have been recently negotiated.
This has been built from the bottom up and stress tested for the following key scenarios:
 — Reasonable delays in key product launches
 — Reasonable reductions in sales growth targets in combination with the above
In each case, there was sufficient headroom to ensure the solvency and liquidity of the Group to at least 31 December 2020. In addition, 
further mitigating actions could be taken to increase the size of the contingency.
This 10 year plan was reviewed by the Board and approved on 23 April 2018.
As part of this review, the Board considered the implications of the Company’s collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca which includes 
terms for the payment of deferred consideration of $100 million which will fall due by 30 June 2019 at the latest. In the event that the Group  
is unable to raise sufficient funding to meet this obligation, a vendor loan has been agreed with AstraZeneca to borrow up to $180 million.
The Directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, as explained in the Basis  
of Preparation paragraph in note 1 to the accounts.

Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the review of the Group’s risk management framework and the level of risk which is acceptable  
in order to achieve its strategic objectives. The Committee, on behalf of the Board, undertakes the detailed monitoring of the risk management 
framework and system of internal controls and reports to the Board on their suitability and efficacy annually.
In order to discharge its duties in this respect, the Committee receives and reviews reports from the Group’s management team.
The Committee continues to assess what is an acceptable level of risk in key areas, and the best strategy for mitigating those risks given  
the cost and time constraints which exist.
During the year, as is required by the Code, the Committee performed a detailed assessment of the principal risks faced by the Group and 
how these are managed and mitigated. An annual review of the effectiveness of the Group’s monitoring and review systems was carried out  
at the December Committee meeting. In 2016, the Board had asked the management team to carry out a review of the operations of the 
Group’s representative office in China. This resulted in a report, prepared with the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Beijing office which 
was provided to the Board late in 2016. One of the recommendations of the report was that there be a follow up audit in 2017 , and this was 
duly carried out, and the results passed on to the Committee in December 2017 .
Whistleblowing
A confidential whistleblowing procedure exists to enable employees to raise concerns regarding possible improprieties in relation to financial 
or other matters. This procedure has been communicated to all staff. Reports can be made through an online tool or a telephone helpline 
operated by a third party provider. The Committee has reviewed these arrangements and is satisfied that the current procedure allows for 
proportionate and independent investigation of such disclosures, and for appropriate follow up actions to be taken. In accordance with the 
current policy, concerned employees may raise matters directly with the Compliance team or directly with the Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee.
Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
The Group has an anti-corruption and anti-bribery policy which has been communicated to all staff. This policy ensures full compliance with  
the UK Bribery Act 2010, the US Foreign Corruption Practices Act and other major anti-corruption legislation. The policy extends to carrying  
out due diligence on new key business partners who are judged to be acting on behalf of the Group in high risk areas.
Internal audit
This year the Committee considered again whether there is a need for an internal audit function and concluded that, given the scale of 
operations at this time, it is not currently necessary. The Board accepted this recommendation. This decision will be kept under review.
External audit
The Group’s external Auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), is engaged to express its opinion on the Group’s financial statements.
Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the external audit process is reviewed annually by the Committee. This review encompasses an examination  
of the independence, qualifications, capabilities, and remuneration of the Auditor. If issues are identified which may affect the effectiveness  
of the process then actions will be agreed. No such issues were identified in the year to 31 December 2017 or up to the date of this report.
At the end of the audit for the year ended 31 December 2017 the Committee formally evaluated the performance of PwC (who had been 
reappointed as auditors following a tender carried out in 2016).
To conduct this evaluation the Committee completed a questionnaire to assess robustness of the audit process, quality of its delivery, quality  
of reporting, and quality of the individuals and service. Moreover, the Committee takes into account the quality of its interactions with the 
Auditor in forming a view on their effectiveness.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 52
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   52 25/04/2018   18:36 Independence
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external Auditor. Each year the external Auditor confirms  
its policies for ensuring its independence and provides the Committee with written confirmation that they continue to be independent.
The Committee pays careful regard to whether non-audit work is carried out by the Auditor so as to ensure that the provision of such additional 
services does not impair its independence or objectivity.
A formal process exists for approving the use of the Auditor for non- audit work. The Auditor should not be appointed to provide non-audit 
services which might put the Auditor in the position of auditing its own work or create a mutual interest between the Group and the Auditor  
or result in the Auditor acting as an advocate, manager, or employee of the Group.
PwC undertook non-audit services for the Group in the course of the year to 31 December 2017 which are summarised in the table below. 
These services were provided in compliance with the policy outlined above and no conflicts of interest were considered to have arisen.

Yes Reporting accountant (corporate finance services) 173
No Other assurance services 18
The total fees paid to the Auditor are shown in note 9 of the financial statements. Services were provided during the year in connection with 
corporate advisory services and other assurance services. The Committee believes that the use of PwC for this work was appropriate in the 
circumstances and that independence was preserved as the nature of the non-audit services was such that the external Auditor was best placed 
to perform this work due to their skills and experience, and the fees paid were insignificant in the context of the overall revenues earned by PwC.
Corporate advisory fees related to services provided in connection with the preparation of the Prospectus required for the transaction which 
was completed with AstraZeneca. Other assurance services related mainly to the fees for the follow up review of the operations of the Group’s 
representative office in China.
In summary, the Committee confirms that the Group has received an independent audit service in the year to 31 December 2017 and up  
to the date of this report.
Audit partner rotation
PwC adheres to a rotation policy which complies with the ethical standards of the Audit Practices Board (the “APB”) and the audit partner  
is rotated every five years. Simon Ormiston, the current audit partner was appointed for the year ended 31 December 2014 and is not due  
for rotation until completion of the year ending 31 December 2018.
Tendering
PwC has been the Company’s Auditor since the year ended 31 December 2007 . The Committee is actively monitoring developments  
arising from the EU audit reform framework and the Competition and Markets Authority . In view of those developments, the Committee 
conducted an audit tender process during the course of 2016 and recommended PwC for re-appointment by shareholders at the 2017  
Annual General Meeting.
The Company has complied during the financial year under review and up to the date of this report with the provisions of the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) 
Order 2014.
Committee evaluation
An internal review of the effectiveness of the Committee was carried out in December 2017 as part of the process of evaluating Board 
effectiveness. The findings of the evaluation were debated by the Board and a list of actions agreed.

Nomination Committee report
Nomination Committee report 
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Circassia’s Nomination Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2017 . The key 
objective of the Committee is to ensure the Board is made up of a range of individuals who together have the appropriate mixture of skills  
and experience to lead the Group.
In the course of the year, Dr Tim Corn and Mr Charles Swingland departed from the Board. Their contributions have been greatly appreciated. 
Subsequently the Board decided that it should seek to appoint additional independent Non-Executive Directors to the Board, and that search, 
which was initiated in the course of 2017 , resulted in the appointments of Ms Jo Le Couilliard, Ms Sharon Curran, and Dr Heribert Staudinger  
in February 2018.
A summary of the activities of the Committee is set out below.
Dr Francesco Granata
Chair of the Nomination Committee
24 April 2018
Responsibilities
The Committee must review the size, structure, and composition of the Board and the Committees evaluating the balance of skills, experience, 
independence, and diversity of the Board as a whole. On the basis of this evaluation it will then make recommendations to the Board on any 
appointments. As part of this process, the Committee will prepare a description of the skills, experience and other characteristics required,  
and identify through a transparent procedure, individuals who are capable of filling those roles.
The Committee also plans for the orderly succession of Directors to the Board and recommends to the Board the membership and 
chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The full terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the website.
Membership and meetings
From 1 January 2017 until 26 May 2017 , the Committee comprised Dr Tim Corn, Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud, and Dr Francesco Granata,  
the Chairman. Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud was considered by the Board to be Independent. However, Dr Tim Corn was not considered  
to be Independent. As Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud was the only Independent Non-Executive Director, the composition of the Nomination 
Committee did not comply fully with the recommendations of the Code which requires the majority of members to be independent.
Dr Tim Corn did not stand for re-election at the 2017 Annual General Meeting, and his position was taken, from 26 May 2017 , by Mr Marvin 
Samson. Also, on 26 May 2017 Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud resigned from the Committee and his position was taken up by Ms Lota Zoth.  
As both Mr Samson and Ms Zoth are independent Non-Executive Directors, the Committee did therefore comply with the Code in respect  
of its composition of independent Non-Executive Directors from 26 May 2017 onwards.
The Committee met three times during the year ended 31 December 2017 and all members except Mr Marvin Samson were present at each 
meeting. A summary of the composition and attendance of the Committee is as follows:
 
Member
 
Date of appointment
Meetings  
attended (held)
Dr Francesco Granata 21 February 2014 3 (3) 
Dr Tim Corn (resigned 26 May 2017) 21 February 2014 1 (1)
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud (resigned 26 May 2017) 21 February 2014 1 (1)
Mr Marvin Samson 26 May 2017 1 (2)
Ms Lota Zoth 26 May 2017 2 (2)
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Chief Executive Officer may attend meetings by invitation.
The Committee is empowered to obtain external professional advice to assist in the performance of its duties. However, during the year  
the Committee did not require any external services except for the the search activities which are described below.
Activities
The principal activities during the year were:
 — Review of the structure, size and composition of the Board (including skills, experience, independence, knowledge and diversity); 
 — Annual performance evaluation of the Board, its members and its Committees; 
 — Approval of the initiation of a search for new Non-Executive Directors; and
 — Proposal for appointment of new Non-Executive Directors.

Annual statement
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Circassia’s Remuneration Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2017 . This report  
will be presented for the consideration and approval of Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 30 May 2018.
This report complies with the regime set out in Part 4 to Schedule 8 of the Large- and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) (the Regulations), the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) and the Listing Rules. Accordingly, 
it consists of three parts: (i) an Annual statement which summarises the key issues and explains the business context in which the Committee’s 
main decisions were taken; (ii) an unaudited Directors’ remuneration policy report which will be put to a binding Shareholder vote at the AGM on 30 
May 2018; and (iii) the Annual report on remuneration which sets out details of and rationale for the remuneration provided to the Group’s Directors 
during the 2017 financial year. This latter report is subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
Remuneration policy
The existing remuneration policy which was first approved by Shareholders at the 2015 AGM, promotes the long-term sustainable success 
of the Group. It aims to reward Executive Directors for performance, and for delivery of Shareholder value judged against transparent and 
demanding criteria. As part of this policy a significant proportion of potential remuneration is linked to the achievement of corporate and 
individual performance indicators.
The annual bonus plan for Executive Directors and management at Senior Vice President level includes an element being deferred into shares 
for three years and subject to forfeiture.
Share incentive arrangements have been in effect since 2014 and are intended to closely align the interests of the Executive Directors 
with those of Shareholders. The earliest date of vesting under these schemes falls three years after grant subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions. Details of the awards made under these schemes to the Executive Directors are set out in the Annual report on 
remuneration. In addition, the Company operates shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors and Senior Vice Presidents to further increase 
alignment with Shareholders.
The Committee believes that the emphasis on performance-related pay, the use of bonus deferral, annual long-term incentive awards and mandatory 
share ownership guidelines, creates a clear focus on sustainable performance, avoids paying more than is necessary and maintains an ongoing 
alignment between Executive Directors and Shareholders.
Performance and reward
The bonus arrangements for 2017 provided for an award of up to 100% of salary linked to the achievement of annual developmental and operational 
goals. As described in the Strategic report, the Group established a transformational commercial collaboration with AstraZeneca in the United States 
and made significant progress in developing its NIOX business and building its commercial infrastructure. In spite of achievement of a number of the 
Corporate Objectives set by the Board in excess of 75%, the Executive Directors and the Board considered it appropriate to limit their bonuses to 75% 
to align with bonus payments to employees.
The Performance Share Plan awards made throughout 2015 have vested in relation to performance ending in 2017 . The criteria are set  
out on page 70.
Application of policy for 2018
The proposed new Remuneration policy set out in this report will be subject to a binding vote by Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting  
on 30 May 2018 and, if approved, will be applied with effect from 1 January 2018.
The salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2018 and increased in line with increases to the general 
workforce of 3%. The annual fee for the Chairman, Dr Francesco Granata, will increase from £138,400 to £142,550.
We welcome Shareholder feedback on these matters and hope that you will be able to support our policy and its application  
at the forthcoming AGM.

Directors’ remuneration policy report (DRP)
Directors’ remuneration policy report (DRP) 
The proposed policy will be presented at the AGM on 30 May 2018 for a binding Shareholder vote and will be expected to remain in force  
until the AGM in 2021. The bar charts on page 63 have, however, been updated to reflect possible scenarios for remuneration in 2018.  
The key policy changes proposed are as follows:
 — Introduction of holding period requirement of two years for Executive Directors following exercise of PSP options
 — Increase minimum holding of shares in the company for Executive Directors to 200%
Each of the changes has been introduced in line with best practice. 
In addition, the contractual arrangements have been reviewed to ensure that these are in-line with current market and best practice. In doing so 
we have aligned the notice periods with our policy on future service contracts. This includes an increase in the notice period from 6 to 12 months 
and the introduction of the ability to make phased payments on termination. The change in notice period for the Executive Directors helps ensure 
business continuity by allowing time for search and recruitment of replacements. 
Remuneration philosophy
The potential levels of remuneration have been set so that they are competitive against those comparator companies with which the Group  
will compete for talented individuals.
The Committee’s goal is to design and implement a remuneration policy which will support and reward Executive Directors for delivering the 
Group’s strategic objectives and ultimately create value for Shareholders, whilst adhering to good corporate governance and reflecting best 
practice. To achieve this, the balance of remuneration is focused on variable performance-related pay. In particular, to reflect the long-term nature 
of the Group’s development pipeline, variable pay is more heavily weighted towards long-term sustainable value creation through the use of 
share incentive plans. When combined with deferral of bonuses in shares, share ownership guidelines and holding periods following the vesting 
of awards, this creates an alignment between Executive Directors and Shareholders with a longer-term view.
The Committee annually reviews the operation of the variable incentive plans to ensure they are operating within an acceptable risk profile  
and that they do not inadvertently encourage any economic, social or governance issues.
Remuneration policy
The total remuneration for each Executive Director is made up of the following elements:
 — Salary;
 — Benefits;
 — Annual bonus;
 — Long-term incentive awards; and
 — Pension.
Recovery and withholding provisions will apply to the bonus and long- term incentive arrangements in specific circumstances as determined 
appropriate by the Remuneration Committee.

CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   56 25/04/2018   18:36 Salary Benefits Annual bonus
Purpose and link to strategy
Provides fixed remuneration in line with 
market rates that reflects the responsibilities 
of the role undertaken and the experience  
of the individual.
Purpose and link to strategy
Provides market competitive, yet  
cost-effective employment benefits.
Purpose and link to strategy
To incentivise and recognise execution of  
the business strategy and personal 
objectives on an annual basis.
Operation
Set at an approximately mid-market level 
and reviewed annually taking into account 
individual responsibilities, performance, 
inflation, and market rates. The Committee 
will also consider the pay and employment 
conditions in the wider workforce when 
determining Executive Directors’ salaries. 
Salary increases are normally effective from  
1 January each year.
Salaries are periodically benchmarked 
against a relevant peer group of UK listed 
companies with similar market capitalisation 
and operations.
Operation
For Executive Directors this includes private 
medical insurance and life insurance.
Other employment benefits may be provided 
from time to time on similar terms as those  
of other employees.
If the Company introduces an all-employee 
share plan, Executive Directors will be eligible 
to participate on the same terms as other 
employees.
If an Executive Director is based outside  
the UK additional benefits and assistance 
with relocation may be provided which  
reflect local market norms or legislation.
Operation
Annual bonus performance targets are set 
at the start of the year by the Board and 
performance against objectives is assessed 
by the Remuneration Committee.
Bonuses will be paid as a mix of cash and 
deferred shares. Until the share ownership 
guidelines are reached, the bonus will be 
payable as 50% cash and 50% shares.
Thereafter, the bonus will be payable  
as 75% cash and 25% shares.
Bonus shares are deferred for three years 
from the date of the award and are subject  
to forfeiture.
Recovery and withholding provisions will 
apply in the event of misstatement of results, 
error in performance calculation or gross 
misconduct.
A dividend equivalent, if payable, will be 
payable in cash when the shares vest.
Maximum potential value
The current base salaries are set out  
in the implementation of policy section  
of the Annual report on remuneration.
There is no formal maximum limit, but 
increases are generally in line with those  
of the wider workforce.
Larger increases may be permitted to reflect 
a change in responsibilities or a significant 
increase in the scale or complexity of the role.
Maximum potential value
There is no formal maximum limit as the value 
of insured benefits will vary from year to year 
based on the cost from third-party providers.
Maximum potential value
The maximum payable for all Executive 
Directors is 100% of salary.
Performance metrics
The overall performance of the individual  
and Company is a key determinant for  
salary increases.
Performance metrics
None.
Performance metrics
Research and development, business 
development, financial and operational 
targets are set at the start of the year by the 
Board. The weighting for each performance 
measure is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee and may vary for each Executive 
Director according to their role and reflecting 
their objectives for the year.
Details of the performance measures for the 
current year are provided in the Annual report 
on remuneration.

objectives and sustained superior Shareholder value creation.
Purpose and link to strategy
To provide a competitive and cost-effective level  
of retirement provision.
Operation
Conditional awards or options from the Performance Share Plan  
are granted annually. The awards vest provided certain performance 
conditions, which have been approved by the Board, are achieved 
over a period of at least three years.
Performance targets are set at the start of each performance  
period. Recovery and withholding provisions apply for reasons  
of misstatement of results, error in performance calculation  
or gross misconduct.
Operation
Executive Directors are eligible to join a defined contribution  
pension scheme.
Alternatively a cash supplement (or a combination of contribution  
and cash) can be made.
Maximum potential value
Annual awards of up to the following percentage each  
year are granted to Executive Directors:
 — Chief Executive Officer, 150% of salary
 — Other Executive Directors, 125% of salary
In special circumstances (such as a recruitment) an award  
of up to 300% of salary is permitted.
Dividend equivalents may be payable on vested awards.
Maximum potential value
The maximum contribution, cash supplement (or combination 
thereof) payable by the Company is 15% of salary.
Performance metrics
Awards are currently subject to a combination of relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) and clinical progression timelines  
for Executive Directors.
No more than 25% of the maximum award will vest for achieving  
the threshold performance level.
The weighting of these performance measures, the choice of 
comparators for relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and / or 
the inclusion of additional performance measures will be reviewed 
annually by the Committee, reflecting the strategic objectives and 
priorities of the following three year performance period.
If the Committee determines a material change to the performance 
measures used for future awards is required to reflect a change  
in strategy, this would only be made following appropriate dialogue  
with the Company’s major Shareholders. 
Performance metrics
None.
 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 58
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   58 25/04/2018   18:36 Share ownership guidelines
Purpose and link to strategy
To align Executives with Shareholders and provide an ongoing incentive for continued performance.
Operation
Only shares which are fully owned with no outstanding vesting criteria count towards the shareholding guideline.
Executive Directors will be required to retain half of any post-tax awards which vest under long-term incentive plans, until the share  
ownership guideline has been satisfied.
Maximum potential value
Executive Directors are required to build and maintain the following minimum level of shareholding:
 — Chief Executive Officer, 150% of salary
 — Other Executive Directors, 100% of salary
Performance metrics
None.
The Committee operates the annual bonus and Performance Share Plan (PSP), in accordance with their rules, and where relevant, the Listing 
Rules. To maintain an efficient administrative process, the Committee retains the following discretions relating to remuneration:
a. the eligibility to participate in the plans;
b. the timing of grant of awards and any payments;
c. the size of awards and payments (subject to the maximum limits set out in the policy table above and the respective plan rules);
d. the determination of whether the performance conditions have been met;
e. determining a good or bad leaver under the terms of the plan;
f. dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group;
g.  adjustments required in certain capital events such as rights issues, corporate restructuring, events and special dividends; and
h. the annual review of performance conditions for the annual bonus plan and PSP .
In certain exceptional circumstances, such as a material acquisition / divestment of a Group business, which mean the original performance 
conditions are no longer appropriate, the Committee may adjust the targets, alter weightings or set different measures  
as necessary, to ensure the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Historical awards
Awards which were granted prior to the Company’s IPO are set out in the Annual report on remuneration (ARR).
These awards have vested, based on their original terms and are disclosed in the relevant ARR as required.

CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   59 25/04/2018   18:36 Remuneration committee report continued
Performance measures
The rationale behind each performance measure currently used in the Performance Share Plan and how it is calculated is as follows:
Performance measure Rationale
Relative TSR performance Recognises outperformance and delivery of relative value to Shareholders
Relative total Shareholder return is currently measured against the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment trusts  
(the ‘Index’)). This was chosen as a comparator group because it represents similar sized companies, is subject 
to less volatility than a smaller peer comparator group and is transparent for both Shareholders and participants. 
The Committee will review on an annual basis the continued appropriateness of the comparator group.
Key strategic business 
objectives
Recognises the importance of both revenue growth and other progress
The growth of the Company and therefore delivery of value to investors is dependent on achievement of certain 
key commercial and other objectives.
The annual bonus is designed to drive the achievement of the Company’s strategic business targets. These targets are agreed by the Board 
and selected because of their importance in value creation for Shareholders. Objectives are weighted for Executives in proportion to the 
degree of responsibility for control and achievement of that objective. The weightings are agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration on recruitment
The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration package of new Executive Directors. Each element of an Executive Director’s 
remuneration is set out below:
Salary Base salary will be determined based on the role, experience of the individual and the current market rate.
It may be considered necessary to appoint a new Executive Director on a below market salary (e.g. to reflect 
limited plc board experience). In such circumstances phased increases above those of the wider workforce 
may be required over an appropriate time period, to bring the salary to the desired market level, subject  
to the continued development in the role.
Benefits Benefits provided would be in line with those of current Executive Directors.
Where required to meet business needs, reasonable relocation support including tax equalisation will be provided.
In addition if it becomes necessary to appoint a new Executive Director from outside the UK, additional benefits 
may be provided to reflect local market norms or legislation.
Annual bonus The ongoing annual bonus maximum will be in line with that outlined in the policy table for existing  
Executive Directors, pro-rated to reflect the period of service.
Depending on the timing or nature of an appointment it may be necessary to set different initial performance 
measures and targets for the first year of appointment.
Long-term incentive 
awards
PSP awards are granted in line with the policy outlined for existing Executives. Any ongoing annual award  
is limited to that of the current Chief Executive Officer.
An award may be made shortly following an appointment (provided the Company is not in a prohibited period). 
For internal appointments, existing awards will continue on their original terms.
Pension A company contribution or cash supplement up to the maximum as outlined for current Executive Directors.
Buy-out awards To enable the recruitment of exceptional talent, the Committee may determine that the buy-out of remuneration 
forfeit from a prior employer is necessary. Where possible, any replacement remuneration will be offered on a 
like-for-like basis with the forfeited awards and may be in the form of cash or shares and depending whether the 
award forgone has similar performance conditions, may or may not be subject to performance conditions. The 
value of any buy-out will be limited to the value of remuneration forfeit. Where appropriate, such awards will be 
granted under existing share plans, however, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion to make use  
of the flexibility to make awards under exemptions in the Listing Rules.
Fee levels for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will be set at a level that is consistent with those of existing fees for the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 60
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   60 25/04/2018   18:36 Exit payment policy
The Group does not have a policy of fixed term employment contracts, however, all Directors put themselves forward for re-election at the 
Annual General Meeting. Notice periods for Executive Directors’ employment contracts are twelve months and three months for the Chairman’s 
and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment from either party.
The following policies and payments apply in the event that an Executive Director’s employment is terminated.
Remuneration element Exit payment policy
Service contracts  
entered into before  
1 January 2018
Termination by notice: six months.
Redundancy: six months annual salary payable (reduced accordingly if part of the notice period is worked). 
Retirement, death and ill-health, injury or disability: no termination payment.
Future service contracts 
(entered into after  
1 January 2018)
Termination by notice: up to 12 months’ notice, with a provision to make a payment in lieu of notice for base salary 
and benefits only. Any payment will normally be phased on a monthly basis and would be subject to mitigation, 
whereby the payment made can be reduced (including to zero) if appropriate alternative employment is found.
Redundancy: annual salary payable for the relevant notice period (reduced accordingly if part of the notice 
period is worked).
Retirement, death and ill-health, injury or disability: no termination payment.
In the event of change of control or merger, the Remuneration Committee of the Company has discretion  
to determine phasing of payments.
Long-term incentives and 
deferred bonuses
PSP awards are governed by the Plan Rules as approved by Shareholders. Likewise, the deferred bonus 
awards are subject to the same leaver provisions. These are summarised below.
Termination by notice: unvested awards lapse on cessation.
Redundancy, retirement, ill health, injury or disability, transfer of employment outside of the Group or change of 
control, or any other reason the Committee determines: unvested awards will vest either on the normal vesting 
date or if the Board decides, immediately on the participant ceasing to be in employment. Awards will vest 
subject to the extent the performance condition has been met, as determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
Awards will be pro-rated for time, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Death: unvested awards will vest on the date of death. Performance against the conditions will be measured up 
to the date of cessation and awards will be pro-rated, unless the Committee determines that pro-rating would 
be inappropriate in the circumstances.
Change of control: unvested awards will vest on the date of the takeover. Awards will vest subject to the extent 
the performance condition has been met, as determined by the Remuneration Committee. Awards will be  
pro-rated, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Annual bonus Termination by notice by individual: if an individual serves notice and the termination date falls before 31 December, 
the bonus is normally forfeited. If notice is served between 1 January following the year in which the bonus was 
earned and the payment date, the employee may (as determined by the Remuneration Committee) receive the 
entire bonus payable in cash, subject to malus and clawback provisions.
Redundancy, retirement, death and ill-health, or any other reason the Committee determines: 
if the termination date falls during the financial year, the bonus is normally paid in cash pro-rated for service 
rendered and subject to performance; if it falls after the end of the financial year the bonus is payable in cash 
based on actual results on the normal bonus payment date.
Termination by notice: not normally paid, however, at the Committee’s discretion, if the termination date falls 
during the financial year, a bonus may be paid pro-rata for service rendered and subject to performance over 
the full financial year and normally paid on the normal payment date: if it falls after the end of the financial year  
a bonus is payable based on actual results on the normal bonus payment date.
Benefits These will normally continue to apply until the termination date.
Pension Contributions by the Company will normally continue to apply until the termination date.
Additional payments The Committee will make payment of any statutory entitlements as necessary. In addition the Committee  
will retain the discretion to make settlement or to compromise a claim in connection with a termination  
of any Executive Directors as necessary.
Reasonable legal and outplacement costs will be met if deemed necessary.

Service contracts
The following Executive Directors have current service agreements with the Company which are effective from 1 January 2018.  
These supersede service agreements covering earlier periods.
Name Position Date of joining
Steven Harris Chief Executive Officer 19 May 2006
Rod Hafner Senior VP of R&D 1 March 2007
Julien Cotta Chief Financial Officer 5 January 2012
The contractual arrangements for each Executive Director have been reviewed in order to ensure that these are in-line with market and best 
practice. The notice period and termination arrangements have been aligned with our policy on future service contracts, i.e. the notice period 
for each Executive Director has been increased from 6 months to 12 months. In the event of termination by way of a Payment In Lieu of Notice, 
payment would be phased over 12 months and may be stopped at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on commencement of new 
employment. The changes to the notice period align our contract provisions with the wider market and help ensure business continuity by 
allowing time for search and recruitment of replacements. All Executive and Non-Executive Directors, (except Mr Marvin Samson and 
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud) put themselves forward for re-election at the Annual General Meeting.
The Board believes that it may be beneficial to the Group for executives to hold non-executive directorships outside the Group. Any such 
appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the director may retain any fees received. Steven Harris received fees of £Nil for being 
on the Board of Synchrony Pharma Limited during the year to 31 December 2017 (2016: £Nil) and £32,000 for being on the Board  
of Woodford Patient Capital Trust during the year to 31 December 2017 (2016: £32,000).
The key terms for the Letters of Appointment for Non-Executive Directors are set out below:
Name Notice period Date of joining
Dr Francesco Granata 3 months 1 September 2013
Ms Jo Le Couilliard 3 months 8 February 2018
Russell Cummings 3 months 25 January 2007
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud 3 months 1 November 2012
Ms Sharon Curran 3 months 8 February 2018
Dr Heribert Staudinger 3 months 8 February 2018
Lota Zoth 3 months 9 February 2015
Marvin Samson 3 months 8 December 2015
Copies of the service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the registered office.
Statement of consideration of employees’ pay and remuneration conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Company does not formally consult with employees on the matters of Executive Director remuneration. However, the Committee  
is made aware of employment conditions in the wider Group.
The same broad principles apply to the remuneration policy for both Executive Directors and the wider employee population. However,  
the remuneration for Executive Directors has a stronger emphasis on performance-related pay than for other employees. In particular the 
following approach is used:
 — Salaries, benefits and pensions are compared to appropriate market rates and set at approximately mid-market level with allowance  
for role, responsibilities and experience.
 — When setting salary levels for the Executive Directors, the Committee considers the salary increases provided to other employees  
and in particular those based in the UK.
 — An annual bonus plan is available to all employees and is based on business and individual performance.
Scenarios
The charts set out for illustrative purposes only, what annual remuneration the Company expects the Directors to obtain if performance l 
evels are below threshold, meet expectations or exceed the maximum targets.
The assumptions used in the calculations are set out below:
 — Fixed pay: this includes salary, pension and benefits.
 — Base salary effective 1 January 2018 and expected pension contribution has been used.
 — The actual monetary value of benefits received in 2017 have been used.
 — Expected: this includes salary, pension, benefits, annual bonus and PSP . This assumes that 70% of the annual bonus maximum  
will be payable for each of the Directors and 50% of PSP awards will vest.
 — Maximum: It is assumed that the maximum annual bonus would be payable and that the awards under the PSP vest in full.
 — No share price growth has been assumed.

Annual report on remuneration
Annual report on remuneration 
This section of the Remuneration Committee report has been prepared in accordance with Part 3 of the Regulations as amended,  
and 9.8.6R of the Listing Rules. The Annual report on remuneration will be put to an advisory Shareholder vote at the AGM on 30 May 2018.
Composition
From 1 January 2017 to 26 May 2017 , the Committee was made up of Mr Marvin Samson (Chairman), Dr Tim Corn, and Ms Lota Zoth. Marvin 
Samson and Lota Zoth are both considered independent by the Board. Dr Tim Corn is considered not to be independent. The Committee 
therefore did not comply with the requirement of the Code that all members of the Remuneration Committee be Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. On 26 May 2017 Dr Corn retired from the board and was succeeded by Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud as a member of the Committee. 
Dr Garaud is considered to be an Independent Non-Executive Director and therefore the committee complied with the code from that point. 
There have been no further changes to the Committee up to the date of this report. The terms of reference of the Committee appear on the 
Company’s website. The Committee met twice during the year ended 31 December 2017 . Each meeting was fully attended.
Responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for the following matters:
 — setting a remuneration strategy which is designed to promote the long-term success of the Company;
 — ensuring that the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior employees reflects performance and delivery of Shareholder value;
 — agreeing the design and targets of share incentive plans which require Shareholder approval and monitoring the achievement of those 
targets;
 — deciding on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior employees, including any specific recruitment or retention terms;
 — making a recommendation to the Board in relation to the Chairman’s fees;
 — appointing external advisers where necessary.
Activities
A summary of the matters considered by the Committee in the course of the year ended 31 December 2017 is as follows:
Meeting Agenda items
February Review of the salary levels and annual bonus plan for the Executive Directors. Review of remuneration  
for the Chairman.
Review of performance targets for annual PSP awards.
May Review of PSP plan vesting criteria. Approval of option awards for new employees.
Advisers
The Committee appointed New Bridge Street (NBS) (part of Aon plc) to advise it on aspects of the Group’s remuneration policy. NBS is a 
signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct which sets out guidelines to ensure that its advice is independent and 
free from undue influence. The fees to NBS in 2017 were £3,395 (2016: £39,150), which were mainly charged on the basis of hourly rates.  
The Committee reviews the performance and independence of its advisers on an annual basis.

   This is the value of the total bonus earned during the financial year and comprises the annual bonus paid in respect of performance against goals for 2017 . Where the 
requisite shareholding requirement has not been met by an Executive Director then 50% of the annual bonus will be paid in shares. Where the requirement has been 
met then 25% will be paid in shares.

 The amount shown relates to the gain, being the market value on date of vesting, less exercise price, on PSP 2014 share option awards that vested during the year.

   UK tax legislation imposes penalty taxes on annual pension contributions where prescribed maximum limits are exceeded. The Committee has previously 
determined that Executive Directors affected by this legislation would receive pension benefits limited by the prescribed maximum amounts and an additional taxable 
supplementary cash payment equal to the cost to the Company of the benefit foregone. The amount of this supplementary allowance is set so that there is no 
additional cost to the Company as a result of the implementation of this arrangement. In 2017 Steven Harris received £61,410 of this pension amount as supplementary 
cash (2016: £59,625). In 2017 Rod Hafner received £41,767 of this pension amount as supplementary cash (2016: £30,417).

CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   66 25/04/2018   18:36 Annual bonus for the year to 31 December 2017
For the year ended 31 December 2017 , bonuses up to a maximum of 100% of base salary for Executive Directors and Senior Vice Presidents 
could be earned for performance against annual operational and development goals.
Performance objectives are agreed by the Board at the beginning of the year and the Remuneration Committee determines the proportion 
of bonus payable to each Director and Senior Vice President in the event that the objective is achieved. The Remuneration Committee 
determines at the beginning of the year following the bonus year, the extent to which the objective has been achieved and the proportion of the 
bonus earned. The bonus is calculated on base salary.
Notwithstanding the achievement of certain objectives in the course of 2017 , the Executive Directors elected to limit payment to a maximum  
of 75% of the total potential bonus. This was to align with the maximum bonus payable to all employees being limited to 75% of their  
potential bonus.

Deferred share bonus awards are structured as conditional awards over shares which vest after three years. The level of deferral is linked  
to the achievement of the Company’s shareholding guidelines as set out in the policy report. Where the guidelines have been met in full,  
75% of bonuses are paid in cash and 25% in shares. Both Steven Harris and Rod Hafner have met their shareholding guidelines and therefore 
75% of their 2017 bonus was paid in cash. Julien Cotta has not yet met the shareholding guidelines and so 50% of his 2017 bonus was paid  
in cash and 50% in shares.

Annual report on remuneration continued
With regard to the PSP , the number of shares released to Directors at the end of the three year performance period is dependent upon 
satisfying the criteria relating to TSR and clinical and strategic milestones which are set out in the section of this report relating to the PSP .
DSBP awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, provided the Executive Director remains an officer or employee  
of the Group.
Executive Directors no longer hold options under the Circassia Holdings Limited EMI Share Option Scheme 2007 (the “EMI Scheme”)  
due to the final options being exercised during the year. Executive Directors continue to hold options under the Circassia Holdings Limited 
Unapproved Share Option Scheme 2013 (the “2013 Unapproved Scheme”). Historically, no performance conditions have been attached  
to the options granted under these schemes. The exercise price is equal to the market value of the Company’s shares at the time the options 
are granted.
It was explained in the Corporate governance section of this report that the Group granted certain Non-Executive Directors share options in the 
past, when it was a private company. No further options have been granted since the IPO in 2014 and no awards will be made in the future.

Directors’ interests in shares (including shares held as Restricted shares)
As was noted earlier in this report, the Company has implemented guidelines which require the Executive Directors and key senior employees 
to build up and maintain an interest in the Ordinary shares of the Company which is equal in value to their annual base salary. For the purpose of 
assessing compliance with these guidelines, the value of the shareholding is calculated using the higher of the share price on 31 December 2017 
(104p) and the acquisition price of the shares. The value as a percentage of salary has been calculated using base salary as at 31 December 2017 .
The following table shows the number of Ordinary shares beneficially owned by the Directors who served during the financial year which  
are not subject to any restrictions on transfer or to forfeiture.

No further restricted shares were awarded in the year.
Restricted shares have been subscribed for or purchased at a price of 10p per Ordinary share and, under the terms of their acquisition, are 
subject to certain restrictions on transfer and forfeiture. The restrictions lift on the earlier of a sale of the Company and the expiry of a vesting 
period of between two and three years (depending on the date of award of the Restricted shares). The Ordinary shares may be forfeited 
if the participant ceases to be employed or be an officer of the Company prior to the vesting of the shares other than by reason of: death; 
resignation; permanent incapacity; redundancy; retirement; non-renewal of a fixed term contract or consultancy.
Directors are not permitted to hold their shares in hedging arrangements or as collateral for loans without the express permission of the Board. 
None of the Directors currently holds or has held their shares in such an arrangement.

performance has been measured by JPMorgan Cazenove.
The mid-market price of an Ordinary share on 31 December 2017 was 104p. From 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 the share price

Application of remuneration policy to 2018 salary review
The Executive Directors’ salaries were reviewed in January 2014 as part of the IPO process and were set at a level which the Committee 
regarded as broadly mid-market when compared with other companies of a similar size operating within the same sector. New Bridge Street 
provided advice to the Committee on this process. Further salary reviews have taken place on 9 February 2015, 10 February 2016, 8 February 
2017 and 6 February 2018 and a 3% increase was applied effective 1 January 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively. This increase is in line 
with the average salary increase awarded to UK employees.

The Committee has decided not to disclose the detailed nature of these performance targets as they comprise commercially sensitive

Invesco holds more than 20% of the voting rights attached to the issued share capital of Touchstone Innovations (by virtue of its shareholding 
in Touchstone’s parent company, IP Group plc) and accordingly there is a presumption (which has not been rebutted) that Invesco and 
Touchstone Innovations are acting in concert in relation to their shareholdings in the Company. At 31 March 2018, Invesco and Touchstone 
Innovations together held 34.3% of the voting rights attached to the issued share capital of the Company.

CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   81 25/04/2018   18:36 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
In respect of the Annual report and accounts and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they  
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected  
to prepare the parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and the parent 
Company financial statements the Directors are required to:
 — properly select and consistently apply accounting policies;
 — make prudent and reasonable accounting estimates and judgements;
 — state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
 — make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions  
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and Directors Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements,  
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for taking reasonable steps  
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the website. Legislation  
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 — the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
 — the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and  
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties which 
they face; and
 — the Annual report and the financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group’s position, performance, business model and strategy.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc’s group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 — give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s loss  
and the group’s and the parent company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
 — have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company’s financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 — have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements,  
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual report and accounts (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the Consolidated 
and parent company statements of financial position as at 31 December 2017; the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
Consolidated and parent company statements of cash flows, and the Consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity  
for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided  
to the group or the parent company.
Our audit approach
Overview
 — Overall group materiality: £5.7 million (2016: £3.25 million), based on 5% of loss before tax.
 — Overall parent company materiality: £5.4 million (2016: £3.0 million), based on 1% of total assets  
(adjusted so as not to exceed 95% of Group materiality).
 — We identified 4 components which, in our view, required a full scope audit based on their size or risk.
 — We used component teams in 2 countries to perform 2 full scope audits, with the Group team  
performing the remaining 2 components.
 — Reporting entities where we performed audit procedures accounted for 99% of Group loss  
before tax; 98% of Group revenue; and 98% of Group total assets. Our audit scope provided sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
 — Impairment of goodwill and intangibles (Group).
 — Accounting for the collaboration with AstraZeneca (Group).
 — Impairment of the parent company’s Investment in and intercompany balances with subsidiaries (Parent).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the group and the industry in which it operates, and considered 
the risk of acts by the group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit procedures at group 
and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher 
than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional 
misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the group and 
parent company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules and UK tax legislation. Our tests 
included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence 
with legal advisors, enquiries of management, including those outside of the finance function and review of significant components auditors’ work. 
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from 
the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk  
of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors  
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the 
auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
IAS 36 requires at least annual impairment assessments in relation 
to goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use, with 
more regular assessment should an impairment trigger be identified. 
No impairment triggers were considered to have occurred at the cash 
generating unit level. However, at an individual asset level triggers 
were identified and impairments were determined to be required for 
Seriveo (£31.0m), Flixotide pMDI substitute (EU rights) (£4.7m) and 
Particle-engineered version of salmeterol xinafoate (£1.3m).
Goodwill of £10.0m and intangible assets of £199.7m are significant 
balances to the Group. Judgement is required in the impairment 
assessment, specifically in forecasting the future results of both 
marketed and in-development products. Judgement is also required 
in determining the discount rates to be applied to future cash flows. 
Management have utilised a value-in-use model for both goodwill  
and intangible asset impairment testing.
Refer to page 51 (Audit Committee Report), page 97 (Critical 
accounting estimates and judgements), and pages 110 to 113  
in the notes.
Group
We assessed the level at which impairment testing was performed. 
Based on our knowledge of the business, including the use of assets 
and internal reporting, we agreed with management’s judgement 
that, for the assessment of the impairment of goodwill and intangible 
assets, the Group has three CGU’s.
We obtained management’s impairment analyses and gained an 
understanding of the key assumptions and judgements underlying the 
assessment. We assessed the appropriateness of the methodology 
applied and tested the mathematical accuracy of the models, with 
no exceptions identified. Management have applied a Value in Use 
method to calculate the CGU’s and individual assets’ recoverable 
amount. We concluded that this approach is appropriate.
We assessed the key assumptions, including:
Future revenue streams: We compared forecast revenues to the 
Group’s business plan, obtained an understanding of the stage of 
product development and management’s expected timelines for 
product launches, including updates on the achievement of expected 
milestones. We specifically considered the reasonableness of:
(i)  revenue growth rates in respect of NIOX (taking into account 
latest forecasts, historical growth rates and the size of the sales 
force available to promote this product line). We concluded 
that the terminal growth rates were reasonable based on our 
market experts’ analysis of the asthma market as well as being 
consistent with the rate used in the prior year. We considered that 
revenue growth rates were reasonable, taking into account the 
increased sales force available to promote the product. Despite 
third party forecasts for the market peak being lower than those 
of management, sufficient headroom remains after sensitising 
sales to this level, such that no impairment is indicated;
(ii)  forecasts for sales of new products, including comparing 
projected peak sales of certain marketed and in-development 
pharmaceutical products with third party forecasts and, in the 
case of in-development products, the probabilities associated 
with such products reaching the market. Despite third party 
forecasts for one product being lower than those of management, 
sufficient headroom remains after reducing sales to be in line with 
third party expectations such that no impairment is indicated.
  Expenses and overheads: We reviewed historical forecasting 
accuracy and assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions, 
including in relation to the future sales force utilisation. We identified 
and corroborated any differences in the historical forecasting 
accuracy to conclude that forecasting accuracy is appropriate.
  Discount rate: We used our experts to recalculate management’s 
discount rates and benchmark the rates against companies of 
a similar nature. We observed that the rates used are at the low 
end of our expected range.
  We also obtained management’s sensitivity analysis and performed 
our own sensitivities reflecting what we believed to be a range of 
reasonably individually possible alternative outcomes over the forecast 
cash flows and discount rates, the results of which did not indicate 
an impairment to goodwill or other intangible assets on a CGU basis. 
We found management assumptions in relation to individual asset 
impairments to be reasonable.

Accounting for collaboration with AstraZeneca
The Group entered into a Development and Commercialisation 
Agreement (‘DCA’) with AstraZeneca to acquire the rights to 
commercialise Duaklir in the United States of America on 12 April 
2017 . In addition, the Group acquired the right to exercise an option 
to acquire the remaining contractual rights and economic benefits  
of Tudorza.
The consideration comprised of 47 ,355,417 ordinary shares valued 
at $50.0m, plus further deferred non-consideration of $100.0m and 
contingent royalty consideration on further sales of Duaklir.
Our main area of focus and the area of most complexity and 
judgement was the assessment of whether control of each product 
had transferred to the Group, resulting in a business combination. 
Where a business combination had occurred, we then focused 
on the identification and valuation of intangible assets, including 
in relation to future royalties payable to AstraZeneca, for which a 
corresponding liability for contingent consideration was recognised 
on initial recognition and subsequently re-measured.
Refer to page 51 (Audit Committee Report), page 97 , (Critical 
accounting estimates and judgements), and pages 126 and 127  
in the notes.
Group
We obtained and reviewed the underlying DCA between the Group and 
AstraZeneca and concurred with management that control of the Duaklir 
business had passed to the Group and that control of the Tudorza 
business would not pass to the Group until the option to acquire 
the remaining contractual rights and economic benefits becomes 
exercisable. We also concurred that the option is not “substantive” (as 
defined in IFRS 10) and therefore should not be recognised as a liability 
of the Group or parent company at the balance sheet date.
We assessed management’s accounting for the business combination 
under IFRS 3 “Business combinations”.
We obtained management’s valuation models and tested the 
mathematical accuracy. We did not identify any exceptions in this testing.
We assessed the appropriateness of the relative fair value approach 
used to determine the split of consideration between Duaklir and 
Tudorza products and concurred that this was the most appropriate 
methodology in the circumstances.
We worked with our valuation experts to assess the reasonableness 
of management’s assumptions by using our understanding of the 
business and the pharmaceutical industry, and performing the following:
We assessed the assumed peak sales and sales profile over the life 
cycle (taking account of patent expiry dates) for both products; We 
recalculated management’s discount rates and benchmarked the 
rates against companies of a similar nature;
We obtained an understanding of the anticipated cash flows and costs 
used in the acquisition model, on which the valuations were based, 
including discussions with R&D specialists outside of the finance function;
We evaluated the working capital assumptions included within the 
model; and
We agreed the future royalty rates payable by the Group to other 
parties to the underlying DCA.
We suggested that cash flows should be modelled over the whole life 
cycle of the product (rather than only over the licence period) and noted 
that certain royalty rates used in the model had not been updated to 
reflect the final agreement. The model utilised by management was 
updated to take account of these items, and we considered that 
management’s assumptions in the final model were reasonable.
In relation to the re-measurement of contingent consideration in 
respect of future royalties payable to AstraZeneca, we obtained 
management’s revised forecasts as at 31 December 2017 , 
considered the reasonableness of changes to anticipated royalties, 
tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations and checked 
that the correct royalty rates were applied from the underlying DCA, 
with no exceptions identified.

Impairment of the parent company’s Investment in and intercompany 
balances with subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries of £273.5m is a significant balance. In 
addition, the parent company has intercompany receivables totalling 
£327 .5m from its subsidiary companies. The market capitalisation 
of the Group is £289m, indicating the existence of a potential 
impairment trigger.
Judgement is required in the impairment assessment, specifically 
in forecasting the future results of the subsidiaries. Judgement is 
also required in determining the discount rates to be applied to 
future cash flows. Management have utilised value-in-use models, 
consistent with the models used for goodwill and intangible asset 
impairment testing, for testing for possible impairment of the 
investment in and balances with subsidiary undertakings.
Refer to page 51 (Audit Committee Report), page 97 (Critical 
accounting estimates and judgements), and pages 113 and 114  
in the notes.
Parent
We have leveraged our analysis and understanding of key assumptions 
and judgements in the value-in-use models used for testing for potential 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the consolidated 
financial statements. In assessing the carrying value of investments in 
and balances with subsidiary companies, we compared the carrying 
value of these balances with the cash flows expected to be generated 
from the value-in-use models for each cash generating unit.
We found that there was significant headroom between the value 
of the cash generating units derived from the value-in-use models 
and the carrying value of the parent company’s investments in and 
balances with subsidiary undertakings.
We performed our own sensitivities (reflecting what we believed to be 
a range of individually reasonably possible alternative outcomes) over 
the forecast cash flows and discount rates, the results of which did 
not indicate an impairment.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements  
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry  
in which they operate.
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group’s accounting process is structured around a local finance function in each of the Group’s reporting entities. These functions maintain 
their own accounting records and controls (although transactional processing and certain controls for some reporting units are performed by the 
head office finance team) and report to the head office finance team through an integrated consolidation system.
In establishing the overall Group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the reporting entities 
by the Group engagement team and by component auditors from other PwC network firms. Where the work was performed by component 
auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting entities so as to be able to conclude 
whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
For each reporting entity we determined whether we required an audit of their reported financial information (“full scope”). Those where a full 
scope audit was required included Circassia Inc (incorporated in the USA), determined as individually financially significant because it contributes 
more than 15% of the Group’s underlying loss before tax and Circassia AB (incorporated in Sweden) due to its size or risk. We also undertook the 
statutory audit of two further reporting units incorporated in the UK, Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc and Circassia Limited. Senior members of the 
UK engagement team attended planning meetings with each engagement team and attended, either in person or by telephone, the audit closing 
meetings. A senior member of the Group audit engagement team visited Sweden, to review the work undertaken by component auditors and 
assess the audit findings of Circassia AB. The Group audit team reviewed the working papers of the US component team remotely.
In addition to the work performed at the in-scope reporting entities, there is a substantial amount of work performed at head office by the 
Group audit engagement team. The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of complex items, prepared by the 
head office finance function, were audited by the Group engagement team. These included goodwill, other intangible assets, investments, 
business combinations, bank and other borrowings and related finance costs, current and deferred tax, central adjustments recorded as  
part of the consolidation process and assessment of impacts of new accounting standards (IFRS 9 and 15).
In aggregate our audit procedures accounted for 99% of Group loss before tax.
As a result of its structure and size, the Group also has a number of small reporting entities that make up the remaining portion of the key 
coverage metrics. These small reporting units are covered by the work performed by the Group audit engagement team, where we perform 
analytical review procedures. A significant proportion of these remaining reporting units not selected for local procedures were subject to an 
analysis of year on year movements, at a level of disaggregation to enable a focus on higher risk balances and unusual movements. Those  
not subject to analytical review procedures were individually, and in aggregate, immaterial. This gave us the evidence we needed for our 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   86 25/04/2018   18:36 Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 87
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures  
on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in  
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality £5.7 million (2016: £3.25 million). £5.4 million (2016: £3.0 million).
How we determined it 5% of loss before tax. 1% of total assets (adjusted so as not to exceed 95%  
of Group materiality).
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
Auditing standards allow materiality to be based on 
a variety of measures depending on the nature and 
business of the entity in question. The most common 
benchmark is profit or loss before tax, although for R&D 
companies at the development stage, expenses are 
sometimes used.
As the business has continued to pursue revenue-
generating activities such as NIOX trading and the new 
AZ collaboration, as well as the discontinuation  
of the Allergy programmes, we considered loss before 
tax to be the measure of most relevance to users of 
the accounts. In the prior year we used loss before 
tax and the exceptional items related to the allergy 
programme (primarily impairment of intangible assets), 
as the exceptional items were material one off items not 
expected to be repeated. While some items have been 
identified as “non-underlying” in the current year, none 
are considered “exceptional”.
We believe that total assets is the primary measure 
used by the shareholders in assessing the performance 
and position of the entity and reflects the Company’s 
principal activity as a holding company.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated across components was between £1.6 million and £5.4 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory  
audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.3 million (Group audit) 
(2016: £0.2 million) and £0.3 million (Parent company audit) (2016: £0.2 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or 
draw attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s and parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going 
Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears  
to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures  
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based  
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 
2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs 
(UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below 
(required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06) In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
 — The directors’ confirmation on page 52 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
 — The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
 — The directors’ explanation on page 39 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit 
and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are 
in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the statements are 
consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. 
(Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:
 — The statement given by the directors, on page 47 , that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and parent company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and parent company obtained  
in the course of performing our audit.
 — The section of the Annual Report on page 51 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
 — The directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure  
from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the  
Companies Act 2006 (CA06).

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 82, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors 
are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 — certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 — the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with  
the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Appointment
We were appointed by the directors of the Company (which was unlisted at the time) in September 2007 to audit the financial statements  
for the year ended 31 December 2007 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 11 years, covering 
the years ended 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2017 . In December 2016, the Company held a competitive tender process for the audit 
of the year ending 31 December 2017 , which resulted in our re-appointment.

CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   95 25/04/2018   18:36 Notes to the financial statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
General information
The Group is a specialty pharmaceutical group focused on the development and commercialisation of respiratory products. 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled  
in England and Wales. The Company is resident in England and the registered office is The Magdalen Centre, Robert Robinson Avenue, 
Oxford Science Park, Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, OX4 4GA.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this financial information are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the financial years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(‘IFRS’), IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations endorsed by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention 
modified by the revaluation of certain items, as stated in the accounting policies, and on a going concern basis.
The exemption from audit has been claimed for the individual financial statements of Circassia Pharma Limited (registered number 6410308) 
and Prosonix Limited (registered number 05679156) for the year ended 31 December 2017 under section 479A of Companies Act 2006. 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc has given the required guarantee under section 479C in respect of the reporting year. Circassia Pharma Limited 
and Prosonix Limited results are included in these consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
Though the Group continues to make losses, the Directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position of the Group,  
taking into account existing cash balances. On the basis of this review, the Directors have not identified any material uncertainties to the 
Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval  
of the financial statements.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
a)  The following new standards and amendments to standards were mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning  
1 January 2017 but had no significant impact on the Group: 
 — IAS 7 (amendment) – Statement of cash flows
 — IAS 12 (amendment) – Income taxes
b)  Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective (and in some cases, had not yet been adopted  
by the EU) and have not been early adopted by the Group:
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (effective 1 January 2018): adopting IFRS 9 will impact hedge accounting and receivables provisions. The basis of 
documentation and effectiveness testing of hedges under the new standard will be linked more closely to the risk management objectives, which 
may generate different levels of ineffectiveness than the current testing under IAS 39. The Group currently does not adopt hedge accounting 
hence the changes are not expected to have any significant impact on the financial statements.
Receivables provisions will move from an incurred to an expected loss model. The Group’s largest exposure is trade receivables with the gross 
value of £4.0 million as at 31 December 2017 . The new model will impact the timing and value of provision recognition on higher risk balances.  
No material impact is anticipated as a result of these changes.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contract with customers’ (effective 1 January 2018): IFRS 15 supersedes current revenue recognition guidance including 
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and specifies how and when entities recognise revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements 
with more informative, relevant disclosures. The standard provides a single, principles based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with 
customers. The review of the impact of IFRS 15 requires an assessment at contract level to confirm the full impact of adopting this standard. 
Based on the analysis completed to date, the Directors consider that the new standard will not materially impact the revenue recognition for the 
Group business activities.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (effective 1 January 2019) removes the current distinction between an operating and finance lease, introducing consistent 
requirements for all leases similar to the current finance lease accounting. The impact on the Group’s financial statements is currently being 
assessed and it is anticipated that the standard will be adopted in the Group’s financial statements in line with the effective date stated above.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 96
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   96 25/04/2018   18:36 Use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial information and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Estimates and judgements are continually made and are based on historic experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances. 
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
Where the Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future, the resulting accounting estimates will seldom exactly match 
actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below and are annotated with an asterisk.
Business combinations
The Group accounts for all business combinations under the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. Judgements are made in 
determining the basis on which goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to CGUs. Estimates are made in relation to the cash 
flow forecasts, probability factors and discount rates used for this purpose. In addition, a judgement is made as to determine the point at which 
control of a business passes to the Group and a business combination occurs. Until control is passed to the Group, consideration paid  
or payable is presented as a prepayment for the business combination.
Accounting for the Collaboration with AstraZeneca
Following the collaboration and profit share arrangement with AstraZeneca, a Purchase Price Allocation exercise was performed focusing  
on the following key accounting areas:
 — Determination and allocation of the consideration 
Under the terms of the agreement to secure certain US commercial rights to Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
, a maximum total consideration  
of $230 million plus future sales-based royalties is payable to AstraZeneca. For the purposes of IFRS 3, the total consideration included  
in the valuation consists of $50 million for shares issued to AstraZeneca, $100 million deferred non-contingent consideration and the fair 
value of royalties payable to AstraZeneca. It does not include the amount (up to $80 million) that would be paid to exercise the Tudorza
®
 
option, which will be accounted for once exercised.  
 
Under IFRS 3, it is necessary to determine the amount of consideration which should be allocated to Duaklir
®
. As this is an unusual 
scenario, there is no prescribed methodology for performing this exercise. Management has based the allocation of consideration between 
both products on a relative fair value approach. This was determined using a bottom-up business valuation for both products and allocating 
the amount expected to be paid for both products proportionately between both products. The valuation model was based on expected 
cash flows into perpetuity under two separate scenarios with certain key assumptions including the use of discount and terminal growth 
rates, revenue forecasts to 2034 incorporating a specific growth profile. These assumptions therefore give rise to a number of judgements 
in the valuation models.
 — Initial valuation of Duaklir IPR&D 
The Excess Earnings Method approach was determined to be the most appropriate methodology to use for the valuation of the In-Process 
Research & Development (IPR&D). This methodology made use of the same cash flows used in the Duaklir
®
 business valuation with certain 
key assumptions including a specific rate of return of net working capital, no additional workforce requirement and minimal tangible fixed 
asset requirements. 
 — Initial valuation of Royalties* 
As part of the transaction, Circassia will pay royalties to AstraZeneca on future sales of Duaklir
®
 in the United States. There is some 
uncertainty over the final amount of future sales and thus royalties due and therefore actual outcomes could differ significantly from the 
estimates made. Under IFRS 3, these royalties have been classified as additional consideration and initially recognised as an IPR&D asset 
with a corresponding contingent liability. The value of the IPR&D asset was calculated by management using a tax-effected NPV of the 
future royalty cash outflows at the date of the transaction. See note 35 for further details.
Goodwill and other intangible assets*
Goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate a potential impairment. Judgements and estimates are made in respect of the carrying value of the cash generating units (CGUs) 
containing the goodwill taking into account key assumptions (see note 15) about the product candidates. If the Group is unable to obtain 
regulatory approval or to commercialise its product candidates, or experiences significant delays in doing so, this could result in an impairment 
of the related goodwill and intellectual property rights.
Investments*
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc holds a number of investment balances in subsidiary companies. Investment impairment reviews are 
undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Judgements and estimates 
are made in respect of the carrying value of the cash generating units (CGUs) containing the investment. If there is a significant impairment 
of a particular CGU or if the Group’s market capitalisation remains below the carrying value of Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc’s aggregate 
investment in subsidiaries, this could result in an impairment of the investment.

Other accounting estimates and assumptions
Fair value of acquired assets
Intangibles – Technology 
In estimating the fair value of Technology, a variation of the Income Approach called the Relief from Royalty Method is used. This methodology 
is considered the standard and preferred technique to value assets such as trademark, core technology and patents. 
Intangibles – Customer Relationships
Customer Relationships have been valued based on the Excess Earnings Method. This valuation method is based on discounting the cash 
flows that can be attributed to the intangible asset, after taking into account the contribution of other assets. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in relation to tax losses carried forward in Aerocrine and Prosonix, but only to the extent of deferred 
tax liabilities arising in the same jurisdictions as the brought forward losses. Management have concluded that it is not yet probable that taxable 
profits will be available in the relevant jurisdictions to utilise brought forward losses in excess of deferred tax liabilities. Judgement is required in 
making this determination. Management anticipate that taxable profits will be considered probable for the purposes of recognising deferred tax 
assets under IAS 12 only when there is a stable history of profitability in those tax jurisdictions.
Share issue costs
Under IFRS incremental costs that are directly attributable to an equity transaction that otherwise would have been avoided had the equity 
instruments not been issued are accounted for through equity. Any acquisition related costs (for example due diligence) must be expensed  
in the income statement. There is a level of judgement in determining which costs meet the criteria of an equity transaction.
Share based payments
Options are valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo Simulation depending on the type of option issued.  
For each relevant option grant, individual valuation assumptions were assessed based upon conditions at the date of grant. The range  
of assumptions in the calculation of share based payments is given in note 26.
Non-underlying items
The Group presents certain items of income and expense as non-underlying in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Management primarily manage the business and measure performance based on the results of “underlying operations”. Significant irregular 
and exceptional items are classified as “non-underlying” items and are excluded from the underlying measures. This is a judgemental area  
and is performed by Management. 
Consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date 
that control ceases. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group.
Joint arrangements
The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations  
or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc has assessed the nature  
of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the 
Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses  
in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the 
Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments 
on behalf of the joint ventures.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies  
of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
Segmental reporting
The Group had four business segments during 2017 , Allergy, Respiratory, NIOX
®
 and US AZ collaboration. This is consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance, has been identified as the Executive Directors, who make strategic decisions.
The allergy operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation. Information about this discontinued segment is provided  
in note 10.
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area  
of operations that will not be progressed in the future. Discontinued operations are presented on the income statement as a separate line  
and are shown net of tax. Cash flows relating to discontinued operations are disclosed in the notes.
The allergy programme costs and the associated research and development tax credit for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been 
reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 5 requirements.  
The decision to treat the allergy business as discontinued was made on 25 April 2017 when the Group announced a decision to cease  
all further activities on the allergy programmes.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 98
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   98 25/04/2018   18:36 Clinical study expenses
Where payments to clinical study sites are made in advance for the purchase of stocks of materials for use in clinical studies, the relevant costs 
are included in receivables as prepaid clinical study expenses. Expenses are charged to the income statement as clinical study services are 
carried out by third party suppliers, or clinical study materials are received. 
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, receivables and payables arising directly 
from operations. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits which have an original maturity of three months or less and are 
readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Such assets are classified as current, where management intend to dispose of the asset within 
12 months of the end of the reporting period. Bank deposits with maturity of more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are 
classified as non-current assets.
Where derivatives exist in the financial year, they are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date, with any resulting gain or loss recognised through profit or loss. 
The Group does not have any committed borrowing facilities, as its cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits are sufficient to finance 
its current operations. Cash balances are mainly held on short and medium term deposits with quality financial institutions, in line with the 
Group’s policy to minimise the risk of loss. The main risks associated with the Group’s financial instruments relate to interest rate risk and foreign 
currency risk (note 2). 
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight  
line basis over the period of the lease. 
Goodwill and Intangible assets
Intangible fixed assets, relating to goodwill, customer relationships, technology and intellectual property rights acquired through licensing  
or assigning patents and know-how are carried at historic cost, less accumulated amortisation, where the useful economic life of the asset  
is finite and the asset will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Intangible asset Estimated useful lives
IPR&D 5 – 16 years
Customer Relationships 18 years
Technology 15 – 20 years
Software 5 years
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable  
net assets acquired. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, 
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents 
the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating 
segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. 
The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair 
value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
Where an acquired intangible asset is not yet available for use in the manner intended by management, the asset is tested annually for 
impairment by allocating the assets to the CGUs to which they relate. Amortisation would commence when product candidates underpinned 
by the intellectual property rights become available for commercial use. Amortisation would be calculated on a straight line basis over the 
shorter of the remaining useful life of the intellectual property or the estimated sales life of the product candidates. 
Expenditure on product development is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over the expected useful economic life of the product 
candidate concerned. Capitalisation commences from the point at which technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product candidate can 
be demonstrated and the Group is satisfied that it is probable that future economic benefits will result from the product candidate once completed. 
Capitalisation ceases when the product candidate receives regulatory approval for launch. No such costs have been capitalised to date.
Expenditure on research and development activities that do not meet the above criteria, including ongoing costs associated with acquired 
intellectual property rights and intellectual property rights generated internally by the Group, is charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Intellectual property and in-process research and development from acquisitions are recognised as intangible assets at fair value. Any residual 
excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets in an acquisition is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Computer Software
Expenditure on software costs is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over the expected useful economic life of the software.  
Until such an asset is fully developed, the costs are capitalised and classified within intangibles assets as ‘Software in development’. These 
costs are not amortised until the software has been fully developed and operational, at which point the total cost of the software development 
is amortised over its estimated useful life.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 99
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   99 25/04/2018   18:36 Notes to the financial statements continued
Investments
Investments in subsidiary companies are recognised and carried at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting 
period. Investments are impaired where there is objective evidence that the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of the acquisition cost and the net realisable value. The FIFO (first in, first out) principle is used to calculate 
the value of inventories. Inventories mainly comprise products for sale and stocks of components for the service activities in Sweden and  
the US. The acquisition value comprises all expenses for purchases. The net realisable value is the expected sale price less expected costs  
for preparation and selling. Write-downs of inventory occur in the general course of business and are recognised in cost of sales.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill or intangible assets not ready for use, are not subject to amortisation and 
are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell  
and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal  
of the impairment at each reporting date. Charges or credits for impairment are passed through the income statement.
Business combinations under common control
Transactions relating to asset and liability transfers between two Group entities are accounted for by applying the predecessor value method 
whereby the acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their existing carrying values on the date of transfer. No new goodwill arises  
in predecessor accounting.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable  
to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,  
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
The carrying amount of replaced parts is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial 
period in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Property, plant and equipment Depreciation rate
Leasehold improvements Over the life of the unbreakable portion of the lease
Plant and equipment 10% – 33% 
Fixtures and fittings 20%
Individually significant tangible assets that are intended to be held by the Group for use in the production or supply of goods and services  
or for administrative purposes and that are expected to provide economic benefit for more than one year are capitalised. All other assets  
of insignificant value are charged to the income statement in the year of acquisition.
Costs incurred relating to an asset that is not yet complete are capitalised and held as Assets under construction until they are brought  
into use. The asset is then transferred to the appropriate asset class and depreciated in line with the policy above.
Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less any provisions for doubtful debts. Provisions are made where there is evidence 
of a risk of non-payment, taking into account ageing, previous experience and general economic conditions. When a trade receivable 
is determined to be uncollectable, it is written off, firstly against any provision available and then to the income statement. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously provided for are credited to the income statement. Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of other 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original 
terms of the receivables. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. They are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year 
or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the amounts 
involved are significant, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate which reflects the current 
market assessment of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where a leasehold property substantially ceases to be used for the Group’s business, or a commitment is entered into which would cause  
this to occur, provision is made to the extent that the recoverable amount of the interest in the property is expected to be insufficient to cover 
the future obligations relating to the lease.
A charge for restructuring costs is taken to the income statement when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan,  
and the restructuring has either commenced or the Group has a constructive obligation, for example having made an announcement publicly 
to the employee or the Group as a whole.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 100
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   100 25/04/2018   18:36 Deferred non-contingent consideration
Deferred non-contingent consideration is measured by discounting the liability, where the effect of the time value of money is material, using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the liability due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense in the income 
statement.
Contingent royalty consideration
In a business combination, future royalty payments owed to the seller are treated as contingent consideration. The contingent consideration  
is recognised as a liability, an asset or equity depending on its terms. A contingent consideration arrangement is initially measured at fair value 
on the acquisition date based on a tax-effected net present value basis of the future cash outflows. Contingent consideration that is classified 
as a liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, with changes included in the income statement in the post-combination period 
until the uncertainty is resolved.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks,  
and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of original investment. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity  
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Employee benefit costs
The Group makes contributions to defined contribution personal pension schemes for its Directors and employees. The pension cost charge 
recognised in the year represents amounts payable by the Group to the funds. The Group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees 
as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of  
the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
 — including the effect of any market performance conditions (for example, an entity’s share price);
 — excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets  
and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
 — including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.  
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to  
be satisfied.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting 
period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity financial statements.
The Group’s employees participate in various share option schemes as disclosed in note 26. Equity settled share based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award. At the end of each 
reporting period the Group revises its estimate of the number of options with non-market performance conditions that are expected to  
become exercisable. The financial consequences of revisions to the original estimates, if any, are recognised in the income statement,  
with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The fair value of share options is measured using either the Black Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo Simulation. This is 
dependent on the conditions attached to each of the issued options. Where conditions are non-market based the Black Scholes option  
pricing model is used. Where market based conditions are attached to options, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation. 
Other employee benefits
The expected cost of compensated short-term absence (e.g. holidays) is recognised when employees render services that increase their 
entitlement. An accrual is made for holidays earned but not taken, and prepayments recognised for holidays taken in excess of days earned. 
Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the 
Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax and trade discounts and after elimination of intra-Group sales. Income is reported 
as follows: 
Sale of goods 
The Group sells medical technology equipment that enables inflammation of the airways to be measured as well as consumable items and 
spare parts. Sales are reported as income when the significant risks and benefits have transferred to the buyer and the seller no longer has 
any significant control over the goods. The Group provides 12 month guarantees for certain products and includes a provision for estimated 
future claims. 
Rendering of services
Under the AstraZeneca collaboration agreement, the Group promotes the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment Tudorza
®
 
in the United States. Revenues recognised are the amounts invoiced to AstraZeneca pursuant to the right to collaborate with AstraZeneca  
on the commercialisation and development of Tudorza
®
 in the United States. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which  
the services are rendered.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 101
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   101 25/04/2018   18:36 Notes to the financial statements continued
Licence income 
Technology and product licensing revenue represents amounts earned for licences granted under licensing agreements, including up-front 
payments, milestone payments and technology access fees. Revenues are recognised when this income becomes non-refundable under  
the terms of the licence and where the Group’s obligations related to the revenues have been completed. Refundable licensing revenue  
is treated as deferred until such time that it is no longer refundable. In general, up-front payments are deferred and amortised in line with  
the period of development. Milestone payments relating to defined project achievements are recognised as income when the milestone  
is accomplished.
Royalty revenue is recognised on an accrued basis and represents income earned as a percentage of product sales in accordance  
with the relevant agreement net of any amounts contractually payable to others under the terms of the relevant royalty agreement.
Foreign currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange 
differences are taken to the income statement in the year in which they arise and presented within ‘Other gains and losses’. Previously foreign 
exchange differences were presented within ‘Finance costs or income’. The change in the presentation reflects the fact that historically the foreign 
exchange differences were to a large extent driven by movements on foreign cash balances whereas following the AstraZeneca collaboration 
agreement the foreign exchange differences also arise from translation of monetary liabilities and as such the change in presentation to ‘Other 
gains and losses’ was deemed appropriate. This constitutes a voluntary change in accounting policy and has been applied retrospectively  
in the financial statements resulting in 2016 total finance income reducing by £5.2 million and Other gains increasing by £5.2 million. Had the 
foreign exchange differences for 2017 been presented within ‘Finance costs or income’, total finance income would have been £7 .2 million higher 
and other gains £7 .2 million lower. There has been no impact to total loss for the current or previous financial year as a result of the policy change. 
Had the current policy been applied to 2015 financial results total finance income would have been £1.8 million lower and other gains £1.8 million 
higher with no impact on total loss for the financial year.
Foreign exchange differences on translation of foreign operations into the Group presentational currency, are recognised as a separate element 
of other comprehensive income. Cumulative exchange differences are presented in a separate component of equity entitled Translation reserve.
Taxation including deferred tax
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year, adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of each reporting period. 
The Group is entitled to claim tax credits in the United Kingdom for certain research and development expenditure. The amount included  
in the financial statements at the year end represents the credit receivable by the Group for the year and adjustments to prior years. 
Deferred tax is accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities in the financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.  
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent  
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except  
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the average tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly  
to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
2. Financial and capital risk management
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern and ensure that sufficient capital is 
in place to fund the Group’s activities. The Group’s principal method of adjusting the capital available has been through issuing new shares. 
During 2017 , the Company issued 47 ,355,417 Ordinary shares with a value of $50 million to AstraZeneca (AZ) as part of the consideration to 
secure certain US commercial rights to Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
. The Group’s capital is comprised of share capital and share premium, which 
are disclosed in notes 25 and 27 respectively. The Group monitors the availability of capital with regard to its forecast future expenditure on an 
ongoing basis.
Transaction and translation risk
Foreign exchange fluctuations may adversely affect the Group’s results and financial condition. The Group prepares its financial statements in Pound 
sterling, but a significant proportion of its expenditure and subsidiary results are in various currencies including US dollars, Swedish krona and Euros. 
The Group does not currently hedge against translation risk. 
Financial risk factors
The Group’s simple structure and the lack of external debt financing reduces the range of financial risks to which it is exposed. Monitoring  
of financial risk is part of the Board’s ongoing risk management, the effectiveness of which is reviewed annually. The Group’s agreed policies 
are implemented by the Chief Executive Officer, who submits periodic reports to the Board. 
Foreign exchange risk 
The majority of operating costs are denominated in Sterling, United States dollars, Euro or Swedish krona. Foreign exchange risk arises from  
future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.
In relation to foreign currency risk, the Group’s policy is to hold the majority of its funds in Sterling, monitor foreign currency rates and purchase 
foreign currency at spot rates.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 102
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   102 25/04/2018   18:36 The change in foreign exchange rates that is assessed to be reasonably likely for each currency in 2017 is 10% (2016: 15%). 
At 31 December 2017 , if the Euro had weakened/strengthened by 10% against Sterling with all other variables held constant, the post tax loss 
for the year would have been £0.4 million (2016: £1.6 million) lower/higher, as a result of net foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of  
Euro-denominated payables, receivables and foreign exchange losses/gains on translation of Euro-denominated bank balances.
The impact on post tax loss at 31 December 2017 of a 10% weakening/strengthening of the US dollar against Sterling with all other variables 
held constant would have been a decrease/increase of £2.7 million (2016: £0.6 million). 
The Group is also exposed to currency translation risk in respect of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of its overseas 
subsidiaries. At present, the Group does not consider this to be a significant risk since the Group does not intend to move assets between 
Group companies.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy in relation to interest rate risk is to monitor short and medium term interest rates and to place cash on deposit for periods 
that optimise the amount of interest earned while maintaining access to sufficient funds to meet day to day cash requirements. 
The Group does not have any committed external borrowing facilities, as its cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposit balances  
are sufficient to finance its current operations. Consequently, there is no material exposure to interest rate risk in respect of interest payable. 
If interest rates had been 10 basis points higher/lower the impact on net loss in 2017 would have been an increase/decrease of £0.1 million 
(2016: £0.1 million) due to changes in the amount of interest receivable. 
Credit risk
The Group’s policy following Admission to the London Stock Exchange is to place funds with financial institutions which have a minimum credit 
rating with Fitch IBCA of A- long term / F1 short-term. During 2017 the Group placed funds on deposit with 6 banks (2016: 7 banks). The Group 
does not allocate a quota to individual institutions but seeks to diversify its investments, where this is consistent with achieving competitive rates  
of return. It is the Group’s policy to place not more than £35 million (or the equivalent in other currencies) with any one counterparty.
The value of financial instruments held represents the maximum exposure that the Group has to them. There is no collateral held for this type  
of credit risk.
No credit limits were exceeded during any of the periods reported, and management does not expect any material losses from non-
performance by these counterparties.
Cash flow and liquidity risk
Funds are generally placed on deposit with the maturity profile of investments being structured to ensure that sufficient liquid funds are available 
to meet operating requirements. The Directors do not consider that there is presently a material cash flow or liquidity risk.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date 
to the contractual maturity date. Financial liabilities outstanding for periods greater than one year in 2017 include non-contingent consideration, 
contingent royalty consideration and R&D contributions payable to AstraZeneca. There were no financial liabilities outstanding for periods greater 
than one year in 2016. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contracted cash flows discounted to present value where such impact is material:

3. Operating segments
The chief operating decision-maker (the Executive Directors) is responsible for making key operating decisions in the Group. Assessment  
of performance and decisions regarding the allocation of resources are made by operating segment. The 2017 operating segments  
are identified within the Group by product portfolios:
 — NIOX
®
 relates to the portfolio of products used to improve asthma diagnosis and management by measuring fractional exhaled  
nitric oxide (FeNO);
 — Respiratory relates to the portfolio of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease product candidates; and
 — US AZ collaboration relates to the US collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca regarding the commercialisation of Tudorza
®
  
and of Duaklir
®
 once approved. 
The allergy operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation. Information about this discontinued segment is provided in note 10.
There were no sales between the segments in either reporting year.
An impairment charge of £37 .0 million in respiratory segment relates to three IPR&D intangible assets, see note 16 for further detail.

On 25 April 2017 , following the receipt of the house dust mite allergy study results, it was announced that Circassia would no longer continue 
development of the allergy programmes. Therefore, the allergy programme costs and the associated research and development tax credit 
for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income to comply with IFRS 5 requirements.

AZ R&D contribution
The cost relates to one-off R&D contribution of £45.1 million for Tudorza

®
 product development. An R&D tax credit of £10.2 million 
related to this expenditure is included in the taxation line for non-underlying items.
Intangible assets impairment
Impairments totalling £37 .0 million (2016: £nil) relating to the respiratory portfolio were recognised in the year. Further disclosures are given  
in note 16. The resulting £6.3 million reduction in a deferred tax liability is included in the taxation line for non-underlying items. 
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs comprise cost optimisation initiatives including severance payments, compensation for loss of office, property and other 
contract termination costs. 
Non-contingent consideration
The £5.4 million foreign exchange movement on non-contingent consideration relates to the impact of the weakening Dollar on translation  
of the $100 million deferred non-contingent consideration payable to AstraZeneca. The consideration was measured by discounting the  
liability with £2.7 million increase in the liability due to the passage of time (unwinding of discount) recognised as a finance cost in the year.
Contingent royalty consideration 
Contingent royalty consideration relates to the amount of royalties payable to AstraZeneca on the future Duaklir
®
 sales. The liability was 
remeasured to fair value at the year end with the resulting £3.2 million gain recorded in other gains in the income statement. The £2.9 million 
foreign exchange movement relates to the impact of the weakening Dollar on translation of the contingent royalty consideration.
Loss from discontinued operations
The costs relating to the discontinued allergy operation are deemed to be an exceptional item to be excluded from the underlying operations,  
see note 10 for further details.
12. Taxation
The Group is entitled to claim tax credits in the United Kingdom for certain research and development expenditure. The amount included  
in the financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 represents the credit receivable by the Group for the year  
and adjustments to prior years. The 2017 amounts have not yet been agreed with the relevant tax authorities.

During 2017 , Circassia entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to commercialise Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
. The £0.2 million  
of goodwill relates to the Duaklir
®
 business combination only. In the event that the Option over Tudorza
®
 becomes exercisable, a further 
business combination is expected to occur, potentially resulting in the recognition of additional goodwill. This collaboration to commercialise 
Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
 products is considered to be a new CGU.
In 2016, following the cat allergy immunotherapy phase III study results, the Allergy portfolio value was written off in full resulting in the 
impairment charge for the Allergy CGU of £74.5 million.
The carrying value of goodwill, translated at year end exchange rates, is allocated to the following CGUs:
Cash generating unit

£m
2016 
£m
NIOX
®
5.4 5.3
Respiratory 4.4 4.4
AstraZeneca collaboration 0.2 –
 10.0 9.7
The recoverable amount of the CGUs is assessed using a value in use model. Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the 
projected risk-adjusted pre-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated. The NIOX
®
 CGU valuation basis 
was changed to a value in use model (2016: a fair value less costs of disposal model) as a result of the changes to the business during the 
year following the AstraZeneca collaboration agreement. In addition, US operation assets are now shared between the NIOX
®
 and AstraZeneca 
collaboration CGUs which resulted in assets being allocated between the two CGUs.
The value in use for the Respiratory CGU was calculated over a ten year period using a discount factor of 13% (being a weighted average 
cost of capital rate for the CGU). The calculations use risked pre-tax cash flow projections. In light of the stage of development of the product 
candidates these cover a ten year period. Cash flows beyond the ten year period were extrapolated using the estimated terminal growth rate 
stated below. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business. The discount rate used is pre-tax and 
reflects specific risks relating to the Group and uncertainties surrounding the cash flow projections, particularly in relation to the assumed 
successful launch of the Group’s products in the expected timeframe and the resulting sales.
The value in use for the NIOX
®
 CGU was calculated over a ten year period using a discount factor of 10% (being a weighted average cost  
of capital rate for the CGU). The calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections. Cash flows over ten years have been considered appropriate 
based on the product lifecycle. Cash flows beyond the ten year period were extrapolated using the estimated terminal growth rate stated 
below. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business. The discount rate used is pre-tax and reflects 
specific risks relating to the Group and uncertainties surrounding the cash flow projections.
The value in use for the AstraZeneca collaboration CGU was calculated over a ten year period using a discount factor of 11.5% (being a 
weighted average cost of capital rate for the CGU). The calculations use risked pre-tax cash flow projections. Cash flows over ten years have 
been considered appropriate based on the product lifecycle. Cash flows beyond the ten year period were extrapolated using the estimated 
terminal growth rate stated below. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business. The discount rate 
used is pre-tax and reflects specific risks relating to the Group and uncertainties surrounding the cash flow projections.

In each case the valuations of Respiratory, NIOX
®
 and AstraZeneca collaboration indicate sufficient headroom such that a change to key 
assumptions that are reasonably possible is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   111 25/04/2018   18:36 Notes to the financial statements continued
Impact of possible changes in key assumptions
Unsuccessful development of two product candidates in the Respiratory CGU
Management have, in their sensitivity analysis, assessed the impact of the possibility that the development of two product candidates  
in the Respiratory CGU is unsuccessful.
Reduction in revenue growth in the NIOX
®
 and AstraZeneca collaboration CGUs
Management have, in their sensitivity analysis, assessed the impact of the possibility that sales growth in the NIOX
®
 and AstraZeneca 
collaboration CGUs is less than that of internal forecasts.
No change in the key assumptions mentioned above would have resulted in a goodwill or intangible assets impairment charge.
As discussed in the Strategic Report, the Group's strategy has been changed and it now intends to out-license / partner the rights  
to the respiratory portfolio and the impact of this change will need to be factored into impairment reviews in the future.

An impairment test is performed annually based on the value in use of the intangible assets. 
The Group tests annually whether goodwill and intangible assets have suffered any impairment and tests more frequently when events  
or circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Key assumptions and sensitivities used in the impairment review at a CGU level are disclosed in note 15. In addition, the Group performs 
impairment reviews in relation to individual assets.
An impairment of £31.0 million has been recognised for the Seretide
®
 pMDI substitute to reflect updated cash flows used in the valuation of 
intangibles on the balance sheet following negative PK study results in the previous two years. This resulted from a reduction in the probability 
of success of the PK study bringing it more in line with analyst expectations. If the launch of the product was delayed by one or two additional 
years compared to the current assumptions, the impairment would be between £2.0 million and £3.7 million higher. If the probability of success 
was further reduced by 10%, the impairment would have been £4.6 million higher. If forecast sales were reduced by 10%, the impairment 
would have been £2.8 million higher.
In addition, an impairment of In-Process Research & Development (IPR&D) of £4.7 million in respect of Flixotide
®
 pMDI substitute (EU rights)  
has been recognised following the decision to halt further development.
IPR&D of £1.3 million relating to a particle-engineered version of salmeterol xinafoate which is no longer being developed has  
also been impaired.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 112
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   112 25/04/2018   18:36 In-Process Research & Development (IPR&D)
IPR&D comprise a portfolio of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease product candidates.
The IPR&D has been initially valued using the Excess Earnings Method. This valuation method is based on discounting the cash flows  
that are attributable to the intangible asset, after taking into account the contribution of other assets. IPR&D assets are tested for impairment  
on the same basis. 
Customer relationships
Customer relationships represent the existing customers, as at the date of acquisition that are expected to continue to support the business.  
A remaining useful life of 18 years was determined at acquisition. Amortisation has been calculated on a straight line basis over this period from 
the date of acquisition.
Technology
Prosonix achieves a sophisticated level of control over the physicochemical properties of drug particles via an integrated platform of unique  
and proprietary particle engineering technologies and formulation processes. The Relief from Royalty Method was used to determine the fair 
value of the acquired Technology. In the Relief from Royalty Method, estimates of the value of these types of intangible assets are made  
by capitalising the royalties saved because the company owns the intangible asset. A remaining useful life of 20 years was determined  
at acquisition and amortisation will commence when the products underpinned by this technology become available for commercial use.  
A value in use model is used in testing for impairment.
Aerocrine developed its technology to measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide (“FeNO”) since the mid-1990s. The Company was the first 
to develop an instrument for the measurement of FeNO as a valuable tool in the management of airway inflammation. The valuation of the 
Technology was based on pre-determined hypothetical royalty rate attributable to the use of the Technology. The estimated remaining useful 
life of the Technology is 15 years. Amortisation has been calculated on a straight line basis over this period from the date of acquisition.
Other
Other intangible assets relate to licences and software.

Transfer of trade and certain assets from Prosonix Limited to Circassia Limited
On 2 March 2017 , Prosonix Limited allotted one new Ordinary share to Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc for £9.0 million. This consisted of share 
capital of £0.001 and share premium of £8,999,999.999. Immediately following the share issue, Prosonix Limited reduced its issued share 
capital from £35,394,779.66 to £1,189.72 by cancelling and extinguishing 2,284,294 ordinary shares of £0.001 each, 1,891,840 A shares of 
£0.001 each and 9,941,261 B shares of £0.001 each, and by cancelling and extinguishing the entire share premium account, leaving behind 
1,189,724 C shares of £0.001 each. The reduction in share capital was credited to a Capital reduction reserve account. 
On 3 March 2017 , Prosonix Limited fully repaid the intercompany loan due to Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc of £10,906,586.98. In addition, 
Prosonix Limited sold its business and certain assets for the price of £1,284,321.55 to Circassia Limited, representing the net book value  
of its business and certain assets, as part of a bona fide solvent reorganisation of the Circassia Group, subject to and on the terms and 
conditions of an asset purchase agreement between Prosonix Limited and Circassia Limited. Consequently, the majority of the Company’s 
investment in Prosonix Limited was reclassified to investment in Circassia Limited.
Deed of assignment for AstraZeneca collaboration agreement 
On 1 September 2017 , management enacted a Deed of assignment between Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc and Circassia Limited, 
transferring all rights, powers, interests and benefits of the transaction. This transfer was accounted for at a book value of £42.1 million  
on 1 September 2017 , with no gain or loss in either entity.

In accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement’ the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded 
derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard. There were  
no such derivatives identified at 31 December 2017 or 31 December 2016.
Fair value 
The Directors consider that the fair values of the Group’s financial instruments do not differ significantly from their book values except  
as described below.
Contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value calculated using a discounted cash flow approach. The valuation methodology  
uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs), therefore this valuation technique is classified  
as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. See note 35 for further detail.

The contractual life of all options is 10 years and the options cannot normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
(i)  Options granted under the PSP Scheme have a fixed exercise price and are subject to additional vesting performance conditions. The exercise price of options 
granted under the 2014 PSP scheme is £nil and all subsequent PSP scheme awards have an exercise price of £0.0008. The performance conditions state that a 
proportion of an award shall vest subject to the Company Total Shareholder Return (TSR) ranking against the Comparator Index TSR and the remaining shall vest 
subject to the meeting of certain strategic Company objectives.
(ii) Options granted under the EMI Scheme have a fixed exercise price based on the market price at the date of grant. 
(iii) Options granted under the Unapproved Scheme also have a fixed exercise price based on the market price at the date of grant.

Options exercised in 2017 resulted in 880,532 shares being issued at a weighted average price of £0.0008 each. The related weighted 
average share price at the time of exercise was £0.88 per share.
There were no options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2016.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 120
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   120 25/04/2018   18:36 Valuation models
The fair value of PSP share options granted during the year was determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation model and Black Scholes model 
dependent on the performance vesting conditions. 
There have been no EMI Scheme or Unapproved Scheme options granted during the year (2016: nil), all options granted in previous  
years were valued using the Black Scholes model.
Black Scholes
There were no options granted during the year (2016: nil) that were valued solely using the Black Scholes model. 
Monte Carlo Simulation
The following weighted average assumptions were used in the Monte Carlo Simulation model in calculating the fair values of the options 
granted during the year:
 2017 2016
Exercise price £0.0008 £0.0008
Share price £0.96 £2.66
Expected volatility 30% 35%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Expected dividends 0% 0%
Risk free interest rate 0.1% 0.4%
The Monte Carlo Simulation model has been used to value the portion of the awards which have a market performance vesting condition (Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR)). The model incorporates a discount factor reflecting this performance condition into the fair value of this portion of 
the award.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation model at the grant date was 
£0.75 per option (2016: £1.75).
For the options valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation, expected volatility is measured by calculating the standard deviation of the natural 
logarithm of share price movements of comparable companies. This is a standard approach to calculating volatility. The risk free rate of return is 
the rate of interest obtainable from government securities as at the date of grant (i.e. Gilts in the UK) over the expected term (i.e. three years).
Restricted shares
The Company previously made awards of Ordinary shares to employees and Non-Executive Directors by entering into a form of restricted 
share agreement with each participant, under which the participant subscribed for or purchased Ordinary shares in the Company at 10p 
per ordinary share (converted into 0.08p shares post capital reorganisation). These shares are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and 
forfeiture, as set out in the restricted share agreement. The restrictions lift on the earlier of a sale of the Company and the expiry of a vesting 
period of between two and three years (depending on the date of award of the restricted shares).
There were no restricted shares in issue at 31 December 2017 (2016: 0. 1 million Ordinary shares of 0.08p).
Deferred shares
During the year the Group awarded nil (2016: 156,035) deferred shares to Executive Directors as part of a deferred bonus for 2016. The shares 
are held by the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust until the third anniversary of the grant date when they will transfer to the Executive Directors so 
long as they are still an officer or employee of the Group.
Income statement
See note 5 for the total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of the above equity settled instruments granted to  
Directors and employees.

During the year the Group received a notification about an arbitration claim raised for up to $4 million for the non-performance of certain 
obligations of the contract against one of the subsidiary companies. At the date these accounts were issued, details of the claim are yet 
to be presented by the claimant. Given the lack of detail at the early stage of the claim, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of 
the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. Hence, the nature and facts of the case are 
disclosed but no provision is made.

35. Business combinations
On 12 April 2017 , Circassia’s collaboration and profit share arrangement with AstraZeneca became unconditional. Under the agreement, 
Circassia secured certain US commercial rights to Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
. On that day Circassia issued 47 ,355,417 ordinary shares with  
a value of $50 million to AstraZeneca. In addition, Circassia will pay AstraZeneca deferred non-contingent consideration of $100 million  
on the earlier of: (i) 30 June 2019; and (ii) the approval of Duaklir
®
 by the FDA; and royalties on sales of Duaklir
®
 in the United States.
Under the terms of the agreement, Circassia will have the option to secure the remaining commercial rights and economic benefits  
of Tudorza
®
. This will become exercisable from H2 2018 based on the sales performance of Tudorza
®
 in the preceding 12 month period,  
or if Duaklir
®
 gains FDA approval before 31 December 2019. Until the option becomes exercisable Circassia does not have control over  
the Tudorza
®
 business hence the consideration paid and payable represents a prepayment for the business combination. 
Following positive results from the AMPLIFY Phase III study, the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) for Duaklir
®
 with the United States  
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is planned in the first half of 2018. Circassia has exclusive commercialisation rights to Duaklir
®
 in the  
United States and as such it is considered that the Group assumed control over the Duaklir
®
 business when the collaboration agreement 
became unconditional. 
The future royalty payments to AstraZeneca on Duaklir
®
 are recognised as an additional intangible asset and contingent consideration liability. 
A contingent consideration arrangement is initially measured at fair value on the acquisition date based on discounted future cash outflows. 
Contingent consideration that is classified as a liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, with changes taken to the income 
statement. The amount of royalties payable as determined in the collaboration agreement is based on the future Duaklir
®
 sales. As the valuation 
methodology uses this significant input which is not based on observable market data, this valuation technique is classified as level 3 in the fair 
value hierarchy. The fair values are calculated using the discount rate of 20.5%.

the operating loss (administrative expenses line) for the year ended 31 December 2017 and £1.6 million has been offset against the Share 
premium reserve.
The consideration for the Duaklir business was determined to be £73.2 million. Intangible assets (IPR&D) of £73.0 million have been recognised  
in the accounts. The difference between total value of the business and identifiable assets resulted in a recognition of £0.2 million goodwill.

®
 option
If the option to secure the remaining commercial rights and economic benefits of Tudorza
®
 is taken, Circassia will make further payments 
to AstraZeneca of up to $80 million dependent on the level of Tudorza
®
 sales in the United States and if Duaklir
®
 gains FDA approval. Such 
payments are not considered to be a present obligation until the option becomes exercisable therefore this has not been recognised as a 
liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 .
Until the Tudorza
®
 option is exercised, the Group promotes the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment Tudorza
®
 in the US 
in accordance with the collaboration and profit share arrangement. The commission fees receivable are based on Tudorza
®
 product in-market 
sales and promotion activities performed by Circassia. In 2017 revenue recognised for rendering this service was £19.0 million.

The changes in future Duaklir

 sales might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of contingent Duaklir
®
 royalty consideration  
(see the table below for list of key inputs used in the fair value measurement). 10% higher or lower Duaklir
®
 sales would result in £3.4 million 
lower or higher fair value of the liability.
Significant estimates relating to contingent royalty consideration valuation
The assessment of the fair value of the contingent Duaklir
®
 royalty consideration requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model at the date 
of acquisition, consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen and the estimation of the future cash flows of the product 
discounted at the risk adjusted rate. Key assessments and judgements included in the calculation of deferred royalty consideration are as follows:
Valuation model Discounted cash flow 
Anticipated launch date 2019 – reviewed and amended to take into account development, regulatory and marketing risks
Sales value, volume and growth rates Estimates of sales value, volume and growth rates are internal forecasts based on both 
internal and external market information and market research commissioned by the Company
Period of specified projected cash flows 16 years
Discount rate 20.5%

36. Events occurring after the reporting date
During 2018, the Company plans to implement its refocused investment strategy. As a result, there will be no further development of the 
respiratory pipeline which may result in an impairment in the carrying value of the respiratory cash generating unit assets as detailed in note 3. 
Circassia intends to issue further ordinary share capital to AstraZeneca, subject to shareholder approval, such that AstraZeneca’s holding 
will increase from 14.2% to a maximum of 19.9%. Circassia will use the proceeds to fund a deferred R&D contribution of $20 million, which is 
payable by the end of 2018 under the agreement with AstraZeneca, and part fund a final R&D contribution of $25 million payable by the end  
of 2019. AstraZeneca has agreed to include any remaining R&D contribution not paid by the end of 2019 in the loan arrangements in the 
existing development and commercialisation agreement.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2017 130
CIR_AR17_back_v17.indd   130 25/04/2018   18:36 Forward-looking statements
This Annual report contains certain projections and other forward-
looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results 
of operations, businesses and prospects of Circassia. The use of 
terms such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “project”, 
“estimate”, “intend”, “continue”, “target” or “believe” and similar 
expressions (or the negatives thereof) are generally intended to identify 
forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current 
expectations and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to 
events and depend upon circumstances that may or may not occur 
in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual 
results or developments to differ materially from those expressed or 
implied by these forward-looking statements. Any of the assumptions 
underlying these forward-looking statements could prove inaccurate 
or incorrect and therefore any results contemplated in the forward-
looking statements may not actually be achieved. Nothing contained 
in this Annual report should be construed as a profit forecast or profit 
estimate. Investors or other recipients are cautioned not to place 
undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained herein. 
Circassia undertakes no obligation to update or revise (publicly or 
otherwise) any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or other circumstances.
