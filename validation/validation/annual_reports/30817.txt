Capturing the value 
of the network
During the year we have:
Made significant progress on the commercial transition of the enlarged 
Signature network 
We have brought together the commercial arrangements of Signature and 
Landmark and started to utilise the wealth of data we capture as to how 
our customers traffic the enlarged network. We have also explored the 
priorities of our different customer segments, whether it be ramp access, 
hangarage or line maintenance, to provide a full, cost-effective service 
offering across the network. 
Invested to position the network for future growth
We have committed capital expenditure to enhance the Signature network 
through lease extensions, adding hangar space to satisfy customer 
requirements, and growing our non-fuel service offering. We have 
partnered with other strategic aviation players to combine expertise on 
technology enabled means of global flight planning. We have invested in 
our people and systems to support further service led growth.
Continued to actively grow Ontic
We have added licences to our extensive range of maturing and legacy 
products and systems and grown our reputation as a trusted partner  
for OEMs wishing to transition products. 
Achieved steady state at ERO
We have delivered a much improved performance at ERO despite continuing 
challenging markets. The benefits have started to flow as we approach 
completion of our operational transformation and from our investment in 
our new, cost-efficient, multi-engine overhaul and test facility in Dallas.
Determined the most appropriate capital structure for the Group  
going forward
An extensive review has been undertaken and, based on the strong and 
robust cash flow fundamentals of the Group, an increase in our target 
leverage range was deemed appropriate. This revised range gives flexibility 
and headroom for the investment requirements of BBA Aviation and the 
cyclicality of the B&GA market.

Chairman’ s 
Statement
2017 was another successful year  
for the Group. 
The US B&GA market grew strongly during the year and we have 
continued to lay the foundations for further growth and value 
creation across the Signature network through investing in our 
infrastructure and customer offer and successfully negotiating 
revised commercial terms with many of our customers.
We made further investments in Ontic’s IP-protected licence 
portfolio in 2017 and the business performed very strongly, with 
good contributions from new licences and growth from military 
parts programmes. There was a much improved operating 
performance at ERO despite challenging markets. 
During the year we undertook a comprehensive review of BBA 
Aviation’s capital structure and, as a result, have increased our 
targeted leverage range. This enables us to maintain a capital 
efficient balance sheet, based on the strong and robust cash flow 
fundamentals of the Group, and provides us with the flexibility 
required to meet investment opportunities to fund organic and 
inorganic growth and enhance shareholder value.
Results
Continuing Group revenue increased by 10% to $2,370.6 million. 
Flight Support revenue was up 13.8% and Aftermarket Services 
revenue grew 3.1%, driven by Ontic which offset the decline at ERO. 
Continuing Group underlying operating profit was $360.6 million 
(2016: $302.6 million) and continuing Group underlying operating 
profit margin increased to 15.2% (2016: 14.1%) reflecting underlying 
margin growth at both Flight Support and Aftermarket Services.
Underlying continuing profit before tax increased to $298.5 million  
(2016: $238.7 million) and adjusted continuing underlying EPS was  
up 24% to 24.0¢. We delivered free cash flow of $220.6 million  
(2016: $224.1 million) and, as a result, the Group de-levered to  
2.6x net debt to underlying EBITDA on a covenant basis. Return on 
invested capital (ROIC) was up 90 basis points to 11.0% (2016: 10.1%).
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 9.59¢ per share, taking 
the full year dividend to 13.40¢, an increase of 5%. This reflects the 
Board’s progressive dividend policy and its continued confidence in 
BBA Aviation’s future prospects. 
Sir Nigel Rudd,
Chairman
The Board
On 2 January 2018 we were delighted to announce that Mark Johnstone 
will join the Board as Group Chief Executive on 1 April 2018. Mark has a 
deep understanding of the Group and the right strategic and operational 
experience, having held a number of senior roles at BBA Aviation over the 
last ten years. Mark takes over from Wayne Edmunds, who stepped into 
the role on an interim basis on the departure of Simon Pryce in June 2017 . 
I would like to thank Wayne and Simon for their respective contributions. 
Simon led BBA Aviation for a significant period and played a key role in 
managing the Group through the downturn and in the transformation 
that has taken place in recent years. Wayne will continue to be a member 
of the Board but will not be regarded as an independent director and will 
not be a member of Board Committees. David Crook joined the Board 
as Group Finance Director on 1 June 2017 , replacing Mike Powell.
On 1 January 2018 we welcomed two new non-executive directors, Amee 
Chande and Emma Gilthorpe, to the Board. Amee and Emma bring highly 
relevant experience for the next stage of the Group’s development and I 
look forward to working with them. We also announced that Peter Ratcliffe 
will step down from the Board at the 2018 AGM. I would like to thank Peter 
for his valuable contribution to the Board over the past nine years and 
thank each of our non-executive directors for their counsel during the year.
Outlook
The Board is pleased with the performance of the Group and progress 
made in 2017 . We have started to capture the value of Signature’s 
unique network and Ontic is performing very well. ERO has stabilised 
and we have recently commenced a strategic review of this business. 
We have also ensured that we have an appropriate capital structure going 
forward. Recent investments at Signature are all focused on delivering 
continued market outperformance in terms of our earnings growth. 
We will continue to look to expand our FBO network and our offering 
of non-fuel services to ensure that we remain the market leader with 
unmatched customer relevance. Our growing portfolio at Ontic offers 
significant opportunities and the business has a strong pipeline. The 
Board remains confident of good growth in 2018. Strategic Report  
Q&A with Interim Group Chief Executive

 “ I have greatly enjoyed this 
period as Interim Group Chief 
Executive. I am extremely 
proud of our people – their 
energy, their commitment, 
their integrity and their focus 
has established the momentum 
that we take into 2018.”
 Wayne Edmunds,
 Interim Group Chief Executive
Q&A with Interim 
Group Chief 
Executive 
Q. How would you describe current US B&GA market conditions?
A. The B&GA market is looking positive. It showed good growth in 
2017 – in the USA growth was 3.1% in the first half and 4.1% in 
the second – and, as we look into 2018, we are encouraged by a 
positive outlook for the US economy, with expected continued 
growth in GDP underpinned by tax reforms. Within the different 
customer segments, charter traffic demonstrated particularly 
strong year on year growth. 
 In the first half of the year, Signature grew in line with the market 
despite the short-term impact of combining the two commercial 
books of Landmark and Signature and transitioning key customers 
onto new commercial agreements. In the second half, we 
outperformed a more buoyant B&GA market as the new commercial 
agreements bedded down and new traffic patterns established. 
Q. What is the enlarged Signature network capable of?
A. Signature now has 198 locations across the world. Of the top 200 
B&GA airports in the US, Signature is present at locations where 
68% of fuel is burned, and we are located at key B&GA centres 
outside the US, in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. These 
are in the places that our customers want to fly to and where they 
know they will receive the same industry-leading service from our 
highly trained Signature team. We have built relationships with these 
customers and we continue to invest in the quality of experience and 
in the quality and range of our infrastructure, our service offering 
and our technology, so that they continue to choose Signature. Our 
goal is to continue to grow operating profit ahead of the market.
Q. How does Aftermarket Services fit with the Group going forward?
A. Ontic offers us scalable investment opportunities that have an 
attractive return on invested capital and enable us to grow our 
portfolio of IP-protected products. The team has demonstrated 
real diligence and expertise on the evaluation of prospective 
licences and we are now regarded as a trusted counterparty for 
maturing and legacy aircraft parts that are either replaced through 
wear and tear or as part of regular service cycles. Furthermore, 
as our scale has increased, our key OEM partners have shown 
an increased willingness to grow their relationships with us, as 
demonstrated by the steady stream of new licence deals we have 
agreed, particularly in the latter part of 2017 . As we announced 
on 1 March 2018, we are currently conducting a strategic review 
of the ERO business, although there is no certainty that this will 
result in a transaction being agreed. Strategic Report  
Q&A with Interim Group Chief Executive
5
Q. What would you say are the priorities of the new Group  
Chief Executive?
A. BBA Aviation completed its annual strategic review and goal 
setting process at the end of 2017 and our goals have been 
cascaded throughout the Group. As a member of the Executive 
Management Committee, Mark has been deeply involved in the 
process and, as Group Chief Executive, he will take responsibility 
for delivering them. Having spent ten years with BBA Aviation in 
a range of senior roles he has a detailed knowledge of how the 
business works and will be able to hit the ground running.
 I have no doubt that his key priority will be to maintain the 
momentum that we have achieved in recent years – not just 
in business performance but in all the underlying things that 
contribute to it: our focus on service and growing our offer to the 
customer; our focus on understanding the customer through 
better use of data; and the deployment of new technology to 
improve our processes and make us more efficient operators. In 
this regard, Mark has been a key facilitator of our recent investment 
in Victor, a leading on-demand private jet charter company, where 
we will explore, in partnership, cutting edge ways to better serve 
the passengers, operators and aircraft owners using our network. 
And, finally, that we continue to deploy capital wisely.
 Mark shares my determination to ensure that BBA Aviation is a 
safe place to work and a great place to work and that we remain 
committed to being a responsible company. This is valued by our 
employees and by potential employees and we want to make sure 
that we continue to attract and retain the best talent. 
Q. What can you say about the review of BBA Aviation’s  
capital structure?
A. BBA Aviation is now predominantly focused on the B&GA 
market. It was therefore appropriate that we reviewed our capital 
requirements and leverage appetite ready for the next stage of our 
development. Our cash generation characteristics are very strong 
and we believe an increase in our leverage range is appropriate, 
hence the increase in the range to 2.5x–3.0x. We ended the 2017 
financial year towards the bottom end of this range.
 We will continue to deploy capital where we see the opportunity 
to generate good risk-adjusted returns and our investment 
priorities are focused on delivering organic underlying operating 
profit growth above B&GA market growth and investing in bolt-on 
acquisitions and IP licensing arrangements at Ontic. The Group 
remains disciplined in its approach to the allocation of capital, with 
the overriding objective being to enhance shareholder value. 
 The Board has a progressive dividend policy with the aim of 
increasing dividends in line with long-term underlying growth in 
earnings. Any surplus cash after satisfying the investment  
opportunities of the business and funding dividends will be 
returned to shareholders.
Q. Of what are you most proud?
A. I have greatly enjoyed this period as Interim Group Chief Executive. 
Of course, I knew the business well having been a member of 
the Board since 2013, but this role has given me a completely 
different perspective. I am extremely proud of our people – they 
have truly risen to the challenge and delivered in what has been a 
very busy year. Their energy, their commitment, their integrity and 
their focus on the goal has got us to where we are today and has 
established the momentum that we take into 2018.
 I am also very proud that we have proven we can deploy a large 
tranche of capital very effectively. Landmark was a large and truly 
transformational addition to the Group and has been integrated 
very successfully, putting us in a great position to move forward.

BBA Aviation is primarily focused on providing 
services to global Business & General Aviation 
(B&GA) customers; 88% of revenue comes 
from this market. 
Ontic has a wider customer base, supporting maturing and legacy 
aerospace platforms in the global commercial and military markets, 
with a low single digit exposure to the B&GA market. While principally 
focused on B&GA, Engine Repair & Overhaul (ERO) also provides 
services to regional commercial operators flying with engines in the 
sub-20,000 lb thrust category.
Business & General Aviation
B&GA covers thousands of aircraft large and small, outside the 
commercial and military aircraft fleets, serving a wide variety of private, 
business, utility and public service roles. Worldwide there are more than 
21,000 jets, 15,000 turboprops and 24,000 turbine civil helicopters 
in operation classified as B&GA aircraft. Signature primarily provides 
flight support together with line maintenance services, through the 
TECHNICAir™ brand, to business and private aircraft in this segment. 
Flight support includes services such as fuelling, ramp access and 
overnight parking and hangarage. ERO and Ontic provide aftermarket 
technical services and licensed products for a broad range of jet, 
turboprop and helicopter platforms. 
Private and business travellers use B&GA aircraft as a productivity and 
efficiency tool, particularly in North America where there are significant 
distances between large conurbations and a lack of efficient intermodal 
alternatives in other travel sectors. BBA Aviation’s key geographic 
focus is North America given that 65% of the world’s business jets and 
turboprops are based there. In all regions, customers value a consistent, 
high-quality flight support offer to aid their journey.
“ AnnualB&GAhoursflownintheUS
market have recently surpassed 
pre-financialcrisislevelsdrivenby
an increase in average leg length 
compared to pre-crisis.”
The US B&GA market has attractive growth characteristics that are 
both cyclical and structural in nature. B&GA travel is driven by corporate 
confidence and wealth creation, with a long-term through-cycle 
correlation to US GDP . More broadly, new business aircraft deliveries, in 
addition to pricing and demand in the second-hand market, indicate the 
longer-term health of the market. Looking forward, lower US personal 
and corporate taxes are expected to provide additional upside to 
business confidence.
B&GA flight hours and aircraft movements are key drivers for Signature 
and for ERO. Increased activity, measured in the US by the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) and in Europe by Eurocontrol, means more 
arrivals and departures and a higher uptake of fuel and other services 
across Signature’s global network, and a greater number of engine and 
other technical service events driven by increased aircraft usage.
Annual B&GA hours flown in the US market have recently surpassed 
pre-financial crisis levels driven by an increase in average leg length 
compared to pre-crisis.
Commercial and Military Aviation
Demand for BBA Aviation’s services in both the commercial and military 
aviation markets is principally driven by flight activity. For Ontic, factors 
supporting the life extension of existing military platforms, such as the 
age of the fleet, and defence spend impacting development of new 
aircraft are key drivers. In commercial, continued airline growth with 
record backlog and life extensions (retirements as a percentage of new 
deliveries) are at the lowest level since 2004, and a large number of 
aircraft are coming off warranty in the next few years, all of which are key 
market drivers for Ontic.

Organic Revenue Growth

Organic revenue growth is a 
measure of the underlying 
growth of the business. It 
excludes the impact of foreign 
currency, fuel price fluctuations 
and any contribution from 
acquisitions and disposals.
Signature continued to 
perform well, delivering  
good organic growth.  
This growth was in part offset 
by weak markets at ERO, 
driving a small increase  
in Group organic underlying 
continuing revenue.

Managing Our Risks 21
BBA Aviation’s risk mitigation strategy and risk appetite are matters  
that are overseen by the Board, with the support of the Audit and 
Risk Committee, which manages the processes that underpin risk 
assessment and our systems of internal control.
The risk assessment process drives the Internal Audit scope, which  
is agreed in February each year by the Audit and Risk Committee.  
The Chief Risk Officer and Head of Internal Audit attend Audit and  
Risk Committee meetings to provide regular updates and discuss  
any proposed changes to the plan.
How we manage risk across BBA Aviation 
The Board has established a framework for assessing risk in the  
context of likelihood and impact in financial and reputational terms.  
Each risk within the Group is assessed against this framework and  
the Board reassesses its risk appetite on a bi-annual basis when risk  
maps are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee.
Group policies, standards and internal controls, together with 
our Values and our focus on safety, underpin our approach to risk 
management. We are committed to being a responsible values-led 
business and our leaders are responsible for embedding this into  
BBA Aviation’s culture, our decision making and how we work.
Our employees are accountable for working to established standards 
and for identifying and escalating encountered risks so that they can 
be appropriately managed. The Group has comprehensive training 
programmes to ensure that employees are appropriately trained  
in BBA Aviation’s ethics policies.

Managing Our Risks 22
The bi-annual risk assessment process looks forward three years  
to create BBA Aviation’s risk profile. These key Group-level risks are 
input into the scenario modelling for the Viability Statement, which  
is explained further on page 85.
Progress in 2017
We continue to adopt a risk and controls-based approach and  
have improved our reporting to provide practical insight in executive 
summaries to enable senior management to understand issues 
quickly. All audit findings are reported in terms of risk and impact, which 
is aligned with BBA Aviation’s Risk Model, and a structured follow-up 
process operates driven by action dates agreed collaboratively  
between Internal Audit and BBA Aviation’s management and overseen 
by executive management.
A key area of improvement in 2017 was in the area of Business 
Continuity Management (BCM).
A new sub-Committee of the Executive Management Committee was 
established to provide guidance and leadership to ensure that BBA 
Aviation’s businesses are suitably protected from a BCM perspective. 
This includes ensuring compliance with the Group’s BCM Policy and 
providing support and expertise, both within Committee members’ 
respective operations and across the Group. The Committee  
consists of BCM co-ordinators from each business unit and the key 
global functions.
The Committee meets for bi-annual reviews and strategy planning, 
monthly conference calls, and is the internal business driver for the BCM 
testing programme. Knowledge, learning and experiences are shared 
within the Group to deliver continuous improvement in BCM practice
Principal Risks 
We have identified 12 principal risks and uncertainties facing BBA 
Aviation which are considered by the Board to be material to the 
development, performance, position or future prospects of the Group. 
These risks, mitigations and changes during the year are summarised  
in the table on page 23. They are not set out in priority order. 
Case Study – response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria
For a 30-day period in August and September 2017 , 17 Signature 
Flight Support locations in the United States and the Caribbean 
were directly impacted by three Category 4 and 5 hurricanes: 
Harvey, Irma and Maria. Systematic planning and implementation 
was the key to employee safety, successful recovery and the 
fast re-opening of locations, confirming that, while not every risk 
can be controlled or prevented, identifying and understanding risk 
enables the turning of a high-risk situation into a manageable event. 
A robust and effective hurricane plan had been in train before  
the start of the 2017 hurricane season when Signature  
locations undertook their annual pre-hurricane review. Then, 
as the hurricanes developed, they were tracked to ensure that 
all locations potentially in their paths were alert and prepared. 
Signature executive leadership had plans in place to monitor  
and manage the crisis while ensuring the ongoing business  
of the rest of the network was not disrupted.
Three to four days ahead of anticipated landfall, Signature’s 
Hurricane Response Plan & Checklist was initiated, and daily  
status calls commenced. The Response Plan & Checklist is a 
detailed step by step guide to ready the entire FBO complex 
for the coming storm. Fuel supplies are checked and verified; 
customers are notified to re-locate their aircraft; Ground Support 
Equipment is prepared and staged; any aircraft remaining on the 
ground are secured as much as possible; buildings and grounds 
are battened down; all administration and supplies are confirmed; 
and emergency equipment such as generators and satellite 
phones are deployed. 
At the corporate offices in Orlando a review was undertaken 
to ensure that all required financial matters, including payroll, 
were dealt with in advance. Communication was maintained 
throughout the storm period and continued until all employees, 
facilities and equipment were confirmed safe. Insurance adjusters 
were quickly dispatched to the affected locations and teams 
were mobilised to provide assistance to employees and to those 
facilities needing additional expertise and/or personnel.
While 17 locations were directly impacted, only three were 
seriously affected and Signature was able to move very quickly to 
re-open its FBOs, using social media to keep customers informed 
of progress. Post-event reviews were undertaken to identify 
learnings, and these have been fed into BBA Aviation’s Business 
Continuity and Crisis Management Plans to further improve 
resilience in the future.

Managing Our Risks 24
BBA Aviation is a values-led organisation and 
our Vision, Mission and Values guide each of 
our employees every day, wherever we are.  
Our Values describe our aspirations as 
individuals and as a company and we all take 
care to behave in ways that are consistent  
with them whatever we are doing.
Corporate Responsibility (CR) and sustainability are embedded into 
our Vision, Mission and Values and are fundamental to everything we 
do at BBA Aviation. CR and sustainability means taking a responsible 
approach to the operation of our companies and the conduct of our 
personnel and we do this by integrating social and environmental 
concerns into our business operations; embracing the opportunities 
and managing the risks of social and environmental developments;  
and living our Values to support our objectives.
Taking a sustainable approach is crucial if we are to achieve our long-
term goals and is also important to our employees, our customers,  
our suppliers and to everyone that has a relationship with us.
Responsibility for CR
Overall responsibility for CR sits with the Board. Day-to-day 
management is delegated, via the Executive Management Committee, 
to the CR Committee, which sets direction on CR and sustainability 
issues. The Committee is made up of senior members of the BBA 
Aviation team with relevant business roles and the ability to share 
knowledge and best practice across the Group. The Committee meets 
regularly each year and the Committee Chairman reports progress to 
the Executive Management Committee and to the Board.
CR motivates our teams and we aim to involve employees personally in 
our CR efforts and pursue things that matter to them through the CR 
Committee’s Special Issues agenda, covering:
• continuous improvement in environmental performance, including 
“alternative fuels“;
• community involvement: local participation and charitable giving;
• employee recognition; and
• diversity initiatives.
  
The Committee invites specialists from around the Group and 
external parties to present on their areas of expertise. It also monitors 
developments in the CR field.
You can read more about our approach to CR on the BBA Aviation 
website where you may also download many of the policies referred 
to in this section.
External Benchmarks
Since 2006, as BBA Aviation plc, we have been a member of the 
FTSE4Good index and participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project. 
It is BBA Aviation’s objective, over time, to maintain and improve its 
ranking within the FTSE4Good index and seek further external CR 
benchmarking to guide our efforts and drive continuous improvement 
in CR performance over the next five years.
Safety Council and Charitable Giving Committee
BBA Aviation also operates a Safety Council and Charitable Giving 
Committee to oversee our activities in those areas. Our Safety 
Council includes Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) professionals 
from across BBA Aviation. Its role is to direct and monitor safety at 
BBA Aviation and promote safety best practices and behaviours. Our 
Charitable Giving Committee reviews and approves applications for 
additional funds to BBA Aviation’s charitable giving programme, which  
is now in its eighth year.

Performance is relevant to everything we do at BBA Aviation.  
It applies to our operational and financial results and to our

service and environmental progress. 
We report on a range of sustainability and CR KPIs in the key 
areas of safety and environmental performance and we  
cascade internal SMART goals to each of our business units  
and functions that motivate all of our teams to do their very  
best and contribute to the success of the whole Group.
CR Dashboards
During 2017 , we have been developing dashboards to be used 
by our sites to proactively monitor local CR metrics using data 
from our SHEBBA reporting and tracking system. To date, aside 
from health and safety metrics, SHEBBA data has typically been 
aggregated and monitored at a higher level to ensure goals are 
met. Providing easily accessible data at a site level will enable 
local goal setting and drive greater engagement with our overall 
targets and better reporting on metrics such as recycling, waste 
and volunteer hours. 
The dashboards will be available during 2018 and are intended to 
include metrics on the following: 
• Environment – water, electricity, gas and fuel usage, recycling 
(plastics, paper and aluminium) and waste (including 
hazardous waste)
• Community – volunteer hours
• Local health and safety metrics are already available.

Safety
We are dedicated to safety and security, the elimination of 
hazards and protecting people, property and our environment.
Protecting the health, safety and security of our teams, our sites, 
our customers and all those who come into contact with us is a 
priority for BBA Aviation. Our goal is zero preventable incidents 
(ZIPP) and our Health and Safety strategy seeks to deliver an 
environment and proactive safety culture at all sites to make  
this achievable. 
Each employee, supported by their local Health and Safety  
team, takes responsibility for their own safety, that of co-workers, 
and of anyone visiting or using our sites. We are focused on 
reporting hazards and acknowledging and learning from near 
misses and the root causes of incidents. We include hazard and 
security incident reporting as a requirement at every site so that 
we maintain high awareness of and deeply engage everyone at 
BBA Aviation in safety issues.
Our Health and Safety Approach is available to download from 
the CR section of the BBA Aviation website.

to injury prevention. It consists of a ten-minute series of 
exercises and stretches undertaken at the start of every 
shift led by volunteer Align & Move coaches. The entire DAI 
overhaul workforce was trained in the programme and, 
whilst daily sessions are voluntary, they are very popular 
as people immediately start to feel the benefits of being 
physically prepared for the day ahead. The programme has 
significantly reduced sprain and strain injuries.
Safety Performance
Recordable Incident Rate (RIR)
RIR is our primary Health and 
Safety performance metric. 
RIR is measured as the total 
number of injuries and illnesses 
multiplied by 200,000, divided 
by the number of actual hours 
worked by all employees. The 
increase in 2017 was primarily 
due to a higher than usual 
number of slip, trip and fall 
injuries in wintery weather 
conditions in the first quarter.
Safety Performance
Number of locations achieving 
zero RIR
131 out of 209 BBA Aviation 
reporting locations achieved

 Changed vs 2016 disclosure due to reclassification of sites.
During 2017 we continued the implementation of our Safety 
Management System (SMS), including completing all training on 
hazard reporting, and we have created new-joiner online training. 
Our Global Safety Day in April 2017 focused on ‘situational 
awareness’ and personal responsibility, with our teams working 
on a range of scenarios from ‘active shooter’ to slip, trip and 
fall hazards. We are also planning on introducing safety leading 
indicators such as completed observations; audit/corrective 
action completed; percentage of turnover and overtime 
hours; and employee training completed to support continued 
improvement in our safety performance. 
People
We are committed to investing in and empowering our 
people through training and education and to providing 
them with opportunities for rewarding careers.
Our people are the foundation of our success. Their service skills 
and their functional, operational and engineering expertise are 
the core of our business. Ensuring that BBA Aviation attracts, 
develops and retains the best people is vital to the Group’s 
success and the achievement of our goals.
Strategic Report 
Corporate Responsibility 27
We provide every member of the team with equal opportunities 
to thrive, as well as specific and relevant job-related training 
designed to expand individual capabilities and give people 
the tools needed to reach their potential. Our Passport to 
Leadership training programme was undertaken by nearly 200 
leaders during the year. This highly interactive programme 
was developed internally and promotes the concept of leaders 
developing leaders by involving the executive management 
team in training sessions. These are set up as mixed groups 
with participants from across the business and with a range of 
leadership levels. Over two modules, participants develop a 
range of new leadership skills, including leading and managing 
change; encouraging diversity, inclusion and collaboration; 
developing and engaging others; leading daily continuous 
improvement and coaching for peak performance.
We encourage all employees to have their say in both formal and 
informal ways and run specific engagement programmes across 
the Group to bring our teams closer together and ensure they 
feel part of the whole. Recognition is also important – exceptional 
performance is valued and rewarded through programmes such 
as Service with a Leading EDGE® and Tow It Like You Own It at 
Signature and long service is celebrated. Individual business and 
function recognition activities are supported by the BBA Aviation 
Above & Beyond card programme which recognises individual 
achievement at all levels of the Group; and BBA Aviation’s annual 
Vision, Mission and Values Awards.
Diversity and inclusion
We believe in an inclusive culture where there is no differentiation 
in behaviour or actions relating to an individual’s race, ethnicity 
or creed, gender, age or orientation that could be considered 
offensive or exclusionary, and we strive to accommodate personal 
needs. We value diversity of background and experience, believing 
them to enhance the performance and culture of our business, 
and apply this philosophy when seeking qualified individuals to fill 
roles at BBA Aviation. 
We have a framework in place that incorporates relevant best 
practice and promotes a common understanding of diversity 
and inclusion across the Group. This includes BBA Aviation’s 
Equal Opportunities and Anti-Harassment Guidelines which  
set out our approach to these matters.
Our ‘BBA Aviation Celebrates!’ initiative was introduced during 
2017 to recognise a variety of cultural holidays and events and 
seeks to celebrate the diversity of our global team at a grass 
roots rather than top down level.
Recognising that gender is only one form of diversity to which 
we are committed, we are pleased that women make up 25% of 
our employee population and 20% of our senior management 
group, the latter being 16% in 2016. T wo female non-executive 
directors joined BBA Aviation on 1 January 2018, meaning our 
current Board is made up of three women and six men.
The table below shows the percentage of women employed in 
various roles as at 31 December 2017:

One Young World, Bogota 2017
In October, BBA Aviation sent eight young leaders from 
across the Group to the One Young World (OYW) Summit 
in Bogota, Columbia for the first time to join participants 
from across the globe, from multiple businesses and 
organisations, to debate, formulate and share new ideas 
on solving the pressing issues facing the world. The goal 
of the OYW organisation is to empower young leaders 
to make lasting connections to create positive change. 
Our delegates returned as energised and enthused OYW 
Ambassadors with plans to partner BBA Aviation’s CR 
Committee to drive engagement and communication within 
the Group on various CR matters. BBA Aviation intends to 
send a delegation to the OYW 2018 Summit to be held in 
The Hague.
Strategic Report 
Corporate Responsibility 28
BBA Aviation’s companies and locations are encouraged to focus 
their efforts on activities and organisations in the fields of aviation, 
education and engineering and those that benefit the communities 
in which they operate. Participating in these efforts engages 
employees and builds strong teams as well as helping others.
Our local efforts are complemented by the BBA Aviation parent 
company charitable giving programme which was launched in 
2010. The programme invites recommendations for donations 
every six months and, to date, has donated more than $1.6 million 
to charities and organisations around the world.
Environment
We are committed to working in ways that limit the impact of our 
business activities on the environment and aim for continuous 
improvement in environmental performance every year, 
including the elimination of environmental incidents. We monitor 
external developments to ensure that we remain compliant with 
all environmental legislation and watch developing technology – 
for example alternative fuels and vehicles – to understand if they 
might have application at BBA Aviation.
Every BBA Aviation site records and tracks the use of key 
resources to monitor efficiency and enable us to report and 
improve environmental performance. We regularly review 
performance and look for ways to reduce and prevent pollution 
and reduce emissions, energy and water use and waste. We also 
aim to increase levels of recycling across the Group. See CR 
Dashboards in the Performance section on page 25.
Our Environment Policy and Approach is available to download 
from the CR section of the BBA Aviation website.
Environmental KPIs 
BBA Aviation has voluntarily reported on environmental metrics 
for a number of years and KPIs are normalised for comparison 
purposes to dollars of revenue. We use the services of an 
external consultant to review the process for collecting and 
consolidating this data.

Service
We strive continually to anticipate customer needs, 
exceeding their expectations.
Our customers expect high quality, reliability and excellent 
service from every business and person they deal with at BBA 
Aviation. We aim to exceed expectations in everything we do 
and have designed our businesses with customer service at the 
forefront and with the ability to innovate and anticipate customer 
requirements both now and into the future. Our internal Ascend 
initiative is a continuous improvement programme in place 
in every part of BBA Aviation seeking to implement projects 
that will make it easier to do business with us and easier for 
employees to work together.
Responsibility 
We are committed to managing our impact on, and 
contributing positively to, society and the environment.
Community
We recognise the benefits of working in partnership with the 
communities in which we operate, and our sites play an active 
role in local projects and local and national organisations through 
volunteering, fundraising and taking part in events.
Hurricane Relief
In late 2017 , hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria had a 
devastating effect on communities in Houston, Florida 
and the Caribbean, with many BBA Aviation personnel and 
their families affected. Teams from across the Group rallied 
to support rescue and relief efforts, from setting up and 
supporting a staging location for a US Military Task Force 
and assisting the coastguard, the American Red Cross 
and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) to 
collecting supplies and arranging their safe passage to 
affected areas. Employees across the world also pledged 
money through three fundraising campaigns, raising nearly 
$100,000 including matched funding from BBA Aviation.

Integrity
We earn the trust and respect of our stakeholders  
with honesty, fairness, openness and by honouring  
our commitments.
Acting with integrity is critical to maintaining good and 
continuing relationships – from those we have with customers 
and other external stakeholders to the way we interact with  
each other. This is vital for our current and future success.
Ethical conduct and legal compliance are key expectations at 
BBA Aviation and any breach is taken extremely seriously. We 
continually look for ways to strengthen our compliance and 
control programmes to ensure we uphold these standards, 
which are fundamental to the way we operate.
BBA Aviation has a range of formal policies relating to such areas 
as Ethics, Gifts and Entertainment and Equal Opportunities. 
These policies are reviewed regularly and compliance with our 
policies is monitored through BBA Aviation’s Internal Audit 
process and informal and formal reporting processes. Ethics 
training is conducted every year.
Our Ethics policies are available to download from the CR section 
of the BBA Aviation website, as is BBA Aviation’s Modern Slavery 
Statement and its statement on Global Tax Strategy.
Human rights
We respect the principles of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s core 
conventions. BBA Aviation has not adopted a formal human 
rights policy as we believe that our existing adopted policies 
and our Vision, Mission and Values recognise the importance 
of how we conduct our business and its impact on a wide range 
of stakeholders and therefore our responsibilities in relation to 
human rights. The requirement for a specific human rights policy 
will continue to be monitored.
Electric crew cars and charging stations
Signature has installed electric vehicle charging stations at 
12 locations across the network and Tesla chargers at five. 
These are a complimentary service available to customers 
at locations where there is demand and additional sites are 
being evaluated for future installs. Signature also introduced 
to the fleet hybrid electric crew cars which are used by crews 
requiring transportation off the airport. These are currently 
available at 11 locations.

Our Markets  
in 2017
BBA Aviation’s key market showed good 
growth in 2017. B&GA movements in the USA 
increased by 3.7% year on year and in Europe 
grew by over 7%.
Business & General Aviation
US B&GA monthly flight activity cycles were positive with growth every 
month, but showing particular strength in the second half.
Modest growth in the economies of the majority of the top 20 business 
aviation markets worldwide continues to be a key factor affecting new 
aircraft orders and sales of pre-owned aircraft. Deliveries of business 
jets have been broadly flat over the last six years. However, long-term 
forecasts still predict the delivery of more than 8,000 new business 
jets between 2018 and 2027; projecting total active global fleet growth 
of 24% or 2.2% CAGR in the period, with new platforms coming to 
market. The North American market is expected to take nearly 60% of 
these deliveries, growing the total active fleet of business jets in BBA 
Aviation’s key region by 22% over 10 years. Aircraft utilisation rates in 
the USA, while still historically low, increased during the year. Pre-owned 
inventory for sale of both jets and turboprops also fell during the year.
Over the longer term, the key drivers for B&GA remain intact – 
continued growth in GDP and total wealth, the increasing value of 
people’s time, corporate confidence and corporate activity levels all 
point to improving sentiment. The unusual nature of the 2007–2009 
crisis and the halting return to growth have meant that, although 
corporate profits have recovered and confidence has improved, flight 
activity has lagged. However, steady growth in US GDP and the current 
upward trend in US business confidence supports a continued increase 
in B&GA movements in the USA with the FAA currently forecasting an 
average growth in B&GA Jet and Turboprop flying hours of 2.5% per 
annum to 2037 . 
The political environment in the USA could also be positive in the short 
and medium-term, with commentators speculating that the new US tax 
policy could be marginally beneficial to jet purchases.
Commercial and Military Aviation 
Trends in military aviation are likely to improve as the global defence 
market recovers after years of pressure due to budget retrenchment. 
The perceived and continuing threat environment and regional tensions 
are expected to be the biggest driver of spending. US defence spending 
represents approximately 34% of global spending and this grew in 2017 
driven by the new administration’s focus on strengthening the nation’s 
military. The USA accounts for 26% of the global military aviation 
fleet (c13,800 aircraft). Budget growth and a higher tempo of military 
operations are expected to positively impact flight activity and thus 
maintenance spend as more missions are executed. Life extension 
programmes continue to be important as the US military aircraft ages. 
Military legacy aircraft life extensions of between seven and ten years 
on platforms such as the C- 130, ACV-8B, F- 15 and AH-64 and delays 
on new aircraft, such as the F-35 and A400M are key drivers for our 
Ontic business. The current US Air Force fleet is more than 25 years 
old on average, with some platforms significantly older. Average age is 
expected to continue to rise despite the large defence budget increases.
Commercial aircraft production is expected to be reasonably flat over the 
next few years (after a slowdown in 2016) and with an increase in delivery 
deferrals, the influence of the low oil price and growing passenger and 
freight traffic this results in increased passenger load factors and so the 
outlook for our legacy support business, Ontic, is positive.
Strategic Report 
Our Markets in 2017 31
Group Finance  
Director’ s Review 
BBA Aviation has delivered another year  
of strong growth. Our underlying operating 
profit outperformed strong B&GA markets  
in 2017 .
During the year we made significant progress on transitioning our 
customers onto new commercial agreements to begin capturing  
the value from the unique Signature network, post the integration  
of Landmark Aviation. Ontic’s focus as a high-quality, cash generative 
market leading provider of legacy support services was further 
enhanced with the addition of new licence agreements during the year. 
Furthermore, the acquisition of GE Aviation’s portfolio of legacy avionics 
products in December 2016 made an encouraging initial contribution.
Flight Support delivered excellent underlying operating profit growth, 
continuing to outperform its markets, with good drop through to profit. 
In Aftermarket Services, Ontic, our legacy support business delivered 
ahead of our expectations. We saw a good contribution from licences 
added in 2016 and organic growth from military parts programmes, 
including the B52. ERO delivered a much-improved operating 
performance through market share gains on certain engine platforms, 
underpinned by ongoing cost reduction and the results of the footprint 
rationalisation. This was achieved despite markets that remained 
challenging with no recovery in legacy mid-cabin fixed wing flying and 
continued pressure on pricing and workscopes.
Continuing Group revenue increased by 10% to $2,370.6 million  
(2016: $2,149.1 million), including $92.7 million contribution from 
acquisitions. Flight Support revenue increased 13.8%, reflecting the 
contribution from acquisitions of $53.0 million, being one additional 
month of Landmark Aviation and the additional three months of 
contribution from the new FBOs in Italy, together with the impact of 
higher fuel prices, partially offset by foreign exchange movements  
that increased Flight Support revenue by $88.1 million. Aftermarket 
Services revenue was up 3.1% driven by Ontic, offsetting the decline  
from continuing challenging markets in ERO.

Group Finance Director’s Review 32
Continuing underlying Group operating profit was up 19% to 
$360.6 million (2016: $302.6 million). There was an excellent 
performance in Flight Support which increased operating profit 
as adjusted for FX and disposals (see page 37) by $43.8 million and 
included an $11.6 million contribution from acquisitions. Aftermarket 
Services, now 17% of continuing Group underlying operating profit,  
was up $24.6 million as adjusted for FX (see page 39) due to Ontic’s 
strong performance and included an $11.5 million contribution from 
acquisitions and a much-improved financial performance at ERO.
Statutory Group operating profit was up 43% to $237.6 million  
(2016: $166.1 million) due to improved trading performance and  
lower exceptional and other items, as set out below.
Continuing Group underlying operating profit margin increased to 
15.2% (2016: 14.1%) reflecting underlying margin growth in both Flight 
Support and Aftermarket Services. On a constant fuel, disposals 
adjusted basis, the underlying operating margin increased 200 basis 
points to 15.2%.
Underlying net interest decreased by $1.8 million to $62.1 million  
(2016: $63.9 million). Net debt decreased to $1,167 .1 million (2016: 
$1,335.3 million). On a covenant basis, the net debt to underlying 
EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.6x (2016: 3.1x), and on a reported basis to 
2.6x (2016: 3.2x). Interest cover on a covenant basis increased to 8.4x 
(2016: 7 .2x), due to the decreased interest on the lower drawn debt.
Underlying continuing profit before tax increased to $298.5 million  
(2016: $238.7 million).
The Group’s underlying effective tax rate for continuing operations is 
17 .5% (2016: 16.5%). Underlying profit after tax increased by 24% and 
continuing underlying adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 
24% to 24.0 cents (underlying adjusted 2016: 19.4 cents). Cash EPS, 
the measure of EPS adjusted to use a current as opposed to total tax 
charge, increased 29% to 28.6 cents (2016: 22.1 cents).
Total Group ROIC increased 90 basis points to 11.0%, up from 10.1%  
in 2016.

Strategic Report 
Group Finance Director’s Review 33
Exceptional and other items after tax, for continuing and  
discontinued operations, totalled $127.0 million (2016: $316.0 million).  
Significant items include restructuring expenses of $28.0 million  
(2016: $9.9 million), comprising of $15.7 million as a result of 
restructuring ERO’s Abu Dhabi facility and $12.3 million associated 
with ERO’s footprint rationalisation programme and actions taken 
to address the costs previously associated with supporting ASIG; 
$93.8 million of non-cash amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
(2016: $98.6 million), and $22.5 million loss after tax on disposal of 
discontinued operations (2016: $97 .5 million). The impact of the 
enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US has also been 
presented as exceptional and other item tax charge during the year.
Continuing statutory profit before tax was $175.5 million versus an 
$82.2 million loss for the prior year. 
Free cash flow was $220.6 million (2016: $224.1 million), the decrease 
mainly due to a working capital outflow of $46.3 million compared to 
an inflow of $36.1 million in the prior year and increased tax payments, 
largely offset by increased earnings, lower capital expenditure and lower 
interest payments. 
Gross capital expenditure amounted to $80.3 million (2016: $102.4 million). 
Principal capital expenditure items include the investment in our FBOs 
at Boeing Field, Palm Beach and Nashville, our new engine overhaul and 
testing facility at Dallas Fort Worth and our Ontic facility in Cheltenham 
to support the ongoing transition of GE Aviation avionics licences. 
Working capital outflows in the year of $46.3 million (2016: $36.1 inflow), 
represented $25.7 million outflow relating to discontinued operations 
and approximately $20 million outflow representing the expected 
reversal of outperformance from 2016.
Cash flows on exceptional and other items during the year were  
$12.7 million (2016: $63.5 million) which primarily relate to  
restructuring costs.
The Group’s tax payments during the year were $41.8 million  
(2016: $15.8 million) which included tax payments of $8.4 million  
in relation to the disposal of ASIG. Net interest payments were  
$57 .2 million (2016: $61.8 million) and dividend payments amounted  
to $130.7 million (2016: $124.3 million).
The consideration paid relating to acquisitions including deferred 
consideration during the year was $75.7 million, net of cash acquired. 
This related substantially to the acquisition of Ontic’s licences. In 
December 2016, Ontic completed the acquisition of a portfolio of 
legacy avionics products from GE Aviation for $60.7 million. The cash 
payment for this acquisition was made in January 2017 .

Divestment of ASIG
In April 2016 the ASIG business was classified as held for sale and, 
as a major line of business for the Group, it has been presented 
as a discontinued operation in both the current and comparative 
financial disclosures. On 16 September 2016 the Group announced 
it had reached agreement with John Menzies plc on the terms of the 
sale of substantially all of the ASIG business for a consideration of 
$202.0 million. The transaction was completed on 31 January 2017 . 
The financial matters that follow represent the Group’s continuing 
operations unless stated otherwise.
Central costs
Central costs were $0.7 million higher at $34.1 million (2016: $33.4 million). 
The central cost base represents two elements: the unallocated 
corporate costs for the Group; and the costs previously associated  
with supporting the ASIG business, which was sold in January 2017 .  
We supported Menzies (the acquirer of ASIG) for a period of six months 
through to July 2017 and since July we have been able to address the 
cost base that had supported the transitionary service agreement with 
Menzies. The work to address the cost base that previously supported 
ASIG is substantially complete with approximately $5 million of such 
costs included in the central costs for 2017 (2016: $18.6 million). These 
costs will not impact the Group from 2018 onwards.
The balance of central costs represents the unallocated central costs 
to support the continuing Group which reflects the additional share 
based payment expenses as anticipated, plus the one-time costs 
associated with the transition of the CEO, and losses incurred by our 
captive insurance company for the damage to US and Caribbean 
facilities during the recent hurricanes.
Exceptional and other items
Exceptional and other items are defined in note 2 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Exceptional and other items after tax, for 
continuing and discontinued operations, totalled $127 .0 million (2016: 
$316.0 million). Significant items include restructuring expenses of 
$28.0 million (2016: $9.9 million), comprising $15.7 million as a result 
of restructuring ERO’s Abu Dhabi facility and $12.3 million associated 
with ERO’s footprint rationalisation programme and actions taken to 
address the costs previously associated with supporting ASIG;  
$93.8 million of non-cash amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
(2016: $98.6 million); and $22.5 million loss after tax on discontinued

operations (2016: $97 .5 million). The impact of the T ax Cuts and Jobs 
Act in the US has also been presented as exceptional and other items 
tax charge as set out below.
Acquisitions and disposals
During 2017 the Group completed four acquisitions for a total initial 
consideration of $14.1 million (of which $0.7 million was deferred),  
net of cash acquired. Further details of these acquisitions are given in 
note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquisitions 
represented the purchase of manufacturing rights and associated 
processes from UTC Aerospace Systems, Curtiss-Wright Defense 
Solutions, Pratt & Whitney Canada and Ultra Electronics by our  
Ontic business. 
Signature has also invested in Victor, a leading on-demand private jet 
charter company.
Interest
Net interest expense decreased by $1.8 million to $62.1 million  
(2016: $63.9 million). Interest cover on a covenant basis increased to 
8.4x (2016: 7 .2x), due to the decreased interest on the lower drawn debt.
Tax and Dividends
The underlying tax rate increased to 17 .5% (2016: 16.5%). This increase 
was primarily due to a greater proportion of taxable profits being 
generated in the US and limitations on the deduction of interest 
expense in the UK.
The impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US  
is broadly neutral for the Group’s underlying effective tax rate in 
2018. As a result of US tax reform legislation the Group has incurred 
a one-time, exceptional charge of $20.5 million, primarily related to 
the non-cash revision of US deferred tax assets and liabilities. The 
Group has revalued US deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2017 , 
primarily relating to amortisation of intangibles to reflect the reduction 
in headline US tax rates, and written off deferred tax assets primarily 
relating to deferred interest as a result of the tax reform restrictions  
on interest deductibility which is now capped at 30% of US EBITDA.  
In addition, the exceptional tax charge includes a $3.0 million  
one-time repatriation tax charge on the unremitted earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries controlled by a US entity. This one-time tax 
charge is payable over eight years and has minimal impact on the 
Group’s cash tax rate. 
The Group’s cash tax payments for 2017 amounted to $41.8 million 
(2016: $15.8 million). The increase in cash tax payments resulted 
from the increased taxable profits of the Group and certain one-time 
payments including settlement of tax payable ($8.4 million) on the 
taxable gain arising from the disposal of ASIG’s US operations.
At the time of the interim results, the Board declared an increased interim 
dividend of 3.81 cents (H1 2016: 3.63 cents). The Board is now proposing 
a final dividend of 9.59 cents per share (2016: 9.12 cents), up 5.2% on an 
underlying basis reflecting the Board’s progressive dividend policy and 
its continued confidence in the Group’s future growth prospects.
Pensions
The Group paid net $8.4 million of pension payments during the period, 
of which $4.0 million represented pension deficit payments reflecting 
the agreed payments to the schemes.
The actuarial valuation of the UK plan at 31 March 2015 indicated a 
funding deficit of £45 million ($66 million) at 31 March 2015 exchange 
rates. The Group paid £4.3 million of pension payments in to the UK 
plan, of which £3.0 million represented pension deficit payments, 
reflecting the agreed payments to the scheme under an agreement to 
make additional contributions of £0.3 million per annum bringing the 
annual deficit contribution to £3.0 million, and £2.7 million thereafter 
until 2034 in accordance with the asset-backed funding arrangement 
established in 2014.
As at 31 December 2017 , the accounting net deficit across the UK and 
US plans was $71.7 million (2016: $82.8 million). The reduction in the 
net deficit of $11.1m since 31 December 2016 reflects the favourable 
impact of better than expected returns on plan assets and employer 
contributions, more than offsetting unfavourable impacts from foreign 
exchange movements, net interest costs and administration expenses. 
In 2017 the largest of the US plans undertook an exercise during the 
year whereby lump sum transfer payments were paid out to a number 
of members in order to discharge the associated liabilities. This resulted 
in a deficit reduction for that particular plan of $2.1 million. 
Cash Flow and Debt
At 31 December 2017 the Group had net debt of $1,167 .1 million  
(2016 net debt: $1,335.3 million), the decrease being due to the strong 
operating performance of the business and the net proceeds from the 
disposal of ASIG whilst continuing to invest in the existing businesses 
and new Ontic licences. The Group’s net debt to underlying EBITDA 
ratio at 31 December 2017 was 2.6x on a reported basis (2016 3.2x  
on a reported basis) and 2.6x on a covenant basis (2016: 3.1x on a 
covenant basis). 
Net cash flow from operating activities of $339.0 million is lower than 
the prior year (2016: $37 4.9 million) primarily as a result of the outflow in 
working capital compared to the inflow in the prior year and the disposal 
of ASIG in January 2017 . Free cash flow decreased by $3.5 million to 
$220.6 million (2016: $224.1 million) as a result of the working capital 
movements as previously noted and increased tax payments, largely 
offset by increased earnings, decreased capital expenditure and lower 
interest payments. Capital expenditure amounted to $80.3 million 
(2016: $102.4 million). Principal items included the investment in 
our FBOs at Boeing Field, Palm Beach and Nashville, our new engine 
overhaul and testing facility at Dallas Fort Worth and our Ontic facility 
in Cheltenham to support the successful transition of GE Aviation 
avionics licences. 
Other significant cash flow items include the proceeds from disposal 
of ASIG of $170.5 million, net of fees, the acquisition of subsidiaries, net 
of cash acquired of $75.7 million (2016: $2,098.2 million) and dividend 
payments of $130.7 million (2016: $124.3 million).

The Group policy with respect to cash deposits is only to have deposits

Financial Risk Management and Treasury Policies
The main financial risks of the Group relate to funding and liquidity, 
interest rate fluctuations and currency exposures. A central treasury 
department that reports directly to the Group Finance Director and 
operates according to objectives, policies and authorities approved by 
the Board, manages these risks.
The overall policy objective is to use financial instruments to manage 
financial risks arising from the underlying business activities and 
therefore the Group does not undertake speculative transactions for 
which there is no underlying financial exposure. More details are set out 
in note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Funding and Liquidity
The Group’s operations are financed by a combination of retained 
profits, equity and borrowings. Borrowings are generally raised at  
Group level and then lent to operating subsidiaries. The Group 
maintains sufficient available committed borrowing facilities to meet 
its forecasted funding requirements.
The Group has a $650 million (2016: $650 million) multi-currency 
revolving credit facility. In addition, the Group has $500 million 
(2016: $500 million) of US private placement loan notes. These debt 
obligations and facilities are subject to cross-default. In addition, 
the Group maintains uncommitted facilities for daily working capital 
fluctuation purposes.
At the end of 2017 , the Group had committed bank facilities of  
$1,353 million (2016: $1,463 million) of which $818 million  
(2016: $1,043 million) was drawn. The reduction in committed bank 
facilities of $110 million was due to the part prepayment of the 3-year 
tranche of the Acquisition Financing Agreement (“AFA”) from the 
proceeds of the ASIG disposal in accordance with the terms of the  
loan documentation.
The revolving credit facility, AFA facilities and the US private placement 
loan notes are subject to two main financial covenants: maximum net 
debt to underlying EBITDA of 3.5x and minimum net interest cover of 
3.0x underlying EBITDA. The facilities and the loan notes do permit the 
use of an ‘acquisition spike’ which allows for the net debt to be up to 
4.0x underlying EBITDA for two test periods following activation of the 
‘acquisition spike’. The ‘acquisition spike’ was activated in February 2016 
and the financial covenant test for net debt to underlying EBITDA was 
4.0x at the 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016 test dates. The net 
debt to underlying EBITDA covenant reverted back to 3.5x from the  
30 June 2017 test date. The Group has operated within these covenants.
The rationale for preparing the financial statements on a going concern 
basis is set out on page 85.
Capital Structure
Post the $2.1bn acquisition of Landmark Aviation and the disposal of 
ASIG, the Group is increasingly focused on the B&GA markets, and we 
communicated at our preliminary results announcement in March 2017 
that we would undertake a review of capital structure during the year. 
The review is now complete and we believe an increase in our target 
leverage range is appropriate based on the strong and robust cash flow 
fundamentals of the Group.
Our balance sheet remains strong and the Group will now manage net 
debt in the range of 2.5x to 3.0x underlying adjusted EBITDA which we 
believe gives flexibility and headroom for the investment requirements 
of the Group and the cyclicality within the B&GA market. The Group has 
performed within this target range during 2017 following the disposal 
of ASIG with net debt to underlying adjusted EBITDA at 31 December 
2017 being 2.6x, in line with expectations. The new target range 
provides up to 1.0x headroom against the Group’s net debt to adjusted 
underlying EBITDA banking covenant.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The interest rate exposure arising from the Group’s borrowing and 
deposit activity is managed by using a combination of fixed and variable 
rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps. The Group’s policy 
with respect to interest rate risk management is to fix portions of 
debt for varying periods based upon the debt maturity profile and an 
assessment of interest rate trends. At the end of 2017 , approximately 
55% (2016: 65%) of the Group’s total borrowings were fixed at weighted 
average interest rates of 3.5% (2016: 3.3%) for a weighted average 
period of three years (2016: three years).
Currency Risk Management
The Group’s policy is to hedge all significant transactional currency 
exposures through the use of forward currency contracts. The Group’s 
policy is to draw its borrowings principally in US dollars in order to match 
the currency of its cash flows, earnings and assets, which are principally 
denominated in US dollars.

Revenue in Flight Support increased by 13.8% to $1,643.0 million  
(2016: $1,443.2 million), reflecting a net positive impact of higher fuel 
prices and foreign exchange movements and $53.0 million contribution 
from 2016 acquisitions being an additional one month contribution  
from Landmark Aviation and an additional three months contribution 
from the acquisition of four FBOs in Italy. Flight Support’s organic 
revenue growth of 3.8% for the full year reflected good growth in the  
US B&GA market generally with movements up 3.7% and European 
B&GA movements up 7.3% during the year. 
Underlying operating profit in Flight Support increased by 12.0% 
to $329.4 million (2016: $294.0 million), driven by continued strong 
underlying operational performance in Signature Flight Support and an 
$11.6 million contribution from acquisitions. Underlying operating profit 
includes our Signature TECHNICAir™ and our aircraft management 
and charter business which is accounted for as a joint venture. On an 
organic basis, adjusting for acquisitions ($11.6 million), FX ($0.6 million) 
and disposals ($7.8 million), underlying operating profit increased by 
11.3%. Underlying operating margins were slightly lower due to the 
increase in fuel prices and disposal of FBOs in 2016 which were equity 
accounted. Underlying operating margins adjusted for constant fuel 
prices and disposals increased by 140 basis points to 20.0%. 
Statutory operating profit of $247 .1 million increased by 39.4% (2016: 
$177.3 million). This is a result of strong organic growth plus the impact 
of acquisitions, net of disposals and a reduction in exceptional and other

items, primarily lower amortisation of acquired intangible assets and the 
non-repeat of acquisition integration costs from 2016. Operating cash 
flow for the division was $313.4 million (2016: $276.8 million) due principally 
to strong organic operating profit growth and reduced capital expenditure. 
Return on invested capital increased to 12.2% (2016: 11.2%) reflecting 
the strong improvement in underlying operating profit during the year.

Signature Flight Support’s locations delivered another strong 
performance in a good growth environment, as we started to capture 
the benefits of our strong and customer-relevant network. 
Against a background of a US B&GA market that grew 3.1% in the first 
half, Signature performed broadly in line with the market despite a 
short-term negative impact on fuel volumes while negotiations with 
Signature’s customers were undertaken and the loss of the Santa 
Ana FBO in April 2017 . In the second half, Signature outperformed its 
principal US B&GA market with 4.4% organic revenue growth against 
the market which grew at 4.1% reflecting both the positive customer 
response to the enlarged network proposition and the good progress 
with our commercial renegotiations.
The hurricanes in August and September – Harvey, Irma and Maria – 
caused minimal impact overall across the Signature network and we 
were able to re-establish services quickly and provide support for the 
rescue and relief efforts. Damage to our FBO network was limited 
although there were some excess payments made on our insurance 
policies by Signature. 
Signature is well positioned to focus on optimising its unique and  
high-quality global network of FBOs and line maintenance locations, 
through the provision of a broader range of B&GA services to our 
extensive customer base and enhancing network performance to 
accelerate value creation. The unique Signature network has the 
unmatched ability to satisfy the needs of our customers at many more 
locations that they want to fly to, supporting anticipated continued 
outperformance in 2018 and beyond.
In 2017 Signature expanded its affiliate FBO programme, Signature 
Select®. It signed an extended licence agreement with Fly Across at 
Toluca International Airport in Mexico, just a 30-minute drive from 
Santa Fe, the country’s financial and business district. This location 
increases the Signature Select® network to 19 locations globally and we 
continue to look for further opportunities to expand this proposition.
Signature has continued to invest in its current network, with the 
successful opening of its newly constructed FBO with premium hangar 
space to satisfy the growing tenant demand at Boeing Field, Seattle 
which completed in June 2017 . It also secured a new strategic lease at 
Washington Dulles International Airport.  
BBA Aviation has also recently taken a minority investment in Victor,  
a leading on-demand private jet charter company. Through this 
minority investment, which concurrently acquired RocketRoute, a 
global flight planning and trip support business, we are committed 
to being at the forefront of advances in data and technology enabled 
customer service. As the demographic using and chartering private 
jets continues to change, our ability to utilise technology will ensure we 
bring the best possible service to our many discerning customers.
There are now 198 locations in Signature’s global network.

* Operating cash flow represents net cash inflow from operating activities less purchase of property,

disposal of property, plant and equipment and add back taxes paid.
In Aftermarket Services, revenue grew by 3.1% to $727.6 million  
(2016: $705.9 million). Underlying operating profit of $65.3 million  
(2016: $42.0 million) was driven by Ontic which now represents c.85%  
of the division’s profits, supported by a much-improved performance  
in ERO. Underlying operating margins grew strongly during the year  
to 9.0% (2016: 5.9%).
On an organic basis, adjusting for FX ($1.3 million) and acquisitions 
($11.5 million) the Aftermarket Services underlying operating profit was 
up 32.2% driven primarily by a recovery in ERO through cost-reduction 
actions and supported by organic growth in Ontic on military licences. 
Operating profit of $33.6 million has increased (2016: $22.2 million). This 
is a result of improved organic operating performance in Ontic and ERO 
and the contribution from acquisitions in Ontic.
Operating cash flow for the division was $66.0 million (2016: $34.0 million) 
which reflected the improved operating performance, lower capital 
expenditure and the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the Forest 
Park facility in Dallas. Return on invested capital increased to 11.3% 
(2016: 6.9%) reflecting the improved operating performance.

Ontic, our legacy support business, continues to perform well, with 
revenue up 26.9% to $208.8 million (2016: $164.5 million). On an organic 
basis, revenue was up 4.5%.
The 2017 performance includes a significant contribution from the 
portfolio of legacy avionics products acquired from GE Aviation in 
December 2016. This business has been substantially transitioned  
into Ontic’s existing UK facility in Cheltenham over the course of 2017 .  
The cash payment of $60.7 million for this acquisition was made in 
January 2017 . Furthermore, it was a strong year for cyclical military 
demand – B52 actuation and C130 Radar units shipped in significant 
quantities during 2017 which we do not expect to repeat in 2018.  
We expect the non-repeat element of the cyclical military orders to 
counter growth from new licences acquired at the end of 2017 .
Ontic has further extended its licensed product portfolio during the year 
with the addition of important new licences; Ontic has recently signed a 
second product licence with Ultra Electronics for the OE manufacturing 
and aftermarket support for various military cockpit controls, switches 
and indicators. We also have a new licence agreement with UTC 
Aerospace Systems for its wound motor product lines, part of the 
electric power systems business segment. This adds significant  
military content to our portfolio.
In December 2017 , we acquired Curtiss-Wright’s product line for the 
Ethernet Switch Unit, which grows not only our military platform content 
but also our product portfolio with Curtiss-Wright. Furthermore, Ontic 
has received certification by the US Department of Transportation 
Federal Aviation Administration for its Singapore facility which serves 
as both a repair station and storefront for a variety of OEM-licenced and 
acquired products, including fuel measurement systems on the Boeing 
B737 Classic and B777 , Fokker 50, 70 and 100 as well as the Airbus A300, 
A318, A319 and A320. In 2018 we have also signed a first product licence 
with Racal Acoustics, part of Esterline Corporation, for various military 
and civil avionics products including cockpit communication control 
systems. The products will transition to our Cheltenham facility  
during 2018.
These acquisitions support Ontic’s strategy to deliver continued 
profitable growth in mature avionics and electronics products with high 
intellectual property content. Ontic continues to assess a strong pipeline 
of opportunities in relation to new products and licence adoptions.

Engine Repair & Overhaul’s revenue decreased by 4.2% to $518.8 million 
(2016: $541.4 million). Conditions in ERO’s market remain challenging 
and, while organic revenue was down for the year, we have improved 
our market share on the majority of programmes. ERO’s operating 
performance in the first half was stable against the second half of 2016 
but much improved on the first half of 2016. Operating performance 
in the second half delivered significant improvement in line with 
expectations resulting from market share gains (PT6, TFE, PW300 and 
Tay) and cost efficiencies from the footprint rationalisation programme.
Volumes in legacy mid-cabin and rotorcraft engine overhauls 
remained depressed throughout the year, with reduced workscopes 
and competitive market pricing. In the first half of the year ERO saw 
improvements in demand for overhauls in certain Pratt & Whitney and 
Tay markets, as well as market share gains for certain Pratt & Whitney 
engines. However, while our market share has improved on the majority 
of programmes, we continue to see lower engine inputs, primarily on 
JT15D, PW500 and PW100. Time between engine overhauls continues 
to extend and the increase of power by the hour contracts either 
through the OEMs or third parties increases the competitive tension.
ERO’s footprint rationalisation programme is nearly complete and it 
will undergo its final facility consolidation in 2018. The new overhaul 
facility at Dallas Fort Worth Centre (DFW) is successfully delivering the 
overhaul operations formerly undertaken at the Neosho and Forest 
Park facilities. The sale of the Forest Park site for $17.4m completed at 
the end of 2017 . Looking forward the combination of an efficient, lower 
cost, flexible engine overhaul and test facility in DFW and a renewed 
focus on customer service will drive further improvement in financial 
performance and allow us to execute our strategy for value creation 
from our ERO business. 
We have recently made the decision to close our engine overhaul 
operations in Abu Dhabi given insufficient market demand to support 
our facility on current engine authorisations. We expect the facility to 
complete its final engine overhaul in April.
As part of BBA Aviation’s focus on driving long-term sustainable value 
for our shareholders, we are currently conducting a strategic review of 
our ERO business, although there is no certainty that this will result in  
a transaction being agreed.
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board on 28 February 2017 
and signed on its behalf by:

Corporate Governance Report
42
Governance is an important contributor to the 
success of the Group and we take pride in what 
we do and in the way we conduct our business 
and deliver our strategic objectives. The Board 
fully supports the BBA Aviation values and 
the Board is committed to ensuring that high 
standards of ethical behaviour and governance 
are maintained throughout the Group.
The Corporate Governance section of the report follows the same 
format that was introduced last year and includes an at-a-glance 
section, a section setting out our compliance with obligations under 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and a report on each of the 
Committees introduced by the Committee Chair.
David Crook, who was the Group Financial Controller, succeeded 
Mike Powell as Group Finance Director. David became Group Finance 
Director and joined the Board on 1 June 2017. I would like to formally 
record my thanks to Mike Powell for his contribution to the Company. 
At the end of June, Simon Pryce, Group Chief Executive, stepped 
down as Group Chief Executive and retired from the Board earlier than 
anticipated. Wayne Edmunds was appointed as Interim Group Chief 
Executive. On 2 January 2018 we announced Mark Johnstone as Group 
Chief Executive from 1 April 2018. Wayne will remain on the Board as a 
non-executive director, but will not be regarded as independent. Wayne 
will not be a member of the Audit and Risk Committee, the Nomination 
Committee or the Remuneration Committee but will be invited to 
attend these Committee meetings as appropriate.
Chairman’ s 
Introduction
“ I am pleased to introduce  
the Corporate Governance 
Statement for 2017. The Board 
is responsible for ensuring 
the long-term success of BBA 
Aviation and the delivery of 
long-term, sustainable value 
for all of our stakeholders.”
 Sir Nigel Rudd,
 Chairman 43
The Board considers that its own continuing effectiveness is vital 
to the Group delivering its strategic objectives. My role as Chairman  
has been to provide leadership to ensure that it is possible to make 
high-quality decisions. I am responsible for leading the Board and 
ensuring ongoing improvement in the Board’s effectiveness. I am 
supported by all the directors, but particularly by Susan Kilsby, as the 
Senior Independent Director. Susan meets independently with the 
other directors and is available, if required, to meet with shareholders. 
As a Board, and as individual directors, we strive to continuously 
improve the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees in  
support of the Group’s objective of delivering exceptional long-term 
sustainable value for all our stakeholders.
The Board spent a significant proportion of its time in 2017 , through the 
Nomination Committee, on the search for a new Group Chief Executive 
and a new non-executive director, which resulted in the announcement 
of a new Group Chief Executive in Mark Johnstone and two new  
non-executive directors in Amee Chande and Emma Gilthorpe.
We conducted a Board effectiveness exercise towards the end of 2017 . 
As a result of the exercise the timings of Board Committee meetings 
are being changed, wherever possible,to provide more time between 
the Committee and Board meetings and there remains a continued 
focus on succession at all levels of the Group. Having used Clare 
Chalmers of Independent Audit as an external facilitator in 2015 and 
used her to support the process in 2016, the effectiveness review in 
2017 was conducted by the Company Secretary with support from 
Oliver Ziehn of Lintstock, a corporate governance advisory firm.
During 2017 , Susan Kilsby has consulted extensively with shareholders 
on the remuneration policy that will be put to the AGM for consideration 
in May. The Annual Statement starting on page 56 of the Remuneration 
Report sets out in detail the Committee’s thinking behind the changes. 
The Board unanimously supports the proposed policy, that seeks 
to align the interests of executive directors and shareholders and is 
structured to promote the long-term success of the Company. 
We keep Group policies and procedures under regular review, bearing  
in mind the ever-evolving business and governance environment that 
we operate in, as well as drawing on the range of experience offered  
by Board members.
The Corporate Governance Statement that follows provides more 
details about our governance policies and procedures, about the 
structure of our Board Committees and the areas our meetings  
focus on.
We note the proposed changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code 
that are the subject of consultation through the first part of 2018. The 
Board will review the changes once finalised and decide what changes 
need to be made to the governance processes before the changes take 
effect from 1 January 2019.
Board members appreciate their interactions with shareholders and 
listen carefully to any comments. I welcome your comments on this 
Corporate Governance Statement and on the 2017 Annual Report 
more generally.

Responsibilities of the Board and its Committees
The Board
There is a schedule of matters reserved to the Board that includes 
matters such as: strategy and objectives; Group policies; annual 
budgets; dividends; acquisitions and disposals of businesses (over a 
certain size); expenditure over a certain limit; financial results; and the 
appointment and removal of directors and the Company Secretary.
This schedule of matters is reviewed by the Board each year. Matters 
outside the scope of this formal schedule are decided by management 
in accordance with delegated authorities approved by the Board and  
the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Board recognises its responsibilities for monitoring the culture of 
the organisation, ensuring that the values remain relevant and that they, 
in conjunction with the Group Chief Executive, set the tone from the top. 
Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee may consider any matter that might 
have a financial impact on the Group. However, its primary roles are to:
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s systems of 
internal control and risk management process;
• monitor the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Audit function;
• review and assess the Company’s external audit function, including 
the annual audit plan and results of the external audit and the 
independence of the external auditor;
• monitor the integrity and audit of the Company’s financial 
statements and any formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s financial performance, including a review of the 
significant financial reporting judgements contained within them;
• review the contents of the Annual Report and Accounts and advise 
the Board on whether, taken as a whole, they are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy;
• review the Going Concern Statement and the Viability Statement  
on behalf of the Board; and
• establish and oversee the Company’s arrangements for employee 
disclosure and fraud prevention within the Company.
 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has two principal functions:
• making recommendations to the Board on the framework and Board 
policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, executive directors and 
other designated senior executives; and
• determining, on behalf of the Board, the specific remuneration 
package for each of the executive directors, including pension  
rights and any compensation payments.
Nomination Committee
The primary responsibilities of the Nomination Committee are to:
• make appropriate recommendations to the Board for the 
appointment or replacement of additional directors;
• devise and consider succession planning arrangements for directors 
and senior executives; and
• regularly review the structure, size and composition of the Board and 
make recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes.
Implementation Committee
The Implementation Committee comprises any two directors  
(normally the two executive directors) and it is authorised to implement 
Board decisions.
Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee comprises any two directors or any director 
and the Company Secretary and has responsibility for determining, on a 
timely basis, the disclosure treatment of material information.
  48
Compliance 
Statement
The Company applies the principles of Corporate Governance set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published in April 2016 (the Code), which is the version 
of the Code that applies to the 2017 financial year. The Directors can confirm 
compliance throughout 2017 with all relevant provisions set out in the Code.
The section below sets out how the Company has complied with the main principles 
of the Code and the disclosures are set out in the order they appear in the Code
Section A: Leadership
A1: Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the Company. Its 
role includes providing effective leadership and agreeing the Group’s strategic aims. 
It assesses business opportunities and seeks to ensure that appropriate controls  
are in place to examine and manage risk.
It is responsible for reviewing management’s performance and oversees senior level 
succession planning within the Group. The Board is also responsible for setting the 
Company’s values and standards, ensuring that the Company’s obligations to its 
shareholders are met.
As described in the ‘at a glance section’ there is a schedule of matters reserved to the 
Board and this is reviewed annually by the Board in December. The following sections 
of the Corporate Governance Report discuss the work of the Board and the work of 
its Committees.
The Company has arranged insurance for the directors and officers of the Company.
A2: Division of responsibilities
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are distinct. The division of 
responsibilities is reviewed annually by the Board and is available on the Corporate 
Governance Section of the BBA Aviation plc website. The statement was last 
reviewed by the Board in December 2017. In summary, Sir Nigel Rudd, the Chairman, 
is responsible for leading the Board and its effectiveness; the Chief Executive is 
responsible for the implementation of the Group strategy and running the businesses.
A3: The Chairman
Sir Nigel sets the Board agenda in consultation with the Chief Executive, the 
Group Finance Director, other Board members and the Company Secretary. 
On appointment as Chairman in May 2014 the Board considered Sir Nigel to be 
independent in accordance with the Code provisions.
A4: Non-executive directors
Susan Kilsby has been the Senior Independent Director throughout the year.  
Peter Ventress became Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee from 1 July  
when Wayne Edmunds became the Interim CEO following Simon Pryce’s  
retirement from the Board.
During the year, the Chairman met the non-executive directors on a one-to-one 
basis. Additionally, the Chairman met the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors on a number of occasions. There were several occasions during 
the year when discussions between various directors took place on an informal basis. 
In addition to formal Board meetings, the Chairman maintains regular contact during 
the year with the other directors to discuss specific issues.
As part of the Board effectiveness review (see B6 below), Susan Kilsby collated the 
feedback on the Chairman, discussed this with the other non-executive directors 
and provided feedback to the Chairman.
Section B: Effectiveness
B1: The Composition of the Board
At the date of this report, the Board comprises the Chairman, six independent  
non-executive directors and two executive directors, who contribute a wide range  
of complementary skills and experience.
The Board has concluded that Amee Chande, Peter Edwards, Emma Gilthorpe, 
Susan Kilsby, Peter Ratcliffe and Peter Ventress are independent in character  
and judgement.
The Company has formal procedures in place to ensure that the Board’s powers to 
authorise conflicts are operated effectively and such procedures have been followed 
throughout 2017 and to the date of this report.
B2: Appointments to the Board
There is a rigorous and transparent procedure for appointments that is described  
in the Report of the Nomination Committee on page 51. Amee Chande and  
Emma Gilthorpe were appointed to the Board on 1 January 2018 following  
a comprehensive process.
The process to select the new Group Chief Executive, Mark Johnstone, who will join 
the Board on 1 April, is also described in the report from the Nomination Committee. 
B3: Commitment
The Chairman and each of the non-executive directors have provided assurances to 
the Board that they remain fully committed to their respective roles and can dedicate 
the necessary amount of time to attend to the Company’s affairs. The Board is 
satisfied that each of the directors is able to devote sufficient time to the Company 
and its affairs to effectively discharge their duties.
Letters of appointment for the non-executive directors are available for inspection 
by shareholders at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Company’s 
registered office.
Executive directors must obtain the prior consent of the Board before accepting  
a non-executive directorship in any other company. The Board understood  
Wayne Edmunds’ non-executive commitments when they asked him to take on  
the Group Chief Executive role on an interim basis.
B4: Development
There is a written framework for the induction of new directors which includes 
site visits, meetings with senior management and advisers, and the provision of 
corporate documentation. The focus of any induction programme is tailored to the 
background of the new director concerned. The induction programmes for the new 
directors are described in more detail on page 50.
The Board and its Committees are kept informed of Corporate Governance and 
relevant regulatory developments as they arise and receive topical business 
briefings. The Board also keeps itself informed about the Company’s activities 
through a structured programme of visits and presentations from each of the 
businesses within the Group and from the Group’s function leaders.
Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Statement 49
The Board Effectiveness Review covered training needs. If any training needs 
are identified, then plans are put in place and the Company provides appropriate 
resources for developing and updating the directors’ knowledge and skills.
The Board believes that the identification of individual training and development 
needs is primarily the responsibility of each individual director, bearing in mind the 
range of experiences and skills that are developed by their differing portfolios.
B5: Information and support
The Chairman takes responsibility for ensuring the directors receive accurate,  
timely and clear information, with Board and Committee papers being circulated 
sufficiently in advance of meetings.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, 
and the Board has established a procedure whereby directors wishing to do so 
in furtherance of their duties may take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense. The Company arranges appropriate insurance cover in  
respect of legal actions against its directors. The Company has also entered into 
indemnities with its directors, as described on page 82.
B6: Evaluation
In 2017, the Company Secretary conducted the Board evaluation with support from 
Lintstock, a governance advisory firm. The directors each completed a questionnaire 
covering a wide range of topics. The outputs were written up and discussed at the 
Board meeting in November. 
Overall, the conclusion from the Board evaluation and appraisal process was positive 
and it was felt the Board and its Committees were operating effectively. The Board 
asked the Company Secretary to review the arrangements for the Committee 
meetings to create more time between the Committee meetings and the Board 
meetings. The Board recognised succession planning as an area that continues to 
require focus through 2018.
In November 2017, the Board also reviewed the evaluation findings from 2016 and 
noted progress had been made in all areas, but as noted above will continue to focus 
on succession in 2018.
B7: Re-election
The Board has decided that all Board members will retire at the AGM and all  
(with the exception of Peter Ratcliffe who is retiring from the Board) will stand for  
re-election at the 2018 AGM. The Board believes that each of such directors  
should be re-elected by shareholders, because each continues to be effective  
and demonstrates commitment to their role.
Section C: Accountability
C1: Financial and business reporting
The Directors’ responsibility statement for preparing the report and accounts is set 
out on page 88.
The business model is within the Strategic Report on pages 10 and 11. The Going 
Concern and Viability Statements are set out on page 85.
C2: Risk management and internal control
The Board undertook a comprehensive review of the principal risks facing the 
Company and how the risks may impact the Company’s prospects. The Risk 
Management process is described in detail on pages 20–23.
Overall responsibility for systems of internal control rests with the Board. The Board 
reviewed the effectiveness and systems throughout the year and further information 
is set out on pages 54 and 55.
C3: Audit Committee and auditors
Compliance with the Code provisions in respect of the Audit Committee 
requirements and auditors is contained within the Audit and Risk Committee  
Report on pages 52–55.
Section D: Remuneration
Please refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report for further information and  
in particular:
D1: Level and components of remuneration
Pages 56–84.
D2: Procedure
Pages 56–84.
In addition, the fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the Board as a 
whole on the recommendation of the Group Chief Executive. No director is involved 
in deciding his or her own remuneration or fees.
Section E: Relations with shareholders
E1: Dialogue with shareholders
The Board is kept up to date on the views of BBA Aviation’s major shareholders. 
The executive directors undertake an annual programme of meetings with banks, 
institutional shareholders, fund managers and analysts to maintain a continuing 
dialogue with the Company’s providers of finance. The Board receives formal written 
reports from its brokers, the executive directors and the Head of Investor Relations 
regarding the views of shareholders following the roadshows that follow the 
preliminary and half-year results announcements and at other times as appropriate.
All non-executive directors, including the Senior Independent Director, are available 
to meet with major shareholders. The Chairman wrote to major shareholders ahead 
of the 2017 AGM offering them the opportunity to raise any issues or questions.  
The Chairman and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee also maintain 
contact, as required, with major shareholders about directors’ remuneration matters. 
In 2017, there was a comprehensive engagement programme on remuneration 
with shareholders accounting for over half of the issued share capital. The Board 
considers that its non-executive directors, including the Senior Independent 
Director, have a good level of understanding of the issues and concerns of major 
shareholders, as required by the Code.
E2: Constructive use of general meetings
The Company’s AGM is used as an opportunity to communicate with private 
investors. It is intended that the notice of the AGM and related papers are sent 
to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. Sir Nigel Rudd as 
Chairman of the Board and the Nomination Committee, Peter Ventress as Chairman 
of the Audit and Risk Committee, and Susan Kilsby as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and Senior Independent Director will each be available to answer 
questions, as appropriate, at the AGM in 2018. Shareholders can vote separately on 
each proposal. The Company counts all proxy votes cast in respect of the AGM and 
makes available the proxy voting figures (for, against and “vote withheld”) on each 
resolution. The voting results of the AGM, together with the details of proxy votes 
cast prior to the meeting, are made available on request and on the Company’s 
website. The results of the AGM voting are also announced to the market via a 
Regulatory News Service.
Directors’ Report

relevant chairman their views on the business of that meeting so that their position 
can be represented.
The Board held two additional meetings in 2017; the Remuneration Committee 
held four additional meetings and the Nomination Committee held five additional 
meetings. These additional meetings were well attended with only two individual 
absences at the 11 meetings.

The induction programmes for Amee Chande and Emma Gilthorpe have started and  
 will continue. 
Both Amee and Emma have undertaken site visits in the UK and held meetings with 
various members of the executive team. Amee spent two days in the USA, meeting 
members of the executive team and visiting the head office in Orlando and a number 
of the Group’s FBOs on the east coast.

are available on the Group’s website www.bbaaviation.com for the main Committees. 
The main responsibilities have been described in the At-a-glance section on pages 
46 and 47. The work of the Board Committees is described below.

Matters reserved and Committee terms of reference
In addition to the matters set out above at each meeting in 2017 the Board received 
reports from the Group Chief Executive and the Finance Director together with 
reports and updates on Health and Safety, litigation and potential mergers and 
acquisition activities. Members of the Executive Committee attended a number of 
meetings in 2017 to report to the Board on their areas of responsibility. Opportunities 
also exist throughout the year for informal contact between Board members and 
with members of the senior management team. 
In 2017, the Board held two of its scheduled seven meetings in the USA. The June 
meeting was held in Dallas, which allowed the Board to visit two of the GES sites and 
the Signature operation at Dallas Love Field. In November, the Board meeting was 
held at the FBO in San Diego allowing the Board to tour the FBO. The Site visits are 
an important part of the Board’s programme, enabling Board members to meet a 
number of employees from different parts of the Group. 
In November, the Board conducted a comprehensive review of the Group’s strategy 
and execution against the strategic plans. The Board also spent time discussing 
the findings of the Board evaluation and receiving an independent presentation on 
investors’ perceptions.
In December, the Board reviewed the objectives it set itself for 2017 which included 
monitoring strategic progress, executive succession planning, non-executive 
succession planning, capital allocation and capital structure, conduct and review and 
independent investor survey and addressing the Board Effectiveness actions from 
2016. The Board considers it has made good progress against its objectives during 
the year, although it recognises that succession planning will need to remain an area 
of focus.

Nomination Committee
The composition of the Nomination Committee is set out in the table below. During 
2017, the Nomination Committee comprised the Chairman and independent  
non-executive directors. Wayne Edmunds stepped down on his appointment as 
Interim Group Chief Executive.

The Nomination Committee meets as required and other directors attend 
Nomination Committee meetings by invitation.
The Nomination Committee had five scheduled meetings and four additional 
meetings in 2017. This was supplemented by informal meetings, individual briefings 
and meetings between Committee members. The additional meetings were related 
to the appointments of the Group Chief Executive, the CFO and additional  
non-executive directors.
How the Committee spends its time
During the year, the Committee continued to discuss matters relating to talent 
and succession planning for leadership development across the Group. Diversity 
is considered as one aspect of the succession planning discussions, together 
with developing and strengthening of the pipeline of talent within the Group and 
increasing the interaction between Board members and executive management and 
talented future executives.
Diversity
Diversity covers a variety of different elements, including professional and  
industry experience and an understanding of different geographical regions,  
ethnic backgrounds and genders. The Board does not believe that gender quotas  
(or any other quotas) effectively promote the development of appropriate and  
broad diversity. However, the Board does believe that an appreciation of the value of a 
diverse range of backgrounds is an important part of succession at all levels  
of the organisation.
Appointment term
Appointments of non-executive directors are made by the Board for an initial term 
of three years. This term is subject to the usual regulatory provisions and continued 
satisfactory performance of duties following the Board’s annual performance 
evaluation. Reappointment for a further term is not automatic but may be made by 
mutual agreement.
The appointment process
Group Chief Executive succession
The Committee was considering succession plans for the CEO role when it was 
agreed to bring forward Simon Pryce’s retirement from the Board. In order to address 
the immediate concern, the Committee recommended the appointment of Wayne 
Edmunds as Interim Group Chief Executive.
Having met a number of firms, the Committee appointed Korn Ferry to support the 
appointment of a permanent CEO. Korn Ferry supported the Committee in defining 
a detailed role profile and the skills required in the ideal Chief Executive Officer 
candidate. Korn Ferry prepared a long list of potential candidates and worked with the 
Committee to prepare a short list of candidates. Following assessments (including 
a CEO simulation exercise for the internal candidates), preliminary meetings and 
interviews with Korn Ferry, the Committee members met a number of internal and 
external candidates for formal interviews. The Committee discussed the decision in 
detail before making their recommendation to the Board. 
Korn Ferry’s only relationship with BBA Aviation plc was in respect of search, selection 
and recruitment. 
Group Finance Director succession
When Mike Powell resigned, the Nomination Committee were pleased, having 
evaluated a number of options, to recommend the appointment of David Crook,  
the former Group Financial Controller, as the successor to Mike Powell in the role  
of Finance Director. David was on the succession plan for the Group Finance  
Director role. 
Non-executive directors
The Board identified the need to search for a new non-executive director and 
agreed to appoint JCA Heidrick Struggles to assist with this search. The Nomination 
Committee considered a skills matrix to help them understand the existing balance 
of experience, skills, knowledge, independence and diversity of backgrounds on the 
Board. The Nomination Committee briefed the JCA team on the characteristics of 
an ideal candidate before a long list of candidates was drawn up. The Committee 
discussed the candidates and identified a number for interview. Members of 
the Committee conducted the interviews and the interviewed candidates were 
discussed by the Committee before making a recommendation to the Board that 
two new non-executive directors were appointed to the Board. 
JCA Heidrick Struggles are a signatory to the voluntary code of conduct for executive 
search firms on gender diversity and their only relationship with BBA Aviation plc was 
in respect of search, selection and recruitment. 
Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Statement 52
All members of the Audit and Risk Committee are independent non-executive 
directors. The Committee is well qualified with comprehensive experience 
of corporate finance matters, Peter Ratcliffe has a professional accountancy 
qualification and Peter Edwards has good relevant industry knowledge. The Board 
believes that the Committee has sufficient recent and relevant financial experience 
to discharge its duties.
Wayne Edmunds and Peter Ventress organised a handover when responsibilities 
changed at the end of June.
During 2017, the Audit and Risk Committee had five scheduled meetings, generally 
coinciding with key dates in the financial reporting and audit cycle. The meetings are 
minuted by the Company Secretary. The Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director, and Chief Risk Officer as well as the external auditor and the PwC 
partner responsible for the co-sourced Internal Audit function also generally attend 
the Audit and Risk Committee meetings by invitation. In 2017, the Audit and Risk 
Committee held confidential sessions with the Head of Group Internal Audit, and 
with the external auditor, but otherwise without management present. In addition, 
the Committee Chairman met with the external auditor, the Chief Risk Officer and 
Internal Audit on a number of occasions during the year and through to February 
2018. The Committee Chairman may call additional Audit and Risk Committee 
meetings at the request of any director or the external auditor.
How the Committee spends its time
The Audit and Risk Committee is routinely briefed on accounting and technical 
matters by senior management and by the external auditors. In 2017, briefings 
included the impact of new IFRS standards and in particular revenue recognition 
(IFRS 15) and accounting for leases (IFRS 16). 
The Audit and Risk Committee reviews twice-yearly reports on the Group’s key 
business risks and the Committee members (all of whom are also members 
of the Remuneration Committee) are aware of the importance of keeping the 
appropriateness of incentive structures under review. The Committee also  
assesses compliance with the Directors’ Responsibility Statements.
There is a twice-yearly formal report to the Committee on business ethics and 
compliance, which includes such matters as the review of the Group’s Disclosure  
of Unethical Conduct Policy, under which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns 
about possible improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. In addition,  
the Committee reviews reports on any items arising under that policy.
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on matters 
within its remit, including the remuneration and appointment of the external auditor. 
While the appointment of the external auditor is considered each year, it is the policy 
of the Committee to review the appointment in greater detail at least every five 
years. A tender process took place in 2014. The Committee considers a number of 
factors, including audit effectiveness at, both operating Company and Group-level: 
quality, continuity, expertise, depth of resources, and competitiveness of fees.  
The appointment of the Senior Statutory Auditor is rotated every five years and  
Ed Hanson will hand over to a new partner after the completion of the 2017 year-end 
audit work.
The Committee discharges its responsibilities through the review of written reports 
circulated in advance of meetings and by discussing these reports and any other 
matters with the relevant auditors and management.
Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee, as can be seen from the description of its role in the 
‘At-a-glance’ section above, discharges a number of key responsibilities on behalf 
of the Board and the Company. These include monitoring BBA Aviation’s financial 
reporting processes, overseeing the work of the Internal Audit team and reporting  
on the independence and objectivity of the external auditor.
While risk strategy and risk appetite are matters for the whole Board, the oversight 
of the processes that underpin risk assessment and internal control are matters that 
the Board delegates to this Committee. For the production of the 2017 Report and 
Accounts, the Audit and Risk Committee was asked by the Board to advise whether 
the Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable 
and that they provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy.
The Audit and Risk Committee also reviewed the Viability Statement and the 
supporting process on behalf of the Board.
The report of the Audit and Risk Committee is set out below.

Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Statement 53
Tax and the impact of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
The impact of the US tax cuts and Jobs Act was material to the Group’s financial 
statements. The impact of the change in legislation requires judgement and is 
dependent on long-term forecasts of the performance on the business in the US. 
The treatment and presentation of the changes as an exceptional item was also 
material to the Group’s continuing underlying effective tax rate.
The Committee reviewed analysis provided by management and the report of 
Deloitte LLP. The Committee was satisfied that the judgements made and the 
disclosures made in relation to them were appropriate.
Purchase price accounting
The Group completed a number of acquisitions during 2017. In each case the 
allocation of fair values to all acquired assets and liabilities is an area of significant 
judgement. Key to the judgements is the estimation of the related cash flows for 
each and every asset and liability acquired. The judgements are often inherently 
dependent on, and sensitive to, long-term forecasts of the performance of the 
underlying business. 
The Committee relied upon analysis provided by management both from the 
acquisition due diligence and the purchase price accounting exercise. The work of 
management was reported on by Deloitte LLP. The Committee was satisfied that the 
purchase price accounting and the disclosure made in relation to it were appropriate.
Provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory
The Group holds significant inventory across its operations, with $249.9 million of 
net inventory at 31 December 2017. This inventory is held at cost net of a provision 
for slow moving or obsolete inventory. The Group has a clear policy for inventory 
provisioning and the policy is applied on a consistent basis. This policy forms an 
important part of the audit by Deloitte LLP .
The Committee has confirmed through its enquiries of management and Deloitte 
that the policy remains appropriate and has been consistently applied.
Topics covered by the Committee during 2017 and to date in 2018 included:
• Review of any significant financial reporting issues and judgements 
in respect of the half-year results and year-end report and accounts 
(described in more detail below);
• Review of any significant matters raised by the internal auditors;
• Consideration of the audit fee and the balance between audit and  
non-audit fees;
• Annual review of the terms of reference of the Committee, of the 
schedule of the Committee’s agenda items for the forthcoming year,  
of the non-audit services policy and of BBA Aviation’s matrix of  
authority levels;
• Review of the effectiveness of Internal Audit and discussion of Group 
Internal Audit’s overall strategy;
• Auditor independence and audit effectiveness (described in more detail 
on page 54); and
• Systems of internal control (described in more detail starting on page 54).
The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed in December 2017 and no 
significant changes were made.
Significant financial reporting issues c onsidered  
by the Audit and Risk Committee
To aid its review, the Committee considers reports from the Group Finance Director 
and Group Financial Controller and also reports from the outcome of the half-year 
review and annual audit. The Committee supports Deloitte LLP in displaying the 
necessary professional scepticism its role requires. The primary areas of judgement 
considered by the Committee in relation to the 2017 financial statements and how 
these were addressed include:
• Recording of exceptional and other items within operating profit;
• Accounting for the disposal of ASIG; 
• Taxation and the impact of the US tax cuts and jobs act;
• Purchase price accounting; and,
• Provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory.
These issues were discussed with management and the external auditor in the July, 
September and December meetings when signing off on the auditor’s plan for the 
year-end, and no new areas were identified subsequently in the February meeting.
Recording of exceptional and other items within operating profit
The Group’s policy is to include certain items within operating profit within a middle 
column within the Income Statement. These items relate to restructuring activities, 
transaction costs associated with acquisitions, the amortisation of acquired 
intangibles and material non-recurring events.
The Committee reviewed analysis provided by management and the report  
of Deloitte LLP. The Committee was satisfied that the judgements made were 
consistent and aligned to the Group’s policy and the disclosures made in relation  
to them were appropriate.
Accounting for the disposal of ASIG
On 31 January 2017, the Group concluded the disposal of the ASIG business. In 2017 
the disposal accounting undertaken included judgements surrounding the residual 
commercial and transactional exposures retained by the Group. 
The Committee reviewed analysis provided by management and the report of 
Deloitte LLP. The Committee was satisfied that the judgements made and the 
disclosures made in relation to them were appropriate.
Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Statement 54
In December 2017, the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the non-audit services 
policy and adopted a more restrictive regime for non-audit services to match the 
latest guidance. The non-audit services policy is available on the Company’s website 
www.bbaaviation.com.
b. System of internal control.
Overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness rests with the Board. Management is accountable to the directors 
for monitoring this system and for providing assurance to the directors that it has 
done so. The system of internal control is essentially an ongoing process embedded 
in the Group’s businesses for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group, including social, environmental and ethical risks. The Group 
considers that it has adequate information to identify and assess significant risks and 
opportunities affecting its long and short-term value.
This ongoing process has been in place for the year ended 31 December 2017 and up 
to 28 February 2018 and the directors can therefore confirm that they have reviewed 
the effectiveness in accordance with the internal control requirements of the Code 
throughout that period.
The Group’s internal system of control is reviewed annually by the directors and 
accords with the FRC’s guidance ‘Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting’ (formerly known as the Turnbull Guidance). The 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. It can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss to the extent that it is appropriate, taking account of 
costs and benefits.
The principal risks and uncertainties which the Group faces are summarised on pages 
20–23, together with a description of their potential impact and mitigations in place. 
The main features of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems are 
listed below.
1.  Risks are identified through a detailed written self-assessment process carried 
out by division and by function. The process analyses risk into eight types 
covering strategic, operational, financial, people, compliance, governance,  
hazard and an ‘other’ category, including unpredictable, although with hindsight, 
often inevitable, events. They are recorded on risk registers together with  
the mitigations. 
2.  On a bi-annual basis, risk registers are refreshed, and the key risks at division and 
Group level are plotted on risk maps, which are discussed with senior business 
management, Divisional management and BBA Aviation’s Executive Committee 
in order to validate the risk profile. The validated risk maps are then discussed with 
the Audit and Risk Committee, together with key mitigation activities, and further 
mitigation, if any, is agreed.
  Group Internal Audit reviews the risk maps and risk registers and builds its annual 
audit plan from the risk profile. A transparent mapping is produced to link the key 
risks to the Internal Audit profile, setting out the rationale for the focus of Internal 
Audit activity. This is agreed annually with the Audit and Risk Committee.
  Based on this information, the Board reviews the risks and, if satisfied, confirms  
it is satisfied that the risks are appropriately mitigated. If this is not the case,  
the Board requests that management take further action.
Audit and accountability
a. Auditor independence and audit effectiveness
Central to the Audit and Risk Committee’s work is the review and monitoring of  
the external auditor’s independence and objectivity, and the effectiveness of the 
audit process.
The Committee carried out a formal effectiveness assessment in respect of work 
carried out during the year by the external auditor, including:
• the continuity and objectivity of the audit partners and audit team;
• the effectiveness of audit planning and execution;
• the role of management in ensuring an effective audit;
• communication with and support of the Audit and Risk Committee; and
• the formal reporting of the auditor.
The assessment was completed with input in the form of a survey of the key financial 
management team, including the divisional Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), the 
Group Financial Controller and the Group Tax Director, together with the Chairman  
of the Audit and Risk Committee.
Other members of the Audit and Risk Committee also input their views and it 
was concluded that the external audit for 2017 had provided appropriate focus 
and challenge on the primary areas of audit risk. Overall, the quality of the audit 
was assessed as “good”. The Audit and Risk Committee also carried out a self- 
assessment and believes that it has satisfied the requirements of the Code and 
the Guidance on Audit Committees published by the Financial Reporting Council 
in September 2012. The Committee has confirmed that during the year it had 
formal and transparent arrangements for considering corporate reporting, risk 
management and internal control principles and for maintaining an appropriate 
relationship with the external auditor.
One of the safeguards to ensure auditor objectivity and independence is the Group’s 
policy on the provision of non-audit services by its external auditor. The policy is 
reviewed each year and, since December 2012, the policy prohibits the Group’s 
external auditor from carrying out remuneration consultancy and tax planning work 
for the Group. The external auditor is also prohibited from carrying out a number 
of other services for the Group such as book-keeping, Internal Audit, valuations, 
actuarial services and financial systems design and implementation. The Company’s 
policy is not to use the external auditor for acquisition and due diligence work. 
However, where the Group considers it appropriate or where conflicts arise, suppliers 
other than the preferred supplier may be asked to tender. This would only include the 
external auditor in unusual and exceptional circumstances.
Non-audit fees paid or due to the external auditor are regularly reviewed by the 
Committee and those paid in 2017 are set out in note 2 to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements.
During 2017, if fees for non-audit projects within the scope of permitted tax services 
were expected to exceed £250,000, then the Audit and Risk Committee Chairman 
was required to pre-approve each project. In any event, specific project approval is 
required by the Committee Chairman for any such project where estimated fees 
exceed £100,000. Pre-approval would have been required for non-tax projects where 
fees are estimated to exceed £25,000.
Deloitte LLP has confirmed that all non-audit services they performed during the 
year were permitted by APB Ethical Standards and do not impair their independence 
or objectivity. On the basis of their own review of the services performed, the 
requirement of pre-approval and the auditor’s confirmation, the Committee is 
satisfied that the non-audit services currently provided by Deloitte LLP do not impair 
their independence and objectivity.
Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Statement 55
12.  A Group policies manual sets out policies and procedures concerning: business 
ethics, bribery and corruption, gifts and entertainment, equal opportunities 
and anti-harassment, competition law, legal policy, data privacy, Corporate 
Responsibility, market disclosure and communications and share dealing.
  A review of compliance with such policies by Group companies is carried out 
twice a year and senior executives are also required to confirm compliance with 
certain policies twice a year. Group policies are complemented by divisional 
and Company-led initiatives and are supplemented by the Group’s Disclosure 
of Unethical Conduct Policy, which includes a 24-hour “hotline” available to all 
employees. This is supported by a formal investigation protocol and regular 
reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee as part of the twice-yearly report 
on Business Ethics and Compliance. The Ethics Implementation Policy seeks 
to codify the overarching principles and processes that underlie the various 
elements set out in more detail in the Code of Business Ethics and the policies 
on bribery and corruption and gifts and entertainment. Compliance with all 
these policies and with the Group’s procedures concerning the appointment and 
remuneration of foreign agents is subject to review as considered necessary  
as part of the ongoing risk-based Internal Audit programme. The effectiveness  
of these policies is assessed alongside the risk review process described in  
item 1 above.
13.  A Group Safety Management System outlines policies, standards and 
procedures in conjunction with the business line procedure manuals of the 
operating companies which are applicable throughout the Group. Annual self- 
assessment and/or audits are carried out at Company level against the Group 
standards and business line procedures. Group-level HSE audits are performed 
to validate Company level compliance. An executive summary Health, Safety 
and Environmental (HSE) report is tabled at each meeting of the Executive 
Committee. The Board also receives a summary HSE report in addition to 
updates on HSE activities. These reports cover all Group companies and are 
prepared by the internal Group HSE function. Key HSE performance metrics are 
reviewed and verified annually by an independent third party organisation. Senior 
managers’ performance and related financial incentives are tied in part to their 
success against selected annual HSE improvement objectives. Further details 
about HSE matters are set out on the BBA Aviation website. BBA Aviation’s Group 
Internal Audit team includes a number of questions on Corporate Responsibility 
matters in the annual Control Risk Assessment questionnaire which is completed 
by each of the operating businesses.
The Corporate Governance Statement was approved by the Board on 28 February 
2018 and signed on its behalf by:
Sir Nigel Rudd,
Chairman
 
3.  An organisational structure is in place at both head office and divisional level which 
clearly defines responsibilities for operational, accounting, taxation, treasury, 
legal, company secretarial and insurance functions.
4.  An Internal Audit function undertakes a programme of risk-based reviews of 
controls and business processes. The role of Internal Audit is defined in a Group 
Internal Audit charter and this includes its terms of reference, the standards to 
which it adheres, the scope and coverage of its work and its reporting processes. 
The Audit and Risk Committee receives a report from Internal Audit at each 
meeting which includes opinions on the adequacy and effectiveness of controls, 
together with a summary of key issues, work schedules and any action required. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Audit and Risk 
Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of Internal Audit using 
outside specialists as well as self-assessment techniques.
  A co-sourcing arrangement exists with PwC, headed by a specialist PwC Internal 
Audit Partner who manages both BBA Aviation and PwC staff in the delivery of the 
Internal Audit service. This arrangement provides access to a broad range of skills 
and experience to support its effective delivery.
5.  A Group Finance Manual details accounting policies and financial controls 
applicable to all reporting units. The Group accounting policies are aligned with 
International Financial Reporting Standards and compliance with these policies  
is reviewed as part of the Internal Audit process.
6.  An annual budgeting exercise is carried out to set targets for each of the Group’s 
reporting units.
7.  Detailed management accounts are submitted monthly to management which 
measure actual performance against budget and forecasts. The monthly 
forecasts of sales, profits and operating cash are updated on a quarterly basis.  
A monthly report is provided to the Board, based on these management 
accounts, highlighting key issues and summarising the detailed financial 
information provided by the operating units. The integrity of management 
accounts with the underlying financial records is subject to review as part of  
the Internal Audit process.
8.  Capital expenditure is controlled by means of budgets, authorisation levels 
requiring the approval of major projects by the Board, and post-investment 
appraisals. The lessons learned from the post-investment appraisals are also 
shared with members of senior management.
9.  Defined procedures are laid down for investments, currency hedging, granting  
of guarantees and use of treasury products.
10.  A matrix defines the levels of authority for the Group’s senior executives and 
their direct reports in relation to acquisitions, capital expenditure, commercial 
and employee contracts and treasury matters. This is authorised by the Audit 
and Risk Committee on behalf of the Board and is reviewed on an annual basis. 
Compliance is reviewed as part of the Internal Audit process.
11.  All significant acquisitions and disposals of companies or businesses are 
approved by the Board.
Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Statement 56
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Introduction
During 2017, the main focus of the Remuneration Committee’s work has been 
finalising the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The new policy is described below 
and will be put to shareholders at the 2018 Annual General Meeting. The Committee 
has also dealt with a change of both the Group Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director.
In considering the new policy the Committee reviewed the principles of the existing 
policy that recognise, among other things: the cyclicality of our business; the 
importance of pay for performance; and that a significant element of remuneration 
for executive directors and the senior management team should be aligned to long-
term performance. These principles are unchanged and they are set out in full in the 
introduction to the policy on page 76. Although the Company is listed in London, the 
majority of the senior management team and the majority of the Group’s business 
is based in the United States and this, together with the views of shareholders, have 
been significant factors in the Committee’s decisions. 
New policy
As shareholders will recall we had initially anticipated that we would put a new policy to 
shareholders at the 2017 AGM. However, as we were still engaged with shareholders 
up to the deadline for the 2017 AGM we decided to continue with the consultation 
process before putting a new policy to shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM.
At the start of 2017, the Committee was confident that three of the proposed 
changes that had been subject to the earlier consultation had overwhelming support 
from shareholders. These changes were compatible with the existing policy and, 
accordingly, they were introduced for 2017. These changes are all carried forward into 
the new policy. They include:
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
We introduced total shareholder return (“TSR”) compared to the FTSE 250 as  
a third performance condition in addition to return on invested capital (“ROIC”) and 
earnings per share (“EPS”) growth. We also added a two-year holding requirement  
for LTIP awards to further align the interests of executive directors with those  
of shareholders.
Minimum Shareholding Requirement
We increased the shareholding requirement for executive directors from 200%  
of salary to 300% of salary.
Extended LTIP 
We decided that the ELTIP would not operate in 2017. In addition, it will not be part 
of the new policy. This reduces the maximum incentive opportunity under the new 
policy and simplifies the remuneration structure.
Directors’  
Remuneration

Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee 57
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
These changes were welcomed by shareholders, as can be seen in the vote for the 
2016 Annual Report on Remuneration which received 99.8% support.
Proposed Policy for 2018 and beyond
Our consultation with shareholders, representing over half of issued shares and 
the main shareholder representative bodies continued throughout 2017. The main 
focus of the consultation was on the Deferred Stock Plan and, in particular, on the 
performance conditions, the vesting profile, the maximum size of the award, and 
a corresponding adjustment to the maximum award under the LTIP. We made 
a number of changes to the proposed policy as a direct result of feedback from 
shareholders.
The Committee recognises shareholders’ sensitivity to quantum in the current 
market. In response to this sensitivity, the maximum opportunities under the 
incentive arrangements have been reduced under the new policy.
The table below summarises the changes in opportunities in variable remuneration:
Element of reward Existing policy Proposed policy Net annual change
Bonus 62.5% 65.0% +2.5%
DSP 72.5% 125.0% +52.5%
LTIP 190.0% 150.0% -40.0%
E-LTIP (110.0% every 3 years) 36.6% 0.0% -36.6%
TOTAL 361.6% 340.0% -21.6%
The maximum variable opportunity is being reduced from just over 360% of salary 
per year to 340% under the proposed policy. Whilst, the expected fair value of the 
new proposed policy is unchanged when measured against the current policy, the 
Committee believes that the proposed shape of the new incentives better supports 
the Company’s strategy over the next period and is better suited to an employee 
base that is predominantly based in the US. Details and rationale regarding the 
changes are set out below.
Bonus
Further to shareholder feedback on quantum, the Committee is now proposing that 
the maximum cash bonus opportunity remains broadly the same at 65% versus 
62.5%. The aspects of the policy governing the performance measures are  
materially the same.
DSP
Overview
The new policy proposes three changes to the DSP:
• an increase in the maximum size of the award from 72.5% of salary to 125%  
of salary;
• a change in the vesting profile from three equal annual instalments over three 
years, to a single vesting on (or after) the third anniversary of grant; and 
• the addition of a two-year holding period post vesting.
The Committee views the DSP as a long-term plan as, whilst the performance periods 
are annual, shares cannot be sold for five years following their award. In addition, a 
number of the strategic objectives will require multiple years to achieve. Therefore, 
whilst the Committee is measuring the steps in successful implementation on 
an annual basis under the DSP, this does not mean that they are not long-term 
objectives. The Committee takes the view that long-term strategic objectives need 
to be broken down into shorter milestones if they are to be successfully implemented. 
Therefore, whilst the performance targets are set on an annual basis, a number of 
objectives to which these performance conditions relate are multi-year. 
Setting performance conditions
The following points should be noted in respect of the Committee’s proposed 
approach to setting performance conditions and targets for the DSP under the  
new policy:
• where strategic and operational objectives are used, the Committee will ensure 
that a significant component of the targets set are capable of quantifiable 
assessment;
• the increase in the incentive opportunity will be accompanied by an appropriate 
increase in the stretch of the performance conditions; and
• the objectives and the performance against those objectives will be fully 
disclosed in the remuneration report in the following year.
New Executive Team
The DSP is particularly important given a new CEO and Finance Director as it will help 
facilitate the build-up of shares early in their tenure subject to performance which 
have to be retained for five years. In the Committee’s opinion, other benefits of the 
revised DSP are:
• Defers an annual incentive in shares that supports the build-up of a long-term 
locked-in shareholding aligning the interests of management with shareholders;
• Manages reward through the cyclicality of the business;
• Allows potential for award value to grow due to share price appreciation helping 
drive longer-term decision making; and
•  Facilitates malus and clawback provisions by having a significant proportion of the 
incentives earned deferred in shares and under the control of the Company post 
the determination of the reward for a particular year.
LTIP
As noted above, the Committee introduced two changes to the LTIP in 2017. 
These were the addition of a two-year holding period following a vesting and the 
introduction of TSR as a third performance condition. These two changes will 
continue under the new policy. The only additional change proposed under the new 
policy is the reduction in the maximum size of the award from 190% of salary to  
150% of salary.
The Committee has retained the LTIP as it wishes to ensure that a significant part of 
the incentives are based on long-term multi-year performance. This will help ensure 
that short-term performance is not prioritised over long-term sustainable value.
The Committee has included TSR in the LTIP performance conditions for the 2017 
award and intends to continue to use it under the new policy because TSR is aligned 
to shareholders’ ownership experience. The Committee recognises the range of 
shareholder views on TSR as a performance measure for LTIP awards and, having 
considered these differing views, on balance decided to include it. 
Overall view
 The Company now has a US-based Group Chief Executive and a predominantly 
US-based business and management team. The slight weighting of 56% of the total 
variable incentive opportunity to an annual assessment of performance under the 
new policy reflects the proposed increase of the maximum award under the DSP. 
This is a key component in the remuneration structures of our US competitors and 
necessary as we compete for talent in the US. Shareholders will be aware that it is 
very difficult for a UK listed company to implement US levels of equity compensation. 
The Committee, therefore, took the view that whilst the Company cannot compete 
on absolute quantum it would provide more competitive levels of deferred stock. 58
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Simon Pryce will receive a bonus pro-rated for the part of the year he was actively 
engaged as Group Chief Executive. David Crook’s bonus reflects that he was Group 
Financial Controller for five months of the year and Group Finance Director for seven 
months. Wayne Edmunds and Mike Powell are not entitled to a bonus in respect  
of 2017.
Changes in US tax legislation in the last few days of 2017 resulted in an unexpected 
increase in the earnings per share figure that is used to calculate the amount of 
the 2015 LTIP that would vest. The Committee made an adjustment and removed 
the favourable impact of the US tax legislation from the calculation as it was not 
reflective of management action or underlying performance; the consequence  
of this was a reduced vesting percentage for the 2015 award from 78% to 50%. 
Further explanation is provided on page 67. 
2018 targets
The Committee will consider all relevant factors when setting the performance 
targets for the bonus, DSP and the LTIPs to be awarded in respect of 2018. They will 
be set at an appropriate level to challenge and incentivise the leadership team to 
drive shareholder value and support delivery of the Group’s strategy. The bonus and 
DSP targets and performance against them will be set out in the 2018 Remuneration 
Report due to commercial sensitivity. The LTIP targets for awards to be granted in 
2018 are set out on page 73.
Remuneration reporting
The report follows the same format as last year:
Part 1 on pages 59 to 61 includes an ‘At a glance’ section that includes a summary  
of the reward in 2017 and 2018, the relative importance of pay, and the graph  
showing TSR performance over the last nine years relative to the Group Chief 
Executive’s remuneration.
Part 2 on pages 62 to 73 sets out the Annual Report on Remuneration for 2017.  
The Annual Report on Remuneration, together with this Annual Statement and the  
‘At a glance’ section, is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM in May 
2018. The sections of the report that have been subject to audit are set out on  
page 73. 
Part 3 on pages 76 to 84 sets out the proposed policy on directors’ remuneration. 
Conclusion
I would like to thank those shareholders that took part in the consultation on the 
Company’s new policy. This process has helped us formulate what we believe is the 
right policy for the Group’s next stage.
We take an active interest in your views as shareholders and I welcome your views  
on any aspect of our remuneration policy. 
Susan Kilsby, 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
28 February 2018
The three-year vesting for the DSP and holding periods for both the DSP and LTIP, 
in conjunction with the increase in minimum shareholding requirements align the 
directors’ interest with those of shareholders. Eighty percent of the potential  
variable reward is provided in shares that have to be retained for five years.
The new policy is simpler than the existing policy, with three elements of variable 
remuneration: the annual bonus plan, the DSP facilitating the deferral of reward  
into shares and an LTIP plan with a three-year performance period and two-year 
holding period.
The Committee has designed the new policy to be aligned to the Company’s 
principles of remuneration and believes it will incentivise the executive directors  
to deliver long-term sustainable value for shareholders. 
Other matters relating to 2017
Group Chief Executive 
The Committee carefully considered the terms agreed with Simon Pryce when he 
stepped down from the Board at the end of June 2017, having brought forward his 
retirement. The Committee agreed to a balanced position that was both fair to Simon 
and facilitated ongoing access to Simon for the executive team given his 10 years of 
experience as Group Chief Executive. The statement published on the Company’s 
website in accordance with Section 430(2B) of the Companies Act 2006 sets out  
the compensation arrangements for Simon Pryce on leaving and these are also set 
out in full on page 75.
Interim Group Chief Executive
Wayne Edmunds was appointed Interim Group Chief Executive from 1 July 2017. 
Recognising the interim nature of the appointment a compensation package 
consisting of only base salary was agreed. Wayne Edmunds was appointed on a base 
salary of $2,500,000 per annum. The fees as Interim Group Chief Executive and as  
a non-executive director are split in the single figure table on page 62.
New Group Chief Executive
The reward package that was agreed with Mark Johnstone recognised that the role is 
based in the US. The base salary from appointment on 1 April 2018 will be $912,060, 
the US dollar equivalent of £675,000 at the exchange rate on the date of agreement. 
The base salary was set to be competitive when measured against our US peers 
and the general UK FTSE 250, and has been set below that of the outgoing Group 
Chief Executive to reflect the difference in experience. Further details of Mark’s 
remuneration package are set out on page 69 of this report.
New Group Finance Director
The Section 430(2B) statement published following Mike Powell’s resignation is set 
out in full on page 74.

Director on 1 June 2017. His base salary was set at £375,000. The base salary was 
set to be competitive when measured against our US peers and the general UK FTSE 
250, and was set below that of the outgoing Group Finance Director to reflect the 
difference in experience. Further details of David’s remuneration are set out in the 
relevant sections of the Remuneration Report.

Long-term performance over the past nine years
The Remuneration Committee believes it is important to consider the longer-term performance of the Company when assessing how performance is reflected 
in reward. The graph below shows the historical cumulative total shareholder return since 2008. The Company believes that the FTSE 250 Index is a suitable 
broad-based equity index of which the Company is a constituent member.
The table below the graph shows elements of the CEO’s remuneration over this period.
The Company’s total shareholder return performance since the end of 2008 has significantly outperformed the FTSE 250, as shown below by the value 
of a hypothetical £100 holding over nine years:

Relative importance of spend on pay
The Board recognises that the level of spend on pay is driven partly by being within the service sector and the high number of employees relative to our size. 
The remuneration receivable by employees reflects this. The comparators below have been selected as they illustrate allocation of “profits” between amounts  
payable to directors and amounts returned to shareholders by way of dividends.

Notes
1  Taxable benefits for Simon Pryce, Mike Powell and David Crook include a cash allowance in lieu of a company car and private medical insurance.
2 David Crook’s remuneration shown in the table above is for his services as a director of the company with the amount shown in the column titled ‘Value of LTIP vesting and DSP grant’ showing a pro-rated amount in 
respect of the long-term incentive plan award granted in 2015 that is expected to vest in March 2018 plus the full amount of the DSP award that is also expected to be granted in March 2018. 
3 The LTIP awards shown in the 2016 figures above have been restated. The original disclosure was based on the average share price in the last quarter of 2016 which was 261.23 pence. When the awards vested on 21 
March 2017 the share price was 307.05 pence. The awards were disclosed in the 2016 report because the three-year performance period for these awards granted in 2014 ended on 31 December 2016.
4  Mike Powell’s 2014 LTIP award was delayed due to the timing of his recruitment. The performance period for these awards ended on 31 December 2016 prior to the point at which Mike Powell gave the Company 
notice. The award was released at 23.3% in August 2017 and is disclosed in the 2016 figures because the financial performance conditions ended during that year. 
5 The LTIP awards granted in 2015 will vest at 50% of the maximum and are disclosed in the table above. The value disclosed is based on the share price in the last quarter of 2017 which was 325.66 pence.
6  The Deferred Stock Plan awards that are expected to be granted in 2018 are disclosed in the table above because the operating profit used to calculate the pool was over the three financial years ending 31 
December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017 and the strategic objectives were measured at the end of 2017. The details of these DSP awards are shown on page 66.
7  During the year Simon Pryce, Mike Powell and David Crook (since his appointment to the Board) received a cash payment of 20% of basic salary in lieu of a contribution to a company pension scheme.
8  The disclosure in the “Other” column represents payments made to Simon Pryce associated with his role as President of Flight Support and the need to spend significantly more time in the USA.
Part 2: Annual  
Report on  
Remuneration  
for 2017
The Board has seen the executive team deliver 
on the Group’s strategy during 2017 , which is 
reflected in the strong shareholder returns  
and the absolute remuneration outcomes.
Remuneration for 2017
The single figure total for the directors is set out in the table below and the 
separate elements of remuneration are explained over the following pages. 63
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Base salary for executive directors
In December 2016, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salaries for the executive directors and their salaries were increased in line with increases for other 
members of staff. The base salary effective from 1 January 2017 for Simon Pryce was £680,572.50 and for Mike Powell was £432,600.00.
When David Crook was appointed finance director on 1 June 2017 his base salary was set at £375,000. The base salary was set to be competitive looking at our US peers,  
the general UK FTSE 250 and was lower than the outgoing Group Finance Director to reflect the difference in experience.
When Wayne Edmunds was appointed Interim Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 July 2017 the Remuneration Committee felt that, given the interim nature of the 
role, it would be appropriate to pay him a base salary only with no bonus or equity awards. Wayne Edmunds was appointed on a basic salary of $2,500,000 per annum. The 
basic salary rate was based on the average single figure paid by the Company over the previous period to the former Group Chief Executive. The Committee did not feel it 
appropriate to operate the bonus plan given that the expected tenure was less than one year and it would also be inappropriate to make any awards under the DSP or LTIP.  
No further payments will be made to the Interim Group Chief Executive other than the salary for the period that he holds the office. 
Fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors
The fees for the Chairman and the non-executive directors are in the single figure table. In accordance with the arrangements on appointment there was no change to the 
fee payable to the Chairman in respect of 2017. The non-executive directors’ fees were increased in line with the increases for other members of staff. The fee for the senior 
independent director was increased from £6,500 to £10,400. This fee was increased because it did not reflect the responsibility or the necessary time commitment.
Benefits
Other benefits for the year for each executive director included a company car allowance, private medical insurance, death in service benefit, annual holiday, sick pay,  
an annual health check and gym membership. The nature of the taxable benefits for the executive directors were unchanged compared to 2016. 
Bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity for 2017 is 62.5% of salary for the executive directors split 52.5% of salary for financial performance (35% for operating profit and 17.5% for 
free cash flow) and 10% of salary for personal objectives. The whole bonus is paid in cash and there are no deferral obligations. The choice of performance conditions and their 
respective weightings reflected the Committee’s belief that they would drive action to deliver exceptional sustainable value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.  
In determining the bonus payment for 2017, no discretion was exercised by the Remuneration Committee in determining the outcomes. 
Following an assessment against the performance targets, the Committee concluded that Simon Pryce will receive a bonus of £143,261. The bonus is pro-rated to take into 
account the fact that Simon stepped down as Group Chief Executive on 30 June 2017. The bonus paid is 67.4% of the pro-rated maximum.
David Crook will receive a bonus of £92,094, he was appointed as Finance Director on 1 June 2017 and the bonus payable for the first five months of the year prior to 
appointment as a director is not included in this amount. The bonus paid is 67.4% of the pro-rated maximum. The bonus for the first five months of the year was calculated  
on the salary prevailing at the time.
Both Simon Pryce and David Crook receive 32.1% of their eligible salaries in respect of financial performance (21.4% was for achievement against the operating profit target 
and 10.7% for free cash flow targets) and they will both receive 10% of their eligible salaries for achievement against their personal strategic objectives. For Simon Pryce his 
personal objectives were measured at the point he stepped down as Group Chief Executive.
The detailed personal and financial targets and the achievement against these are shown on the following two pages of this report.
Wayne Edmunds and Mike Powell are not entitled to receive a bonus in respect of 2017.
Targets and performance
The Board is continuing with its approach to disclose the Bonus targets for the year under review. Financial measures account for 84% of the maximum opportunity: operating 
profit represents 56% of the maximum opportunity and free cash flow represents 28% of the maximum opportunity split equally for the half-year position and full-year 
position. Personal objectives represent 16% of the maximum opportunity.
Personal objectives 
The personal objectives set and how the Committee assessed their satisfaction and the level of performance achieved are set out below for the executive directors:
Simon Pryce
Simon Pryce’s personal objectives are set out in the table overleaf. These personal objectives had to be judged at 30 June 2017 when Simon stepped down from the Board.  
As all the objectives were on track and it was reasonable to assume that they would have been completed by the end of the year it was decided that Simon’s personal 
objectives would be considered as being 100% achieved.  64

Notes
The purpose of the half-year cash flow target is to focus attention on cash throughout the year rather than at a single point in time. There is a trade creditor cap applied to the actual figures above, which ensures 
payments to creditors are not inappropriately delayed to deliver bonus targets. The measures are assessed on a straight line basis between threshold and target and also from target to maximum.

Deferred bonus in respect of 2014
Half of the bonus in respect of 2014, paid in early 2015, to Simon Pryce was deferred into shares and this award will be released shortly after the third anniversary of grant. 
Dividends will be awarded on the deferred element once the risk of forfeiture has lifted to reflect economic alignment of the director’s interests with those of shareholders.  
No additional sum is included in the 2017 single figure total as the full bonus, including the deferred element, was disclosed in respect of 2014, the year it was earned. 66

Deferred Stock Plan
Under the DSP, a pool of shares is determined based on 3.5% of the Company’s average underlying operating profit performance over the prior three years and achievement 
against certain strategic objectives. Participants are granted conditional shares which vest annually over a three-year period but are not released until after the third 
anniversary of the grant.
The Group underlying operating profit for 2015 was US$202.0 million for 2016 was $330.1 million and for 2017 was $360.4 million, giving an average of $297.5 million and 3.5% 
of this is $10.4 million. The strategic objectives were:
Goals Achieved
Improve processes and achieve over $5m of new cross-business selling during the year.
• Improvements have been delivered and over $5m of new cross-business selling was achieved in 2017. 100%
Establish common customer KPI definitions and measures Group-wide.
• Completed within Signature and baseline established.
• Decided to postpone some aspects in other businesses due to more urgent customer and business requirements. 70%
Completion of the disposal of ASIG within the financial parameters set by the Board.
• The ASIG business was successfully sold at a price and on terms acceptable to the Board. 100%
Develop an improved culture of innovation and continuous improvement measured with financial targets.
• The improved culture of innovation and continuous improvement has been delivered and financial targets met.
• Examples include energy efficiency / green energy programmes, waste reduction projects and a number of process enhancements. 100%
Develop the safety culture by completing further training to a wider audience.
• Training has been completed and delivered to over 2,000 employees.
• Strong culture of hazard reporting with over 2000 hazards reported during 2017.
• Although the training was completed, the achievement level was reduced from 100% because the Reportable Injury Rate increased year on year.  
The increase was primarily due to higher than usual slip, trip and fall injuries in wintry weather conditions in the first quarter. 80%
Deliver ethics training to nurture culture for employees to behave and make decisions in an ethical manner consistent with our values.
• The agreed training was delivered and it is felt that employees operate ethically and consistently with the Group’s values
• Supporting evidence is that there were no regulatory fines for inappropriate ethical behaviour in 2017
• There were no matters reported through the confidential whistleblowing channels to give rise to concerns. 100%
Develop and implement solutions to improve core functionality for FBO operations and data-analytics capabilities
• The projects to deliver these solutions are progressing well albeit behind the stretching timetable that was set. 65%
Develop a revised capital allocation and distribution policy and re-finance $500m of the Group’s acquisition financing.
• The plans for the appropriate capital structure were developed during the year and regular updates were provided to the Board and the proposals are 
announced with the preliminary results on 1 March 2018. 
• The Board has determined this is fully achieved because the requisite work was completed but the Board requested the proposals were reviewed by 
the incoming CEO once appointed and held back on timing pending the appointment. 100%
Develop the Corporate Responsibility strategic plans and agree appropriate benchmarks.
• The external FTSE for Good benchmark was retained.
• Further work required on the strategic plans for Corporate Responsibility. 75%
Reduce SG&A costs in line with publicly disclosed targets to better reflect new complexion of Group portfolio and needs of businesses.
• The requisite cost savings have been delivered during 2017. 100%
Overall achievement: (goals are equally weighted) 89%
The Remuneration Committee concluded that 89% of the strategic objectives had been delivered and agreed the overall pool is therefore $9,267,125. 
The face value of the DSP award that will be granted to David Crook in respect of 2017 is equivalent to 64.5% of his 2017 salary (£375,000). This award equates to 89% of the 
maximum. The Remuneration Committee anticipates that it will grant this award in March and as soon as awards are made to executive directors they will be announced via 
the Regulatory News Service (RNS), as well as in the 2018 Annual Report. 67

Long- Term Incentive Plan
The performance conditions for the LTIP awards granted in 2015 are set out in the table below. Performance was measured over three financial years ending 
31 December 2017.
Percentage of
shares vesting
EPS growth per annum  
(50% of each award)
Average annual ROIC  
(50% of each award)
Nil Less than 6% Below 9.0%
25% At 6% At 9.0%
25% to 100% straight line pro-rata Between 6% and 12% Between 9.0% and 10.5%
100% At or above 12% At or above 10.5%
For the three years ended 31 December 2017 EPS growth per annum was 8.9% and the average annual ROIC was 10.7%. This performance would lead to the EPS element of 
the award vesting at 56% of the maximum and a full vesting of the ROIC element – an overall vesting of 78%. As set out on page 73 and calculated in note 6 the earnings used in 
the LTIP calculation of EPS are adjusted to take account of the Company’s exceptional policy and also the underlying current tax charge. The US tax reform in the final few days 
of 2017 resulted in a significant increase in the EPS using the agreed methodology. This was not reflective of management action or underlying business performance and 
therefore the Committee used its discretion to adjust for the impact of US tax reform and this reduced the EPS growth to 5.1% and accordingly the EPS element will not vest. 
The overall vesting will be 50% for the awards held by the executive directors. 
The performance conditions for the ELTIP Awards granted in 2015 had an EPS performance range between 12% and 15% with a 9% ROIC hurdle. The EPS growth, even 
without making an adjustment as described above, was below the 12% threshold and accordingly all the ELTIP awards lapse.
Pension
The Company’s pension contribution for Simon Pryce, Mike Powell and David Crook (since his appointment to the Board) was 20% of basic salary. During the year all three 
received a cash payment in lieu of a contribution to a company pension scheme.

recognise promotion to the CFO role on 3 April 2017; the grant price was £3.071 which was the average middle market closing price on the three trading days prior to grant The total aggregate award was just over 
120% of his new salary, recognising he was not in the Finance Director role for the full year.
2  The DSP awards granted in 2017 are in respect of performance in 2016. Simon Pryce’s DSP award is included in the single figure table in the row for 2016. David Crook’s award granted in 2017 is not included in the 
single figure table as it does not relate to services as a director of the Company. The DSP conditional awards were made on 17 March 2017. The grant price was £3.030 which was the average middle market closing 
price on the three trading days prior to the grant. David Crook received a second award to recognise promotion to the CFO on 3 April 2017 and the grant price was £3.071. The aggregate award was just under 63%  
of his new salary.
3 David Crook’s awards were granted before he became an executive director but are included in this table to provide shareholders with full information.
Long- Term Incentive Plan
In 2017, Simon Pryce was awarded an LTIP of 190% of his salary and this will lapse on his leaving the Group in June 2018. David Crook received an LTIP equivalent to 120% of his 
new salary. Mike Powell did not receive an LTIP award in 2017.
Performance conditions for awards made in 2017
A ROIC performance condition is applied to one third of the LTIP award, an EPS performance condition is applied independently to another third of the award and the final third 
is subject to a total shareholder return (“TSR”) measure. There are no further performance conditions attached to the DSP or SAYE scheme.
The detailed performance conditions for the LTIP awards are set out on page 73.
Extended Long- Term Incentive Plan
No awards were made under this plan in 2017.  68

SAYE
The Company issued an invitation under the Savings Related Share Option Plan in September 2017. No directors accepted the invitation. David Crook was already saving the 
maximum amount under an earlier scheme. His options are disclosed in the Interests in shares table on page 72.
Other
In 2015, when Simon Pryce was asked to take on the role of President of Flight Support in addition to his role as Group Chief Executive, he was asked to spend significantly 
more of his time in the United States. At the time the Remuneration Committee agreed Simon should be neither better off nor worse off as a result of the assignment and 
agreed to provide accommodation and an allowance to support his incidental living expenses and certain elements were grossed up for tax purposes. In accordance with this 
approach Simon Pryce received £97,000 (2016: £194,000).
Payments to past directors
The payments made to Mike Powell in respect of 2017 are disclosed in the single figure table. The statement in accordance with section 430(2B) of the Companies Act 2006 
that has been on the Company’s website since 1 June 2017 is set out in full on page 74.
Simon Pryce has continued to receive his basic salary, benefits and pension contribution during his notice period and will receive a bonus for the first half of 2017. Simon’s 2015 
LTIP and DBP awards will vest at the normal time while he is still an employee. This remuneration is all disclosed in the single figure table (with the exception of the DBP award, 
because it was disclosed in the year it was earned). Simon continues to be paid and also to be available to the executive team until 5 June 2018. The outstanding LTIP awards 
from 2016 and 2017 will lapse on this date and the outstanding DSP awards will vest on the normal date. Full details were set out in the statement in accordance with section 
430(2B) of the Companies Act 2006 that has been on the Company’s website since 1 July 2017 and included in the RNS announcement is set out in full starting on page 75.
 No payments have been made to any other past directors of the Company during the year. 
Loss of office payments
No directors received any payments for loss of office during the year.
Change in remuneration of Chief Executive Officer and a comparator group
The table below shows the movement in total remuneration for the CEO between the current and previous financial years compared with that of the total remuneration costs 
of relevant comparator employees as a whole. Relevant employees are employees of BBA Aviation plc and its subsidiaries who are in banded grades 1–4 (about 80 of the 
Group’s senior leaders) as the Board believes this is a suitable comparator group. The CEO’s reward is made up of a larger proportion of variable pay than employees within this 
comparator group.

Year ended  
31 December 2017
Year ended  
31 December 2016 Percentage change
CEO base salary 680.6 661.0 3.0%
Relevant average comparator employees’ base salary 157.4 137.2 14.7%
CEO taxable benefits 21.0 21.0 0.0%
Relevant average comparator employees’ taxable benefits 9.0 8.7 3.4%
CEO annual bonus 286.5 291.0 -1.7%
Relevant average comparator employees’ annual bonus 51.4 45.6 12.7%
For the illustrative purposes of this table and to make the comparisons valid, the CEO’s bonus has not been pro-rated for time (the figure shown above for the year ended 
31 December 2017 is double the amount that was actually paid). The majority of the Comparator Group are paid in US$ and the exchange rate accounts for a proportion of the 
increase shown above.
Outside appointments
Simon Pryce received an annual fee of £50,000 for his role at Electrocomponents plc. For his role at Low and Bonar plc Mike Powell received an annual fee of £40,000, which 
increased to £47,000 on 12 April 2017 when he became chairman of the Audit Committee. Wayne Edmunds received $192,400 and £60,000 for his roles on the Dialight and 
Ashtead Boards respectively. During 2017 he received a combination of a cash fee ($85,000) and stock ($140,000) for his role on the MSCI Inc. Board. In accordance with policy 
the directors retain their fees for these appointments.  69
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Implementation of policy in 2018
The proposed implementation of the existing policy for each element of remuneration in 2018 is described below.
Base salary for executive directors
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salary for David Crook and, given his appointment was relatively recent, decided not to increase it from £375,000. The 
standard pay increase for employees of good standing across the Group was 2.5 – 3%. Mark Johnstone, who will be appointed as Chief Executive Officer on 1 April 2018, will 
receive a base salary of $912,060. The base salary was set to be competitive looking at our US peers, the general UK FTSE 250 in line with the size of the company and was 
lower than our outgoing Group Chief Executive to reflect the difference in experience. Mark’s salary is denominated in US dollars and accordingly this amount will appear to 
fluctuate when disclosed in the single figure tables in sterling. Any increases in salary will be transparently disclosed in US$ within the remuneration report.
Chairman and NED fees
On appointment it was agreed that the fee for the Chairman would not be reviewed for the first three years and the Chairman’s fee has increased with effect from 1 January 
2018 to £295,000, an increase of 18%. This is the first increase the Chairman has received since becoming Chairman in May 2014. The basis of the Chairman’s new fee was to 
position him broadly at the median compared to the FTSE 250 in line with the size of the Company and also to reflect the increase in scope and commitment required given 
the changes to the Company over the period, including the transformational acquisition of Landmark. The fees for the non-executive directors (including SID and Committee 
Chair roles) have been reviewed and it was agreed to increase all fees by 3%, in line with average employee rises during this cycle.
Pension and benefits
The Committee does not expect to change the pension or benefit arrangements for the executive directors in 2018.
Annual cash bonus
For 2018, the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors is 65% of salary (subject to shareholder approval at the AGM) and 
will again be contingent on meeting both financial targets and personal objectives. The Committee has reviewed targets for the year to ensure they remain appropriately 
stretching and relevant to the Company’s business strategy. In 2018, financial performance objectives will again represent about 85% of the bonus opportunity and personal 
objectives will represent about 15% of the bonus opportunity. The financial targets will, as in 2017, be based on operating profit and free cash flow at the half and full year with 
approximately the same weights as in 2016.
The Board has decided that bonus targets for 2018 are commercially sensitive as they could provide the market and competitors with confidential information on the Group’s 
strategy and expectations. The Board will disclose the targets once they are no longer commercially sensitive and anticipates they will be disclosed in the 2018 Annual Report. 
This has been the Company’s practice for the last three years.
Deferred Stock Plan
In respect of 2018, Mark Johnstone and David Crook are eligible to receive an award (in early 2019) under the plan. The award will be subject to a maximum of 125% (subject to 
shareholder approval) of their 2018 salary following an assessment of Group operating profit performance at the end of the 2018 financial year and performance against the 
strategic Group objectives. These awards will be subject to a three-year cliff vest and a subsequent two-year holding period. 
LTIP
The LTIP award, due to be granted in 2018 for Mark Johnstone and David Crook, will be 150% of salary. The award will be announced to the market when it is made with 
additional detailed disclosure to shareholders in the 2018 Directors’ Remuneration Report. The three-year performance criteria will be average ROIC; EPS growth and total 
shareholder return. As in previous years, the average ROIC and EPS growth targets are set using GAAP applying at the time and the performance will be assessed on a 
consistent/constant GAAP basis. The performance conditions are shown on page 73 and show progression from the performance conditions for the awards granted in 2017. 
The awards will be subject to a two-year holding period following the performance period.
Service contracts
The executive directors have rolling contracts of employment with no fixed term which entitle them to 12 months’ notice from the Company in the event of termination other 
than for cause. Executive directors’ contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination with a payment in lieu of notice, or an enforced 
period of garden leave at the Company’s discretion. Both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director are required to give the Company 12 months’ notice.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment. The Chairman’s appointment letter entitles him to six months’ notice from the Company 
and he is required to give the Company six months’ notice. The Company may terminate the Chairman’s contract immediately and pay him an amount in lieu of his fees for six 
months less the statutory deductions.
Letters of appointment and service contracts are available for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office. 
There are no contractual commitments over and above those disclosed above. 70

The Remuneration Committee and its work
The Board is responsible for the remuneration policy and has delegated prime responsibility for the implementation of that policy to the Remuneration Committee. The 
Remuneration Committee is a Board Committee consisting of independent non-executive directors and the Chairman. No individual is directly involved in the determination 
of, or votes on, any matter relating to their own remuneration. The members of the Committee throughout the year and at the date of this report were Susan Kilsby 
(Chairman), Peter Edwards, Peter Ratcliffe, Sir Nigel Rudd and Peter Ventress. Wayne Edmunds was a member of the Committee from 1 January 2017 until 30 June 2017.
In 2017, the Committee held five scheduled meetings and three ad hoc meetings. Peter Ratcliffe was unable to attend one meeting. The meetings were minuted by the 
Company Secretary. Executive directors and the Group HR Director attend Remuneration Committee meetings by invitation. The Committee has responsibility for the 
remuneration of the Chairman, executive directors and the Executive Management Committee (that includes the Company Secretary). The remit includes determining 
remuneration strategy and this year has considered changes in employee incentive structures throughout the senior management team (about 100 staff).
The main issues considered by the Remuneration Committee during 2017 are set out below:

In the course of its meetings, the Remuneration Committee also consulted the Chairman of the Board, the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group HR 
Director and the Company Secretary in connection with the Committee’s work within their particular areas of knowledge and expertise. It is expected that the Committee will 
wish to continue to consult with these people in 2018 and that they will continue to be invited to attend Committee meetings when appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee receives updates on remuneration trends and market practices as part of its regularly scheduled business and in 2017 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) provided input and advice on these areas.
The Committee’s advisers throughout 2017 were PwC who have provided advice on market levels of remuneration, transaction related remuneration issues, performance 
conditions for the LTIP and consulting on the preparation of the Remuneration Report. The total fees paid by the Company to PwC for advice on remuneration issues were 
£186,200. PwC also provide internal audit services to the Company.
PwC are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and are committed to that group’s voluntary code of practice for remuneration consultants in the UK.
This includes processes for ensuring integrity and objectivity of advice to the Remuneration Committee and ensuring that any potential conflicts are effectively managed. 
The Remuneration Committee also confirmed it was satisfied that it had received independent advice from PwC. 71

Directors’ shareholdings and interests
In accordance with the Company’s internal shareholding guidelines, the executive directors are expected to hold the equivalent of 300% of their annual salary in shares. There 
are no formal shareholding requirements in the articles of association of the Company. As can be seen from the table below,Simon Pryce comfortably exceeded the increased 
minimum expectation from 1 January 2017 until he stepped down from the Board on 30 June 2017. At his date of leaving Simon Pryce held 501% of his salary in shares. None of 
the other executive directors held any shares. New executive directors are expected to build up their holding to meet the expectation over five years.

1 June 2017
Further to the announcement dated 1 March 2017 BBA Aviation plc (the “Company”) confirms that Mike Powell stepped down as a director on 31 May 2017.
Mike Powell has outstanding awards under the Long- Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), the Executive Long- Term Incentive Plan (the “ELTIP”), the Executive Share Option 
Plan (“ESOP”), the Deferred Bonus Plan (“DSP”) and the Deferred Stock Plan (“DSP”). Full details of the outstanding awards and the performance conditions are set out in 
the Remuneration Report in the Annual Report and Accounts 2016. Mike’s entitlements to these outstanding awards will be calculated in accordance with the directors’ 
remuneration policy and the rules of the plans. 
The LTIP awards granted in 2015 and 2016 will lapse. The ELTIP award granted in 2015 will also lapse. The risk of forfeiture over awards under the DBP and the DSP plans lift in 
equal tranches on each of the first three anniversaries of the award so Mike will receive 2/3 of the 2015 DBP award and 1/3 of the 2016 DSP award. The treatment for each of 
these awards is set out in the table below:
Award details Outstanding Lapse To be released / vest
2015 Conditional LTIP 225,826 225,826 0

2016 Conditional DSP 157,908 105,272 52,636
Mike Powell’s 2014 LTIP award comprised of a conditional award over 212,661 shares and a linked award over 12,885 shares together with approved options over 12,885 shares 
under the 2006 Executive Share Option Plan. The performance period for these awards ended on 31 December 2016 prior to the point at which Mike gave the Company 
notice. Based on the Group’s performance the conditional awards will vest at 23.3% in August. The linked award will vest at a level to fund the exercise of 23.3% of the approved 
options. Full disclosure of the value at vesting will be disclosed in the 2017 Remuneration Report.
Mike Powell has not received a DSP or LTIP award in 2017 and he will not receive a bonus in respect of 2017.

Section 430(2B) statement relating to Simon Pryce
1 July 2017
Following Simon Pryce stepping down as CEO from 30 June 2017, he will continue to remain an employee for the duration of his garden leave period until 5 June 2018,  
during which period he will receive his current salary, benefits and pension contribution. There will be no entitlement to bonus for the period of garden leave. 
In respect of the 2017 financial year, Simon Pryce will receive a bonus pro-rated to the period worked during the year and based on the satisfaction of the performance 
conditions at the end of the year. Bonus payment will be made at the same time as to other executives of the Company. 
Simon Pryce holds a number of subsisting awards under the following Company share plans:
• BBA 2006 Deferred Bonus Plan (the “DBP”).
• BBA 2015 Deferred Stock Plan (the “DSP”).
• BBA 2015 Long- Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”).
• BBA 2015 Extended Long- Term Incentive Plan (the “ELTIP”). 
DBP & DSP Awards
The performance conditions for awards granted under the DBP and DSP were satisfied at the date of grant with the only ongoing condition being continued employment at 
the relevant vesting date. Awards under these plans vest in equal tranches over a three-year period with the risk of forfeiture ceasing at each vesting date. Shares subject to 
vested awards can only be sold at the release date, which is three years from the date of grant. Dividend equivalents may be provided on vested shares on the release date. 
Simon Pryce will remain employed by the Company at the vesting dates below and therefore the tranches of the award set out will automatically be eligible to vest in 
accordance with the rules of the plan. He will remain subject to the terms and conditions of the plan and will not be able to sell shares until the relevant release date. 
Date of grant Vesting date Release date Number of shares
13.03.2015 13.03.2018 13.03.2018 31,880

The Remuneration Committee has determined that the following additional tranches of DSP awards will vest on their original vesting dates and be subject to their original 
release dates. The basis of the Committee’s determination is that these tranches have already been earned by Simon Pryce.

The performance periods for the 2015 awards granted under the LTIP and ELTIP will have been completed prior to Simon Pryce’s cessation of employment. In addition,  
Simon Pryce will be employed at the vesting date and release date for the LTIP award and therefore this award will automatically be eligible to vest in accordance with the rules  
of the LTIP. In respect of the ELTIP award, the Committee has determined that any shares earned at the end of the performance period will continue to vest and be released  
in accordance with the rules of the ELTIP.
Dividend equivalents may be provided on vested shares on the release date.

Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Introduction
The following key principles govern the design of the Group’s remuneration and reward structures:
• relevance to BBA Aviation, the cyclicality of our businesses and the international markets in which we compete and operate;
• pay for performance, notably the effective execution of the Group strategy and delivery of exceptional, long-term sustainable value for all our shareholders and stakeholders;
• top quartile for exceptional performance and mid-market for mid-level performance;
• reward actions that support our Vision, Mission and Values;
• remuneration should be commensurate with role and responsibilities and sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre individuals with relevant experience;
• reward should be appropriate and easily understood, both internally and externally;
• for executive directors, a significant element of remuneration should be aligned to long-term business performance; and
• the reward structure is compatible with our risk policies and systems and must not create environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating 
irresponsible behaviour.
All contractual commitments or awards made which are consistent with the remuneration policy in force at the time that the commitment or award was made will be honoured 
even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled or awards vest. Any contractual commitments entered into or awards 
made before the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 came into force or before a person became a 
director will also be honoured. The tables below set out a clear and comprehensive summary of BBA Aviation’s remuneration policy for directors and how it operat es.
Policy table: executive directors 
Base salary
There are no performance or recovery provisions.
Strategic purpose
Designed to attract individuals with the skills and capabilities to oversee the execution of the Group’s strategy.
Set to reflect the role, the international nature of operations and the contribution, skills and experience of the individual.
Operation
Reviewed annually taking into account market conditions, business performance, personal contribution and the level of pay awards and 
conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Market comparisons are carried out every three years and are made against organisations of comparable size, complexity, geographical 
spread, business focus and opportunity.
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the targeted policy level until they 
become established in their role. In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the general rises for employees until the 
target positioning is achieved.
Maximum opportunity
Typically, the base salaries of executive directors in post at the start of the policy period and who remain in the same role throughout the 
policy period will be increased by a similar percentage to the average annual percentage increase in salaries of all other employees in the 
Group. The exceptions to this rule may be where there is an increase in scope, complexity or responsibilities of the role/salary progression  
for a newly appointed director and market adjustment.
Salary increases are linked to individual contribution and performance, which is assessed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee ensures that salary levels are positioned in line with companies of comparable size, complexity, geographical spread, 
business focus and opportunity so that they are competitive against the market.
Link to performance
Salary increases are linked to individual contribution and business performance, which is assessed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Pension
There are no performance or recovery provisions.
Strategic purpose
Provides the opportunity for longer-term savings to prepare for retirement, tax efficiently where possible, to ensure arrangements are locally 
competitive.
Operation
Participation in a defined contribution pension plan or a cash allowance in lieu of this or a combination of the two.
Pension is not included in salary figures for the purposes of determining any other benefit entitlement.
Maximum opportunity
Up to 25% of base salary per annum as a cash payment or employer contribution into the pension scheme for current executive directors. 
The Company will set out in the section headed Implementation of remuneration policy, in the following financial year the pension 
contributions for that year for each of the executive directors. In respect of new executive directors, the level of cash payment will be set in 
line with other employees.

Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Other benefits
There are no performance or recovery provisions.
Strategic purpose
Provided to ensure arrangements are locally competitive, are consistent with arrangements provided to other senior employees and 
enhance efficiency and personal welfare.
Operation
Benefits include but are not limited to a company car or allowance, private medical insurance, health and welfare benefits, life insurance, 
death in service benefit, annual holiday, sick pay and an annual health check. Relocation benefits may be provided in certain circumstances 
(see note 4 on page 78).
The Committee recognises the need to maintain suitable flexibility in the benefits provided to ensure it is able to support the objective of 
attracting and retaining personnel in order to deliver the Group strategy. Additional benefits may therefore be offered.
Maximum opportunity
Benefits are set by the Remuneration Committee to be locally competitive, and consistent with arrangements provided to other senior 
employees.
The maximum is the cost of providing the relevant benefits; levels are determined by market rates.
Link to performance
n/a
Annual Bonus Plan (“ABP”)
There are provisions for recovery of sums paid or withholding of sums – subject to the Group’s malus and clawback policy (see table on page 79).
Strategic purpose
Focuses on targets set over a 12-month period that are aligned to the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives and include: 
• incentive for the achievement of Group financial objectives; and incentive for achievement of individual personal objectives.
Operation
Annual performance conditions including targets and weightings are determined by the Committee at the beginning of the year.
Bonus is normally paid in March following the finalisation of the Company’s year-end accounts and is based on personal and Company 
performance in the previous financial year. Bonus is delivered in cash.
Maximum opportunity
The maximum annual cash bonus is 65% of salary. At threshold financial performance, up to 20% of the maximum bonus can be earned. 
At target performance, up to 45% of the maximum bonus can be earned. Bonus is earned on a straight line or kinked line basis between 
threshold and target, and between target and maximum.
Link to performance
The level of bonus paid each year is determined by the Remuneration Committee after the year end based on performance against targets. 
Financial targets will normally account for not less than 70% of the potential maximum award, with personal objectives accounting for 
the remainder. The Committee reviews the measures, the targets and the relevant weightings on an annual basis to ensure they remain 
appropriately aligned with the business strategy. Examples of financial performance measures include operating profit and Group free cash 
flow. Examples of personal objectives include achievement of specific strategic goals or KPIs.
Deferred Stock Plan (“DSP”)
There are provisions for recovery of sums paid or withholding of sums – subject to the Group’s malus and clawback policy (see table on page 79)
Strategic purpose
To strengthen the focus on delivering the Group’s medium to long-term strategic goals and enhance the alignment between the interests  
of executives and shareholders. The plan provides the individuals with an economic effect equivalent to annual bonus deferral.
Operation
Deferred stock will be allocated from a pool.
Annual performance conditions and targets are set at the beginning of the plan year.
The proportion of the deferred stock pool available for allocation each year will be determined by the achievement of strategic Group 
objectives during the year. The value of the pool will be converted into a number of shares based on the prevailing share price.
As well as determining the performance conditions, targets and relative weighting, the Committee will also determine, within the pool limit, 
the allocation of deferred stock to each individual based on potential and performance at the beginning of the plan year. Awards are provided 
in shares which vest on the third anniversary of the grant date subject to continued employment and are subject to a two-year holding period 
that expires on the fifth anniversary of grant.
An award is made up of conditional shares that will be delivered based on the Company’s operating profit, performance against strategic 
objectives and subject to continuing employment.
Under the rules of the plan the Remuneration Committee may make an award in respect of dividends that would have been received on the 
shares once the risk of forfeiture has lifted.
In the UK, the Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) may be used to grant options that are linked to the DSP to allow directors to take 
advantage of HMRC-approved share options at no marginal cost to the Company.
Maximum opportunity
The maximum opportunity is 125% of salary. 78
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Link to performance
The pool will be calculated at the beginning of each year and the size of the pool will be the equivalent in value to 3.5% of the average Group 
operating profit over the prior three years. The value of the pool will be converted into a number of shares based on the prevailing share 
price. The proportion of the deferred stock pool available for allocation each year will be determined by the achievement of strategic Group 
objectives during the year.
An award under the DSP is subject to satisfying operational and strategic Group objectives that are directly linked to Company strategy and 
KPIs, measured over a period of one financial year.
The current performance condition is a matrix of Group operating profit and strategic Group objectives.
Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
There are provisions for recovery of sums paid or withholding of sums paid – subject to the Group’s malus and clawback policy (see table on page 79 below)
Strategic purpose
Focuses executives on achievement of longer-term strategic objectives and ensures long-term alignment with shareholders’ interests.
Operation
Awards are granted annually to executive directors in the form of a conditional share award, nil cost option or restricted share award.
Awards will vest at the end of a three year period subject to:
The executive director’s continued employment at the date of vesting; and satisfaction of the performance conditions. 
Awards are subject to an additional holding period of two years following the vesting of shares.
In the UK, the Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) may be used to grant options that are linked to the LTIP to allow directors to take 
advantage of HMRC-approved share options at no marginal cost to the Company.
Maximum opportunity
Maximum annual award is 150% of salary.
Below threshold performance no award can be earned.
At threshold performance 25% of the maximum opportunity can be earned rising to 100% for maximum performance. The award is 
calculated on a straight line basis between threshold and maximum.
Link to performance
No material change will be made to the type of performance conditions without prior shareholder consultation.
All employee equity participation plans
Strategic purpose
To encourage employees to buy shares in the Company, tax efficiently where possible.
Operation
Executive directors may participate in locally approved plans on the same basis as all eligible employees.
Maximum opportunity
Subject to the relevant local tax limits.

Notes
1  The performance measures selected for the purposes of the annual bonus plan and the long-term incentive plans are either Key Performance Indicators for the Group or are selected in order to encourage and 
reward directly or indirectly sustainable and long-term shareholder value creation. Performance targets are set taking into account prior year performance, annual budgets, strategic imperatives and external 
factors. “Threshold” performance is set taking into account the highly cyclical nature of our business and the variability of results from year to year and our dependence on flying hours. The “maximum” standard of 
performance is intended to be exacting and to represent a level of performance that places the Group among the best performers.
2  The elements of remuneration for executive directors are similar to those that apply to the management-banded population in the Group. Any differences that exist arise either because of market practice and/or  
the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of business need and commercial necessity.
3  The Company also reimburses business expenses in accordance with the corporate business expenses policy which the Remuneration Committee has discretion to revise from time to time.
4  In addition to other benefits, the Remuneration Committee, where necessary, will provide support in accordance with BBA Aviation’s standard approach to relocation where a director is required to relocate to fulfil 
their responsibilities. The primary purpose of the policy is to facilitate recruitment and relocation of key employees by protecting the individual and their family from costs arising directly from a move of residence 
required for business reasons. The elements of the policy include, but are not limited to, travel reimbursement of the cost of movement of household goods, housing, schooling and other reasonable costs.
Intention and discretion
In respect of the Annual Bonus Plan, the Deferred Stock Plan and the Long- Term Incentive Plan, the Company will set out in the section headed Implementation of 
remuneration policy, in the following financial year, the nature of the targets and their weighting for each year and in relation to the LTIP the targets themselves. Details of the 
performance conditions, targets and their level of satisfaction for the year being reported on will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. Should the Committee 
determine that one or more targets are commercially sensitive, these will be disclosed in subsequent years’ remuneration reports once commercial sensitivity ceases to 
apply. When the Committee sets targets for any element of reward it should be assumed that these are on a consistent basis of accounting and, where accounting standards 
change during the performance period, the Committee will (when it is fair and equitable to do so) make adjustments to ensure that directors neither benefit nor suffer as a 
result of changes in accounting standards. The Committee may make adjustments for exceptional items in the performance period if it is not fair and equitable to do so. 79
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
In exceptional circumstances the Committee retains the discretion to:
• change the performance measures and targets and the weighting attached to the performance measures and targets part-way through a performance period if there  
is a significant and material event which causes the Committee to believe the original measures, weightings and targets are no longer appropriate;
• make downward or upward adjustments to the amount of bonus contribution earned or DSP or LTIP resulting from the application of the performance measures, if the 
Committee believes that the outcomes are not a fair and accurate reflection of business performance.
Any adjustments or discretion applied by the Committee will be fully disclosed in the following year’s Remuneration Report.
The Committee will operate all plans in accordance with the relevant rules and in accordance with the principles of the policy set out in the introduction to the policy above
Malus and clawback policy
The table below sets out the scope and circumstances under which withholding (malus) and recovery of pay (clawback) will be applied to variable pay of the executive directors. 
The same provisions also apply to the senior staff in Bands 1–4 (circa 100 employees). The definition of malus and clawback that will apply for the ABP , DSP and the LTIP are:
• Malus is the adjustment of the ABP payments or unvested DSP and LTIP awards because of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. The adjustment 
may result in the value being reduced to nil.
• Clawback is the recovery of payments made under the ABP or vested DSP and LTIP awards as a result of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. 
• Clawback may apply to all or part of a participant’s payment under the ABP or vested DSP or LTIP awards and may be effected, among other means, by requiring the 
transfer of shares, payment of cash or reduction of awards or bonuses.
The circumstances in which malus and clawback could apply are as follows:
• Discovery of a material misstatement resulting in an adjustment in the audited accounts of the Group or any Group company;
• The assessment that any performance condition or condition in respect of a payment under the ABP, DSP or LTIP award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading 
information;
• The discovery that any information used to determine the ABP payments or DSP and LTIP awards were based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information;
• Action or conduct of a participant which amounts to fraud or gross misconduct; or 
• Events or the behaviour of a participant have led to the censure of a Group company by a regulatory authority or have had a significant detrimental impact on the 
reputation of any Group company provided that the Board is satisfied that the relevant participant was responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that  
the censure or reputational damage is attributable to the participant.

Notes
1  The Company also reimburses business expenses in accordance with the corporate business expenses policy which the Remuneration Committee has discretion to revise from time to time.
Shareholding requirement
To ensure that executive directors’ interests are aligned with those of shareholders over a longer time horizon there is a formal shareholding guideline to encourage 
substantial long-term share ownership by executive directors.
The ownership guideline for executive directors is 300% of base salary, which should be achieved within five years. This element of the policy ensures that the interests of the 
executive directors and those of shareholders are closely aligned. The build-up and retention of shares by management is a key objective of the policy. The Committee retains 
the discretion to increase the shareholding requirements.
Legacy arrangements under incentive plans
There are outstanding awards which apply to directors made under arrangements which will not be offered under the policy effective from the close of the Company’s 2018 
AGM. The awards already made under these plans will be honoured.
Recruitment and appointment policy
On appointment the Committee’s approach to remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for 
the role. The remuneration package for any new recruit would be determined in accordance with the principles set out on page 76. The Committee is mindful that it wishes to 
avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and is aware of guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short or 
long-term incentive payments made on recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance conditions associated with the award.
If an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but there would be no retrospective application of the policy 
in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements. Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be 
honoured and form part of the ongoing remuneration. These would be disclosed to shareholders in the following year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Company’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of new non-executive directors is to apply the policy which applies to current non-executive directors.
The Company’s policy when setting remuneration for a new director is summarised in the following table: 81
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration element Policy
Base salary and benefits The salary level will be set taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, experience and the salaries paid for similar roles in comparable 
companies. The Committee will apply the policy set out on salaries for the current Executive Directors in the remuneration policy table. The 
executive director shall be eligible to receive benefits in line with the Company’s benefits policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Pension The executive director will be entitled to receive contributions into a pension plan or alternatively to receive a supplement in lieu of pension 
contributions in line with the Company’s pension policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Annual Bonus Plan (“ABP”) The executive director will be eligible to participate in the ABP as set out in the remuneration policy table. The maximum potential 
opportunity under this plan is 65% of salary.
Deferred Stock Plan (“DSP”) The executive director will be eligible to participate in the DSP as set out in the remuneration policy table. The maximum potential 
opportunity under this plan is 125% of salary.
Long- Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
The executive director will be eligible to participate in the LTIP as set out in the remuneration policy table. The maximum potential 
opportunity under this plan is 150% of salary.
Total incentive opportunity The maximum variable remuneration which may be granted in normal circumstances is 340% of salary under the ABP, DSP and LTIP 
(excluding the value of any buy-out awards).
“Buy-out” of incentives 
forfeited on cessation of 
employment
The Committee’s policy is not to provide buy-outs as a matter of course. However, should the Committee determine that the individual 
circumstances of recruitment justifies the provision of a buyout, the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation  
of an Executive Director’s previous employment will be calculated taking into account the following:
• the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the executive director’s cessation of employment;
• the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of them being satisfied; and
• any other terms and conditions having a material effect on their value (“lapsed value”).
The Committee may then grant up to the equivalent value as the lapsed value, where possible, under the Company’s existing incentive plans.
To the extent that it was not possible or practical to provide the buyout within the terms of the Company’s existing incentive plans a bespoke 
arrangement would be used.
Relocation policies Where the new Executive Director is required to relocate from one work base to another, the Company may provide one-off/ongoing 
support as part of the director’s relocation benefits compensation to reflect the cost of relocation for the executive director in cases where 
they are expected to spend significant time away from their country of domicile. The level of relocation package will be assessed on a  
case-by-case basis, but will take into consideration any cost of living differences, housing allowance and schooling.

• Base salary and benefits and pension reflect the increases to apply in 2018.
• For mid-point performance, an assumption of 50% of annual bonus and DSP is applied and 50% vesting for the LTIP has also been used. 
• No share price increase. 
• Housing and relocation are excluded. 82
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Service contracts
The executive directors have rolling contracts of employment with no fixed term which entitle them to 12 months’ notice from the Company in the event of termination other 
than for cause. Executive directors’ contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination with a payment in lieu of notice, or an enforced 
period of paid garden leave at the Company’s discretion. The Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director are required to give the Company 12 months’ notice.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment. The Chairman’s appointment letter entitles him to six months’ notice from the Company 
and he is required to give the Company six months’ notice. The Company may terminate the Chairman’s contract immediately and pay him an amount in lieu of his fees for six 
months less statutory deductions.
Letters of appointment and service contracts are available for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office. 
There are no contractual commitments over and above those disclosed in this policy.
All directors benefit from a Company indemnity in connection with their duties and the Company also purchases Directors and Officers Liability insurance.
Policy on payment for loss of office/leaving the Company
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing director, the Committee will always seek to minimise the cost to the Company whilst complying with the 
contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time. The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are 
made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim 
arising in connection with the termination of an executive director’s office or employment. The Company will seek to avoid making any payment for failure.
A director who leaves as a result of poor personal performance will normally be treated differently than a director who leaves by reason of redundancy, retirement or ill health. 
The Company will not make any payments for loss of office in the event of gross misconduct.
The Remuneration Committee will operate the share schemes in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the principles of the remuneration policy (see 
page 76 for further details).
The share plan rules make more generous provisions for those who leave for a permitted reason (ill health, retirement, redundancy etc.) and this is colloquially referred to as a 
“good leaver”.
On termination, a non-executive director would normally receive their fee for the month of termination. The Chairman is entitled to six months’ notice and benefits for that 
period if served notice by the Company.
The Company may purchase a small leaving gift for departing directors.
The table below sets out how each component of the payment may be calculated. Any discretions described in the table below may be applied in full or in part against all or part 
of an award as the Committee thinks fit.
Element of payment Basis of calculation
Permitted reason (good leaver) Other reason
Annual base salary and  
benefits
Executive Directors may be entitled to receive compensation for loss 
of office which will be a maximum of 12 months’ salary.
Such payments will be equivalent to the monthly salary and benefits 
that the executive would have received if still in employment with 
the Company. These will be paid over the notice period. Executive 
directors will be expected to mitigate their loss within a 12-month 
period of their departure.
The Company has discretion to make a lump sum payment in lieu of 
notice. The Committee may also make modest payments relating to 
outplacement consultancy.
There will be no compensation for loss of office due to 
misconduct or normal resignation.
Pension Pension contributions or payments in lieu of pension contributions will 
be made during the notice period.
The Company has discretion to make a lump sum payment in lieu 
regarding loss of office.
Calculated on a contractual basis and where the pay in lieu of notice 
clause is invoked, an amount up to one year’s accrued benefits.
There will normally be no payments or compensation. 83

Annual Bonus Plan 
(“ABP”)
Performance conditions will be measured at the measurement date.
The Committee’s normal policy is that the bonus will be pro-rated  
for time although the Committee may decide not to pro-rate for 
time. It is the Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances which, in its opinion, are sufficiently exceptional and 
where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained  
in full to shareholders.
No bonus is payable for the year of cessation.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to 
determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the 
Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances which, in its opinion, are sufficiently 
exceptional and where there is an appropriate business  
case which will be explained in full to shareholders.
Deferred Stock Plan 
(“DSP”)
All subsisting deferred stock awards will vest.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion:
• to vest deferred shares at the end of the original deferral period or 
at the date of cessation. The Remuneration Committee will make 
this determination depending on the type of good leaver reason 
resulting in the cessation;
• to determine whether to pro-rate the maximum number of shares 
to the time from the date of grant to the date of cessation. The 
Committee’s normal policy is that it will not pro-rate awards for 
time. The Remuneration Committee will determine whether or  
not to pro-rate based on the circumstances of the executive  
director’s’ departure.
Awards subject to the holding period (i.e. vested awards for years 
four or five following grant) will normally be released at the end of the 
holding period. The Committee has discretion to release the shares 
earlier and will make this determination depending on the type of good 
leaver reason resulting in the cessation.
Lapse of any unvested deferred stock awards.
Awards subject to the holding period (i.e. vested awards in 
years four or five following grant) will be released at the end  
of the holding period.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to 
determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the 
Remuneration Committee’s intention to only use this

business case which will be explained in full to shareholders.
The Committee may determine to pay cash in lieu of shares.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
Normally pro-rated to time and performance in respect of each 
subsisting LTIP award and the performance testing is undertaken at 
the normal time.
Awards subject to the holding period (i.e. vested awards for years 
four or five following grant) will normally be released at the end of the 
holding period. The Committee has discretion to release the shares 
earlier and will make this determination depending on the type of good 
leaver reason resulting in the cessation.
The Committee may decide to measure performance over the original 
performance period or at the date of cessation. The Committee will 
make this determination depending on the type of good leaver reason 
resulting in the cessation.
The Committee may determine whether to pro-rate the maximum 
number of shares to the time from the date of grant to the date of 
cessation. The Committee’s normal policy is that it will pro-rate 
awards for time. It is the Committee’s intention to use discretion not 
to pro-rate in circumstances where there is an appropriate business 
case which will be explained in full to shareholders.
The Committee may determine to pay cash in lieu of shares.
Any unvested LTIP awards will normally lapse. 
Awards subject to the holding period (i.e. vested awards in 
years four or five following grant) will be released at the end

The Committee may determine to pay cash in lieu of shares.
Compensation for forfeited 
remuneration
Upon termination, any “buy-out” awards would normally lapse. However, the Remuneration Committee does retain the discretion to 
decide otherwise, provided the termination is not as a result of poor performance.
Other benefits, e.g. relocation 
allowances, international 
mobility benefits and expenses
Will depend on what has been agreed on appointment, but the Remuneration Committee would not expect any or all of these elements 
of pay to form part of any termination arrangement but has discretion to make payments in respect of them.
All employee equity 
participation plans
Directors will be treated in the same manner as any other member of staff in respect of those plans in accordance with the rules of the 
relevant plan and there is no discretion to apply alternative treatment. 84
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report
A good leaver reason is defined as cessation in the following circumstances:
• death;
• ill-health;
• injury or disability;
• redundancy;
• retirement (in agreement with the Company);
• employing company ceasing to be a Group company;
• transfer of employment to a company which is not a Group company; and 
• any reason permitted by the Committee in its absolute discretion in any particular case except where termination is for dishonesty, fraud, misconduct or other 
circumstances justifying summary dismissal.
Cessation of employment in circumstances other than those set out above is for other reasons. 
Change of control
In the event of a change of control the Remuneration Committee will consider all relevant factors to ensure an equitable result is delivered for all stakeholders. The table below 
sets out the default position and the Committee’s discretions. As above, any discretions described in the table below may be applied in full or in part against all or part of an 
award as the Committee thinks fit.
Element Approach Discretion
Annual Bonus Plan Default: performance conditions will be 
measured at the date of the change of control. 
The bonus will normally be pro-rated to the date 
of change of control.
The Committee has the discretion to determine whether to pro-rate the bonus to 
time. The normal approach is that it will pro-rate for time, however, in exceptional 
circumstances where the nature of the transaction produces exceptional value for 
shareholders and provided the performance targets are met (or likely to have been 
met) the Committee will consider whether pro-rating is equitable.
Deferred Stock Plan For the year of change of control performance 
conditions will be measured at the date of the 
change of control. The award will normally be 
pro-rated to the date of change of control.
Subsisting deferred stock awards will vest on a 
change of control.
The Committee has the discretion to determine whether to pro-rate the DSP 
award to time for the year of change of control. The normal approach is that it will 
pro-rate for time, however, in exceptional circumstances where the nature of the 
transaction produces exceptional value and provided the performance targets are 
met (or likely to have been met) the Committee will consider whether pro-rating is 
equitable and also may determine to pay cash in lieu of shares.
In respect of subsisting awards the Committee has the discretion to determine 
whether to pro-rate the DSP award to time. The normal approach is that it will not 
pro-rate for time. The Committee may determine to pro-rate depending on the 
circumstances of the change of control.
LTIPs The number of shares subject to subsisting LTIP 
awards will vest on change of control pro-rated to 
time and performance.
The Committee has the discretion to determine whether to pro-rate the LTIP 
award to time and performance. The normal approach is that it will pro-rate, 
however, in exceptional circumstances where the nature of the transaction 
produces exceptional value for shareholders and provided the performance targets 
are met (or likely to have been met) the Committee will consider whether pro-rating 
is equitable and also may determine to pay cash in lieu of shares.
Employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
In determining remuneration, the Remuneration Committee is mindful of pay and conditions across the Group. Decisions concerning executive directors’ pay and benefits 
are generally in line with the practices and framework across the Group. The Committee is briefed by the Group Chief Executive and the Reward team on the overall pay and 
benefits framework for the Group and on changes made. 
Employees’ views
Employees have not been consulted on the directors’ remuneration policy but are free to ask any questions they wish and to offer any opinions they have through our 
employee communications channels. Employees who are also shareholders are able to vote on the directors’ remuneration policy and report.
Shareholders’ views
The Remuneration Committee supported by relevant executives actively engages with major institutional shareholders on a regular basis and welcomes the views of 
shareholders on the Group’s remuneration policy. The Remuneration Committee consulted with shareholders throughout 2017 and addressed the proposed amendments 
to the remuneration policy that have been set out in detail above. In finalising the proposals, the views of the largest shareholders were taken into account during a 
comprehensive engagement process. 85
Going Concern  
and Viability  
Statement
Going Concern 
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report on pages 1–88. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows 
and liquidity position are described on pages 34–36. In addition, note 17 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to credit risk  
and liquidity risk.
The Group’s committed bank facilities comprise a $650 million multicurrency 
revolving credit facility (RCF) dated 10 April 2014 due to expire in April 2019 and 
an Acquisition Financing Agreement (AFA) put in place during 2015 to fund the 
acquisition of Landmark Aviation in conjunction with the rights issue. Following the 
prepayment of Facility A and the partial prepayment of Facility B in June 2016 from 
the disposal proceeds of the six FBOs in accordance with the U.S. Department of 
Justice’s requirement in relation to the Landmark Aviation acquisition, there remain 
two term debt facilities. These are Facility B due to expire in February 2019 and 
Facility C due to expire in September 2020. During the year the Group used part of 
the net proceeds from the disposal of ASIG to prepay $110 million under Facility B of 
the AFA and, therefore, as at 31 December 2017 $253 million remains outstanding 
under this term debt facility. There have been no prepayments under Facility C of  
the AFA and, therefore, as at 31 December 2017 the full amount of $450 million 
remains outstanding.
In addition, BBA Aviation plc has US private placement (“USPP”) obligations of $500 
million senior notes with various maturity dates between 2018 and 2026. 
In total the Group has debt obligations and facilities of $1,853 million and as at 
31 December 2017 the Group has available $535 million of undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities. These debt obligations and facilities are subject to cross default. 
Further details relating to these debt arrangements are provided in note 16 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. The bank facilities and the USPP notes are 
subject to two main financial covenants: maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA  
of 3.5x and minimum net interest cover of 3.0x underlying EBITDA. The directors 
expect the Group to comply with these covenants for the foreseeable future.
The Group’s forecasts and projections taking account of reasonably possible changes 
in trading performance show that the Group should be able to operate within the level 
of its current facilities in the foreseeable future. The principal risks and uncertainties 
affecting the forecasts and projections, to which the Group is exposed, relate to the 
number of hours of flying activity, principally in Business & General Aviation, but also 
to a lesser extent in commercial and military aviation. Flying hours largely dictate the 
drivers of revenue, namely fuel volumes in Signature, engine overhaul cycles in ERO 
and demand for components in Ontic. Further details of these risks and uncertainties 
are provided on pages 20–23.
The directors have carried out a critical review of the Group’s 2018 budget and 
medium-term plans with due regard for the risks and uncertainties to which the 
Group is exposed and the impact that these could have on trading performance.  
The key assumptions used in constructing the budget were as follows:
• In Flight Support we anticipate continued strong momentum in Signature Flight 
Support, supported by growth in B&GA flying hours.
• In Aftermarket Services, Ontic’s outlook remains solid with a strong order backlog. 
Engine Repair & Overhaul has substantially completed its footprint rationalisation 
programme but, with a competitive market and pricing environment, further 
opportunities to simplify the business will be taken to improve efficiency.
• In addition, our overall performance will be supported by further incremental 
contributions from the substantial investments made across the Group in recent 
years. Over the longer term, the underlying strengths of our market-leading 
businesses, the continuing improvement in their operational performance and 
the structural growth and consolidation in our major markets support the Board’s 
confidence in our ability to generate superior through-cycle returns.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
annual financial statements.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision c.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
directors have assessed the financial and operational position and prospects of the 
BBA Aviation Group. The directors’ assessment considered the three-year period to 
December 2020. This assessment was based on the three-year financial forecast for 
the BBA Aviation Group. The BBA Aviation Group three-year financial forecast was 
prepared on a business by business basis alongside the BBA Aviation Group annual 
budget process.
The Directors consider the three-year period to December 2020 to be the 
appropriate viability assessment period based on the historic performance of the 
Group and its key underlying markets. The directors believe the period is the optimal 
balance of long-term projections and acceptable forecasting accuracy.
In making their assessments the directors have considered the potential financial 
and operational impacts of severe yet plausible scenarios that could impact the 
three-year financial forecasts for BBA Aviation. The plausible scenarios considered 
are broadly aligned to the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 20–23. In 
their assessment of the impact of plausible scenarios on BBA Aviation, the directors 
have also considered the likely effectiveness of available mitigating actions.
Based on this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the BBA Aviation Group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
their liabilities as they fall due for the three-year period to December 2020.

Directors’ interests in shares
Directors’ interests in shares and share options are contained in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity in favour of each of its directors, 
under which the Company agrees to indemnify each director against liabilities 
incurred by that director in respect of acts or omissions arising in the course of their 
office or otherwise by virtue of their office. In addition, the Company has entered 
into indemnity deed polls in substantially similar terms in favour of members of the 
Executive Management Committee and other members of senior management. 
Where such deeds are for the benefit of directors, they are qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions as defined by section 309B of the Companies Act 1985 or 
section 234 of the Companies Act 2006, as applicable. At the date of this report, 
these indemnities are therefore in force for the benefit of all the current directors 
of the Company and other members of senior management.
On 1 November 2007 , a subsidiary of the Company, BBA Aviation Finance, entered into 
qualifying third party indemnity provisions as defined by section 234 of the Companies 
Act 2006 in favour of its directors, under which each director is indemnified against 
liabilities incurred by that director in respect of acts or omissions arising in the course 
of their office or otherwise by virtue of their office and such provisions remain in force 
as at the date of this report.
Employee information
The Company provides employees with various opportunities to obtain information 
on matters of concern to them and to improve their awareness of the financial and 
economic factors that affect the performance of the Company. These include 
“All Hands Briefings”, staff forums, and meetings with trade unions that take place 
throughout the year.
All companies within the Group strive to operate fairly at all times and this includes 
not permitting discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment 
on the basis of race, religion or belief, colour, gender, disability, national origin, age, 
military service, veteran status, sexual orientation or marital status. This includes 
giving full and fair consideration to suitable applications for employment from 
disabled persons and making appropriate accommodations so that if existing 
employees become disabled they can continue to be employed, wherever 
practicable, in the same job or, if this is not practicable, making every effort to  
find suitable alternative employment and to provide relevant training.
Agreements
Under section 992 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company discloses that in the 
event of a change of control in the Company: (i) the Company’s commitments under 
the $1,650 million Acquisition Financing Agreement dated 23 September 2015 and as 
amended and restated on 16 November 2015, its $650 million revolving credit facility 
dated 10 April 2014, its $300 million private note placement dated 18 May 2011 (as 
amended) and its $200 million private note placement dated 17 December 2014 
could become repayable; (ii) the Engine Lease Agreement dated 29 June 2009 (as 
amended) under which $83 million of aircraft engines have been leased to the Engine 
Repair & Overhaul (ERO) business could be terminated; (iii) the consent of Netjets 
would be required for the transfer of the benefits under its contract with Signature 
Flight Support; (iv) the operating licence with London Luton Airport Operations 
may be terminable; and (v) certain licence agreements within the ERO and Ontic 
businesses are terminable or require the consent of the counterparty but none of 
these contracts in their own right are significant to the Group.

Suppliers’ payment policy
The Company and Group’s policy is to settle terms of payment with suppliers when 
agreeing the terms of each transaction, to ensure that suppliers are made aware of 
the terms of payment and abide by the terms of the payment.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital and changes to the share capital are shown 
in note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. That note also contains a 
summary of the rights attaching to each class of shares and details of the number 
of ordinary shares held in employee benefit trusts. Awards granted under the 
Company’s share plans are satisfied either by shares held in the employee benefit 
trust or by the issue of new shares when awards vest. The Remuneration Committee 
monitors the number of awards made under the various share plans and their 
potential impact on the relevant dilution limits recommended by the Investment 
Association. There is a 5% limit in respect of discretionary plans and a 10% limit in 
respect of all plans. Based on the Company’s issued share capital as at 31 December 
2017 the Company has used 2.2% towards the 5% limit and 2.5% towards the  
10% limit.
The Company was given authority to purchase up to 14.99% of its existing ordinary 
share capital at the 2017 AGM. That authority will expire at the conclusion of the AGM 
in 2018 unless renewed. Accordingly, a special resolution to renew the authority will 
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
The existing authority for directors to allot ordinary shares will expire at the 
conclusion of the 2018 AGM. Accordingly, an ordinary resolution to renew this 
authority will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. In addition, it will be proposed 
to give the directors further authority to allot ordinary shares in connection with a 
rights issue in favour of ordinary shareholders. This is in line with guidance issued by 
the Investment Association. If the directors were to use such further authority in the 
year following the 2018 AGM, all directors wishing to remain in office would stand for 
re-election at the 2019 AGM.
Details of these resolutions are included within the Notice of AGM.
Resolutions at the Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM will be held on 11 May 2018. Accompanying this report is the 
Notice of AGM which sets out the resolutions to be considered and approved at the

Directors’ 
Responsibilities 
Statement
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law), including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence  
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and 
financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s  
and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s  
profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
including Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of BBA Aviation plc (the ‘Parent Company’) 
and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
• the Consolidated Income Statement;
• the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement;
• the Accounting Policies of the Group and Parent Company; 
• the related Group notes 1 to 26; and
• the related Parent Company notes 1 to 14.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”  
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) 
(ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the 
UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) Ethical Standard as applied to 
listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services 
prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group and the 
Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters
The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Signature Flight Support (“SFS”) goodwill impairment
• Revenue recognition: Percentage of completion accounting
• Carrying value of Aftermarket Services inventory 
• Presentation of earnings
Materiality
The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was $12.0 million which was calculated by reference to both profit 
before tax and underlying profit before tax.
Scoping
Following the sale of the ASIG business in February 2017 and further integration of the Landmark business, our audit scope for 2017  
decreased from 13 to 10 operating locations. Senior members of the group audit team continued to visit key locations where our group 
audit scope was focused. 
Significant changes in our approach
In the current year, acquisition accounting has been removed as a key audit matter as there have been no significant acquisitions. In 
addition, following a reassessment of risks that are most significant to our audit, the key audit matter on goodwill impairment is focused 
on the SFS goodwill because the balance represents over 25% of total assets of the Group and the forecasted cash flows are subject to 
management’s estimate of the long-term performance of the business.

Independent Auditor’s Report
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 85 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue to 
do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to 
that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to report,  
add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the 
knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of 
the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on page 23 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation on page 85 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 85 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to  
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the Group 
required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to report,  
add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include 
the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
SFS goodwill impairment 
Key audit matter description
Goodwill within the SFS cash generating unit amounted to $1,058.3 million (2016: $1,048.7 million), representing 26% (2016: 
24%) of the total assets of the Group. 
As stated within the accounting policies to the Group’s financial statements on page 100, goodwill is subject to an annual 
impairment review using a value in use basis.
The value in use calculation is based on long-term cash flows of the business which are subject to management’s estimate of 
the long-term performance of the business and risk adjusted discount rates, as stated within the notes to the accounts on page 
107. We have therefore included goodwill impairment for the SFS cash generating unit as a key audit matter.
How the scope of our audit responded to the 
key audit matter
Our audit procedures included challenging the key assumptions used in management’s impairment model, including the 
forecast future cash flows, growth rates applied in the medium and long term and the risk adjusted discount rates.  
In performing our audit procedures we reviewed historical financial performance of the business units compared with 
the original forecasts to evaluate the accuracy of management’s budgeting process. Furthermore, we assessed the 
appropriateness of the forecast cash flows and long-term growth rates with reference to external macro-economic and market 
outlook data.
To assess the discount rate applied we used internal valuation specialists to perform benchmarking against independent data.
In addition to the above, we have also reviewed the related presentation and disclosures in the financial statements.
Key observations
We concur with the directors’ assessment that there is no impairment charge required. We also consider the disclosures within 
the Consolidated Financial Statements to be appropriate. 91
Consolidated Financial Statements
Independent Auditor’s Report
Revenue recognition: Percentage of completion accounting
Key audit matter description
As stated within the accounting policies to the Group’s financial statements on page 102, revenue recognised in the Engine 
Repair & Overhaul businesses of $518.8 million (2016: $541.4 million) requires management judgement to estimate the stage of 
completion and profitability of contracts, to determine the amount of revenue and profit to be recorded for engine overhauls  
in progress at the year end.  
Given the management estimates involved in determining the key assumptions, we have identified this as a potential fraud  
risk area.
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
In performing our audit procedures we assessed the estimates applied within the percentage of completion calculation by 
verifying the engine overhaul costs incurred for work undertaken at the year end and challenging the estimated costs to 
completion. In assessing the estimated costs to completion, we considered the historical accuracy of management’s  
forecasts in previous years for the cost of engine overhauls and made enquiries of technical staff responsible for the engine 
overhaul process.
Key observations
Based on the results of each of the procedures as set out above, we consider the related financial statement amounts to be 
appropriate and in line with the Group’s accounting policies as set out on page 102.
Carrying value of Aftermarket Services inventory 
Key audit matter description
As detailed within the significant financial reporting issues considered by the Audit and Risk Committee on page 53, 
management judgement is required to establish that the carrying value of inventory across the Aftermarket Services 
businesses of $220.0 million (2016: $215.8 million) is appropriate, in particular in relation to determining the appropriate level of 
inventory provisioning against surplus and obsolete items. 
The judgement reflects the nature of the Group’s Aftermarket Services operations which means that inventory must be held to 
support aircraft engine overhaul cycles, resulting in inventory which can be held for extended periods of time before utilisation.
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
Our audit procedures included testing of the inventory provisions held in the Aftermarket Services businesses by understanding 
and challenging the key assumptions used to determine the appropriate carrying value of inventories. Specifically, we assessed 
whether: 
• management’s controls relating to the estimation of the inventory provisions are appropriately designed and implemented;
• the estimates of remaining lives and usage profiles of the engine and aircraft platforms are consistent with industry 
projections and supported by industry experts; and
• where the expected future usage of inventory is based on past experience, this has been reasonably estimated. 
Furthermore we assessed the mathematical accuracy of the provisioning calculation by performing a recalculation of the 
expected provision based on the above key assumptions.
Key observations
Evidence obtained during the audit shows that the level of inventory provisions is appropriate and consistent with our 
understanding of the business.
Presentation of earnings 
Key audit matter description
Management presents the Consolidated Income Statement in a columnar format, separately disclosing the “underlying” results 
and “exceptional and other items”.
Total “exceptional and other items” contributed to a charge of $127.0 million (2016: charge of $316.0 million).
In addition, following the sale of the ASIG business in February 2017, management has presented the results of the business as a 
discontinued operation, consistent with the presentation shown for the year ending 31 December 2016.
As detailed within note 2 to the Group’s financial statements, management has defined “exceptional and other items” as items 
which are material and non-recurring in nature and also include costs relating to acquisitions and disposals and amortisation of 
acquired intangibles and valued in accordance with IFRS 3. 
Management judgement is required in relation to the identification, measurement and disclosure of “exceptional and other 
items” to ensure clarity in the presentation of the Group’s financial performance.
This key audit matter was discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 53. 92
Consolidated Financial Statements
Independent Auditor’s Report
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
We have challenged the assumptions made to identify and measure those items classified as “exceptional and other items”. 
Our audit work has included:
• obtaining supporting documentation, such as invoices, legal correspondence and severance contracts, for the 
measurement of such costs included within “exceptional and other items”;
• understanding and challenging management’s rationale for the inclusion of such costs as “exceptional and other items”.   
This has included assessing whether management’s approach to identifying exceptional and other items is consistent with 
the prior year;
• assessing the adequacy of disclosure in relation to the “exceptional and other items”; and
• understanding and challenging management’s rationale for those items included in the underlying results which may be  
considered non-recurring in nature. 
We have also considered the use of alternative performance measures disclosed in the Annual Report given previous guidance 
issued by the FRC and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
Key observations
Evidence obtained during the audit shows that the presentation of earnings is appropriate and consistent with the Group’s 
policy in this area.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
Materiality
$12.0 million (2016: $10.0 million) $6.0 million (2016: $5.0 million)
Basis for determining materiality
Materiality was determined by reference to both profit before 
tax and underlying profit before tax. 
Materiality represents less than 1% (2016: less than 1%)  
of net assets. 
Rationale for the benchmark applied
Profit before tax and underlying profit before tax are 
considered to be key performance metrics of the business. 
Materiality of $12.0 million represents approximately 7% of 
Profit before Tax and 4% of Underlying Profit before Tax.
As this is the parent company of the Group it does not 
generate significant revenue but instead incurs costs and as 
such the net assets of the Parent Company are considered 
appropriate when determining materiality.
We have agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report all audit differences in excess of $600,000 (2016: $500,000), as well as differences below that 
threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment:
We focused our group audit scope on 10 (2016: 13) operating locations representing a decrease of three operating locations audited in the current year. The decrease 
arises from the disposal of the ASIG business and integration of the Landmark business.
• Five (2016: five) of these locations were subsidiaries subject to a full scope audit for the year ended 31 December 2017 in accordance with statutory reporting 
requirements in the UK and Europe.
• Four (2016: three) were subject to specific audit procedures, focused on the significant audit risk areas. This increase on prior year due to Dallas Airmotive being subject 
to specific audit procedures in the current year.
• The remaining operating location (2016: five locations) relates to the SFS US business for which a full scope audit was completed. 
• These 10 (2016: 13) locations represent the principal operating locations of the Group and account for approximately 96% (2016: 96%) of revenue and 93% (2016: 93%) 
of the Group’s total assets.  93
Consolidated Financial Statements
Independent Auditor’s Report
Audits of these locations are performed at materiality levels determined by reference to a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the business 
concerned. Materiality for each location was set no higher than 70% (2016: 60%) of Group materiality.
At the Parent Company level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks 
of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the group audit team visits each of the 
locations where the group audit scope was focused. Visits were made to 7 of the 10 operating locations during the year (2016: 10 out of 13). The visits will enable the group 
audit team to update their understanding of the operations, risks and control environments of each component. The visits will also be used to review audit working papers 
and attend key meetings with local management.
For each of the businesses included within the programme of planned visits, the group audit team discusses audit findings with the relevant component audit team 
throughout the audit engagement and reviews relevant audit working papers.
The Parent Company is located in the United Kingdom and audited directly by the group audit team.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s  
report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with  
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be  
materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider  
the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge  
obtained in the audit; or
• Audit and Risk Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit and Risk 
Committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the 
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Group’s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 94
Consolidated Financial Statements
Independent Auditor’s Report
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Group’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Group’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Group and the Group’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified 
any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect  
of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect  
of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee, we were appointed by the Board in 2002 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 
December 2002 and subsequent financial periods. Following a competitive tender process, we were appointed as auditor for the period ending 31 December 2014 and 
subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is 15 years, covering the years 
ending 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2017.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit and Risk Committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit and Risk Committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).

Accounting Policies of the Group
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted for use 
in the European Union (EU) and therefore comply with Article 4 of 
the EU International Accounting Standards (IAS) Regulation and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared using the historical 
cost convention adjusted for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out 
below. These policies have been consistently applied with the prior 
year except where noted.
New financial reporting requirements
A number of EU-endorsed amendments to existing standards and 
interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2017 and have been applied in preparing the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the Group. There is no impact on the Group 
Consolidated Financial Statements from applying these standards.
Financial reporting standards applicable for future  
financial periods
A number of EU-endorsed standards and amendments to existing 
standards and interpretations, are effective for future annual 
periods and have not been applied in preparing the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the Group. 
The most significant changes to the IFRS framework in these 
forthcoming standards and amendments to standards are IFRS 9: 
Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts  
with customers (IFRS 15) and IFRS 16: Leases (IFRS 16). 
IFRS 9
The Group will apply IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 addresses 
the classification, measurement and recognition of financials assets 
and financials liabilities, impairment and hedge accounting.  
Classification and measurement: The number of categories of 
financial assets under IFRS 9 has been reduced compared to IAS 39.  
The classification is based on the business model within which the 
asset is held and the contractual cash flow characteristics of  
the assets.
For financial assets that are debt instruments the classification 
categories are amortised cost; fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL). Equity investments that fall within the scope of the 
standard are usually measured at FVTPL unless an irrevocable 
election is made to recognise them within other comprehensive 
income. On the transition the Group has elected to recognise 
future changes in the fair value of the equity investment in Fly Victor 
Limited and Lider Taxi Aero S.A. Air Brasil which are classified as 
financial instruments within other comprehensive income.
Impairment: The impairment model under IFRS 9 reflects expected 
credit losses, as opposed to only incurred credit losses under IAS 39.
Hedge accounting: On initial application of the  standard, an entity 
may choose, as its accounting policy, to continue to apply the hedge 
accounting requirements of IAS 39 instead of the hedge accounting 
requirements of IFRS 9. The Group will adopt the hedge accounting 
requirements of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018.
The full impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group will depend on the financial instruments 
that the Group has during 2018 as well as on economic conditions 
and judgements made as at the year end. The Group has performed 
a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adopting IFRS 
9 based on the financial instruments and hedging relationships 
as at the date of initial application of IFRS 9 (1 January 2018).  
Management’s expectations are that the impact of IFRS 9 on the 
Group will not be material.
IFRS 15
IFRS 15 addresses the recognition of revenue from customer 
contracts and impacts on the amounts and timing of the recognition 
of such revenue. IFRS 15 will supersede the current revenue 
recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue. The Group will adopt 
IFRS 15 for the year ending 31 December 2018.
The standard introduces a five-step approach to revenue  
recognition – identifying the contract; identifying the performance 
obligations in the contract; determining the transaction price; 
allocating that transaction price to the performance obligations and 
finally recognising the revenue as those performance obligations  
are satisfied.
The Group recognises revenue from the following major  
income streams:
Flight Support:
•  Fuelling & fuel farm management
•  Property management
•  Ground handling
•  Technical services
Aftermarket Services:
•  Repair & overhaul
•  Engine & part sales
An impact assessment has been performed on the likely impact of 
IFRS 15:
Within the Aftermarket Services division the methodology presently 
adopted for revenue recognition under the current standard, IAS 18 
Revenue, will not materially change under IFRS 15.
Within the Flight Support division it is also not expected that IFRS 
15 will have a material impact due to the nature of the services 
provided – the cycle from order through to delivery of these services 
is generally short.
The full impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group will depend on the Group’s activities during 
2018. The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the 
potential impact of adopting IFRS 15 based on the Group’s historic 
trading as at the date of initial application of IFRS 15 (1 January 2018).  
Management’s expectations are that the impact of IFRS 15 on the 
Group will not be material.
IFRS 16
IFRS 16 replaces existing leasing guidance, including IAS 17 ‘Leases’ 
and IFRIC 4 ‘Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease’.  
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2019. 101
Consolidated Financial Statements
Accounting Policies of the Group
Accounting Policies of the Group
 – has the power over the investee;
 – is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement 
with the investee; and
 – has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if 
facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or 
more of the three elements of control listed above. 
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and 
cash flows relating to transactions between the members of the 
Group are eliminated on consolidation. 
In the current year the Group reclassified its investment in GB 
Aviation Holdings LLC as a joint venture. The reclassification resulted 
in a $28.4 million reclassification from the investment in associates 
to the investment in joint ventures.
Goodwill on acquisitions represents the excess of the fair value of the 
consideration paid, the non-controlling interest, and the fair value of 
any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of 
the identifiable net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. 
Where goodwill can only be determined on a provisional basis for a 
financial year, adjustments may be made to this balance for up to 
12 months from the date of acquisition. Goodwill is capitalised and 
presented as part of intangible assets in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses and is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Associated undertakings are those investments other than 
subsidiary undertakings where the Group is in a position to exercise 
a significant influence, typically through participation in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee. Joint ventures and 
associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
and are initially recognised at cost. The Consolidated Financial 
Statements include the Group’s share of the post-acquisition 
reserves of all such companies less provision for impairment.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, 
a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further 
detail is contained in the directors’ statement of going concern on 
page 85 of the Directors’ Report.
Business combinations
On the acquisition of a business, fair values reflecting conditions at 
the date of acquisition are attributed to the identifiable separable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Where the fair 
value of the total consideration, both paid and deferred, is different 
to the fair value of the identifiable separable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as purchased 
goodwill and capitalised or a bargain purchase gain and recognised in 
the income statement. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in 
the income statement as incurred. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by 
the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, 
the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the 
The standard requires lessees to account for most contracts under 
an on-balance sheet model, with the distinction between operating 
and finance leases being removed.  
The standard provides certain exemptions from recognising leases 
on the balance sheet, including where the asset is of low value or 
the lease term is 12 months or less. In addition, the standard makes 
changes to the definition of a lease to focus on, amongst other 
things, which party has the right to direct the use of the asset.  
Under the new standard, the Group will be required to recognise right 
of use lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The right 
of use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured 
at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses, adjusted for any re-measurement of the 
lease liability. Liabilities are measured based on the present value of 
future lease payments over the lease term. Subsequently, the lease 
liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the 
impact of lease modifications, amongst others.
The recognition of the depreciation of right of use lease assets and 
interest on lease liabilities over the lease term will have no overall 
impact on profit before tax over the life of the lease, however 
the result in any individual year will be impacted and the change 
in presentation of costs will likely be material to the Group’s key 
metrics. Under IAS 17, the charge is booked in full to operating profit.  
Metrics which will therefore be affected will include operating profit 
& operating margin, interest & interest cover, EBITDA, ROIC and 
operating cash flow.
Furthermore, the principal amount of cash paid and interest in the 
cash flow statement will be presented separately as a financing 
activity. Operating lease payments under IAS 17 would have been 
presented as operating cash flows. There will be no overall net cash 
flow impact. 
The Group has commenced work to understand the impact of the 
new standard and the project will complete during 2018. Work will 
include detailed review of contracts to establish lease classification, 
assessment of transition options, the quantification of financial 
impacts, design of future processes and the related systems 
changes, the assessment of the related impacts on the Group’s 
regulatory and commercial reporting requirements and the impact 
on the Group’s long-term incentive schemes. It is therefore not 
practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect 
until the directors complete their review.
Information on the undiscounted amount of the Group’s operating 
lease commitments under IAS 17 ‘Leases’, the current leasing 
standard, is disclosed in note 15.  
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company, BBA Aviation plc, and its subsidiary 
undertakings under the acquisition method of accounting.
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is 
achieved when the Company: 102
Consolidated Financial Statements
Accounting Policies of the Group
accounting is incomplete. These provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are 
recognised, to reflect new information obtained about the facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, 
would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business 
combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is 
measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of 
the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes 
in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as 
measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with 
corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period 
adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information 
obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed 
one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances 
that existed at the acquisition date.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s 
previously-held interests in the acquired entity is re-measured to 
the acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, 
is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in 
the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit 
or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest 
were disposed of.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement  
period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration  
is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity  
is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and its 
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is re-measured 
at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, or IAS 37 Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with 
the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the  
entity’s functional currency at the rate of exchange at the date  
of the transaction.
The individual financial statements of each group company are 
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position 
of each group company are expressed in US dollars, the presentation 
currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements. The functional 
currency of the parent company is sterling.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 
the balance sheet date are translated into the functional currency 
at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Any gain or loss 
arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of 
transaction is recognised in the Income Statement.
The income statements of operations of which the functional 
currency is other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars  
at the average exchange rate for the year. The balance sheets of 
these operations, including associated goodwill, are translated into 
US dollars at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.  
All exchange differences arising on consolidation are recognised 
initially in other comprehensive income and only in the Income 
Statement in the period in which the entity is eventually disposed of. 
All other translation differences are taken to the Income Statement, 
with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowing 
and derivative instruments to the extent that they are used to 
provide a hedge against the Group’s equity investments in overseas 
operations. These translation differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, together with the exchange difference on 
the net investment in those operations.
Goodwill and intangible assets arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate of exchange.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied 
and services provided by the Group excluding inter-company 
transactions, sales by associated undertakings and sales taxes.
Within the Engine Repair & Overhaul business, revenue and 
associated profit on engine overhauls are recognised on a 
percentage of completion basis once the terms of the contract 
have been agreed with the customer and the ultimate profitability 
of the contract can be determined with reasonable certainty. The 
percentage of completion is based on hours incurred compared 
with management’s best estimate of the total hours of production. 
Within the Engine Repair & Overhaul business, revenue and 
associated profit are recognised on engine sales. Where the engine 
sold is subsequently leased back, the revenue and profit are only 
recognised where the lease can be categorised as an operating lease.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging exceptional and other items 
and after the share of results of associates and joint ventures but 
before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items are items which are material and non-recurring 
in nature, and include costs relating to acquisitions, disposals and 
significant restructuring programmes. Other items include the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles accounted for under IFRS 3.
Underlying operating profit is the Group’s key alternative 
performance measure and is consistent with the way that financial 
performance is measured by management and reported to the Board 
and the Executive Committee, and assists in providing a meaningful 
analysis of the trading results of the Group. Additionally, exclusion 
of amortisation of acquired intangibles accounted for under IFRS 3 
from the Group’s underlying results assists with the comparability  
of the Group’s underlying profitability with peer companies.
Underlying operating profit is calculated as operating profit before 
exceptional and other items (see note 2). Further detail on the 
rationale for the use of alternative performance measures and 
reconciliations to the equivalent GAAP measures are set out on 
pages 174-178.

recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money. The risks specific to the asset are reflected as an adjustment 
to the future estimated cash flows.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
Income Statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.  
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income 
immediately. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill 
are not reversed in subsequent periods.
Inventories
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
comprises the cost of raw materials and an appropriate proportion 
of labour and overheads in the case of work in progress and finished 
goods. Cost is calculated using the first-in first-out method in the 
Flight Support segment, and weighted average method in the 
Aftermarket Services segment. Provision is made for slow-moving 
or obsolete inventory as appropriate.
Associates and Joint Ventures
Where the Group has the power to participate in (but not control) 
the financial and operating policy decisions of another entity, it 
is classified as an associate or joint venture. Associates and joint 
ventures are initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet 
at cost. Subsequently associates and joint ventures are accounted 
for using the equity method, where the Group’s share of post-
acquisition profits and losses and other comprehensive income 
is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and 
other comprehensive income (except for losses in excess  
of the Group’s investment in the associate or joint venture unless 
there is an obligation to make good those losses).
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and 
its associates and joint ventures are recognised only to the extent of 
unrelated investors’ interests in the associate or joint venture. The 
investor’s share in the associate’s or joint venture’s profits and losses 
resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying 
value of the associate or joint venture.
Any premium paid for an associate or joint venture above the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the 
carrying amount of the associate or joint venture. Where there 
is objective evidence that the investment in an associate or joint 
Intangible assets
Licences and contracts, other than manufacturing licences within 
the Ontic business, that are acquired separately are stated at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is 
provided for on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. 
The Ontic business acquires licences from Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs) to become the alternate OEM for that 
product. The useful life is based on the underlying contract where 
that is a determinable period. Where the useful life is indeterminable 
and finite, a lifespan of 20 years is typically used. An annual review is 
performed to assess the licence’s remaining useful life against the 
vitality of the underlying platform.
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of 
computer hardware, the software is treated as an intangible asset. 
Computer software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred 
to acquire and bring to use the specific software. Amortisation is 
provided on the cost of software and is calculated on a straight-line 
basis over the useful life of the software.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, arising on acquisitions are 
capitalised at fair value. An intangible asset will be recognised as long 
as the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal 
rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably. Amortisation is 
provided on the fair value of the asset and is calculated on a straight-
line basis over its useful life, which typically is the term of the licence 
or contract.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated in the Balance Sheet at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment. 
Depreciation is provided on the cost of property, plant and equipment 
less estimated residual value and is calculated on a straight-line basis 
over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:
Land Not depreciated
Freehold buildings 40 years maximum
Leasehold buildings Shorter of useful life or lease term
Fixtures and equipment (including 
essential commissioning costs) 3-20 years
Tooling, vehicles, computer and office equipment are categorised 
within fixtures and equipment.
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of 
major items of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part 
of those assets. The commencement of capitalisation begins when 
both finance costs and expenditures for the asset are being incurred 
and activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are in 
progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities 
that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant 
and equipment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
value of its goodwill, intangible and tangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of 
the impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows 
that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the  104

venture has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is 
tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Group comprise 
interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. All such 
instruments are used for hedging purposes to manage the risk 
profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with the 
Group’s risk management policies. Recognition of gains or losses 
on derivative instruments depends on whether the instrument is 
designated as a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed   
to hedge.
The effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges 
is recognised in other comprehensive income until the impact 
from the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement. 
The ineffective portion of such gains and losses is recognised 
immediately within other gains and losses in the Income Statement.
Hedges of net investments in non-US dollar territories are 
accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge 
is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss 
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately, and 
is included within operating profit. Gains and losses deferred in the 
foreign currency translation reserve are recognised in profit or loss 
on disposal of the foreign operation.
Changes in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts which 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised within operating 
profit in the Income Statement as they arise. 
Fair value hedges are undertaken as part of the Group’s policy for 
managing interest rate risk. Changes in value of fair value hedges are 
immediately recognised within interest in the Income Statement and 
are off-set by changes in fair value of the underlying borrowing. Any 
ineffectiveness on fair value hedges is recognised immediately in the 
Income Statement.
Other financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are accounted for at 
the trade date.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deemed 
deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less which are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables excluding derivative assets are initially 
recognised at fair value and do not carry any interest and are stated 
at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are initially recognised 
at fair value and classified according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is  
any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of  
the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair 
value, which equates to proceeds less direct issue costs at inception. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, except 
where they are identified as a hedged item in a fair value hedge.  
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, 
and the amount due on settlement is recognised in the Income 
Statement over the term of the borrowings. 
Trade and other payables
Trade payables, excluding derivative liabilities, are not interest 
bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale (AFS) financial assets are non-derivatives that 
are either designated as AFS or are not classified as (a) loans and 
receivables, (b) held-to-maturity investments or (c) financial assets 
at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group holds investments in unlisted shares that are not traded 
in an active market but that are classified as AFS financial assets 
and stated at fair value (because the directors consider that fair 
value can be reliably measured). Gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve with the 
exception of impairment losses. Where the investment is disposed 
of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is 
reclassified to profit or loss.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each 
balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the 
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets obtained under finance leases are capitalised within property, 
plant and equipment and the capitalisation values written off on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of the period of the lease or the 
useful economic life of the asset. Obligations to the lessors relating 
to finance leases, net of finance charges, in respect of future periods 
are recorded as liabilities. The interest element of the obligation is 
allocated over the lease term to produce a constant rate of interest 
on the outstanding capital payments.
Operating leases are not recognised in the Group’s Balance Sheet. 
The rental payments are charged to the Income Statement on a 
straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Following a review of

certain leases during the year, the prior year comparatives have been 
restated to remain consistent with the current year presentation.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle that 
obligation and the obligation can be reliably estimated.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of 
the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties 
surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the 
cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying 
amount is determined by discounting the expected future cash 
flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a 
provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the 
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that 
reimbursement will be received on settlement of a related provision 
and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Insurance
Provisions are recognised for self-insured risks as the cover is 
provided. The provisions cover both known claims and claims 
incurred but not reported. Provisions are made for the associated 
costs based on an assessment of the specific risk or expected 
claims development for risks that are incurred but not reported. The 
estimates of current and ultimate risk exposure are made with the 
aid of an actuary or other suitably qualified third party.
Restructuring
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has 
developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has 
raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the 
restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing 
its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a 
restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditure arising 
from the restructuring, and comprises those amounts that are both 
necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with  
the ongoing activities of the entity.
Warranties
Warranties provisions are recognised when the associated products 
or services are sold. Provisions are made for the associated costs 
based on an assessment of future claims made with reference to 
past experience. 
Environmental
Environmental provisions relate to environmental liabilities 
within continuing operations of the Group. These liabilities relate 
predominantly to the Group’s current and historic property 
portfolios. The liabilities have an expected life of up to ten years.
Post-retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are 
charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost is 
determined using the projected unit credit method, with valuations 
under IAS 19 (revised) being carried out annually as at 31 December. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in 
which they occur. They are recognised outside of profit or loss and 
presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees 
during the year is charged to operating profit in the year. Any 
past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that 
the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become 
vested. The interest cost on the net defined benefit deficit is 
included within finance costs.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, and reduced by the 
fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation 
is only recognised to the extent that it is recoverable. 
Defined benefit scheme contributions are determined by valuations 
undertaken by independent qualified actuaries.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of cash and equity-settled share-
based compensation plans. The fair value of the compensation 
is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense. The total 
amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the options granted and calculated 
using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of 
award. These include Black–Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo 
simulations. For cash-settled options, the fair value of the option 
is revisited at each balance sheet date. For both cash and equity-
settled options, the Group revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable at each balance 
sheet date.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and 
comprises current and deferred taxation. Current tax is calculated  
at tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted as  
at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred taxation takes into account taxation deferred due to 
temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for 
taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is accounted for 
using the balance sheet liability method and is the tax expected 
to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases in the computation of taxable profit.
An uncertain tax provision is recognised for those matters for which 
the tax determination is uncertain but it is considered probable 
that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The 
uncertain tax provisions are reported within current liabilities and 
measured using the most likely amount approach. Examples of 
activities for which the Group experiences tax uncertainties include  106
Consolidated Financial Statements
Accounting Policies of the Group
but are not limited to transfer pricing under the application of OECD 
transfer pricing principles and the deductibility of interest payable 
resulting from the Group’s financing arrangements. The Group is 
monitoring developments in relation to EU State Aid investigation 
including the EU Commission’s announcement on 16 November 
2017 that it will conduct a State Aid investigation into the UK’s 
Controlled Foreign Company regime. The Group does not currently 
consider any provision is required in relation to EU State Aid.
The provision for uncertainties is established based on the 
management judgement of senior tax professionals within the 
Group supported by previous experience in respect of such activities 
and in certain cases based on specialist independent tax advice.  
The methodology for establishing provisions for tax uncertainties 
has been consistently applied with the prior year.
No provision is made for temporary differences on unremitted 
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates where 
the Group has control and the reversal of the temporary difference 
is not foreseeable.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all  
or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at tax rates which have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and that are 
expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income 
Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited  
to the Statement of Comprehensive Income, in which case  
the deferred tax is also dealt with in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Assets and associated liabilities classified as held for sale
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of 
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Assets are classified 
as held for sale if their net carrying amount will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This 
condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable 
and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Management must be committed to the sale which should be 
expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one 
year of the date of classification.
When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control 
of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are 
classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, 
regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest 
in its former subsidiary after the sale.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of  
estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the directors 
are required to make judgements (other than those involving 
estimations) that have a significant impact on the amounts 
recognised and to make estimates and assumptions about the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors 
that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Management has concluded that for 2017 there are no critical 
accounting judgements or key sources of estimation uncertainty 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities with the next financial year.

1. Segmental information 
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of 
internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the Group Chief Executive to allocate resources to the 
segments and to assess their performance.
The Group provides information to the Chief Executive on the basis 
of components that are substantially similar within the segments in 
the following aspects:
–    the nature of the long-term financial performance;
–    the nature of the products and services;
–    the nature of the production processes;
–     the type of class of customer for the products and services; and
–    the nature of the regulatory environment.
Based on the above, the operating segments of the Group identified 
in accordance with IFRS 8 are Flight Support, which comprises 
Signature Flight Support and ASIG (until 31 January 2017), and 
Aftermarket Services, which comprises Engine Repair & Overhaul 
(ERO) and Ontic.
The businesses within the Flight Support segment provide 
refuelling, ground handling, line maintenance and other services to 
the Business & General Aviation (B&GA) and commercial aviation 
markets. The businesses within the Aftermarket Services segment 
maintain and support engines and aerospace components,  
sub-systems and systems.
Sales between segments are immaterial.
All alternative performance measures are reconciled to IFRS 
measures and explained on pages 174-178

Underlying profit is shown before exceptional and other items on the face of the income statement. Exceptional and other items are items 
which are material and non-recurring in nature and also include costs relating to acquisitions, disposals and restructuring. Other items includes 
amortisation of acquired intangibles accounted for under IFRS 3. The directors consider that this gives a useful indication of underlying 
performance and better visibility of Key Performance Indicators.
All alternative performance measures are reconciled to IFRS measures and explained on pages 174-178.

Borrowing costs included in the cost of qualifying assets during the year arose on the general borrowing pool and are calculated by applying 
a capitalisation rate of 3.57% (2016: 3.85%) to expenditure on such assets, which represents the weighted average interest rate for the 
currency in which the expenditure has been made.
Interest amounts included in the cost of qualifying assets carry tax relief at the prevailing rate of tax in the relevant jurisdiction as amortised 
through the Income Statement, with an associated deferred tax movement in the year amounting to $0.5 million (2016: $0.6 million).

Income tax expense/(credit) for the year from continuing operations 33.7 (62.9)
UK income tax is calculated at 19.25% (2016: 20.0%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions 
is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
On 22 December 2017 , the United States enacted tax reform that implements substantial changes to the federal tax system by reducing 
the headline federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and limiting interest deductions to a maximum of 30% of US EBITDA. The reduction in the 
headline rate of tax has resulted in a revaluation of US deferred tax balances amounting to a credit of $59.3 million. Additionally, the Group has 
re-measured a deferred tax asset relating to financing costs from prior years amounting to a charge of $54.5 million together with a current year 
charge of $22.3 million. Finally, the tax reform introduced a tax on repatriation of profits of overseas subsidiaries resulting in a charge of $3 million.
The net impact of this tax reform ($20.5m charge) has been reflected in the continuing exceptional and other items tax result so as to reflect 
the underlying effective tax rate on a consistent basis to prior periods.

The applicable tax rate of 26.4% (2016: 25.3%) represents a blend of the tax rates of the jurisdictions in which taxable profits have arisen.  
The change from the prior year is due to a change in the proportion of profits that have arisen in each jurisdiction and the benefits  
associated with certain financing structures implemented.

On 19 May 2017, the 2016 final dividend of 9.12¢ per share (total dividend $91.5 million) was paid to shareholders (2016: the 2015 final dividend 
of 8.68¢ per share (total dividend $87.2 million) was paid on 20 May 2016).
On 3 November 2017, the 2017 interim dividend of 3.81¢ per share (total dividend $39.2 million) was paid to shareholders (2016: the 2016 
interim dividend of 3.63¢ per share (total dividend $37.1 million) was paid on 4 November 2016).
In respect of the current year, the directors propose that a final dividend of 9.59¢ per share will be paid to shareholders on 25 May 2018.  
The proposed dividend is payable to all shareholders on the register of members on 13 April 2018. The total estimated dividend to be paid 
is $98.6 million. This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM and, in accordance with IAS 10: Events after the Reporting 
Period, has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. 114

Included within the amortisation charge for intangible assets of $109.9 million (2016: $114.2 million) is amortisation of $93.8million 
(2016: $99.4 million) in relation to the amortisation of intangible assets acquired and valued in accordance with IFRS 3 and disclosed within 
exceptional and other items. 
Included within the acquisitions of $25.2 million (2016: $1,809.4 million) is $5.0 million (2016: $2.5 million) of Ontic licence acquisitions which 
are not accounted for as a business combination under IFRS 3 and hence not presented under note 24.
Licences and contracts are amortised over the period to which they relate, which is on average 16 years (2016: 16 years) but with a wider 
range, with some up to 60 years in duration. Computer software is amortised over its estimated useful life, which is on average five years 
(2016: five years). 
Transfers to assets held for sale relates to the ASIG business as disclosed in note 25.
Impairment losses recognised in the year
During 2017 the Group’s H+S Middle East business (part of the H+S CGU) continued to underperform. As a result of this underperformance 
management carried out an impairment review to assess the recoverability of the remaining assets of the business following the CGU 
impairment in 2016. The review led to an impairment loss of $15.7 million that has been recognised within exceptional and other items in 2017. 
The $15.7 million impairment was recognised against $5.7 million of Intangible assets and $10.0 million of Property, Plant & Equipment. 
H+S Middle East is contained within the Group’s Aftermarket Services operating segment.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit 
from the business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows and reflects aggregated CGUs:

Flight Support:
Signature Flight Support 1,058.3 1,048.7
ASIG (discontinued operations) – 70.6
Aftermarket Services:

Ontic 68.3 65.2
Total goodwill from continuing and discontinued operations 1,126.6 1,184.5
Total goodwill from continuing operations 1,126.6 1,113.9
Total goodwill from discontinued operations – 70.6
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Group has determined the recoverable amount of each CGU from value-in-use calculations. The value-in-use calculations are based 
on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and detailed financial projections for the next four years, as approved by 
management, with a terminal growth rate after four years. The resultant cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate 
for the relevant CGU.
Key assumptions
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are as follows.
Sales volumes, selling prices and cost increases over the four years covered by management’s detailed plans
Sales volumes are based on industry forecasts and management estimates for the businesses in which each CGU operates, including 
forecasts for Business & General Aviation (B&GA) flying hours, aircraft engine cycles and military spending. Selling prices and cost increases 
are based on past experience and management expectations of future changes in the market. The extent to which these assumptions affect 
each principal CGU with a significant level of goodwill are described below.
Signature Flight Support and Engine Repair & Overhaul (ERO) both operate in the B&GA market. Signature Flight Support is the world’s 
largest and market-leading Fixed Base Operation (FBO) network for business aviation providing full services support for B&GA travel, focused 
on passenger handling and customer amenities such as refuelling, hangar and office rentals, and other technical services. ERO is a leading 
independent engine repair service provider to the B&GA market with strong relationships with all major engine OEMs.
Ontic operates in the military and commercial sectors and is the leading provider of high-quality, cost-effective solutions in the continuing 
support of maturing aerospace platforms to the major aerospace OEMs and airframe operators.
In B&GA, growth is measured principally in relation to B&GA flying hours. Over the longer term, the key drivers for B&GA remain intact – 
continued growth in GDP and total wealth, the increasing value of people’s time, corporate confidence and corporate activity levels all point 
to improving sentiment. The unusual nature of the 2007–2009 crisis and the halting return to growth have meant that, although corporate 
profits have recovered and confidence has improved, flight activity has lagged. However, steady growth in US GDP and the current upward 
trend in US business confidence supports a continued increase in B&GA movements in the USA with the FAA currently forecasting an 
average growth in B&GA Jet and Turboprop flying hours of 2.5% per annum to 2037. 
The political environment in the USA could also be positive in the short and medium-term, with commentators speculating that the new US 
tax policy could be marginally beneficial to jet purchases.
Trends in military aviation are likely to improve as the global defence market recovers after years of pressure due to budget retrenchment. 
The perceived and continuing threat environment and regional tensions are expected to be the biggest driver of spending.
US defence spending represents approximately 34% of global spending and this grew in 2017 driven by the new administration’s focus on 
strengthening the nation’s military. The USA accounts for 26% of the global military aviation fleet (c13,800 aircraft). Budget growth and  
a higher tempo of military operations are expected to positively impact flight activity and thus maintenance spend as more missions  
are executed.
Life extension programmes continue to be important as the US military aircraft ages. Military legacy aircraft life extensions of between seven 
and ten years on platforms such as the C-130, ACV-8B, F-15 and AH-64 and delays on new aircraft, such as the F-35 and A400M are key 
drivers for our Ontic business. The current US Air Force fleet is more than 25 years old on average, with some platforms significantly older. 
Average age is expected to continue to rise despite the large defence budget increases. 118

Growth rates used for the periods beyond those covered by management’s detailed plans
Growth rates are derived from management’s estimates, which take into account the long-term nature of the industry in which each CGU 
operates, external industry forecasts of long-term growth in the aerospace and defence sectors, the maturity of the platforms supplied by 
the CGU and the technological content of the CGU’s products. For the purpose of impairment testing, a conservative approach has been 
used and where the derived rate is higher than the long-term GDP growth rates for the countries in which the CGU operates, the latter has 
been used. As a result, an estimated growth rate of 2.0% (2016: 2.0%) has been used for the Flight Support and Ontic CGUs, which reflects 
forecast long-term US GDP growth. ERO has an estimated long-term growth rate of 1% as set out in more detail in the following section on 
ERO impairment.
Discount rates applied to future cash flows
The Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has been used as the foundation for determining the discount rates to be 
applied. The WACC has then been adjusted to reflect risks specific to the CGU not already reflected in the future cash flows for that CGU.  
The discount rate used was 7.5% (2016: 7.3%) for the CGUs within Flight Support and 9.9% to 10.0% (2016: 9.4% to 9.6%) for the CGUs  
within Aftermarket Services.
Sensitivity analysis
Both the ERO CGUs, Dallas Airmotive (DAI) and H&S Aviation (H+S), recognised impairments in 2016, see below. 
In relation to ASIG CGUs, the operations were held for sale at 31 December 2016 and subsequently have been sold. The business’ assets 
were impaired in 2016 based on the fair market value established in that disposal process, see note 25.
In relation to Signature Flight Support and Ontic, management has concluded that for these CGUs no reasonably foreseeable change in the 
key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
ERO impairment
In 2016 both the ERO CGUs recognised impairment. Management had previously reported that a reasonably possible change in the key 
assumptions used in the impairment model could result in an impairment charge for Dallas Airmotive (“DAI”).
The ERO trading conditions remained challenging during 2016, with no recovery in legacy mid-cabin fixed wing and rotorcraft flying visible for 
the engine platforms on which ERO operates. This, coupled with continued pressure on pricing and workscopes, led to another disappointing 
ERO result. Engine trading was much reduced and that, together with further margin pressure arising from OEM actions, and reduced 
demand for lease engines, was only partially offset by the limited cost savings delivered through the footprint restructuring programme and 
additional cost reduction actions. As a result of this performance and with no visible recovery in legacy mid-cabin fixed wing and rotorcraft 
flying, an impairment review was carried out at 30 June 2016 for both the DAI and H+S CGUs within the ERO business.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were consistent with the 2016 year end goodwill impairment test, with the exception 
of discount rates which were adjusted to reflect risks specific to each CGU but had not already been reflected in the future cash flows for that 
CGU. Full detail of the assumptions used in the ERO impairment test are set out in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.

Trade receivables
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services of $6.6 million (2016: $7.5 million). 
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience and current expectations.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balances are debtors with a carrying amount of $47.0 million (2016: $58.7 million) which are past due 
at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are 
still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of these overdue receivables is  
69 days (2016: 73 days).

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the 
date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and 
unrelated. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.  
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, investments and derivative 
financial instruments.
The Group’s policy on credit risk relating to cash and derivative financial instruments is disclosed in note 17.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables. The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net 
of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous 
experience, is evidence of a reduction of the cash flows.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

The average lease term was five years (2016: five years) for equipment and 18 years (2016: 18 years) for FBO leasehold improvements. In 2017, 
the average effective borrowing rate for the Group was 6.2% (2016: 6.2%). Interest rates were fixed at the contract date or varied based on 
prevailing interest rates. 
All of the Group’s finance lease obligations are denominated in US dollars.
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ charges over the leased assets.

are negotiated for an average term of eight years for office properties, 15 years for plant and warehouses, 23 years for FBOs and  five years 
for equipment. Rentals are generally fixed or adjusted based on inflation. Following a review of certain leases during the year, the prior year 
comparatives have been restated to remain consistent with the current year.
The total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases at 31 December 2017 were  
$316.4 million (2016: $303.3 million).

1   Initial drawings under the Landmark Aviation acquisition debt facilities were for $1,000 million drawn under three facilities – Facility A, Facility B and Facility C. Facility A was  
a short-term bridge to disposal facility which was fully repaid on 30 June 2016 from the proceeds of $187 million from the disposal of the FBO bases as part of the requirements  
of the U.S. Department of Justice under the terms of the regulatory approval following the acquisition of Landmark Aviation. The balance of the proceeds of $37 million were  
used to prepay part of Facility B under the requirements of the loan documentation. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had $500 million of US private placement senior loan notes outstanding with $400 million accounted for 
at fair value through profit and loss as the fair value interest rate risk has been hedged from fixed to floating rates. The remainder is accounted 
for at amortised cost.
Under IFRS hedge accounting rules the fair value movement on the loan notes is booked to interest and is offset by the fair value movement 
on the underlying interest rate swaps.
The Group includes the fair value gain on the interest rate swaps in relation to the loan notes within net debt so that the net effect is to show 
the $500 million US private placement at face value and to reflect the fact that the liabilities will be in place until maturity. More information is 
included in note 17. 
All other borrowings are held at amortised cost.

The Group’s borrowings are funded through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. The floating rate debt exposes the Group to cash 
flow interest rate risk whilst the fixed rate US dollar private placement loan notes exposes the Group to changes in the fair value of fixed 
rate debt due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by the combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps in 
accordance with pre-agreed policies and authority limits. As at 31 December 2017, 55% (2016: 65%) of the Group’s borrowings are fixed at  
a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% (2016: 3.3%) for a weighted average period of three years (2016: three years).
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. All bank loans and loan notes are unsecured.  128

Collateral
As part of the Group’s management of its insurable risks, a proportion of this risk is managed through self-insurance programmes operated 
by the Group’s captive insurance companies, BBA Aviation Insurances Limited, based in the Isle of Man, and BBA Aviation Insurances 
(Vermont) Inc. These companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group and premiums paid are held to meet future claims. The cash 
balances held by these companies are reported on the balance sheet within cash and cash equivalents. As is usual practice for captive 
insurance companies, some of this cash is used as collateral against contingent liabilities (standby letters of credit) that have been provided 
to certain external insurance companies.

The standby letters of credit have been issued via bank facilities and the amount of these facilities corresponds to the amounts pledged as 
detailed in the table above. The amounts pledged are usually for less than one year, and are secured by a legal charge to the bank providing 
the letters of credit over the cash balances of these companies corresponding to the amount of the standby letters of credit. 
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity 
risk. Overall, the risk management policies and procedures focus on the uncertainty of financial markets and seek to manage and minimise 
potential financial risks through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which 
there is no underlying financial exposure.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of BBA Aviation plc. This 
department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with Group subsidiary companies. The treasury policies 
cover specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of 
excess liquidity. These policies are outlined on page 36.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return 
to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash 
equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements. These borrowings, together with cash generated from 
the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market-based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.
The Group is subject to two financial covenant requirements within its borrowing facilities: maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA of 3.5x 
and minimum net interest cover of 3.0x (based on EBITDA). The borrowing facilities permit the use of an ‘acquisition spike’ which allows for 
the maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA covenant to be 4.0x for two test periods following the activation of the ‘acquisition spike’. The 
‘acquisition spike’ was activated in February 2016 so the higher test applied for the testing periods ending June 2016 and December 2016. 
The maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA covenant reverted back to 3.5x for the testing period ending June 2017. The Group complied 
with these covenants during the year.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations 
in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group has well-defined policies for the management of these risks which includes 
the use of derivative financial instruments.
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues, cash flows, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in the currency in 
which the operations are located. The Group’s policy in relation to foreign exchange translation risk is not to hedge the income statement 
since such hedges only have a temporary effect. In relation to the balance sheet, the Group seeks to denominate the currency of its 
borrowings in US dollars in order to match the currency of its cash flows, earnings and assets, which are principally denominated in US dollars.
As at 31 December 2017, the majority of the Group’s net borrowings were denominated in US dollars as set out below:

Within the Group’s definition of net debt the US Private Placement (USPP) is included at its face value of $500 million (2016: $500 million) 
reflecting the fact that the liabilities will be in place until maturity. This is $2.2 million (2016: $7.3 million) lower than the carrying value, adjusted 
for the deduction of debt issuance costs. The net carrying value as at 2017 was $502.2 million (2016: $507.3 million).
The Group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange 
policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary. Each foreign exchange 
policy is individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposures within the relevant subsidiary. Transaction currency risk is managed through 
the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts. All committed exposures are fully hedged 100% and where significant foreign 
currency exposures exist then generally a percentage of the projected foreign currency flows are covered, depending on the certainty of 
these cash flows.
The transaction foreign exchange risk is measured by each subsidiary submitting regular reports to Group Treasury which detail the foreign 
currency exposure reported on the balance sheet as committed exposures and, for those subsidiaries with significant foreign exchange 
transaction exposures, an additional report detailing the future projected foreign currency cash flows over the life of the policy. The pre-
determined policy margin is shown against the projected exposures to determine whether there is a net exposure which needs to be hedged. 
If this is the case, then foreign exchange spot or forward contract(s) will be undertaken by Group Treasury on behalf of the relevant subsidiary 
with the Group’s relationship banks.

The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounting to $10.1 million (2016: $1.3 million) 
has been recognised in other comprehensive income. A gain of $2.2 million (2016: gain of $4.5 million) has been transferred to the income 
statement. 
Foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge foreign currency flows through the BBA 
Aviation plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its 
international cash pooling structure.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash flow hedges amounting to $11.1 million 
(2016: $34.6 million) have been transferred to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year. The net impact on the Group’s 
result for the period is immaterial, since the balances which these contracts relate to have had a similar but opposite effect on administrative 
expenses.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s borrowings are funded through a combination of bank debt and capital markets borrowings. The Group’s bank debt is funded 
through floating rate debt which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s capital markets borrowings are financed 
through US private placement fixed rate debt which exposes the Group to changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in 
interest rates. The Group’s policy in relation to interest rate risk specifies the portion of its debt obligations, which should be fixed through the 
use of fixed rate debt and/or interest rate swaps, based on the debt maturity profile and an assessment of interest rate trends.  132

The fair values of the financial instruments above are categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy on the basis that their fair value has 
been calculated using inputs that are observable in active markets which are related to the individual asset or liability. 
The Group has designated $626.6 million (2016: $1,045.0) interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of which $nil (2016: $150 million)
are forward starting interest rate swaps and the fair value loss of $1.7 million (2016: gain of $5.4 million) has been recognised in other 
comprehensive income. A charge of $4.0 million (2016: charge of $7.3 million) has been booked against hedged interest payments made in 
the period. 
As detailed in note 16, $400 million of the $500 million US dollar private placement loan notes included within borrowings above have been 
adjusted by fair value changes due to interest rate risk, as this has been hedged using interest rate swaps converting fixed interest to floating 
interest rates. The fair value loss of $4.3 million on the swaps has been recognised in the income statement (2016: loss of $3.8 million) which 
has been offset by the fair value gain on the related fixed rate debt of $4.3 million (2016: gain of $3.8 million). This has also been booked to the 
income statement and the net impact is immaterial. 
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well 
as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. As part of the Group’s operations, cash 
management and risk management activities, the Group is exposed to counterparty risk arising on the financial assets held by the Group and 
the credit risk on outstanding derivative financial instruments.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements – continued 133
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated

Treasury-related credit risk
The Group aims to reduce counterparty risk by dealing with counterparties with investment grade ratings, as measured by financial credit 
rating agencies. All treasury related activity is concentrated with relationship banks that provide unsecured committed facilities to the Group. 
Across the subsidiaries, wherever possible and where services can be provided efficiently and cost-effectively, bank accounts, surplus cash  
and any hedging activity are concentrated and undertaken with relationship banks.
Each counterparty that the Group uses for derivatives, bank account activity and the investment of surplus cash is assigned a maximum 
credit limit dependent upon the counterparty’s credit rating. This limit gives a maximum permitted amount of cash and derivatives that can 
be held or undertaken with each counterparty. Deposits are generally for short-term maturity of less than three months.
As at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the Group had a number of exposures to individual counterparties. These exposures are 
continually monitored and reported and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management 
activity. No significant losses are expected to arise from non-performance by these counterparties.
Commercial-related credit risk
The Group’s exposure to commercial-related credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables and the amounts 
presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. Sales to customers are settled in a number of different ways 
including cash, credit cards, cheques and electronic payment methods. A customer or potential customer is assessed on a case-by-case 
basis to determine whether credit terms will be provided. The Group does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been 
provided for, as shown in note 12.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its liquidity requirements through the use of short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts. In addition to strong cash 
generation in the businesses the Group maintains unsecured committed borrowing facilities from a range of banks to mitigate this risk 
further. Headroom on our facilities is regularly evaluated and consistently monitored to ensure that the Group has adequate headroom and 
liquidity. 
The table in note 16 provides a breakdown of the Group’s committed borrowing facilities.

Sensitivity analysis as at 31 December 2017
Financial instruments affected by market risk are derivative financial instruments. The following analysis is intended to illustrate the 
sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the derivative portfolio and the proportion of derivatives hedging foreign 
exchange risk and interest rate risk are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 December 2017 and 2016 respectively. 
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
 –    fair value interest rate swaps are assumed to be fully effective and therefore there is no impact on the income statement or balance sheet 
from changes in interest rates; 
 –    changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges are assumed to 
be recorded fully within other comprehensive income; 
 –    the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, cash and derivative 
instruments;
 –   changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement;
 –    all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the 
Income Statement; 
 –    the floating rate leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in the 
interest rate affects a full 12-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations;
 –   the sensitivity of foreign exchange rates only looks at the outstanding foreign exchange forward book and the currency bank account 
balances of the Company only as at the balance sheet date and assumes this is the position for a full 12-month period;
 –    the sensitivity of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates has been used due to the fact that historically rates can move by 
approximately 10% per annum; and
 –    the sensitivity of a 1% movement in interest rates has been used due to the fact that historically floating US dollar interest rates have 
moved by on average 1% per annum.

Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Income Statement and within other comprehensive 
income that would result from reasonably possible movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, before the effects

The foreign exchange analysis in the sensitivity table above illustrates the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on foreign 
currency transactional exposures and does not include the impact on the translation of the Group’s overseas Income Statement and Balance 
Sheet. The translation impact on profit before tax in the Group’s Income Statement from the movement in exchange rates is approximately 
$0.4 million (2016: $0.1 million) for each 1% movement in the £/$ exchange rate.

18. Provisions – continued
Insurance provisions relate to the Group’s captive insurance companies. The Group’s captive insurance companies retain a portion of the 
exposure they insure on behalf of the remainder of the Group. Currently the Group retains all or a portion of the risk in relation to its Aviation, 
Workers Compensation, Automobile and Property damage insurances. Significant delays occur in the notification and/or settlement of 
claims and judgements involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty 
at the balance sheet date. The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however, it is inherent in the nature of the 
business that ultimate liabilities may vary. Provisions for outstanding claims are estimated to cover the outstanding expected liability as well 
as claims incurred but not yet reported. The liabilities have an expected life of up to ten years (2016: ten years).
Restructuring provisions represent costs provided in relation to commitments made at the balance sheet date for reorganisations which are 
expected to occur within one year of the balance sheet date. 
Provisions in respect of discontinued operations represent a provision for environmental and other liabilities relating to businesses that  
have been disposed of by the Group in prior years. The provision of $12.0 million (2016: $11.3 million) is partially offset by expected recoveries 
from third parties of $5.7 million (2016: $5.7 million), which are included within trade and other receivables due after one year of $5.0 million, 
(2016: $5.0 million) and trade and other receivables due within one year of $0.7 million (2016: $0.7 million) in note 12. The liabilities have an 
expected life of up to 50 years (2016: 50 years).
Environmental provisions relate to environmental liabilities within continuing operations of the Group. The liabilities have an expected life of 
up to ten years (2016: ten years).
Warranty provisions relate to warranties issued in the Aftermarket Services division. The liabilities have an expected life of up to ten years 
(2016: ten years).
Other provisions relate to other trading matters from the acquisition of Landmark Aviation in the prior year. The trading matters included 
onerous leases, liabilities for indirect taxes and property dilapidation provisions. The liabilities have an expected life of up to ten years  
(2016: ten years).

19. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of plans worldwide, of both the funded defined benefit type and the defined contribution type. The normal 
pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was $9.7 million (2016: $13.1 million) of which $6.2 million (2016: $8.9 million) was 
in respect of schemes outside the United Kingdom. This includes $8.9 million (2016: $10.9 million) relating to defined contribution schemes. 
The pension costs and defined benefit obligation are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The Group’s main UK pension commitments are contained within a final salary defined benefit scheme, the BBA Income and Protection 
Plan (IPP), with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Contributions to the IPP are made and the pension cost is assessed 
using the projected unit method. As required by UK pension law, there is a board of Trustees that, together with the Group, is responsible for 
governance of the IPP.
During 2008, the Trustees of the UK defined benefit plan purchased from Legal & General Group plc an annuity to match the liabilities 
associated with pensioner members. Since the initial ‘buy-in’, further tranches of annuities have been purchased periodically in respect of 
new pensioner liabilities, although there have been no new tranches purchased during 2016 or 2017. The annuity is an investment of the UK 
plan, and all pension liabilities and responsibility for future pension payments remain with the plan. The income from the annuity matches the 
payments to be made to the pensioner members it covers and removes mortality risk in relation to those members which are the subject of 
the annuity purchase. The fair value of the annuity policy has been set equal to the present value of the related benefit payments.
The Company closed the IPP to future accrual with effect from 31 May 2016 after consultation with members. On this date, all active 
members became deferred and their pension increases in future will be linked to deferred revaluations.
The actuarial valuation of the IPP as at 31 March 2015 indicated a funding deficit of £44.5 million ($66 million at rate as at 31 March 2015).  
As agreed with the Trustees of the IPP, BBA will make deficit contribution payments to the IPP of £0.3 million per annum in addition to 
the Asset-Backed Funding payments (set out below) to meet the costs of running the IPP. At the time the funding plan was agreed, if the 
assumptions made are borne out in practice the funding deficit will be eliminated by 31 March 2034. The next actuarial valuation is due as 
at 31 March 2018, at which point the funding deficit and funding plan will be reviewed. During the year the Company has appointed a sole 
professional trustee. This decision was taken to improve scheme governance, enable more efficient and quicker decision making, and reduce 
costs. The sole trustee continues to act on behalf of the scheme members.
The US Minimum Funding actuarial valuation for the BBA retirement plan as at 1 January 2017 indicated a funding deficit of $3.2 million. 
As required by US law, BBA will make contribution payments that are in excess of the minimum required contribution amounts. The next 
actuarial valuation is due as at 1 January 2018. 
During the first half of 2014, the Group agreed a new long-term funding package with the Trustee of the IPP , following the sale of APPH 
Limited. As part of this funding package, an Asset-Backed Funding (ABF) structure was put in place, which entitles the Trustee to receive 
payments of £2.7 million each year until 2034. In addition, the Group made an additional payment of £4.2 million in January 2015.
The ABF structure consists of a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP), formed between two newly incorporated subsidiaries of the Group 
and the Trustee of the IPP. The SLP has a long-term inter-company loan receivable due from Ontic Engineering & Manufacturing UK 
Limited (Ontic UK), on which annual interest payments of £2.7 million are due over the term of the loan. The SLP will make quarterly profit 
distributions of the interest payments received from Ontic UK to the IPP, totalling £2.7 million per annum. The Trustee of the IPP acquired its 
interest in the SLP via an in-specie contribution from BBA.
The ABF structure has been established so that the three newly created entities are consolidated into the Group’s financial statements. In 
addition, the interest in the SLP held by the IPP is not treated as an asset under IAS 19, and therefore is not included as part of the Group’s 
pensions disclosures under IAS 19. Instead, the payments due to the IPP are treated as a series of payments which the Group has committed 
to make.
The split of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2017 is approximately 45% in respect of deferred members and 55% in respect of 
pensioner members. The weighted average duration of the IPP’s liabilities is approximately 15 years.  138

19. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits – continued
In February 2016, the Company acquired the Northern Executive Aviation Limited Pension and Assurance Scheme as part of the Landmark 
Acquisition. This Plan has been included in the consolidated accounts within this report with effect from 5 February 2016. The Company and 
Trustee agreed to merge the assets and liabilities of the NEA Scheme into the IPP , with an effective date of 31 December 2017. This decision 
was taken to reduce running costs of two separate plans and improve overall efficiency. Members in the NEA Scheme will continue to receive 
the same benefits following the merger. The Group’s foreign pension schemes (all in North America) mainly relate to a funded defined benefit 
pension arrangement.
There is also a post-retirement medical plan and a deferred compensation plan. Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified 
actuaries, using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
During December 2017, the main US plan undertook a bulk transfer exercise, extinguishing the liabilities for a number of members of the 
scheme. In total, $8.6 million of assets were transferred out of the scheme, with a corresponding decrease in the IAS 19 liabilities as at 
31 December 2017 of $10.7 million.
In accordance with IAS 19, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and 
healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2017. The following weighted average financial assumptions have  
been adopted:
United Kingdom North America
2017 2016 2017 2016
Per annum (%)
Discount rate 2.35 2.5 3.5 4.1
Rate of increase to pensionable salaries – – – –
Price inflation 3.1 3.2 2.3 2.3
Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.0 3.1 2.3 2.3
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate used to discount the liability be determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high-
quality corporate bond investments. The currency and terms of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the 
post-employment obligations. The discount rate for the UK Plans have been derived using a yield curve approach. The yield curve is based on 
the yield available on sterling AA rated corporate bonds of a term similar to the liabilities.
The RPI assumption for the UK Plans allow for the shape of the inflation spot curve and the duration of the Plan’s liabilities. A deduction of 
30 basis points has been made to the breakeven inflation assumption to allow for an inflation risk premium. For the UK Plans, the mortality 
assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within the plan, and a best estimate view of future mortality 
improvements. The life expectancy assumptions applying to the IPP as at 31 December 2017 are as follows:
2017 2016
Male Female Male Female
Life expectancy for a current 65-year-old (years) 22.0 24.1 22.1 24.3
Life expectancy for a 65-year-old in 15 years (years) 23.2 25.7 23.5 26.2
For the US post-retirement medical plan, the immediate trend rate for medical benefits was 8.50% which is assumed to reduce by 0.5% per 
annum to 4.5% in 2026 onwards.

The funding policy for the IPP and majority of the North American schemes is reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the 
independent scheme actuary in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the 
liabilities of the schemes over the long term.
Included within other receivables in the balance sheet are $2.6 million (2016: $2.9 million) of listed investments which are held in trust for the 
benefit of members of the deferred compensation plan in North America. These amounts are not included within the assets shown in the

At 31 December 2017, the largest single category of investment held by the UK Plans are annuities purchased from Legal and General which 
match the liabilities associated with pensioner members, with a value of $379.4 million (51.8% of the asset holding at 31 December 2017). The 
value of these annuities has been calculated as being equivalent to the value of the pensioner liabilities which they match, using the same 
actuarial assumptions used to calculate the corresponding element of the DBO. The purpose of the annuity is to help reduce asset/liability 
mismatch risk.
The remainder of the assets of the UK Plan are invested in a range of funds with different risk and return profiles, with equities being the next 
largest asset class held after the insurance contract. The objective of the remainder of the portfolio is to generate excess returns, in order to 
partially fund the UK Plan through asset performance. To the extent that actual investment returns achieved are lower than those assumed, 
then this may result in a worsening of the funding position and higher future cash contribution requirements for the Group. This is particularly 
the case in respect of the proportion of the assets held within equity instruments.
The assets of the US Plans are invested in a range of funds with different risk and return profiles. The risks inherent in the investment strategy 
for these Plans is similar to the risks posed by the investment strategy for the UK Plans, albeit they are smaller in magnitude given the size of  
the US Plans relative to the UK Plans.

The UK Plans are exposed to inflation risk as a result of the decision to grant inflation-linked increases to pensions in payment and deferment. 
There is also a longevity risk to the UK Plans if member mortality improves beyond expectations. The sensitivity of the liabilities to such

The sensitivity analysis is based on a change in one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, therefore interdependencies 
between assumptions are excluded, with the exception of the inflation rate sensitivity which also impacts salary and pension increase 
assumptions. The analysis also makes no allowance for the impact of changes in gilt and corporate bond yields on asset values. The 
methodology applied is consistent to that used to determine the defined benefit obligation.

On 22 December 2017, the United States enacted tax reform that implements substantial changes to the federal tax system reducing the 
headline federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and limiting interest deductions to a maximum of 30% of US EBITDA. The impact of the tax reform 
has meant a re-measurement of a deferred tax asset related to financing costs from prior years amounting to a charge of $54.5 million 
reflected in continuing operations, whilst additionally the reduction in the headline rate of tax has resulted in a revaluation of US deferred tax 
attributes amounting to a credit of $58.1 million.  
The net impact of this tax reform ($3.6 million credit) has been reflected in the exceptional and other items tax result (continuing $4.8 million 
credit and discontinued $1.2 million charge).
At the balance sheet date, the Group has gross temporary differences and tax losses of $1.6 billion (2016: $1.2 billion) available for offset 
against future profits for which deferred tax has not been recognised. These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of 
future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be accurately predicted at this time. Included in the unrecognised gross 
temporary difference is $nil (2016: $9.5 million relating to losses due to expire in 2020) which relates to losses that will expire by 2020. Other 
losses may be carried forward indefinitely under current tax legislation.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which 
deferred tax liabilities could arise but have not been recognised is $nil (2016: $13.0 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these 
differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant. 144

22. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments
The number of options and the associated share prices in the tables below have been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the shares 
issued under the terms of the rights issue.
(i) Share options
The Group plan provides for a grant price equal to the average of the middle market price of a BBA Aviation plc ordinary share up to five 
dealing days prior to the date of grant. The vesting period is generally three years. Share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the 
Group before the options vest.

Outstanding at the end of the year 3,017,313 195p 6,160,905 113p
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 308.83p (2016: 220.93p). The 
options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had weighted average remaining contractual life of 24 months (2016: 26 months), and an exercise 
price range of 112p to 303p (2016: 156p to 248p). Options of 56,432 (2016: 221,896) shares were granted under the BBA UK Share Option Plan 
in the year. 1,003,772 options (2016: 3,463,484) shares were granted under the BBA Savings Related Share Option Plan.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted and calculated 
using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of award. These include Black–Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo 
simulations. The inputs into the models were as follows:

March 2017

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the period of time equivalent to the 
remaining contractual life of the option. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for 
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
(ii) Share awards
Details of the conditional share awards outstanding during the year are as follows:
Number

Lapsed during the year (3,353,502) (3,304,340)
Outstanding at the end of the year 13,203,674 13,477,137
The awards outstanding at 31 December 2017 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 16 months (2016: 18 months). The 
weighted average fair value of conditional shares granted in the year was 209p (2016: 167p).
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted and calculated 
using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of award. These include Black–Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo 
simulations. The inputs into the model were as follows:

Expected dividend yield (%) 1.78% 4.75%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the period of time equivalent to the 
remaining contractual life of the option. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for 
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
(iii) Expense charged to Income Statement
The Group recognised a total expense of $9.9 million (2016: $9.1 million) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions and  
$nil (2016: $0.7 million) related to cash-settled share-based payment transactions during the year. $0.4 million (2016: $3.7 million) of that 
expense was classified as exceptional and other costs in relation to restructuring.
(iv) Other share-based payment plan
The Company’s Savings Related Share Option Plan is open to all eligible UK employees. Options are granted at a price equal to the average 
three-day middle market price of a BBA Aviation plc ordinary share prior to the date of grant, less 20%. Options are granted under three or 
five-year SAYE contracts. The maximum overall employee contribution is £500 per month.  148

24. Acquisition of businesses – continued
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to anticipated future operating synergies. $0.9 million of the goodwill is expected to 
be deductible for income tax purposes.
In the period since acquisition, the operations acquired during 2017 have contributed $0.6 million and $0.3 million to revenue and operating 
profit respectively. If the acquisitions had occurred on the first day of the financial year, it is estimated that the total revenue and operating 
profit from these acquisitions would have been $5.6 million and $1.2 million respectively.  152

ASIG divestiture
It was announced in March 2016 that, following significant inbound interest, management was assessing value maximising options for the 
Group’s investment in the ASIG business, part of the Flight Support segment. At the beginning of April 2016, management committed to a 
plan to sell substantially all of the ASIG business and as such at that point the relevant assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale. At 
that time, as a major line of the Group’s business, the ASIG operations were also classified as a discontinued operation.
On 16 September 2016, the Group announced that it had reached agreement with John Menzies plc on the terms of the sale of the ASIG 
business. The transaction completed on 31 January 2017. 
The fair values of the assets held for sale are categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy on the basis that their fair value has been 
calculated using inputs that are observable in active markets which are related to the individual asset or liability.

2016 FBO disposals 
Under the terms of the regulatory approval in connection with the acquisition of Landmark Aviation, the Company was required to sell six 
legacy Landmark Aviation FBOs at: Westchester County Airport, New York; Washington Dulles International Airport, Virginia; Scottsdale 
Airport, Arizona; Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, Alaska; Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport, California; and part of the 
Landmark facilities at Fresno Yosemite International Airport. As a result, the six FBOs referred to above were classified as a disposal group 
and held for sale from the date of acquisition. Though the operations are wholly-owned by the Group, as a result of the restrictions placed 
upon our influence by the requirements of the U.S. Department of Justice, the results of the operations were accounted for as an  
associate undertaking.
In March 2016, the Group announced the sale of six FBOs, as agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice under the terms of the regulatory 
approval for the acquisition of Landmark Aviation, for an aggregate consideration of $190 million to affiliates of KSL Capital Partners LLC (the 
transaction). The transaction closed on 30 June 2016. 
Net cash proceeds totalled $184.7 million after adjusting for the impact of working capital. There was no gain or loss recognised on the 
transaction. In the period of the Group’s ownership in 2016 the disposal group contributed $nil of revenues and $7.9 million of underlying 
operating profit which is included in the share of profits of associates and joint ventures in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Accounting Policies of the Company
Basis of accounting
BBA Aviation plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have 
been prepared using the historical cost convention adjusted for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards and law. The Company reports under Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(FRS 101).
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis in accordance with the rationale set out in the Going Concern and 
Viability Statement on page 85 of the Directors’ Report.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
– A Cash Flow Statement and related notes;
– Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
– Disclosures in respect of capital management;
– The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs; 
– Disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel; and,
– Presentation of comparative information in respect of certain items.
As the Consolidated Financial Statements of BBA Aviation plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the 
exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
– IFRS 2: Share-Based Payments in respect of Group settled share-based payments;
– Certain disclosures required by IAS 36: Impairment of Assets in respect of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets;
–  Disclosures required by IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, in respect of the cash flows of 
discontinued operations;
– Certain disclosures required by IFRS 3: Business Combinations, in respect of business combinations undertaken by the Company; and,
–  Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7: Financial Instrument Disclosures.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these  
financial statements. 
Investments
In the Company’s Financial Statements, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at cost less provision 
for impairment.
Treasury
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Any gain 
or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of transaction is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Company comprise interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. All such instruments 
are used for hedging purposes to manage the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Company in line with the Company’s risk 
management policies. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Recognition of gains or losses on derivative 
instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge.
The effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges are deferred in equity until the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the 
profit and loss account. The ineffective portion of such gains and losses is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Gains or losses on the qualifying part of net investment hedges are recognised in equity together with the gains and losses on the underlying 
net investment. The ineffective portion of such gains and losses is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the profit and loss 
account as they arise.
Accounting Policies of the Company 158
Consolidated Financial Statements
Accounting Policies of the Company
Accounting Policies of the Company – continued
Post-retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost is determined using the projected unit credit method, with valuations under FRS 
101 being carried out annually as at 31 December. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are 
recognised outside of profit or loss and presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to operating profit in the year. Any past service 
cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
average period until the benefits become vested. The interest cost on the net defined benefit deficit is included within finance costs.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service costs and reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is only 
recognised to the extent that it is recoverable. 
Defined benefit scheme contributions are determined by valuations undertaken by independent qualified actuaries.
Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of cash and equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the compensation is 
recognised in the profit and loss account as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the options granted and calculated using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of award. These include 
Black–Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. For cash-settled options, the fair value of the option is revisited at each balance 
sheet date. For both cash and equity-settled options, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to 
become exercisable at each balance sheet date.
Tangible fixed assets
Plant and machinery and land and buildings are stated in the balance sheet at cost or valuation. Depreciation is provided on the cost of 
tangible fixed assets less estimated residual value and is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives  
of the assets:
Land Not depreciated
Buildings 40 years maximum
Plant and machinery (including essential 
commissioning costs) 3–5 years
Computer and office equipment are categorised within plant and machinery in note 3 to these accounts.
Leases
Where assets are financed by lease agreements that give rights similar to ownership (finance leases), the assets are treated as if they had 
been purchased and the leasing commitments are shown as obligations to the lessors. The capitalisation values of the assets are written off 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the periods of the leases or the useful lives of the assets concerned. The capital elements of future 
lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the 
leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital payments outstanding.
For all other leases (operating leases) the rental payments are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lives of  
the leases.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive 
income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Current tax and deferred tax for the year 
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity respectively.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements (other than those involving 
estimations) that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised and to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
Management has concluded that for 2017 there are no critical accounting judgements or key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities with the next financial year.

12. Share-based payments
Details of share-based payments are provided within note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
13. Pension and other post-retirement benefits
The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom. Assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. 
Contributions to the scheme are made and pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
During the first half of 2014, the Group agreed a new long-term funding package with the Trustee of the IPP , following the sale of APPH Limited. 
This new funding package replaced the deficit contributions agreed with the Trustee as part of the 2012 triennial valuation of the IPP . As part of 
this funding package, an Asset-Backed Funding (ABF) structure was put in place. In accordance with the implementation steps of the structure 
the Company made a capital contribution to a newly formed partnership of £33 million. This has been classified as a prepayment following the 
adoption of FRS 101. This asset will unwind over the life of the ABF structure as contributions to the plan reduce the Plan deficit. The final cash 
contribution will be made by the ABF structure to the Plan in March 2034, at which point the prepayment will be fully unwound.
Details of the UK scheme are provided within note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
14. Contingent liabilities
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the 
guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment 
under the guarantee.

Consistent with the 2015 Annual Report the summary has been restated in 2014 for the impact of the rights issue and the impact of  
a reclassification of provisions.
2015, 2016 and 2017 are presented as the continuing Group as reported. The significant changes in the Group in those years as a result of 
the rights issue, the acquisition of Landmark and the disposal of ASIG mean that the 2015, 2016 and 2017 financials presented above are not 
comparable with other years.
The dividend per share for the year ended 31 December 2015 totalled 13.53¢ being an interim dividend of 4.85¢ per share plus the final 
dividend per share of 8.68¢. Removing the impact of the rights issue the total dividend per share for 2015 would have been 12.15¢.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Alternative Performance Measures
Introduction
We assess the performance of the Group using a variety of alternative performance measures. We principally discuss the Group’s results on 
an ‘adjusted’ and/or ‘underlying’ basis. Results on an adjusted basis are presented before exceptional and other items.
Alternative performance measures have been defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure below, along with the rationale behind 
using the measures.
The alternative performance measures we use are: organic revenue growth, underlying operating profit and margin, EBITDA and underlying 
EBITDA, underlying profit before tax, underlying deferred tax, adjusted basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share, return on invested 
capital, operating cash flow, free cash flow, cash conversion, and net debt. A reconciliation from these adjusted performance measures 
to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below. The alternative performance measures we use may not be 
directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Where applicable, divisional measures are calculated in accordance with Group measures.
Exceptional and other items
The Group’s income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before exceptional and other items. The 
directors believe that presentation of the Group’s results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the Group’s financial performance, as 
exceptional and other items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. This presentation is consistent with the way that financial 
performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing a meaningful 
analysis of the trading results of the Group. In determining whether an event or transaction is treated as an exceptional and other item, 
management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence. 
Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as exceptional items in the current and/or prior 
years include costs relating to significant acquisitions/disposals of significant businesses and investments, significant business restructuring 
programmes, asset impairment charges and impact of the US Tax Cuts and Job Act 2017. In the event that other items meet the criteria, 
which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as exceptional and other items. Other items include amortisation of 
intangible assets arising on acquisition and valued in accordance with IFRS 3. These charges are presented separately to improve comparability 
of the Group’s underlying profitability with peer companies.
Exceptional and other items are disclosed and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Organic revenue growth 
Organic revenue growth is a measure which seeks to reflect the performance of the Group that will contribute to long-term sustainable 
growth. As such, organic revenue growth excludes the impact of acquisitions or disposals, fuel price movements and foreign exchange 
movements. We focus on the trends in organic revenue growth.
A reconciliation from the growth in reported revenue, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the organic revenue growth,  
is set out below.

EBITDA and underlying EBITDA
In addition to measuring the financial performance of the Group and lines of business based on underlying operating profit, we also measure 
performance based on EBITDA and underlying EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as the Group profit or loss before depreciation, amortisation, net 
finance expense and taxation. Underlying EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before exceptional and other items. EBITDA is a common measure 
used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies.
We consider EBITDA and underlying EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying 
operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation. EBITDA and underlying EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, 
which is shown by our cash flow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
A reconciliation from Group operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported and underlying Group EBITDA, is set 
out below.

Return on invested capital (ROIC)
Measuring ROIC ensures the Group is focused on efficient use of assets, with the target of operating returns generated across the cycle 
exceeding the cost of holding the assets.
ROIC is calculated by dividing underlying operating profit for ROIC by net assets for ROIC, both of which are at the same exchange rate which is 
the average of the last 13 months’ spot rate. The net assets for ROIC are calculated by averaging the net assets over the last 13 months.
A reconciliation from underlying operating profit to underlying operating profit for ROIC is set out below. In addition, a reconciliation from net 
assets, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to invested capital for ROIC, is set out below.

Alternative Performance Measures
Operating cash flow
Operating cash flow is one of the Group’s Key Performance Indicators by which our financial performance is measured. Operating cash flow 
is defined as the aggregate of cash generated by operations, purchase of property, plant and equipment, purchase of intangible assets less 
Ontic licences not accounted for under IFRS 3, and proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment.
Operating cash flow is primarily an overall operational performance measure. However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our 
liquidity.
Operating cash flow reflects the cash we generate from operations after net capital expenditure which is a significant ongoing cash outflow 
associated with investing in our infrastructure. In addition, operating cash flow excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level 
independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends, share buy-backs, acquisitions and disposals, financing costs, tax payments, 
dividends from associates and the repayment and raising of debt. Operating cash flow is not a measure of the funds that are available for 
distribution to shareholders.

Cash conversion
Cash conversion is a key part of the Group strategy for disciplined capital management with absolute cash generation and strong cash 
conversion. Cash conversion is defined as operating cash flow as a percentage of continuing and discontinued operating profit. Operating 
cash flow has been reconciled above to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, being cash generated from operations.

Free cash flow
Free cash flow represents the cash that a company is able to generate after spending the money required to maintain or expand its asset 
base. Free cash flow is set out in note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and reconciled to net cash inflow from operating activities, 
the most directly comparable IFRS measure.
Net debt
Net debt consists of borrowings (both current and non-current), less cash and cash equivalents and the fair value adjustment on the US 
Private Placement loan. 
Net debt is a measure of the Group’s net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength. It is also a single 
measure that can be used to assess both the Group’s cash position and its indebtedness. The use of the term ‘net debt’ does not necessarily 
mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not defined in IFRS. The most directly comparable IFRS measure is 
the aggregate of borrowings (current and non-current), and cash and cash equivalents. A reconciliation from these to net debt is given below.

Warning to shareholders – boiler room share scams
Share fraud includes scams where investors are called out of the blue and offered shares that often turn out to be worthless or non-existent, 
or offered an inflated price for shares that investors already own. These calls come from fraudsters operating in “boiler rooms” that are 
mostly based abroad. BBA Aviation plc is aware that, in common with other companies, a small number of our shareholders have received 
unsolicited telephone calls concerning their investment in the Company, which may have been from fraudsters.
Callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders are advised not to give details of their e-mail addresses or  
other personal details to any third party that they do not know. Further information can be found on the Company’s website at  
www.bbaaviation.com under investors and shareholder information.

179 Shareholder Information This Annual Report is addressed solely to members of BBA 
Aviation plc as a body. Neither the Company nor its directors, 
employees, agents and advisors accept or assume responsibility 
to any person for this Annual Report beyond the responsibilities 
arising from the production of this Annual Report under the 
requirements of applicable English company law. Sections of this 
Annual Report, including but not limited to the Strategic Report, 
Directors’ Report and Directors’ Remuneration Report may contain 
‘forward-looking statements’ about certain of BBA Aviation plc’s 
current plans, goals and expectations relating to future financial 
condition, performance, results, strategy and objectives including, 
without limitation, statements relating to: future demand and 
markets of the Group’s products and services; research and 
development relating to new products and services; liquidity and 
capital; and implementation of restructuring plans and efficiencies. 
Statements containing the words “believes”, “intends”, “targets”, 
“estimates”, “expects”, “plans”, “seeks” and “anticipates” and 
any other words of similar meaning are forward-looking. These 
‘forward-looking statements’ involve risks and uncertainties 
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances 
that will or may occur in the future which may be beyond BBA 
Aviation plc’s control.
Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those set out 
in the forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors 
including, without limitation: changes in interest and exchange 
rates, commodity prices and other economic conditions; 
negotiations with customers relating to renewals of contracts and 
future volumes and prices; events affecting international security, 
including global health issues and terrorism; changes in regulatory 
environment; and the outcome of litigation. The Company 
undertakes no obligation to update or  revise any forward-looking 
statement in this document or any other forward-looking 
statements it may make, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or otherwise. Consequently, such forward-looking 
statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent 
uncertainties (including, without limitation, both economic and 
business risk factors) underlying such forward-looking statements 
or information.
Pages 1 to 88 inclusive consist of a Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report including the Directors’ Remuneration Report that have 
been drawn up and presented in accordance with and in reliance 
upon applicable English company law. The liability of the directors in 
connection with such reports shall be subject to the limitations and 
restrictions provided by, and shall be no greater than is required by, 
applicable English company law.
Nothing in this Annual Report should be construed as a  
profit forecast.
