STRATEGIC REPORT – OVERVIEW
Chairman’s Statement 
*
Gary Kennedy
Progress on  
many fronts
The acquisition of Peacock Foods in the US and investments  
in the UK have transformed Greencore in what has been  
a demanding year.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
FY17 has been both a challenging and 
rewarding year. We made our largest 
acquisition ever in the US and have step-
changed our UK business through organic 
growth. There were some challenges in 
delivering a programme of such complexity, 
with an impact on operating leverage in the 
period and with considerable investment  
and restructuring charges incurred. However, 
as a result of the significant activity delivered 
in the year, we are now well positioned to 
secure profitable growth and returns in the 
coming years. 
STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT
In FY17 we made further progress in  
achieving our vision to become a fast-growing, 
international convenience food leader. This 
vision and our strategy shape the direction  
of the Group. A complete outline of our 
strategic framework is provided on pages  
13 to 17, with examples of how this was 
implemented in FY17 and the priorities in 
place for FY18.
The key highlight of the year was the 
completion of the acquisition of Peacock 
Foods on 30 December 2016. The acquisition 
transforms our market and channel position  
in the US and has given us a growth platform 
of real scale. The enlarged US business has a 
well invested network, serving a diversified 
customer base across multiple channels. 
Integration is on track and the focus is on 
exploiting the potential of the commercial 
pipeline of outsourcing and innovation-led 
opportunities. 
*    The Group uses Alternative Performance Measures 
(‘APMs’) which are non-IFRS measures to monitor the 
performance of its operations and of the Group as a 
whole. These APMs along with their definitions and 
reconciliations to IFRS measures are provided in the 
APMs section on pages 176 to 179.  5 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
In the UK we strengthened our leadership 
position in the food to go category with several 
significant business wins and commercial 
launches delivered to plan, and contracts 
extended with core customers. We have 
completed a phase of network investment in 
Food to Go, and have added further capacity 
through the acquisition of the Heathrow 
facility. We have also made a substantial 
investment in the UK ready meals network,  
and have rationalised the UK portfolio with the 
planned exit from the desserts manufacturing 
business in Evercreech. Finally, we have begun 
a process of streamlining our UK organisation 
which will help underpin overall performance  
in the medium term. 
BREXIT
Although the exact nature of changes to  
come as a result of Brexit remains unclear,  
the Board continue to monitor closely its 
potential implications on the business, 
including, in particular, any potential changes 
to costs in the supply chain and the availability 
and cost of labour.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
We assess financial performance across  
the Group using a framework of profitability, 
return and cash flow measures. This framework 
underpins our financial Key Performance 
Indicators (pages 20 and 21) and our criteria 
for remuneration (pages 63 to 93).
Performance in the year has been challenging 
at times, reflecting the significant operational 
investments and strategic change in the period. 
Reported revenue in the year was £2,319.7m, 
an increase of 56.5% versus FY16, and 
Adjusted Operating Profit grew by 37.4%  
to £140.1m, both primarily driven by the 
acquisition of Peacock Foods. Adjusted 
Operating Margin was 6.0%, 90 basis points 
below the prior year, primarily due to the 
impact of the acquisition of Peacock Foods 
and the significant commercial investments  
in the UK. Adjusted EPS declined by 3.8%  
to 15.4p reflecting the increase in Adjusted 
Operating Profit, offset by a higher tax rate,  
a higher finance charge and the impact of an 
increased number of shares as a result of the 
rights issue which part funded the Peacock 
Foods acquisition. Basic EPS declined by 
80.0% to 1.9p. This was because the Group 
incurred a pre-tax exceptional charge of 
£78.2m in the period. This amount was higher 
than we would have liked, in particular the 
£29.7m impairment charge for software assets. 
This related to our decision not to proceed 
with the planned rollout of a common Enterprise 
Resource Planning (‘ERP’) platform across the 
UK business. Whilst I believe this decision is 
necessary, the impairment is nonetheless 
unsatisfactory. 
I have been pleased with the increased focus 
on cash flow and returns. This will be a theme 
for the business in FY18 and beyond. 
DIVIDENDS
The Board of Directors is recommending  
a final dividend of 3.37 pence per share.  
This will result in a total dividend for the year  
of 5.47 pence per share (FY16: 5.47 pence per 
share). The total dividend represents a pay-out 
amount of approximately 38% of Adjusted 
Earnings, in line with the policy to maintain  
an annual dividend pay-out equivalent to 
30–40% of Adjusted Earnings. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In line with the above developments in  
FY17 , we continued to develop our corporate 
governance practices. We have made progress 
in strengthening our corporate culture and 
corporate governance framework, increasing 
the transparency of our remuneration 
structures and improving our engagement  
with shareholders. I recognise this is an 
important and constantly evolving process. 
One of the Board’s top priorities was to absorb 
the lessons from the large number of votes 
against two remuneration-based resolutions 
at the Annual General Meeting in January 2017 . 
During the year, the Remuneration Committee 
Chair and I engaged with our largest 
shareholders on the future developments  
in relation to our remuneration approach.  
I found the shareholder engagement very 
valuable in trying to understand the range of 
perspectives on our remuneration and I would 
like to thank our shareholders for their input. 
The Remuneration Committee having viewed 
shareholder feedback holistically, made detailed 
proposals to the Board which have all been 
adopted and are presented in the Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration on pages 63 to 93. 
The acquisition of Peacock Foods in the US 
and importance of that geography to the 
Group has led to some governance changes. 
We have created a Group US Advisory Council 
to help inform us on market, commercial  
and regulatory matters. We have co-opted 
Tom Sampson, previously CEO of Peacock 
Foods and Kevin O’Malley, recently retired US 
Ambassador to Ireland, to the Board. Both are 
US residents and I warmly welcome them to 
the Group. Tom will also chair the Group’s US 
Advisory Council.
As part of our ongoing planned Board 
development Eric Nicoli, who was appointed 
as Non-Executive Director in May 2010 will 
retire after the December Board meeting.  
I would like to thank Eric for his outstanding 
service and contribution to the Group and  
his valuable personal counsel to myself over 
the past seven years in Greencore. In addition 
to being the Senior Independent Director, Eric 
was a member of the Nomination Committee 
and previously chaired the Remuneration 
Committee. Upon his retirement, Sly Bailey  
will take over the role as Senior Independent 
Director. 
CULTURE AND VALUES
FY17 was a demanding year for our employees 
especially as we progressed to transform the 
UK and the US business. Throughout our 
operations, regardless of geography, The 
Greencore Way continues to drive our culture 
and our values. Through my visits to the sites 
during the year, I witnessed the commitment 
and input of all of our employees and I want to 
take this opportunity to thank all our employees 
for their dedication and hard work throughout 
the year. I am particularly impressed by the  
way our new employees have integrated and 
strengthened our capabilities in many areas. 
OUTLOOK
Greencore anticipates delivering a year of 
strong growth in FY18 and is well positioned  
to drive improved profitability, cash flow and 
returns over the medium term. Building on 
what has been an intense phase of strategic 
progress and network investment, Greencore 
will now take advantage of its exposure to 
higher growth categories in the UK and US 
convenience food markets. 
The Group anticipates good revenue growth 
in FY18, driven by a full-year contribution from 
Peacock Foods and organic growth in both the 
UK and the US. Further new business wins are 
expected in the US, the financial impact of 
which will be determined by the phasing of 
commercial execution. The Group anticipates 
that the UK business will see a modest 
improvement in operating leverage despite 
continued inflationary pressures, and that the 
US division will benefit from the delivery of 
further cost synergies. The rate of EPS growth 
is expected to be moderated by an increasing 
tax rate. The Group also anticipates that by  
the end of the year it will be approaching its 
benchmark leverage ratio of approximately  
2x Net Debt to EBITDA.

STRATEGIC REPORT – OUR STRATEGY
Business Model
VISION
To be a fast-growing, international convenience food leader
CONSUMER 
• Consumers are looking for more convenient  
solutions to suit their changing lifestyles.
• The frequency of snacking has increased as 
consumers continue to expand from more  
traditional meal occasions.
• Consumers are choosing fresh and healthy  
foods that are better for them.
• Consumers continue to seek value for money  
and this remains a key factor in buying behaviour.
CUSTOMER 
• Customers are investing more in innovation to  
drive growth in increasingly competitive markets. 
• An increased focus on end-to-end costs is helping 
customers to protect and enhance margins.
• Customers have increased emphasis on optimising 
returns and are reshaping portfolios and supply 
chains to do this.
WHERE WE PLAY 
Focus on categories with strong underlying growth 
that are supported by long-term customer and consumer 
trends. In the UK we focus on sandwiches and food to go 
products supported by complementary positions in other 
convenience food categories. In the US we primarily 
manufacture sandwiches, lunch kits and salad kits. 
Serve multiple customers that are the largest and  
most relevant in their local markets, developing enduring 
partnerships with these over time. In the UK, this includes 
supply to all of the major UK supermarkets, whereas in the 
US we serve the largest US food brands including leaders 
in Consumer Packaged Goods (‘CPG’), convenience retail 
and food service. 
Leverage our expertise in food manufacturing by 
favouring processes that are people intensive and in the 
high-care environments required for ‘ready to eat’ products.
Prioritise capital for businesses where we have clear 
market leading positions.
HOW WE WIN 
We relentlessly focus on customer centricity , with 
specific sets of products and bespoke solutions for each 
customer, supported by a multi-level, multi-functional 
relationship. 
We continuously improve our operations to provide us 
with an effective and cost efficient platform to ensure we 
create value for our customers and our business.
We create great food, delivering industry-leading food 
safety and technical standards, innovating in recipes and 
technologies, and investing to understand consumers’ 
tastes and preferences. 
We put people at the core of our business, ensuring  
we attract, develop and retain the best people across  
our leadership teams and our front line colleagues. 
BUSINESS CONTEXT 9 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
KEY RESOURCES 
We employ approximately 16,000 talented, 
committed and experienced people across 
our UK, US and Irish operations. 
We have a well invested infrastructure –  
17 facilities in the UK, and 14 facilities in the 
US – that provides a strong platform to 
manufacture products for our customers. 
We always strive to use the highest 
technical standards and processes to 
develop and maintain product quality  
for our customers. 
Our strong balance sheet and cash 
generation provides us with financial 
strength to reinvest for organic growth and 
to augment this growth via selective M&A.
THE GREENCORE WAY 
The Greencore Way defines who we are 
and how we succeed:
STAKEHOLDER OUTCOMES 
Delivering industry leading economic 
performance for shareholders.
Ensuring customers are provided with 
excitement, intimacy, growth and trust.
Building effective and transparent 
relationships with suppliers.
Doing the right thing for our industry  
and communities.
Respecting and efficiently using resources 
in the environment. 
COMPETITOR
• In the UK, we compete with a number of large  
private label fresh food businesses, many of  
which are privately owned.
• In the US, we see a fragmented base of competitors 
across the categories we participate in.
• Often the principal competition for our US business  
is our customers’ in-house capabilities.
INPUTS
• Raw material sourcing is increasingly complex  
and commodity pricing remains volatile.
• The competition for labour is intense and likely  
to remain so in future. STRATEGIC REPORT – OUR STRATEGY

Chief Executive’s Review
Patrick Coveney
Securing profitable 
growth and returns
This year has been about  
setting the Group up for  
profitable growth and returns  
in a dynamic marketplace. 11 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
Q: 
IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR,  
YOU ANNOUNCED THE BOARD’S 
INTENTION TO ACQUIRE PEACOCK 
FOODS. YOU ARE NEARLY A YEAR INTO 
YOUR OWNERSHIP – HOW HAS PEACOCK 
FOODS INTEGRATED INTO THE GROUP?
Our acquisition of Peacock Foods in December 
2016 was both the largest transaction and  
the most transformational portfolio and 
organisational change in Greencore’s history. 
Our US business has now increased to more 
than four times its original size and we are, 
more than ever, an international convenience 
food leader. Of course, with the acquisition,  
we have also welcomed 3,000 new colleagues 
into our Group. 
The onboarding, integration, and development 
of Peacock Foods is going well. There is ‘much 
to do’ but we are excited by what the new 
business brings in every respect. We are 
learning a lot too. Having visited our new sites, 
met with many new colleagues, and engaged 
extensively with the Peacock Foods’ original 
customers, I am struck by how aligned we are 
culturally – a strong theme which has been 
evident since our first interactions with the 
Peacock Foods leadership team. In terms of 
culture, people, commercial relationships, 
strategy and momentum we have a platform 
now to deliver our US strategy and Group vision. 
Q: 
YOU RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A SET 
OF ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES  
IN THE UK? WHAT IS THE REASONING 
BEHIND THEM AND WHAT BENEFITS WILL 
THE NEW APPROACH BRING? 
While we have driven exceptional results in the 
UK for much of the past decade, we are very 
conscious of the challenges we continue to 
face in the UK – from the market in general 
and with our customers’ business models 
being under pressure. We must now look to 
the future, confronting these challenges as  
we build an even better business for the next 
decade. A different operating model with 
stronger capabilities is required to improve 
Cost Efficiency and to rebuild returns. 
To do this, we have put in place a 
comprehensive structural, organisational and 
efficiency programme – actually a renewed 
focus on The Greencore Way, to enable the 
Group to deliver more effectively against its 
strategy and win in the future. We will do this  
by adopting a new approach to operations  
and major projects, creating a refreshed two 
divisional UK structure, having greater functional 
centralisation, injecting new capabilities into the 
business to support our strategy, standardising 
our processes, and reducing overheads across 
the business. We plan to have the following 
changes in place in early 2018: 
• Our UK business will operate under a two 
divisional structure. Our former Prepared 
Meals divisions and parts of our former 
Grocery division will form a new division, 
called UK Convenience Foods, which will 
operate alongside Food to Go. This will 
enable us to serve our customers better 
and operate more consistently as one  
UK business. 
• We will create a more consistent and 
efficient approach to the delivery of  
UK functions: Finance, HR, Technical, 
Purchasing and IT and create three new 
central UK capabilities: Operational 
Excellence, Strategy & Development  
and Major Projects. 
• We will create a new, wider UK senior 
leadership team, comprising both divisional 
and functional leaders to embed and 
operate this new approach. 
• We expect these changes to be better  
for our people as they will provide greater 
scope to drive performance, more focus  
on what really matters, leaner and simpler 
structures, bigger roles, and better ways  
of working together.
Q: 
OVERALL, DO YOU THINK THE 
GREENCORE WAY IS WORKING 
ACROSS THE WHOLE GROUP? IS IT BEING 
EMBEDDED EFFECTIVELY THROUGHOUT 
THE NEWLY ADDED SITES? 
We have never sought to create or impose a 
culture from scratch; our approach is grounded 
in who we are and what we value. A central 
feature of The Greencore Way approach is  
that so many of our colleagues recognise  
much of their organisation, their team, their 
way of doing things, and indeed themselves  
in it. It is who we are! 
Onto these strong cultural foundations, we 
have now layered our new UK organisational 
model, our integration of the former Peacock 
Foods’ sites, and a ‘whole Group’ view on 
processes and implementation. We are 
excited by the possibilities that this ‘one 
Group view’ brings. 
Patrick Coveney was appointed  
Group Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’)  
in March 2008, having joined the  
Group in September 2005 as Chief 
Financial Officer. 
Greencore has undergone a sustained 
period of strategic, directional and 
operational change since Patrick took 
over the role of CEO, most recently in 
terms of its people agenda, geographic 
strategy and its increased capabilities. 
FY17 has seen a step-change in 
Greencore’s US strategy and organisation 
which has presented many challenges  
to overcome. It has been a transitional, 
transformative and challenging year  
for the Group in every respect; in terms 
of Greencore’s performance, strategy, 
commercial relationships, culture, 
organisational structure and leadership. 
Now in his tenth year as CEO, Patrick 
talks about some of these changes, 
challenges and opportunities.  12 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT – OUR STRATEGY
Through all of it, our core Greencore Way 
principles remain the same: 
• People at the Core
• Great Food
• Business Effectiveness
• Cost Efficiency
In the last year, we have delivered the most 
ambitious strategic, commercial, new capacity, 
and capability-building programme in  
our history. The level of change has been 
extensive and FY17 has not been without its 
challenges. However, throughout, our people 
and our Great Food have stood out and have 
remained at the heart of all that we do; it is  
our people, our food and our culture that 
underpins who and what Greencore really is. 
The Greencore Way has been a rallying point  
for our leadership approach and integration 
delivery in the US. Our approaches to people, 
culture, food and efficiency are as strong and 
consistent in the US as they are in the rest of 
Greencore. We held two extended Board 
meetings in the US – visiting Chicago, Anaheim 
and Seattle, where the senior US team engaged 
strongly with our full Board on all strategic, 
integration, operating, people, and 
performance matters – using The Greencore 
Way as a roadmap. Our US team have visited 
their colleagues in the UK to see The Greencore 
Way in action (bringing US customers in several 
instances). They have been energised by these 
engagements – taking ‘lessons learned’ back  
to their own teams. Importantly, our UK and  
US operations leadership teams are working 
together to build a single Group-wide approach 
to manufacturing and production excellence.
Q: 
CONSUMER AND CUSTOMER 
SENTIMENT ACROSS THE WORLD 
CONTINUES TO BE VOLATILE. WHAT 
TRENDS HAVE YOU SEEN IN 2017  
AND HOW ARE THEY IMPACTING  
THE BUSINESS?
Across our Group, each of our markets has 
seen significant political and marketplace 
changes in the last number of years – this has 
accelerated in the last 12 months. Despite 
these shifts, our business has continued to 
grow strongly in FY17. 
We are a customer-centric business – it is 
through the supply chains, store networks,  
and brands of our customers that we meet 
consumers’ needs for convenient, high-quality, 
great tasting food. As consumer preferences 
and tastes have evolved and fragmented,  
so too the routes to market and consumer 
engagement models have changed. 
Our customers are responding to consumer 
changes by driving new formats and ranges  
in partnership with us and other strategic 
suppliers. Meeting the needs of ‘on the go’ 
consumers remains central to our strategy.  
In this part of the food market, traditional 
definitions of channels have blurred. For 
example, if you leave the office for lunch in 
Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, or London, or in 
Chicago, Washington, Boston or Seattle, you 
don’t confine your choice to supermarkets, 
quick service restaurants (‘QSRs’) or coffee 
shops. You consider the full set – all channels, 
all formats and all brands. You then make  
your choice based on some combination of 
location, brand, value, taste and service. Our 
strategy, customer relationships and business 
model sets us up well to ensure that we have 
Great Food available at whatever point of 
purchase customers demand. 
Of course, we recognise the changes in the 
political and consumer environments of the 
UK and the US during FY17. Given the scale  
of our UK business, our management team  
is actively engaged in understanding, 
influencing and planning for different Brexit 
scenarios. More broadly, we take consumer, 
customer and regulatory risk seriously and 
have plans in place at all levels to manage 
these risks. 
Q: 
THE STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN 
UNDER PRESSURE THIS YEAR. HAS 
IT IMPACTED ON YOUR CONFIDENCE 
AND THAT OF THE BOARD IN THE 
STRATEGY OF GREENCORE? 
Clearly, I am not happy with the performance 
of our stock price this year. While rights issues 
and large strategic acquisitions can often 
contribute to stock price volatility, I have been 
disappointed with the performance since then 
– I say this both as CEO and as a shareholder! 
However, all of us – our Board, our leadership 
teams, me – are committed to building a better 
and stronger business for the long term. 
Chief Executive’s Review  
continued
FY17 has very much been a transitional year. 
There have of course been challenges during 
this transition – understandable questions 
regarding our strategy, the level of investment 
and restructuring, and a sense of chasing  
hard for performance in some of the smaller 
parts of our portfolio. Undoubtedly these 
challenges will have impacted stakeholder 
confidence and sentiment towards our stock. 
Importantly though, they have not dented our 
Board’s confidence, optimism and excitement 
for the future. It is crystal clear to me that our 
business is in better shape today in every 
respect than it has ever been. We have large 
scale, fast-growing, well invested convenience 
foods businesses in both the UK and the US;  
a set of robust, deeply embedded long-term 
customer relationships; enhanced capability, 
management teams and culture; and an 
economic model that will drive profitability, 
cashflows and returns going forward. I am 
confident the full delivery of this agenda 
should generate value for shareholders in  
the years ahead.
In closing, I would like to say that I am 
immensely proud of our Greencore colleagues 
and it is a pleasure to work with them during 
this challenging but exciting time in our 
evolution. In addition, I wanted to specifically 
thank my Board and the other senior leaders 
for the counsel, insight, skill and commitment 
that they bring to our Group. I also want to 
thank our customers and shareholders for their 
continued support as we strive to make our 
business better. 
It is a privilege to lead this organisation –  
and fun too! We are committed to making 
Greencore better in every respect. I look 
forward to helping Greencore deliver 
industry-leading performance over the 
coming years.

Strategy

1. Build on our platform in the US  
to drive strong growth and returns 
The acquisition of Peacock Foods during the year 
transformed our market and channel position in the 
US and has given us a growth platform of real scale. 
The enlarged business has an enhanced, well invested 
network, with the potential to support our ambitions 
to grow in value added, assembly-led, convenience 
food manufacturing with existing and new customers 
across the US.
Our addressable market is large and is supported by 
strong underlying growth trends. The US branded 
Consumer Packaged Goods (‘CPG’) channel accounts 
for a large proportion of US retail food sales and we 
are well placed with the largest players. The trend 
towards outsourced manufacture is driven by a need 
to improve return on capital, while dealing with a 
more complex set of consumer preferences and 
channels. In addition, the market for away from home 
consumption is large and growing as rising labour 
costs and increased concerns about food safety 
continue to increase the relevance of added value 
supply partners to CPG and foodservice brands.
Peacock Foods was acquired in December 2016  
and the integration and synergy delivery is on track. 
Key investments in the period were the significant 
expansion in our Carol Stream, Illinois facility to  
cater for a new contract win in meal kits, and further 
expansion in our Romeoville, Illinois facility. 
We have a strong commercial pipeline for our new 
enlarged network that allows us to exploit growth 
opportunities with both existing and new customers.
Convenience Foods US division reported FY17 
revenue growth of 295.0% to £0.9bn, an increase  
of 5.9% on a pro forma basis. Pro forma volume 
growth, a more meaningful indicator of underlying 
performance, rose by approximately 7% and was 
driven by good category growth and business wins. 
Adjusted Operating Profit increased by £35.4m to 
£33.3m, representing a margin of 3.8% (+470bps  
on FY16).
We will complete the integration of Peacock Foods 
and will deliver the planned synergies associated 
with this. 
We will continue to leverage our fresh, frozen and 
ambient capabilities to expand and extend our 
pipeline of commercial opportunities with existing 
and new customers, particularly in the CPG channel 
– while maintaining our reputation for excellent food 
safety and innovation.
These opportunities, coupled with an improving 
customer mix, will help the US division to leverage  
its enlarged network footprint and wider capabilities 
to drive profitable growth and enhanced returns.

2. Enhance our leadership position in UK 
convenience food, especially in food to go
Our performance in the UK is underpinned by our 
leadership of the fast-growing food to go category. 
Growth in the food to go category of 6.6% comfortably 
exceeded the 2.9% growth in the overall food market. 
The category continues to benefit from supportive 
underlying consumer trends and further growth in  
the space dedicated to food to go in supermarket  
and specialist channels. The Group has built strong 
long-term partnerships with our customers who are 
also looking to this category for growth. 
This is complemented by market-leading positions in 
convenience food categories including ready meals 
and cooking sauces. In recent years these businesses 
have benefitted from an increasing preference for 
private label products, which have outpaced brands 
in their categories.
We strengthened our leadership position and 
increased market share in the food to go category 
with several significant business wins, commercial 
launches delivered to plan plus contracts extended 
with core customers. 
Capacity is in place for medium-term growth in Food 
to Go, having substantially completed a phase of 
network investment with key customers and having 
added further capacity through the acquisition of 
the Heathrow facility and the integration of the 
Atherstone facility. 
We also invested in the UK ready meals network  
to position for future growth, and continued to 
rationalise our UK portfolio with the exit from the 
desserts manufacturing business in Evercreech. 
Convenience Foods UK & Ireland division reported 
FY17 revenue growth of 14.3% to £1.4bn, an increase 
of 11.9% on a pro forma basis. This was primarily 
driven by our Food to Go business which accounted 
for approximately 60% of divisional revenue in the 
period. Adjusted Operating Profit increased by 2.6% 
to £106.8m, representing a margin of 7.4% (-90bps  
on FY16).
As the operational disruption from network and 
commercial investment eases, we will leverage the 
invested overhead to improve cost effectiveness  
and position ourselves for future volume growth.
We will use our investment in consumer insight  
and additional capacity to grow the category in 
partnership with our customers. We will work with 
our customers to maximise product returns through 
collaborating on initiatives including sourcing, 
ordering, merchandising, and waste management. 
We have moved to multi-year supply arrangements 
with our major customers to support this investment 
for the long term.
Following investment in our ready meals category  
in FY17 (due to complete in FY18), the priority is  
now to strengthen our strong positions with our  
key customers in that category. 
We will streamline and strengthen our UK  
divisional and cost structures. This will involve  
the implementation of a more compact divisional 
structure, overhead reduction, upgraded operational 
capability, greater functional centralisation and 
standardisation.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE
3. Develop enduring  
customer partnerships
Strong relationships with our customers has been  
a critical element of Greencore’s success for many 
years. We have a broad retail customer base in  
the UK, with significant sales to each of the largest 
supermarket customers and good coverage of the 
convenience and discounter channels. In the US,  
we serve many of the largest CPG food companies 
along with leaders in convenience and foodservice. 
Our relationships with our customers in both markets 
are characterised by strong partnerships underpinned 
by long-term agreements, a track record of excellent 
customer service and multiple personal relationships 
across functions and levels.
This was a particularly successful year for the further 
development of the Group’s long-term partnership 
model with key customers in Food to Go. Several 
significant business wins and commercial launches 
were delivered to plan. The business also extended  
a number of contracts with its core customers in the 
year and now has multi-year sole supply contracts in 
place with all of its top customers.
The launch of a business win in meal kits in Carol 
Stream was a great example of the customer 
partnership model in the US, a true joint business plan 
driving all aspects including execution and capital. 
We innovate at all levels within the business. During 
FY17, 46% of our products in the UK and the US were 
new to market, as we worked with customers on 
product or packaging development initiatives.
We will develop strategic relationships with  
our customers to achieve the best outcome for  
them, their consumers and Greencore. Through 
these relationships, we will move beyond food 
manufacturing to provide distribution, innovation, 
new product development and category 
management solutions.
We will continue to advance our US commercial 
pipeline and deepen our customer relationships, 
including our recently extended strategic 
partnership with one of our largest customers.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE
4. Invest in people,  
infrastructure and capability
With approximately 16,000 staff employed in over  
30 facilities in the UK, US and Ireland, Greencore  
is a people-intensive business and we believe that 
we ultimately differentiate ourselves through our 
people. We provide an integrated approach to  
staff and leadership development that we believe  
is critical to our continued success.
World-class delivery of food safety and technical 
excellence through the supply chain is a further 
distinguishing capability for us, requiring ongoing 
investment and attention.
We have invested in additional capacity where 
required to support organic growth and we  
believe these investments will enhance our  
long-term returns profile.
During the year we successfully expanded our 
workforce to support significant growth and invested 
in our performance management system to share 
best practice and provide a consistent approach  
to divisional and functional deployment. 
We also welcomed Peacock Foods’ colleagues to  
the Greencore Group and through this integration, 
began to share and learn from alternative ways  
of working, in line with our principle of Business 
Effectiveness.
In Food to Go, we invested in capacity for the 
medium term by completing a phase of network 
investment with key customers, integrating the 
Atherstone facility, and acquiring a sandwich 
manufacturing facility near Heathrow. We also 
invested in our UK ready meals network. In the US,  
we expanded our Carol Stream and Romeoville 
facilities to deliver business wins with existing  
and new CPG customers.
The scope of network and commercial investment 
across the division in FY17 leaves us well positioned 
for growth in the short to medium term.
We will streamline and strengthen our UK 
organisational and cost structure. This programme 
involves a more compact divisional structure, 
upgraded operational capability, and greater 
functional centralisation and standardisation  
of processes across the business.
In the US, the integration programme and 
investment in people and organisational 
strengthening will continue.
We will continue to enhance our engagement and 
retention strategy and maintain pay structures and 
employment conditions to ensure labour availability. 
Learning and development opportunities will be 
provided at all levels of the Group, in line with our 
principle of People at the Core. We will ensure  
that our food safety and technical standards are 
maintained at the highest level. 
We will continue to generate value through careful 
investment in infrastructure and capacity that 
supports growth opportunities and enhances 
returns. We will focus on specific investments in 
technology that will deliver operational benefits.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE
5. Maintain a strong financial  
and economic model
In pursuing our strategic objectives we maintain 
prudent, relatively low levels of financial risk. This 
provides us with a platform to generate sustainable 
cash flow that is used for effective capital allocation.
Return on invested capital is a key internal measure 
of value creation and is driven by increased profit  
conversion from the existing asset base, managing 
capital allocation effectively, and maintaining robust 
internal disciplines and metrics.
Our focus in FY17 has been on reducing the 
trajectory of capital spend throughout the year. A 
number of initiatives were executed in this regard, 
including the decision to exit our chilled desserts 
facility in Evercreech, our decision not to proceed 
with the remainder of the planned rollout of an 
Enterprise Resource Planning (‘ERP’) system across 
the UK business and our facility acquisition near 
Heathrow to enable capacity in food to go in a 
capital efficient manner.
In addition, we continue to expand capacity in the US 
through a co-investment model with our customers. 
We strengthened our capital structure in FY17.  
In December 2016, the Group raised £427.0m  
by way of a rights issue. The net proceeds of the  
rights issue, combined with a new five year $249m 
bank facility, were used to finance the acquisition  
of Peacock Foods. The Group also extended the 
maturity of its bank facilities and remains well 
financed with committed facilities of £720m that 
have a weighted average maturity of 4.4 years.  
Net Debt: EBITDA leverage as measured under 
financing agreements was 2.4x.
Increased cash flow will be generated from the 
combination of an enlarged profits base, tightly 
managed working capital, normalising capital 
expenditure levels and management of other 
operating cashflows.
Sustaining an effective capital structure will remain  
a key priority. This will be shaped by our leverage 
benchmark of approximately 2x Net Debt: EBITDA,  
a dividend payout ratio of 30–40% of adjusted  
annual earnings, and a disciplined M&A and 
portfolio strategy.

Financial Key Performance Indicators
The Group uses a set of headline Key Performance Indicators 
(‘KPIs’) to measure the performance of its operations and of the 
Group as a whole.
PRO FORMA REVENUE GROWTH 
The Group uses Pro Forma Revenue Growth  
as it believes this provides a more accurate 
guide to underlying revenue performance.
Pro Forma Revenue Growth for FY17 adjusts 
reported revenue to reflect ownership of 
both Peacock Foods and The Sandwich 
Factory for the full period of both FY16  
and FY17 and excludes the impact of the 
Heathrow acquisition. These figures are  
also presented on a constant currency  
basis and exclude the impact of the 53rd 
week in FY16.
ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT
The Group uses Adjusted Operating Profit  
to measure the underlying and ongoing 
operating performance of each business  
unit and of the Group as a whole.
Adjusted Operating Profit excludes 
exceptional items which are deemed one 
time in nature, the impact of the amortisation 
of acquisition-related intangible assets, net 
financing costs and the impact of taxation. 
ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (‘EPS’)
The Group uses Adjusted EPS as a key measure 
of the overall underlying performance of the 
Group and returns generated for each share. 
The Group calculates Adjusted EPS by dividing 
Adjusted Earnings by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the 
year, excluding Ordinary Shares purchased and 
held in trust in respect of the Annual Bonus 
Plan, the Performance Share Plan and the 
Executive Share Option Scheme. Adjusted 
Earnings is after excluding exceptional items 
which are deemed one time in nature. It also 
excludes pension finance items (net of tax), the 
amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles 
(net of tax), foreign exchange on inter-company 
and external balances where hedge accounting 
is not applied and the movement on fair value 
of derivative financial instruments and related 
debt adjustments.
Pro forma revenue increased by 9.4% in  
FY17 driven by underlying category growth, 
and the contribution from substantial new 
business wins particularly in our Food to Go 
business in the UK.
In the US, the Peacock Foods business 
operates the majority of its revenue contracts 
on a pass through basis and as such is entitled 
to pass on the price of materials directly to  
the customer as part of its finished goods. 
Accordingly, while revenue and costs of sales 
can be impacted by changes in material 
inflation or deflation, these changes do not 
impact profit delivery, therefore volume growth 
is a more important indicator of performance. 
Pro Forma Volume Growth for Convenience 
Foods US was approximately 7% in the year.
Adjusted Operating Profit was £140.1m, 
compared to £102.0m in FY16, an increase  
of £38.1m largely due to the impact of the 
Peacock Foods acquisition.
Adjusted EPS were 15.4 pence compared to 
16.0 pence in FY16, a decrease of 3.8%. The 
decrease reflects the increase in Adjusted 
Operating Profit offset by a higher tax rate,  
a higher interest charge and an increased 
number of Ordinary Shares in issue as a 
result of the rights issue which completed  
in December 2016.
The Group has identified these KPIs to measure progress of our strategic imperatives in delivering profitability, returns and cashflow generation. 
Although the measures are separate, the relationship between them is also monitored. Certain of these KPIs are non-IFRS measures or Alternative 
Performance Measures (‘APMs’). The definitions and reconciliations of all APMs to IFRS are set out within the APMs section on pages 176 to 179.

RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (‘ROIC’)
The Group uses ROIC as a key measure to 
determine returns from each business unit, 
along with the measurement of potential new 
investments. The Group uses invested capital 
as the basis for this calculation as it reflects 
tangible and intangible assets the Group  
has added through its capital investment 
programme, the intangible assets the Group 
has added through acquisition, as well as the 
working capital requirements of the business.
The Group calculates ROIC as net Adjusted 
Operating Profit after tax (‘NOPAT’) divided by 
average invested capital. NOPAT is calculated 
as Adjusted Operating Profit plus share of 
profit of associates before tax, less tax at the 
effective rate in the Income Statement. 
Invested capital is calculated as net assets 
(total assets less total liabilities) excluding  
Net Debt and the balance sheet value of 
derivatives not designated as fair value 
hedges. It also excludes retirement benefit 
obligations (net of deferred tax assets). 
Average invested capital is calculated by 
adding together the invested capital from  
the opening and closing balance sheet and 
dividing by two. 
OPERATING CASH FLOW
The Group uses Operating Cash Flow as a 
key metric to measure the amount of cash 
generated by the operating activities of each 
business unit and of the Group as a whole.
The Group calculates Operating Cash Flow as 
Adjusted Operating Profit plus depreciation,  
IT related amortisation, share-based payment 
expense, dividends received from associates, 
movement in working capital, Maintenance 
Capital Expenditure, cash outflow related to 
exceptional items and other movements within 
operating activities. 
The Group’s ROIC in FY17 was 12.2% compared 
to 13.8% in FY16. FY17 ROIC was impacted  
by an increase in the effective tax rate, the 
acquisition of Peacock Foods in the US and 
significant strategic capital expenditure in  
the UK to enable future growth.
Operating Cash Flow was £117.8m compared 
to £113.9m in FY16, an increase of £3.9m 
reflecting increased EBITDA partly offset  
by exceptional cash outflows and increased 
Maintenance Capital Expenditure in the 
period, along with a slight working capital 
outflow compared to an inflow in FY16.

Non-financial Key 
Performance Indicators
The Group measures progress against a number of 
non-financial Key Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’). 
Monitoring these areas is relevant to our strategy and important to our long-term success. The Greencore Way model  
shows how we achieve success in a number of these areas. Some of these non-financial KPIs are being developed to be 
Group-wide, taking into account the acquisition of Peacock Foods. 
1. PEOPLE AT THE CORE 
The Group is a highly people-intensive 
business, which is why people are at the core  
of The Greencore Way. Greencore constantly 
strives to build stronger capabilities through 
its people. Our people’s health and safety, 
development needs and recognition of their 
contributions are key priorities.  
HEALTH AND SAFETY
‘Keeping People Healthy and Safe’ is a top 
priority in the People at the Core principle. 
The Group maintains the highest safety 
standards and uses an accident incidence  
rate as the key benchmark. The rate has been 
impacted by the addition of Peacock Foods. 
However, the Group has made underlying 
continuous improvement. For the year under 
review, the rate increased to 0.60 from 0.57 , 
reflecting the expanded business.

2. GREAT FOOD 
The Group’s success is based on the ability to 
be dynamic and innovative when it comes to 
product and recipe development, as well as 
following best practice in food safety and 
integrity standards.
FOOD SAFETY ACCREDITATION
Our commitment to ensuring only the  
highest food safety and integrity standards is 
demonstrated through our supplier approval 
and audit process. The Group maintains 
industry leading food safety and traceability 
processes and procedures. All sites in the UK 
and US are subject to independent third party 
audits under the Global Food Safety Initiative 
Standard. In the UK all sites are registered 
under the British Retail Consortium (‘BRC’) 
Unannounced Scheme, whilst in the US sites 
are audited against BRC or Safe Quality Foods 
level 3. 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
The Group’s innovation rate in FY17 was 46% 
which means that, of our 3,946 products, 1,802 
of them had undergone some form of product 
or packaging development during the course  
of the year. This is an increase of 4% from FY16.

3. ENVIRONMENT
How the Group interacts with the environment 
is crucial to our ability to operate successfully. 
Waste management, energy efficiency and 
carbon disclosure are significant elements of 
Greencore’s interaction with the environment 
and the Group utilises a series of initiatives to 
measure this.
WASTE TO LANDFILL
In line with the Group’s lean programmes the 
Group focuses on eliminating and minimising 
waste and working towards sustainable 
maintaining recovery and recycling rates. 
In FY17, our UK manufacturing sites have 
maintained a 0% disposal rate with all solid 
waste being reused, recycled or recovered.

STRATEGIC REPORT – OUR STRATEGY
Risks and Risk Management
As a leading food manufacturer in a highly competitive 
environment, it is critical that Greencore identifies, assesses 
and prioritises its risks. This, along with the development of 
appropriate mitigating actions, enables us to monitor, minimise 
and control the probability and impact of these risks.
OUR APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management is the responsibility  
of the Board and is integral to the ability  
of the Group to deliver on its strategic 
objectives. The Board recognises the need  
for a robust system of internal control and  
risk management in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. There is a clear 
link between risk and risk management and 
the Company’s ability to continue as a viable 
entity. This is set out in further detail on pages 
61 and 62.
The Board establishes the culture of effective 
risk management throughout the business  
by identifying and monitoring the material 
risks, setting risk appetite and determining  
the risk tolerance of the Group. The Board is 
responsible for establishing and maintaining 
appropriate systems and controls to manage 
risk within the Group and to ensure compliance 
with relevant regulation.
Under delegation from the Board, the Audit 
Committee regularly monitors the Group’s risk 
management systems. The Audit Committee 
is responsible for overseeing the effectiveness 
of the internal control environment of the 
Group. Details of the activities of the Audit 
Committee for the year under review can be 
found in the Report of the Audit Committee 
set out on pages 94 to 100.
The Group has a well-established internal  
audit function, known as the Risk Management 
Group (‘RMG’) whose role is to provide 
independent assurance that the Group’s risk 
management, governance and internal control 
processes remain appropriate and continue to 
operate effectively.
The Board has considered its obligations in 
relation to providing an annual Going Concern 
Statement and Viability Statement. Its review 
and conclusions in this regard are set out on 
page 61 of the Directors’ Report.
IDENTIFYING AND MONITORING 
PRINCIPAL RISKS
Principal risks are identified through  
a well-established business-wide risk 
assessment process, which is known as  
a ‘bottom up approach’, along with an 
evaluation of the strategy and operating 
environment of the Group, which is known  
as a ‘top down approach’.
The bottom up review encompasses the 
identification, management and monitoring of 
risks in each area of the business and ensures 
risk management controls are embedded within 
the business’ operations. This process includes 
an assessment of the risks to determine the 
likelihood of occurrence, potential impact  
and the adequacy of the mitigation or control  
in place. A full review is then undertaken by 
operational management, who evaluate the 
material risks of the Group with reference to  
its strategy and the operating environment. 
The Audit Committee monitors these 
processes, reviewing the Risk Register  
and reporting material risks to the Board.
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties 
during FY17 are summarised in the risk profile 
table as set out in pages 26 to 29.
Given the scale of our UK business, Brexit 
continues to be an area of focus requiring 
continual monitoring. Although the nature  
of the changes to come is currently unclear, it 
has already created uncertainty in the financial 
markets, including a significant fall in the value 
of sterling. The overall short to medium-term 
effects for the Group are additional risks to 
margins caused by higher costs in the supply 
chain and uncertainty regarding the availability 
and cost of labour. Consideration for these  
risks have been incorporated into the Group’s 
principal risks as appropriate.
RISK APPETITE
The Board considers and assesses risks in  
four broad categories, namely; strategic, 
commercial, operational and financial. As a 
consumer foods business, the Board has a  
low risk appetite for risks which may impact 
the Group’s reputation or brand in financial, 
compliance or operational areas such as 
product quality and safety, health and safety 
and compliance with laws and regulations. 
However, the Board recognises that, in pursuit 
of strategic growth objectives, there is a 
trade-off between risk and reward in making 
certain strategic investment decisions e.g. 
acquisitions, capital investments or new 
market expansions. In these cases, a higher 
level of risk may be accepted. Through  
the risk management framework outlined  
above, all strategic investment decisions are 
approved by the Board. These are supported 
by detailed documentation and analysis, along 
with senior management input, to ensure  
that the risks associated with each decision, 
and the related execution plan, are fully 
understood and accepted.  25 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
RISK ASSURANCE

model to provide assurance that each risk has 
adequate control and mitigation:

STRATEGIC REPORT – OUR STRATEGY
Risk area Description of risk Control Movement
STRATEGIC
Competitor 
Activity
The Group operates in highly competitive 
markets. Significant product innovations, 
technical advances or the intensification  
of price competition by competitors could 
adversely affect the Group’s results.
The Group develops long-term relationships 
with its customers that are based on several 
factors including quality, service, innovation 
and costs effectiveness. The Group continually 
works to streamline its cost base to ensure it 
remains competitive. The Group also invests  
in research and development and continuous 
improvement to ensure that the introduction of 
both new products and improved production 
processes places the Group at the forefront of 
customer needs in its chosen markets. 
The risk has stayed  
the same.
Growth  
and Change
The Group is pursuing a strategy of growth and 
expansion. In the US, it has made the significant 
acquisition of Peacock Foods, positioning it for 
further growth with a broad set of customers. In 
the UK, the Group has recently won significant 
customer contracts. Delivering this strategy  
will necessitate organisational change and 
investment, major capital investments and 
potential further corporate development 
opportunities. The level of growth and 
consequent organisational change is 
particularly high in the US, given the integration 
of Peacock Foods. Major capital investments 
and corporate development opportunities are 
often high cost, may involve significant change 
and may result in the addition of material 
numbers of new employees. 
The Board and senior management engage  
in a robust, formal and thorough process  
for identifying, measuring and deciding  
on the suitability of such growth and change 
initiatives. In the case of acquisitions, an 
integration team reporting to senior Group 
management and the Board is established to 
ensure a successful integration. Resources are 
put in place as deemed necessary to manage 
business change. Post project reviews are 
carried out on all major capital investment 
projects to monitor the effectiveness of 
execution. In the case of Peacock Foods, 
significant resources have been allocated  
to ensure an effective integration. 
The gross risk has increased, 
principally due to the 
Peacock Foods acquisition 
and other major projects.
COMMERCIAL
Changes in 
Consumer 
Behaviour  
and Demand
In common with other food industry 
manufacturers, unforeseen changes  
in food consumption patterns or in  
weather patterns may impact the Group.  
In addition, demand for a number of  
the Group’s products can be adversely 
affected by fluctuations in the economy.
The Group works closely with its customers  
to adapt to changing consumer trends  
and invests in market research, innovation  
and new product development to ensure 
regulatory, customer and consumer 
requirements are addressed. In the US,  
it works with brands that are leaders in  
the categories in which they operate.
The risk has stayed  
the same.
Key Customer 
Relationships 
and Grocery 
Industry 
Structure
The Group benefits from close commercial 
relationships with a number of key customers. 
The loss of any of these key customers, or an 
impact to the relevant brand reputation, or a 
significant worsening in commercial terms, 
could result in a material impact on the Group’s 
results. In addition, changes to the grocery 
industry structure in either the UK or the US may 
also adversely affect performance. For example, 
the grocery market in the UK is undergoing 
significant change with the growth of limited 
assortment discounters, small stores and online 
sales. In the US, the large consumer packaged 
goods industry is going through significant 
consolidation and ownership change.
The Group invests significant resources to 
maintain deep, multi-level relationships which 
drive value and minimise risk for both itself and 
its key customers. The Group also continues to 
focus on a broad range of customers across all 
formats in both the UK and the US.
The gross risk has increased 
principally due to the 
Peacock Foods acquisition.

Raw Material 
and Input  
Cost Inflation
The Group’s cost base and margin can be 
affected by fluctuating raw material and 
energy prices and changes in cost and  
price profile. 
The combined Group may also be impacted 
by the loss of a key supplier. The Group relies 
on a concentrated number of key suppliers.  
A loss of, or interruption of supply from a key 
supplier could cause short-term disruption  
to the operational ability of the Group and 
adversely affect its results.
The Group maintains a strong commercial focus 
on purchasing, process and cost improvement 
to manage and mitigate these risks. In addition, 
the Group adopts strategies that diversify  
risk thereby improving the positioning of its 
businesses and the defensibility of its margins. 
In the US, the Group operates most of its 
contracts on a pass-through basis, which also 
reduces the exposure to these fluctuations. In 
the UK, the Group now has a number of cost 
transparency models with its customers, which 
also seek to mitigate the impact of input cost 
fluctuations. The Group has mitigated the 
impact of 3% cost inflation in FY17 in the UK 
through this combined approach.
The gross risk has increased, 
due to currency volatility  
and the continuing 
uncertainty associated  
with Brexit.
OPERATIONAL
Food Industry 
Regulations
As a producer of convenience foods and 
ingredients, Greencore is subject to rigorous 
and constantly evolving regulations and 
legislation, particularly in the areas of food 
safety and environmental protection. Failure 
to comply with such regulations may lead to 
serious financial, reputational or legal risk.
The Group maintains strong technical 
functions in both the UK and the US, which  
sets high standards for food safety and 
environmental controls, striving for best 
practice above and beyond the minimum 
compliance requirements. In addition, 
Greencore closely monitors emerging issues  
in an ever-changing regulatory environment to 
address increasing compliance requirements.
The risk has stayed  
the same.
Product 
Contamination
The Group produces a large volume of  
food annually and there are risks of product 
contamination through either accidental or 
deliberate means. This may lead to products 
being recalled as well as being a significant 
draw on resources and could therefore result 
in both a financial and/or reputational impact 
on the Group.
The Group maintains industry leading  
food safety and traceability processes  
and procedures. Each facility in the UK and  
the US has a team dedicated to ensuring 
compliance with Group and industry standards 
in this area and the Group constantly monitors 
performance against a detailed set of metrics 
and measures. They are subject to a significant 
number of audits by internal teams, customers 
and independent bodies auditing against 
recognised global food safety standards.  
The Group also operates stringent controls 
across its supply chain, including audits and 
strict approval of its suppliers, supported by 
rigorous ethical and quality checking of all 
ingredients. In FY17 , 73,732 internal audits  
and 655 external audits were carried out at  
our facilities and 189 audits were carried out  
on Group suppliers.
The risk has stayed

Health  
and Safety
In addition to the obvious human cost,  
a serious workplace injury or fatality  
could inevitably carry serious financial, 
reputational and legal risk.
The Group has in place strong processes and 
procedures in health and safety, supported by 
an established review programme across all 
sites. We also have a culture of engagement 
throughout the business from executive 
management through to the shop floor.
The risk has stayed

Disruption  
to Day to  
Day Group 
Operations
The Group is at risk of disruption to its day  
to day operations from poor operational 
management, the breakdown of individual 
facilities or the loss of a significant 
manufacturing plant.
The Group maintains operational processes 
and procedures to ensure effective operational 
management at each facility. The Group invests 
in high calibre on-site teams, with responsibility 
across engineering and maintenance, supply 
chain, planning and operational excellence.  
The Group also maintains robust security and 
comprehensive operational disaster recovery 
plans. In addition, the Group undertakes 
regular reviews of all sites with external 
insurance and risk management experts,  
with these reviews being aimed at improving 
the Group’s risk profile.
The risk has stayed  
the same.
Recruitment  
and Retention of 
Key Personnel 
The business is currently experiencing strong 
growth and undergoing significant change, 
including the integration of colleagues through 
the Peacock Foods acquisition and the 
reorganisation in the UK. The ongoing success 
of the Group is dependent on attracting and 
retaining high quality senior management who 
can effectively implement the Group’s strategy.
The Group mitigates the risk through  
robust succession planning and strong 
recruitment processes, offering competitive 
and attractive remuneration and benefits 
packages. In addition, the Group has also 
established the senior executive leadership 
team, which supports succession planning  
at the senior management level.
The risk has stayed  
the same.
Labour 
Availability  
and Cost
Due to political and economic pressures and 
changes, there may be a risk that labour cost 
and availability may be affected and this would 
have a detrimental impact on the Group. The 
Group needs to also ensure it is compliant with 
any ethical legislation, such as the ‘Working 
Time Directive’ and ‘Eligibility to Work’ in  
the UK and the relevant legislation in the US. 
Failure to comply could result in heavy fines  
and reputational damage. 
The Group is continually reviewing and 
improving its recruitment processes to  
reflect changing market conditions, including 
rigorous compliance checks. The Group also 
has a strong commitment to excellent working 
conditions, on-the-job training and specific 
programmes to enhance communication  
and colleague engagement. The Group  
also maintains a strong commercial focus on 
process and cost improvement to manage  
and mitigate the increased cost of labour. 
The gross risk has increased, 
due to continuing uncertainty 
associated with Brexit.

IT Systems and 
Cyber Risk
The Group relies heavily on information 
technology and continuous investment in 
systems to support our business. An extended 
failure of our core systems, caused by accidental 
or malicious actions, including those resulting 
from a cyber-security attack, could result in a 
significant impact on the business. In common 
with most large global companies, the Group is 
susceptible to cyber-attacks with the threat to 
the confidentiality, integrity and availability of 
such systems. Whilst no material losses related 
to cyber security breaches have been suffered, 
given the increasing sophistication and evolving 
nature of this threat, we cannot rule out the 
possibility of them occurring in the future. 
Greencore maintains a program of controls  
and processes, including disaster recovery  
to protect the confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of information across the Group.  
Recent Group business wins have highlighted 
that the Group will increasingly be required by 
its clients to show compliance with accepted 
Information Security Standards and the Group 
plans to review the full set of control documents 
against the requirements of ISO27001. In 
addition, the Group has cyber insurance to 
transfer part of the risk of any deliberate attack 
over to our insurer. 
The gross risk has increased, 
principally due to heightened 
cyber threat levels globally.
FINANCIAL AND OTHER
Interest  
Rates, Foreign 
Exchange  
Rates, Liquidity 
and Credit
In the multi-currency and multi-national 
trading environment in which the Group 
operates, there are inherent risks associated 
with fluctuations in both foreign exchange 
rates and interest rates. In addition, in the 
current economic climate, the Group’s credit 
rating and its related ability to obtain funding 
for future development and expansion are 
specific risks.
These risks are actively managed by the 
Group’s treasury team, which operates  
within the framework of strict Board approved 
policies and procedures which are explained 
further in Note 21 to the Group Financial 
Statements. During the course of the year, the 
Group entered into a new bank facility, to part 
finance the acquisition of Peacock Foods and 
extended the maturity of some of its primary 
committed bank facilities. The Group remains 
well financed with committed facilities of 
£720m at year end and a weighted average 
maturity of 4.4 years.
The level of foreign exchange 
risk has increased principally 
due to global uncertainty 
associated with Brexit.
Employee 
Retirement 
Obligations
The Group’s legacy defined benefit pension 
funds are exposed to the risk of changes  
in interest rates and the market values of 
investments, as well as inflation and the 
increasing longevity of scheme members. The 
recent volatility in worldwide equity markets 
and decline in bond yields has highlighted the 
risk of employee retirement valuations.
These risks are mitigated by paying 
appropriate contributions into the funds  
and through balanced investment strategies 
which are designed to avoid a material 
worsening of the current surplus or deficit in 
each fund. The Group has closed all legacy 
defined benefit pension schemes to future 
accrual. Where relevant, the Group also  
uses specific arrangements with schemes  
to improve the security of scheme benefits, 
while reducing contributions.
The risk has stayed  
the same.
Taxation
In an increasingly complex, international tax 
environment, such matters as changes in tax 
laws, changing legal interpretations, tax audits 
and transfer pricing judgements may impact the 
Group’s tax liability or reporting requirements. 
Failure to accumulate and consider relevant tax 
information may result in non-compliance with 
tax regulations or adverse tax consequences.
The Group employs internal tax experts in 
both the US and the UK, who support the 
Group in ensuring compliance with all taxation 
matters globally. The Group also engages 
external taxation advisors for research, use of 
economic statistical studies and guidance on 
matters of compliance where appropriate.
The gross risk has increased, 
principally due to the overall 
global tax environment.

Each site will conduct its own internal reviews 
and is subject to an annual unannounced audit 
by the Group health and safety team. The third 
line of defence centres on an independent third 
party assessment. In the US, annual internal 
audits are conducted with a plan to introduce  
a second internal compliance audit in 2018.
These audits aim to use the findings  
to constructively challenge performance, 
assure compliance and foster continuous 
improvement.
There are now 10 sites across the Group that 
are independently accredited to OHSAS 18001 
– the occupational health and safety best 
practice standard.
In the UK, we have achieved a high level  
of recognition via our relationship with the 
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents

RATIO OF MEN AND WOMEN 
We work towards maintaining a diverse workforce and culture that values and respects all 
forms of diversity. This includes recruiting, developing and retaining women across the Group. 
In FY17, 41% of all employees were female. Females make up 53% of our workforce in 
Ireland, 45% in the US and 40% in the UK. At Board level, 20% of our Directors were

We continue to work with the Food and Drink 
Manufacture Forum (a partnership between 
Trade Associations, Trade Unions and the Health 
& Safety Executive), participating as the Chilled 
Food Association’s (‘CFA’) representative. This 
enables us to play an active part in shaping the 
strategy to improve health and safety in the food 
manufacturing sector in the UK.
We also continue our active membership of the 
Food and Drink Manufacturing Committee of 
the Institute of Occupational Health and Safety, 
developing and delivering best practice sharing 
events in the UK. As an example of this, our 
Northampton site hosted the Food and Drink 
Culture Change workshop and presented their 
strategy for promoting a positive health and 
safety culture in the workplace. 
In the US we are involved in various forums 
such as EHS Today in addition to supporting 
local safety councils. Since the acquisition of 
Peacock Foods, we have upgraded the health 
and safety system across our new and existing 
sites. This new electronic system is more 
robust and has the ability to give us real time 
information regarding the status of our sites. 
We will be able to better track, analyse, and 
eliminate employee injuries and areas of 
concern. The system has recently been rolled 
out in the US and feedback from sites has 
been extremely positive.
Overall, as we have seen an increase in number 
of plants as well as significant increases in 
capacity, we have taken steps to enhance the 
health and safety team by reorganising the 
structure and additional personnel. 
GREENCORE ETHICAL CODE 
Greencore is committed to ensuring a high 
standard of ethical and environmental practices 
and we believe that we have a responsibility to 
adhere to the highest standards of behaviour

activities have the potential to impact our  
key stakeholders and therefore they have the 
right to expect high standards in what we do. 
Our Ethical Code and Employment Standard 
is available on our website. This is informed by 
the International Labour Organisation (‘ILO’) 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work, and the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights.

PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT
Greencore Qualifications: We launched 
Greencore Qualifications in July 2017. 
Greencore Qualifications are specific learning 
modules (funded by the Apprenticeship Levy) 
in the UK that support our people to grow their 
capabilities in management development, 
food technical, project management and 
supply chain. About 100 people commenced 
Greencore Qualifications in September. We 
have partnered with subject matter experts 
including Nottingham Trent University.
Compliance with UK regulations on eligibility  
to work and with the Ethical Trading Initiative 
(‘ETI’) base code on working hours is audited  
by the Risk Management Group. In order to 
meet fluctuations in demand, we use agency 
labour providers at our UK manufacturing sites. 
Branches of the agency providers are audited 
on a regular basis by our technical team and 
human resource teams to ensure that they  
are also compliant with eligibility to work  
and ETI requirements.
Greencore is a member of the Supplier Ethical 
Data Exchange (‘SEDEX’) and our UK business 
requires all new raw material suppliers to 
register with SEDEX. We have progressively 
encouraged all existing suppliers to become 
SEDEX members, targeting direct raw material 
and selected non-resale suppliers, with 90% of 
the top 500 now SEDEX registered.
We recently joined the Food Network for 
Ethical Trade (‘FNET’), an industry-wide 
initiative which Greencore helped to pilot  
in 2016. FNET’s mission is to improve human 
rights in global food supply chains through a 
common approach to managing ethical trade.
Certain entities in the UK are subject to  
the provisions of the Modern Slavery Act, 
which commenced in October 2015. All staff 
employed by Greencore, whether permanent,

Technical graduate scheme: The scheme is 
now in its fifth year, with those joining in FY15 
the latest to take up permanent roles in the 
business. Graduates with degrees in food 
science or related disciplines join the two year 
programme, which provides experience and 
training. After completing two site placements 
over the two years, graduates are employed in 
roles across the UK business. 
We recognise the importance of Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Maths (‘STEM’) 
skills to our business in the UK and the food 
industry in general. A number of our technical 
colleagues are STEM ambassadors who go into 
schools or attend events to highlight some of 
the career paths available in food production. 
Greencore promotes food industry careers, 
particularly encouraging young scientists to join 
the industry through the Food Science Summer 
Schools offered by UK universities. 
In the US, we work closely with industry  
groups and universities, and have actively 
recruited technologists and interns to  
support our mission, and develop the  
careers of the next generation of food 
scientists and administrators.
Greencore has participated in the Institute  
of Grocery Distribution (‘IGD’) Feeding  
Britain’s Future initiative since it began in  
2012. Sites provide training for people to help 
them prepare for employment. This year, our 
Manton Wood team received the ‘National 
Employer Award’ for outstanding performance 
working with Job Centre Plus to get people 
into employment. We also contribute through 
the schools workshop programme where site 
personnel visit local schools to give guidance 
to young people on the skills they need in the 
workplace and provide insight into the variety 
of jobs available in the food and grocery  
supply chain.

RESPECT, RECOGNISE AND REWARD 
EVERYONE’S CONTRIBUTION
As part of our People at the Core Survey,  
in which over 9,500 colleagues participated, 
we maintained a high engagement level, with 
a score of 81%. Furthermore, 79% of people 
said that they are happy to work for Greencore 
and 75% are likely to recommend people to 
work for us.
The Greencore Way Awards are a way of 
recognising and celebrating colleagues who, 
through their activities, have demonstrated 
exceptional examples of one or more 
principles of the Greencore Way.
There are monthly and quarterly events  
to award colleagues, culminating in an  
annual presentation at Group level. In FY17, 
approximately 1,000 colleagues have been 
recognised with a Greencore Way Award. 34 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT – OUR STRATEGY
Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 
continued
The key activity during FY17 has been a  
review of Greencore’s approach, systems  
and structures to build on our strategy for  
FY18 with a focus on increasing delivery of 
Business Effectiveness and Cost Efficiency.
The Group has continued to progress the  
lean enterprise road map developed in order 
to embed lean principles into our ways of 
working. This has been supported by training 
with colleagues receiving formal qualifications 
in Lean Six Sigma Yellow, Green and Black 
belts. Across Greencore UK manufacturing 
sites, 199 people have completed Yellow belt 
training and 25 Green belt training. We also 
have 23 colleagues outside of manufacturing 
that have completed belt training and are 
applying lean principles in roles across 
different functions.
Projects delivered as part of the belt 
programme have enabled the business to 
improve efficiencies. They also promote  
a continuous improvement culture within 
manufacturing sites. Lean competencies  
form part of our key role profiles within our 
High Definition Leadership Programme.
As part of the Group’s reorganisation in  
the UK, it has committed to an even more 
effective approach to operations and major 
projects under a programme called Greencore 
Manufacturing Excellence.
Since acquiring Peacock Foods in December 
2016, much of our focus this year has been  
on the integration of seven new facilities in 
Illinois, Ohio and California into the Greencore 
Group and welcoming new colleagues. This 
process has enabled us to share and learn 
from alternative ways of working, recognising 
practices that support the Business 
Effectiveness principle. The original Peacock 
Production System has been adopted in the 
new Greencore Production System to drive 
effectiveness and consistency.

EFFICIENTLY USING AND  
RESPECTING ALL RESOURCES
Being effective at managing and using  
our resources and reducing waste is  
entirely consistent with our economic and 
business aims. Every site and individual has a 
responsibility to conserve precious resources 
and reduce our impact on the environment.
Following on from our comprehensive energy 
surveys at all of our UK manufacturing sites  
as part of the Energy Saving Opportunity 
Scheme (‘ESOS’) compliance programme,  
we have developed a ‘Greencore Utilities Best 
Practice Guide’, covering all key energy using 
equipment on our sites. The three main aims 
of the guide are:
• Optimising the operation of existing 
utilities equipment;
• Providing guidance and standards for 
purchasing new utilities equipment; and
• Providing a framework for improvement  
to feed into phase 2 of ESOS in 2019.
We have developed a tool to assess sites 
against the best practice guide, and during 
FY17, piloted this within our Prepared  
Meals division. This will be rolled out to the 
remaining UK manufacturing sites in FY18.
During the year, we have continued to 
implement energy efficiency opportunities 
that were identified during the ESOS audits. 
The overall impact has been a further 1.4% 
reduction in our overall primary energy per 
tonne of production, now totalling 13.8% 
reduction in the last four years.

During the year we again responded to the 
CDP climate change module. Our overall score 
was C, in line with the overall CDP programme, 
sector and FTSE 725 averages.
The most significant change during this year 
has been the growth of the business. The 
Peacock Foods acquisition added seven new 
sites in the US, whilst we acquired a new site  
in the Food to Go division in the UK, with a 
further development of a new sushi facility 
coming on line. Our direct to store business 
increased the number of deliveries into stores 
by 25%, adding to the transport related 
element of the Scope 1 emissions.
Our Scope 2 emissions increase from  
expansion has been offset by energy efficiency 
improvements and an almost 15% reduction in 
the carbon intensity of the grid in the UK. During 
2018, we will be exploring the opportunity to 
establish science based targets for greenhouse 
gases (‘GHG’) reduction across the Group.
Despite the Group’s increase in scale and 
capacity, our carbon intensity has decreased 
by 23% in the last year, and 38% since FY14.

MANAGING OUR WASTE
We continue to manage our waste in line with 
the waste hierarchy, with our lean programmes 
focused on elimination and minimisation at 
source. During the year, we have continued  
to focus on redistribution of food for human 
consumption to avoid it becoming waste 
through increased internal staff sales and 
partnerships with The Company Shop/
Community Shop and Fareshare in the UK. 
During the year we redistributed 746 tonnes  
of food (in addition to staff sales), equivalent 
to more than 1.75 million meals.
Recycling and recovery rates for waste from 
our UK food manufacturing business were 
consistent with last year. In FY18 we plan to 
focus on improvements in recycling and will  
be piloting a ‘recycling score’ key performance 
indicator with support for key sites to improve 
recycling rates. During FY17, we again sent no 
waste to landfill (directly or indirectly) from our 
UK manufacturing operations.

by 2030.
CONSERVATION OF WATER
Whilst we have completed a number of 
initiatives to reduce water consumption across 
the business during the year, the nature of our 
products and the cleaning requirements make 
a step change improvement a real challenge. 
Our overall water consumption per tonne of 
product has remained largely static for the  
last three years. In FY17, we have prioritised 
effluent treatment improvements, delivering 
upgrades at several sites and are currently 
planning additional treatment at three further 
sites to be operational in FY18.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
All of our UK manufacturing sites have  
been assessed against our environmental 
roadmap and have been actively working  
on implementing processes and procedures  
to improve their scores. Our quarterly UK 
environmental meetings (with representation 
from all UK manufacturing sites) provide a 
forum for sharing best practice and developing 
environmental programmes. As an example we 
have undertaken environmental risk assessment 
to help prioritise future actions on external 
environmental issues impacting on the Group, 
and following this, we are developing strategies 
for longer-term compliance with the Medium 
Combustion Plant Directive and F-Gas 
Regulations (high Global Warming Potential 
F-Gas replacement options).
Our UK Environmental Manager chaired  
the Chilled Food Association Sustainability 
Working Group, and in that role represented 
the CFA at the Environment Agency food 
industry liaison meeting, as well as participating 
in supplier initiatives with a number of our  
key customers.

DELIVER INDUSTRY LEADING FOOD 
SAFETY STANDARDS EVERY DAY
The safety and quality of the foods we 
produce are top priorities for our business and 
the Group has highly-developed programmes 
to deliver compliance to food safety and 
quality standards. 
All UK and US sites are subject to independent 
third party audits under the Global Food Safety 
Initiative (‘GFSI’) Standard. In the UK all sites are 
registered under the British Retail Consortium 
(‘BRC’) Unannounced Scheme whilst in the US 
sites are audited against BRC or Safe Quality 
Foods (‘SQF’) level 3. 
These independent audits are further 
supplemented by internal governance  
audits across both geographies. Greencore 
sites received 655 audits by external 
organisations through FY17. In the US, at 
Federal level many of our sites operate with  
a Grant of Inspection from the United States 
Department of Agriculture (‘USDA’) Food 
Safety and Inspection Service and the US 
Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’). USDA 
inspectors have offices in relevant sites and 
have full and open access to our operations  
to inspect during agreed production hours. 
The FDA may inspect our facilities on an 
unannounced basis, at any time. 
Greencore’s sites are also audited regularly by 
customers against their corporate standards. 
In the UK, achievement of ‘earned recognition’ 
status with three of our main customers 
emphasises the trust our customers place  
in our teams and our standards.
During FY17, we have aimed to form a detailed 
picture of the internal audit programme across 
all Greencore sites. The 73,732 internal audits 
conducted include the thorough product and 
process ‘health checks’ carried out by senior 
technical colleagues, in addition to routine 
surveillance and Good Manufacturing 
Practices (‘GMP’) audits. Together these 
programmes highlight operational standards 
and enable continuous improvement, as well 
as opportunities to demonstrate best practice. 
Recently, the US Food Safety Modernisation  
Act became law. Greencore has fully-trained key 
food safety managers throughout the business 
and has deployed food safety plans that deliver 
compliance with this new legislation. 
CONTINUOUSLY INNOVATE FOOD 
RECIPES AND TECHNOLOGIES
During FY17, 46% of our products across  
the UK and the US were new to market.  
We innovate at all levels within the business, 
from new ingredients and packaging, process 
developments to longer-term research. We 
currently receive funding from Innovate UK for 
projects within our Food to Go and Prepared 
Meals divisions. The latter involves a consortium 
looking at salt and fat reduction in baked quiche. 
Nutrition and health are important to 
Greencore, our customers and consumers.  
In the UK, we made an early commitment  
to remove artificial trans fats and do not use 
partially hydrogenated vegetable oils as 
ingredients in our products or oils and fats 
containing trans fats. We continue to work  
with our customers in the UK to maintain  
salt within target levels set by Public Health 
England and to reduce sugar in those 
categories highlighted in the UK Government 
Childhood Obesity Strategy. We provide 
choice for those with particular dietary 
restrictions, such as gluten intolerance  
or meat-free preference by innovating  
in these products within our ranges.
We manage our complex raw material supply 
base through a supplier approval process, 
which in the UK, is operated by central 
technical and purchasing functions. Our 
auditing team audits suppliers according  
to a risk assessment process. During FY17,  
189 physical audits of suppliers were carried 
out, including 35 overseas, while 802 desktop 
approvals were granted. Risks to the integrity 
of our raw materials are addressed through a 
central horizon scanning process and testing 
schedule. Our specialist subject matter experts 
carry out regular visits to suppliers and provide 
a detailed understanding of supply chains. 
In FY17 , all our UK outbound storage and 
distribution providers were BRC certified, while 
we continue to work towards BRC certification 
for agents. We have reviewed the supply chains 
behind 120 agents supplying our sites.
We are a founder member of the Food 
Industry Intelligence Network (‘FIIN’), an 
initiative established in 2015 to address the 
issue of food fraud. We continue to co-Chair 
the FIIN governing Board. 
We hold Group Marine Stewardship Council 
certification for UK Food to Go sites. We are 
members of the Roundtable for Sustainable 
Palm Oil (‘RSPO’) and hold multi-site  
RSPO certification.

been recognised with a suite of awards including 
‘Own Label Supplier of the Year’ at the Grocer 
Gold awards in the UK, for nominations by 
customers across all product categories.
We were named ‘Food to Go Manufacturer of 
the Year’ at the British Sandwich awards, and 
won with celebration cakes, soups, sauces, 
food to go and dairy products at the Own

STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENTS
Food to Go delivered another year of strong 
growth, with revenue up 18.8% on a pro  
forma basis. The Group has extended  
its long-term partnership model with its 
customers, enabling deeper strategic 
engagement on both consumer and supply 
chain initiatives. Several important business 
wins and commercial launches were delivered 
to plan in the period. The business also 
extended a number of contracts and now  
has multi-year sole supply agreements in  
place with all of its core customers. The 
Group’s market share of sandwiches in the  
UK grocery channel now stands at 60%.
There were significant investments completed 
at the Group’s London facilities (Park Royal 
and Bow) and at Northampton to deliver 
business wins and commercial launches.  
These investments, along with the capacity 
added through the acquisition of the facility 
near Heathrow and the integration of the 
Atherstone facility, provide capacity for medium 
term growth in a capital efficient manner. 
The Group has also invested in the ready 
meals business during FY17 to reset its 
capacity and commercial positioning.  
In addition, there was further rationalisation  
of the UK portfolio with the exit from the 
desserts manufacturing business in Evercreech. 
In November 2017 the Group announced  
a streamlining and strengthening of the  
UK organisational and cost structure.  
This programme involves a more compact 
divisional structure, overhead reduction, 
upgraded operational capability, and greater 
functional centralisation and standardisation 
of processes across the business. The overall 
programme will help underpin operating 
leverage progression in FY18 and beyond. 
half of the year continued to be strong, though  
it was impacted by a more modest summer 
trading period and temporary supply issues  
in the ‘side of plate’ salad part of the business.
The wider food to go market continues to 
expand, with strong category growth of 6.6%  
in the grocery channel in FY17 , driven largely  
by volume. This continued growth is supported 
by favourable consumer trends including a 
desire for convenience, an increase in snacking 
occasions, and a preference for healthier 
products. This growth is also supported by 
ongoing investment by retail customers to 
increase the space dedicated to convenience 
formats. The Group is also benefitting from 
extending its product reach and from a 
broadening channel mix. 
The significant commercial activity in the year 
has involved a large amount of operational 
change and development. The investments  
in Park Royal and Bow enabled the launch  
of a substantial new contract with one of 
Greencore’s key food to go customers 
announced in September 2016. The investment 
programme completed at the Northampton 
facility enabled the final elements of business 
wins with its key customer at that facility to  
be launched successfully, including a new  
sushi range. 
At the end of June 2017 the Group acquired a 
sandwich manufacturing facility near Heathrow. 
This adds another modern, well invested site to 
the Food to Go network and provides the scope 
to grow with new customers outside of the main 
grocery retail channel. Following substantial 
investment in its distribution and direct-to- 
store capability in recent years, this part of the 
business helped drive strong growth again this 
year. Revenue for the distribution of third party 
products now accounts for a high single digit 
share of Food to Go sales. 
As anticipated, the pace of operational change 
across the Food to Go business began to  
ease in the second half of the year, with some 
consequent recovery in operating leverage.
OTHER UK & IRELAND 
The other parts of the Convenience Foods  
UK & Ireland division comprise the ready 
meals, chilled soups and sauces, cooking 
sauces, quiche, Yorkshire Pudding and cakes 
and desserts businesses, as well as the Irish 
ingredients trading businesses. Revenue 
growth across these businesses was 2.7%,  
or 3.5% on a Pro Forma basis.
The Group has also reviewed its overall 
technology management structure and 
investment priorities. Based on the scale  
of additional investment required and analysis 
of anticipated benefits, the Group has made  
a considered decision to cease the planned 
multi-year rollout of a common Enterprise 
Resource Planning (‘ERP’) platform across the 
UK business. Consistent with this decision,  
the Group incurred a £29.7m impairment 
charge in FY17, reflecting investment over the 
last four years. The Group will now focus on 
more targeted and cost efficient technology 
investments that will deliver many of the 
anticipated benefits. Whilst recognising  
that any such impairment is unsatisfactory,  
the decision is consistent with the Group’s 
focus on capital discipline.
DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE
Reported revenue in the Convenience Foods 
UK & Ireland division increased by 14.3% to 
£1,438.4m, achieved against the backdrop of a 
challenging UK trading environment comprising 
intense retail competition and significant cost 
inflation. Pro Forma Revenue Growth was 11.9%, 
primarily driven by continued strong growth in 
the Food to Go business. Adjusted Operating 
Profit rose by 2.6% to £106.8m. Operating 
leverage was impacted by network and 
commercial investments associated with 
significant business win activity in the period,  
as well as challenging trading conditions in 
other parts of the division outside Food to Go, 
that continued as the year progressed. 
FOOD TO GO 
Food to Go comprises sandwich, sushi  
and salad activities and accounted for 
approximately 60% of divisional revenue  
in FY17. Strong growth was generated in  
FY17 with reported revenue growth of 24.4% 
and Pro Forma Revenue Growth of 18.8%.  
This performance was driven by underlying 
category growth, helping core customers to 
outperform, and the contribution from the 
substantial new business wins. The second

Operating and Financial Review 
continued
The division reported FY17 revenue growth  
of 295.0% to £881.3m, primarily reflecting  
the acquisition of Peacock Foods. Pro Forma 
Revenue Growth for the division was 5.9%, 
driven by underlying category growth and the 
impact of new business wins. The significant 
deflation in raw materials costs, seen especially 
in Peacock Foods in H1, eased as the year 
progressed. A substantial portion of divisional 
revenue is generated on contracts where 
these material costs are passed through 
directly to the customer. Volume growth is 
therefore a more meaningful indicator of 
underlying performance. Pro forma volumes 
for the division grew by approximately 7%  
in the period. 
Divisional growth was driven by a combination 
of good underlying growth and net new 
business wins. As anticipated, the first new 
business wins from the combined commercial 
pipeline began to be delivered during the 
fiscal year and all have progressed well to 
date. There was a significant expansion of the 
Carol Stream (IL) facility to cater for a large 
contract win with a key customer in that facility, 
as well as an expansion in the Romeoville (IL) 
facility to deliver business wins with new CPG 
customers. The business also had smaller 
business wins with CPG and other customers 
at its Minneapolis (MN), Seattle (WA) and 
Woodridge (IL) facilities. This growth was 
offset by some product churn within the 
ambient co-packing part of the business and 
the exit from frozen product production in the 
Group’s Jacksonville (FL) facility towards the 
end of the financial year.
The performance was also supported by  
good category growth across all the areas  
in which the Group operates, including lunch 
kits (+5% volume), frozen breakfast sandwiches 
(+2% volume), fresh sandwiches (+9% volume) 
and salad kits (+13% volume). 
Adjusted Operating Profit increased by £35.4m 
to £33.3m driven by the acquisition of Peacock 
Foods. Underlying profit delivery with core 
CPG customers was in line with expectations, 
driven by underlying category growth and  
the business wins as outlined above. As 
anticipated, the operational impact of project 
delivery and new launch activity eased as the 
Substantial network and commercial 
investments were made in the ready meals 
business during the year. The ready meals 
network was upgraded and extended through 
investments at the Group’s Wisbech and 
Warrington facilities. New contracts were 
signed with some key customers in the 
business and several product ranges were 
relaunched. Operational leverage was reduced 
in the period as a result of these initiatives. 
Challenging trading conditions in the cakes 
and desserts businesses were characterised  
by business churn and high levels of inflation.  
In May 2017 the Group announced the 
prospective phasing out of manufacturing  
at the desserts facility in Evercreech in FY18. 
An exceptional charge of £16.5m relating to 
this exit was incurred in FY17 .
Elsewhere, the Group’s cooking sauce business 
benefitted from working with customers to 
maintain the ongoing growth of the own label 
portion of the market while good progress was 
made in the Group’s Irish ingredients trading 
businesses as a result of stronger international 
dairy markets.
UK INFLATION
Inflation trends in the Group’s main UK cost 
components were broadly as anticipated.  
Raw material and packaging costs rose by 
approximately 3% in FY17 driven by a rise in 
certain commodity costs such as dairy, as well 
as the inflationary impact of a weaker sterling 
on imported ingredients. Labour inflation in the 
UK was approximately 4% in the year, primarily 
due to the effect of increased National Living 
Wage levels on the Group’s wage structure.  
The Group successfully mitigated the overall 
effects of this inflation during FY17 by working 
with customers on a variety of cost and 
innovation programmes, and by continued 
internal cost efficiency initiatives.
BREXIT
Although the exact nature of changes to come 
as a result of Brexit remains unclear, the Group 
continues to monitor closely the potential 
implications on its business, including in 
particular any changes to costs in the supply 
chain and the availability and cost of labour. 
However it is worth noting that Greencore’s 
business in the UK is largely ‘local’ i.e. made 
and sold in the UK, and therefore carries  
limited trade risk.
CONVENIENCE FOODS US
STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENTS 
The acquisition of Peacock Foods transformed 
the Group’s market and channel position in 
the US and has provided a growth platform  
of real scale. The enlarged US business has  
a strong and diversified customer base  
across Consumer Packaged Goods (‘CPG’) 
companies, foodservice, convenience store 
and grocery retail channels. Long-term 
contracts are in place to supply many 
customers’ primary brands and the commercial 
model includes the scope to co-invest with 
these customers for capital expenditure on 
new project activity. The enlarged, well invested 
network of 14 facilities has the potential to 
support the Group’s ambitions to grow in 
value added, assembly-led, convenience food 
manufacturing, with both existing and new 
customers. The integration of the business  
is proceeding to plan and is focussed on 
reducing overheads, optimising procurement 
and improving network efficiencies. 
As anticipated, the first business wins from  
the combined US pipeline began to be 
delivered during the period. These were with 
both new and existing CPG customers across 
the enlarged network. The broader growth 
opportunity available to the Group in the US 
market is highly attractive. Firstly, this is being 
driven by a trend to high care outsourced 
manufacturing, where customers are looking 
for ways to improve returns via more purpose 
built and effective cost structures, with 
partners who value quality, trust and food 
safety. Secondly, there is an increased focus on 
innovation as customers seek to develop and 
enhance their commercial strategies in fresh, 
prepared, ‘perimeter of store’ food offerings. 
The Group is also pleased to confirm that it 
has recently extended its long-term, strategic 
partnership with one of the largest and most 
important US, and Group, customers.
DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE
The results of Peacock Foods have been 
consolidated from the end of December 2016. 
The new combined US business manufactures 
a wide range of fresh, frozen and ambient 
convenience food products.

year progressed. Additional operational costs 
were incurred later in the year in the salad kits 
business (formerly known as L&L) due to a 
combination of new business win activity and 
operational integration. Capacity utilisation 
improved in some of the Group’s original sites, 
however underlying financial performance only 
modestly improved, and less than had been 
anticipated, in that part of the business. Labour 
inflation in the US was approximately 5% and 
was mitigated by various cost efficiency 
initiatives and pricing with customers.
US INTEGRATION
The integration of the business has progressed 
well and the delivered cost synergies were 
slightly above expectations in FY17 . The 
consolidation of central offices was completed 
in the second half of the year. Given the strength 
of commercial project activity, the Group has 
decided not to rationalise its manufacturing 
network which reduces planned integration 
spend and has a modest impact on the phasing 
of targeted annualised cost synergies of $15m. 
The costs of integration in FY17 were £9.3m  
with now only an additional modest amount 
expected in FY18.
GROUP CASH FLOW AND RETURNS
STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT 
The focus has been on reducing the trajectory 
of capital spend throughout the year. A number 
of initiatives were executed in this regard, 
including the exit from the chilled desserts 
facility in Evercreech, the decision not to 
proceed with the remainder of the planned 
rollout of an ERP system across the UK business 
and the acquisition of a facility near Heathrow 
to provide capacity in Food to Go in a capital 
efficient manner. In addition, the Group 
continues to execute investment projects  
in the US on a co-investment model with 
customers, including several in FY17 . 
PERFORMANCE
Operating Cash Flow is used to measure  
the Group’s net generation of cash through 
business operations. The Group calculates this 
measure as the net cash flow from operating 
and investing activities before strategic capital 
expenditure, contributions to legacy defined 
benefit pension schemes, interest paid, tax 
paid, and acquisitions and disposals. Operating 
Cash Flow was £117.8m in FY17, an increase of 
£3.9m driven by increased Adjusted EBITDA, 
offset by increases in working capital, 
Maintenance Capital Expenditure and 
exceptional cash outflows. 
Maintenance Capital Expenditure was £39.7m  
in the period, an increase of £7 .8m reflecting 
both the addition of Peacock Foods and the 
significant expansion of manufacturing footprint 
in the UK. Strategic Capital Expenditure in  
the period was £83.6m (FY16: £71.2m), driven 
primarily by the significant commercial 
investment activity in both the UK and the US. 
Cash tax continued to be very low. Overall,  
net debt increased to £519.2m in FY17 , largely 
reflecting the acquisition of Peacock Foods. 
Return on Invested Capital (‘ROIC‘) was 12.2%  
in FY17 , a reduction of 160bps due to the impact 
of an increased tax rate, investment activity and 
the acquisition of Peacock Foods. The full-year 
dilutive effect of the addition of Peacock Foods 
on ROIC will be seen in FY18.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Group strengthened its capital structure 
in FY17. In December 2016, the Group raised 
£427.0m by way of a rights issue. The net 
proceeds of the rights issue combined with  
a new five year $249m bank facility, were used  
to finance the acquisition of Peacock Foods. 
The Group also extended the maturity of its 
primary committed bank facility of £300m to 
March 2022, and extended the maturity of a 
£50m bilateral bank facility to March 2020. The 
Group remains well financed with committed 
facilities of £720m at the end of the fiscal year 
and a weighted average maturity of 4.4 years. 
The Group’s net debt:EBITDA leverage as 
measured under financing agreements was 
2.4x at the end of the financial year, above the 
benchmark level of approximately 2x that the 
Group believes is appropriate for the business 
to operate on a longer term basis. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
REVENUE AND OPERATING PROFIT
The Group completed the acquisition of 
Peacock Foods on 30 December 2016 and  
the results of Peacock Foods have been 
included in the Group results for the nine-
month period to 29 September 2017.
Reported revenue in the year was £2,319.7m,  
an increase of 56.5% versus FY16. Adjusted 
Operating Profit of £140.1m was 37.4% higher 
than in FY16, primarily driven by the acquisition 
of Peacock Foods. Adjusted Operating Margin 
was 6.0%, 90bps below the prior year, primarily 
due to the impact of the acquisition of Peacock 
Foods and significant commercial investments 
in the UK. 
The average exchange rates for the period 
were £1 – $1.2730 and €1.1487 (FY16: £1 – 
$1.4172 and €1.2739). The Group now has 
increased exposure to GBP/USD foreign 
exchange translation movements as a result  
of the Peacock Foods acquisition.
ACQUISITION RELATED INTANGIBLES
The Group recognised an amortisation charge 
of £19.2m on acquisition related intangible 
assets, up from £9.2m in the prior year. The 
increase reflects the additional amortisation 
charge relating to intangible assets, primarily 
customer relationships, recognised on the 
acquisition of Peacock Foods in the period.
FINANCE CHARGE 
The Group’s bank interest payable in FY17 was 
£24.0m, an increase of £6.9m. The increase was 
driven by higher average net debt primarily  
as a result of the Peacock Foods acquisition. 
£1.8m of interest on major projects was 
capitalised during the period (FY16: £1.3m).
The Group’s non-cash finance charge in  
FY17 was £7 .0m (FY16: £10.8m). The change in 
the fair value of derivatives and related debt 
adjustments was a non-cash charge of £2.8m 
(FY16: £6.5m) reflecting the foreign exchange 
movement on balances where hedge 
accounting is not applied. The non-cash 
pension financing charge of £3.9m was £0.5m 
lower than the FY16 charge of £4.4m. The Group 
recorded a £0.3m charge in respect of the 
movement in the present value of assets and 
liabilities compared to a £0.1m credit in FY16.

Operating and Financial Review

OPERATING CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT
Operating Cash Flow was £117 .8m in FY17 ,  
an increase of £3.9m driven by increased 
Adjusted EBITDA, offset by increases in 
working capital, Maintenance Capital 
Expenditure and exceptional cash outflows. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 37 .1% to £189.7m 
driven primarily by the acquisition of Peacock 
Foods. A working capital outflow of £3.0m was 
incurred. Capital expenditure of £123.3m was 
incurred in the period (FY16: £103.1m), driven 
by the significant commercial investment 
programme. The total cash outflow during the 
year in respect of exceptional charges was 
£33.7m (2016: £9.9m), of which £5.0m was in 
respect of prior year exceptional charges. 
The Group’s net debt at 29 September 2017 
was £519.2m, an increase of £187.4m from 
30 September 2016 reflecting the impact  
of the new facility to part fund the Peacock 
Foods acquisition. 
FINANCING 
In December 2016, the Group raised £427.0m, 
net of associated fees, by way of a rights issue, 
by issuing 9 new shares for every 13 shares 
held. The net proceeds of the rights issue 
combined with a new five year $249m bank 
facility, were used to finance the acquisition  
of Peacock Foods as well as to pay transaction 
fees and expenses. Further details of this 
acquisition are set out in Note 31 to the Group 
Financial Statements.
In addition to the new debt financing for the 
Peacock acquisition the Group also extended 
the maturity of its primary committed bank 
facility of £300m for a further year to March 
2022, and extended the maturity of a £50m 
bilateral bank facility for a further 18 months to 
March 2020. The Group remains well financed 
with committed facilities of £720m at the end 
of September 2017 and a weighted average 
maturity of 4.4 years.
TAXATION 
The Group’s effective tax rate in FY17 (including 
the tax impact associated with pension finance 
items) was 8% (FY16: 2%). The rate has been  
low as a result of the benefit of tax attributes 
including those acquired as part of the Uniq plc 
acquisition. Substantially all UK tax attributes 
have now been recognised on the balance 
sheet such that there is no further rate benefit 
in the current year, nor expected in the future. 
The Group has also recognised US tax 
attributes to the extent that those losses are 
expected to be available to the Group to offset 
taxable profits in the short to medium term. 
The effective tax rate of the Group is  
expected to rise in the medium term to a  
rate representative of a blended rate for the 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates. 
There is a degree of uncertainty over the level 
of this rate, due to a combination of factors 
including US tax reform, Base Erosion and  
Profit Shifting (‘BEPS’) actions and the impact  
of Brexit on levels of UK taxation. 
The effective tax rate applicable to Adjusted 
Earnings in FY17 was 12% compared with 6%  
in FY16. When calculating the effective tax rate 
applicable to Adjusted Earnings, the tax charge 
excludes the tax effect of those items which are 
excluded from Adjusted Earnings. These items 
attract different tax rates depending on the 
applicable tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction. 
This results in a different effective tax rate 
applicable to Adjusted Earnings, as compared 
to the Group’s effective tax rate. 
Cash tax continues to be low as the Group 
utilises historical tax attributes in both the UK 
and the US. The cash tax rate in the period  
was 0% (FY16: 0%). The cash tax rate for the 
Group is expected to rise modestly in the  
near term as a result of increased profitability 
and a reduction in the degree to which UK 
losses may be utilised in any one year. Overall  
it is expected to stay low for the medium term.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
The Group incurred a pre-tax exceptional 
charge of £78.2m in the period. Cash outflows 
associated with this charge are £38.6m, some 
£28.7m of which were incurred during FY17 
with the remainder to be incurred in FY18. 
The overall charge is comprised as follows:
• a charge of £29.7m relating to the 
impairment of software assets, associated 
with the decision not to proceed with the 
planned rollout of a common ERP platform 
across the UK business;
• a charge of £16.5m relating to business  
exit costs associated with the prospective 
exit from desserts manufacturing at the 
Group’s Evercreech facility; 
• a charge of £15.6m for transaction costs 
relating to acquisitions during the current 
financial year, of which £15.2m relates to the 
acquisition of Peacock Foods in December 
2016 and £0.4m relates to the acquisition  
of a sandwich manufacturing facility  
near Heathrow in the UK in June 2017;
• an £11.2m integration and reorganisation 
charge, of which £9.3m relates to the 
acquisition of Peacock Foods, £0.4m 
relating to the completion of the integration 
of The Sandwich Factory, and £1.5m relates 
to costs associated with streamlining the 
management structure within Convenience 
Foods UK & Ireland;
• a £4.1m charge in relation to pre-
commissioning and start-up costs related 
to significant plant development and 
related on-boarding of new business at its 
facilities in Northampton and Warrington  
in the UK and Carol Stream (IL) in the US; and 
• a £1.1m charge relating to a legal 
settlement incurred during the period.
EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Adjusted Earnings of £100.5m in the period 
were 26.1% ahead of the prior year. Adjusted 
Earnings Per Share of 15.4 pence was 3.8% 
behind FY16 which reflects the impact of an 
increased number of shares in issue as a result 
of the rights issue. Basic earnings per share 
was 1.9 pence (FY16: 9.5 pence). The weighted 
average number of shares in issue in FY17  
was 652.5m (FY16: 497.6m). The weighted 
average number of shares in issue in FY16  
has been restated for the impact of the bonus 
issue incorporated in the rights issue and 
accordingly earnings per share measures  
have been restated. 47 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT – PERFORMANCE REVIEW
PENSIONS
All legacy defined benefit pension schemes 
are closed to future accrual and the Group’s 
pension policy with effect from 1 January 2010 
is that future service for current employees 
and new entrants is provided under defined 
contribution pension arrangements.
The net pension deficit relating to legacy 
defined pension schemes (before related 
deferred tax) at 29 September 2017 was 
£124.8m, £37.5m lower than the position at 
30 September 2016. The net pension deficit 
after related deferred tax was £103.1m, a 
decrease of £31.6m from 30 September 2016. 
The decrease in net pension deficit was driven 
principally by an increase in discount rates 
applied to the UK scheme liabilities. 
The valuations and funding obligations of  
the Group’s legacy defined benefit pension 
schemes are assessed on a triennial basis with 
the relevant trustees. Following the most 
recent reviews, including the latest agreed 
actuarial valuation for the Greencore UK 
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme, the Group 
expects the annual cash funding requirement 
for defined benefit pension schemes to remain 
unchanged at approximately £15m.
DIVIDENDS
The Board of Directors is recommending a  
final dividend of 3.37 pence per share. This  
will result in a total dividend for the year of 5.47 
pence per share (FY16: 5.47 pence per share). 
The total dividend represents a payout amount 
of approximately 38% of Adjusted Earnings,  
in line with the policy to maintain an annual 
dividend pay-out equivalent to 30–40% of 
Adjusted Earnings. 
SUMMARY
Greencore anticipates delivering a year of 
strong growth in FY18 and is well positioned  
to drive improved profitability, cashflow and 
returns over the medium term. Building on 
what has been an intense phase of strategic 
progress and network investment, Greencore 
will now take advantage of its exposure to 
higher growth categories in the UK and US 
convenience food markets.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Directors’ Report
INTRODUCTION
The Directors present their Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 29 September 2017. The Directors’ Report is contained on pages 
50 to 104.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND REVIEW OF BUSINESS
In the UK, Greencore has strong market positions across sandwiches and other food to go products as well as complementary positions in other 
convenience food categories, including chilled prepared meals, chilled soups and sauces, ambient sauces and pickles, cakes and desserts and 
Yorkshire Puddings. It is a supplier of own-label products to all of the major supermarkets, and has world-class manufacturing sites with industry-
leading technology and supply chain capabilities. 
Following its acquisition of Peacock Foods in December 2016, Greencore is now a leading manufacturer of consumer packaged goods for many of 
the largest food brands in the US. The Group also produces chilled and frozen food to go products for convenience retail and food service leaders 
in the US.
The Group’s performance and development activity is summarised in the Operating and Financial Review set out in pages 42 to 48. The principal 
subsidiary and associate undertakings are listed in Note 33 to the Group Financial Statements and form part of this report.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
The Group Income Statement, which is out on page 111 details the Group’s results for the year. The Group reported an Operating Profit for the 
year before acquisition related amortisation and exceptional items of £140.1m (FY16: £102.0m), whilst the profit after taxation and exceptional 
charges was £13.9m (FY16: £48.5m).
DIVIDENDS
An interim dividend of 2.10 pence (FY16: 2.10 pence) per share was paid on 3 October 2017. The Directors are recommending a final ordinary 
dividend of 3.37 pence (FY16: 3.37 pence) per share. Subject to shareholders’ approval, this dividend is to be paid on 5 April 2018 to shareholders 
who are on the register of members at 5.00 pm on 8 December 2017. This will give a total dividend of 5.47 pence for the year, subject to 
shareholders’ approval.
SHARE CAPITAL
Pursuant to a rights issue to part finance the acquisition of Peacock Foods, 273,565,760 Ordinary Shares were issued on 21 December 2016. 
Furthermore, as part of a rump placement, 13,649,203 Ordinary Shares were issued on 21 December 2016. 
During the year 4,250,498 (FY16: 1,883,280) Ordinary Shares were issued under the Company’s Scrip Dividend Scheme and 714,595 (FY16: 1,283,084) 
Ordinary Shares were issued under the Company’s ShareSave Schemes. Further details are set out in Note 25 to the Group Financial Statements.
One Special Share of €1.26 exists in the share capital of the Company. The Articles of Association provide that the Special Share may be held only 
by, or transferred only to, the Minister for Agriculture, Food & the Marine or some other person appointed by the Minister. Under the Articles of 
Association, the consent of the holder of the Special Share is required in the winding up of the Company. Many of the rights attached to the 
Special Share were abolished in 2011.
At the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) of the Company held on 31 January 2017 , the shareholders gave the Directors the authority to allot shares up 
to a maximum nominal amount equal to £2,316,919.06. This authority will expire at the forthcoming AGM and therefore, shareholders will be asked  
to renew, until the date of the AGM to be held in 2019 or 30 April 2019, whichever is earlier, the authority of the Directors to allot new shares. This 
authority will be limited to the allotment of up to an aggregate nominal value of 33% of the nominal value of the Company’s Issued Share Capital.
Shareholders will also be asked at the forthcoming AGM to approve until the date of the AGM to be held in 2019, or 30 April 2019, whichever is earlier, 
the Directors’ power to disapply the strict statutory pre-emption provisions relating to the issue of the new equity for cash. The disapplication will be 
limited to the allotment of equity securities in connection with any rights issue or any open offer to shareholders and the allotment of shares in lieu of 
dividends, and/or the allotment of shares up to an aggregate nominal value equal to 5% of the nominal value of the Company’s Issued Share Capital.
At the AGM held on 31 January 2017, the shareholders passed a resolution to give the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, the authority to make 
market purchases of up to 10% of its own shares. At the forthcoming AGM, shareholders will be asked to authorise the Directors, until the date of 
the AGM to be held in 2019 or 30 April 2019, whichever is earlier, to make market purchases or overseas market purchases of up to 10% of its own 
shares. Whilst the Directors do not have any current intention to exercise the power to purchase the Company’s own shares, any purchases would 
be made only at price levels which the Directors consider to be in the best interests of the shareholders generally, taking into consideration the 
Group’s overall financial position. In addition, the authority being sought from shareholders will provide that the minimum price which may be paid 
for such shares shall not be less than the nominal value of the shares and the maximum price will be the higher of 105% of the then average market 
price of such shares and the amount stipulated by Article 3(2) of the EU Delegated Regulation on Regulatory Technical Standards on buy-back 
programmes and stabilisation measures (EU/2016/1052). 53 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
Shareholders will be asked to pass a resolution at the forthcoming AGM authorising the Company to re-allot shares purchased by it and not 
cancelled as treasury shares. If the resolution is passed, the authority will expire on the earlier date of the AGM in 2019 or 30 April 2019 and the 
minimum price at which treasury shares may be re-allotted shall be set at the nominal value of the share where such a share is required to satisfy  
an obligation under an employees share scheme or, in all other cases, an amount equal to 95% of the then market price of such shares and the 
maximum price at which treasury shares may be re-allotted shall be set at 120% of the then market price of such shares.
Subject to the necessary approval from shareholders at the forthcoming AGM, the Directors intend to continue the Scrip Dividend Scheme so  
that eligible shareholders will be offered the opportunity to take all or part of the FY17 final dividend of 3.37 pence per Ordinary Share in the form 
of fully paid new Ordinary Shares. 
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Greencore anticipates delivering a year of strong growth in FY18 and is well positioned to drive improved profitability, cash flow and returns over 
the medium term. Building on what has been an intense phase of strategic progress and network investment, Greencore will now take advantage 
of its exposure to higher growth categories in the UK and US convenience food markets. 
The Group anticipates good revenue growth in FY18, driven by a full-year contribution from Peacock Foods and organic growth in both the UK and 
the US. Further new business wins are expected in the US, the financial impact of which will be determined by the phasing of commercial execution. 
The Group anticipates that the UK business will see a modest improvement in operating leverage despite continued inflationary pressures, and that 
the US division will benefit from the delivery of further cost synergies. The rate of EPS growth is expected to be moderated by an increasing tax rate. 
The Group also anticipates that by the end of the year it will be approaching its benchmark leverage ratio of approximately 2x Net Debt to EBITDA.
DIRECTORS
Mr EP Tonge was appointed Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director on 3 October 2016, replacing Mr AR Williams who resigned from  
his position as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director on the same day. Mr Williams remained with the Group until the end of December 
2016 to facilitate an orderly transition. On 1 February 2017 Mr TH Sampson was appointed to the Board as Non-Executive Director, followed by 
Ambassador KF O’Malley who was appointed to the Board as Non-Executive Director on 14 March 2017. 
Furthermore, Mr EL Nicoli has confirmed his intention to retire from the Board as Non-Executive Director following the December 2017 Board 
meeting. Ms SG Bailey will replace Mr Nicoli as Senior Independent Director upon his retirement.
In accordance with the Greencore Group plc Articles of Association and Provision B.7 .1. of the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘2016 Code’)  
each of the Directors individually retire at each AGM of the Company and where appropriate submit themselves for re-election. No re-appointment  
is automatic and all Directors who intend to submit themselves for re-election are subject to a full and rigorous evaluation. One of the main purposes 
of the evaluation is to assess each Director’s suitability for re-election. If a Director is not deemed to be effective in carrying out their required duties, 
the Board will not recommend that Director for re-election.
In line with the 2016 Code, in the year under review, each Director was subject to a formal internal evaluation. Following on from the review, the 
Chairman and Board are pleased to recommend for re-election of those Directors who are seeking re-appointment at the forthcoming AGM as 
they continue to be effective and remain committed to their role on the Board. In accordance with Provision B.6.2. of the 2016 Code, it is intended 
that an external evaluation will continue to be conducted at least every three years. In line with this provision, the next external evaluation is 
scheduled to take place during the course of FY18.

Greencore Group plc is registered in Ireland and as an Irish incorporated company it is not subject to the UK executive remuneration requirements 
as set out in the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. Nonetheless, in order 
to ensure transparency to all of our stakeholders, we have sought to comply with these requirements on a voluntary basis, to the extent possible 
under Irish law. The Report on Directors’ Remuneration is contained on pages 63 to 93.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group is committed to maintaining sustainable and ethically responsible corporate and social practices in every aspect of its business for the

TAXATION STATUS

ACCOUNTING RECORDS
The Directors believe that they have complied with the requirements of Sections 281 to 286 of the Companies Act 2014 with regard to accounting 
records by employing accounting personnel with appropriate expertise and by providing adequate resources to the finance function. The accounting 
records of the Company are maintained at No. 2 Northwood Avenue, Northwood Business Park, Santry, Dublin 9, D09 X5N9, Ireland.
DIRECTORS’ COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for securing compliance by the Company of its relevant obligations as set out in the 
Companies Act 2014 (the ‘Relevant Obligations’).
The Directors further confirm that there is a Compliance Policy Statement in place setting out the Company’s policies which, in the Directors’ opinion, 
are appropriate to ensure compliance with the Company’s Relevant Obligations.
The Directors also confirm that appropriate arrangements and structures are in place which, in the Directors’ opinion, are designed to secure 
material compliance with the Company’s Relevant Obligations. For the year ended 29 September 2017, the Directors, with the assistance of the 
Risk Management Group, conducted a review of the arrangements and structures in place. In discharging their responsibilities under Section 225 
of the Companies Act 2014, the Directors relied on the advice of persons who the Directors believe have the requisite knowledge and experience 
to advise the Company on compliance with its Relevant Obligations.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR
Each of the Directors individually confirm that:
• In so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• That they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of such information. 55 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
AUDITOR
The auditor, KPMG, Chartered Accountants, continues in office in accordance with Section 383 of the Companies Act 2014.
Under Irish legislation, the Company’s external auditor is automatically re-appointed each year at the AGM unless the meeting passes a resolution  
to appoint a different auditor or provides that the existing external auditor shall not be re-appointed or, alternatively, if the auditor expresses its 
unwillingness to continue in office. Since 2014, the Company has put an annual advisory resolution before shareholders in respect of the continuation 
in office of KPMG as external auditor. It is intended that this resolution will once again be put before shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING AND SPECIAL BUSINESS
Notice of the 2018 AGM, together with details of special business to be considered at the meeting, will be circulated to shareholders during

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Corporate  
Governance  
Report
The core purpose of corporate governance 
is to facilitate effective, entrepreneurial and 
prudent management that is capable of 
delivering long-term success. Greencore 
has a robust corporate governance 
framework through which the Group  
fully commits to the highest ethical and 
professional standards in all its activities  
and operations. 
The benchmark used by the Group for 
measuring corporate governance is the  
2016 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘2016 Code’). This statement explains how  
the Company has applied the principles  
and complied with the provisions set out  
in the 2016 Code.
Whilst Greencore is not listed on the Irish  
Stock Exchange, for increased transparency, 
we have chosen to voluntarily adopt the 
provisions of the Irish Corporate Governance 
Annex (the ‘Annex’).
The Board believes that the Group has 
complied fully with the 2016 Code and the  
relevant provisions of the Annex throughout 
the financial year ended 29 September 2017 
where the requirements are of a continuing 
nature. The full text of the 2016 Code can be 
found on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website, www.frc.org.uk, whilst the Annex  
can be found on the Irish Stock Exchange’s 
website, www.ise.ie.
The Board, with the assistance of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee, 
keeps corporate governance developments 
under continuous review in order to ensure 
that the Group’s governance structures  
evolve as necessary and remain appropriate 
for a Group of our size and complexity.
My colleagues on the Board and I 
acknowledge and fully embrace our role in 
setting and fostering Greencore’s culture. This 
culture is underpinned by the four principles of 
The Greencore Way, which are the drivers of 
our behaviour. Diversity, mutual respect and 
the ability to challenge are fundamental to the 
way we operate as a Board. 
Together, these characteristics set the tone for 
management and employees of the Group to 
follow. We believe that having a healthy and 
enduring culture both protects and generates 
value. Throughout the year, the Board has 
visited many of the Group sites, and the Board 
recognises that spending time in the business 
is critical for getting a true sense of the culture 
in different parts of the business.

Corporate Governance Report

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board is responsible for the governance of the Group. It is also responsible for leading, monitoring and controlling the Group, and for 
promoting its long-term success. The Board consists of two Executive Directors and eight Non-Executive Directors. The biographical details  
of each of the Directors, along with each of their individual dates of appointment, are set out on pages 50 and 51.
Both on an individual and collective basis, the Directors have the range of skills, understanding, experience and expertise necessary to ensure the 
effective leadership of the Group and to ensure corporate governance standards are maintained.
The Board is comprised of Directors from a diverse range of backgrounds, each of whom brings independent judgement to bear on a number of 
key issues for the Group, including risk, strategy, performance, culture, environmental matters, health and safety, resourcing, ethics and regulation. 
In accordance with Provision B.1.2. of the 2016 Code at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, are independent. Where appropriate,  
it is Board policy to ensure that the independence of each Non-Executive Director is determined prior to his or her appointment and is reviewed 
annually thereafter.
On 3 October 2016, Mr AR Williams resigned from his position as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director and was replaced by Mr EP Tonge. 
Mr Williams remained with the Group until the end of the calendar year in order to ensure an orderly transition. 
During the period under review, Greencore has further strengthened its Board through the appointment of two Non-Executive Directors.  
Mr TH Sampson was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2017, having previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Peacock Foods from 2013 
to 2016. Prior to joining Peacock Foods, Mr Sampson spent 28 years at Kraft Foods, including 10 years as President of Kraft North American Food 
Service. His extensive experience and knowledge of the wider US food industry is key as Greencore continues to expand in the US. The Board 
acknowledges that, resulting from his role in Peacock Foods, Mr Sampson is not considered to be independent. Furthermore, Mr Sampson  
is currently Chair of the Group’s US Advisory Council and he receives a separate fee for this additional responsibility. 
Ambassador KF O’Malley was appointed to the Board on 14 March 2017 , having previously served as the United States Ambassador to Ireland from 
October 2014 to January 2017 . Ambassador O’Malley previously spent 11 years as Partner of Greensfelder, Hemker, and Gale, PC, as a legal advisor. 
In addition, Ambassador O’Malley has industry experience as an investor in the US hospitality sector and brings to the Board a wealth of knowledge 
and insight to support the Group’s overall growth and in particular the Board’s vision to build a large scale, high performing convenience food 
business in the US. 
These two appointments underscore the significant developments that have taken place within the Group including the acquisition of Peacock Foods 
in December 2016. Together, these appointments enhance the Board by bringing both geographic diversity, knowledge and key industry experience.
Furthermore, Mr EL Nicoli has confirmed his intention to retire from the Board as Non-Executive Director following the December 2017 Board 
meeting. Ms SG Bailey will replace Mr Nicoli as Senior Independent Director upon his retirement.
The Board reviewed the independence of each of the Non-Executive Directors who are submitting themselves forward for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). Notwithstanding the status of Mr Sampson, the Board confirms that each of the other Non-Executive 
Directors are independent. In addition, none of the other Non-Executive Directors have any material or other relationship with the Group.
In December 2016, the Board, on recommendation from the Nomination and Governance Committee, reviewed the composition of the Board and 
each of the Board committees (the ‘Committees’). This review resulted in a reconfiguration of membership in both the Nomination and Governance 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee. As part of the changes to the membership of the Committees, Mr EL Nicoli stepped down as Chair 
and as a member of the Remuneration Committee. Ms HA McSharry took over the role as Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Mr JJ Moloney 
joined the Remuneration Committee. Mr Nicoli then became a member of the Nomination and Governance Committee. These changes took effect 
at the conclusion of the AGM held on 31 January 2017 . Following these changes, it was determined that both the Board and the Committees are of 
the correct size and structure with no one individual or small group having the ability to dominate decision making. Furthermore, given the current 
composition of the Board, no undue reliance is placed on any individual Non-Executive Director. The Board continues to ensure that each of the 
Non-Executive Directors, where possible, remain impartial and independent, notwithstanding the appointment in February 2017 of Mr Sampson  
as explained above. The Board is confident that the Board’s composition is sufficiently independent in order to meet the collective challenges of  
their roles.
Each year, a schedule of regular meetings to be held in the following calendar year is agreed with each of the Directors. A list of the Directors’ 
attendance at scheduled meetings throughout the year can be found on page 59. Additional Board meetings are held on an ad-hoc basis as 
required throughout the year. In advance of the acquisition in December 2016 of Peacock Foods further Board and Audit Committee meetings 
were held. Board meetings generally take place at the Group’s head office in Dublin along with the offices of the Group’s operating subsidiaries, 
wherein tours of the local facilities, and visits to customer stores where appropriate, are also incorporated into the Board agenda. In FY17, the 
Board held two strategy sessions, which took place in the US at the Geneva manufacturing site, and in Ireland at an off-site location. Each session 
was held over the course of two days.
Prior to the appointment of any Non-Executive Director, he or she is provided with details of the time commitment required for the role to ensure 
the Directors devote sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively. If a Director is unable to attend a Board meeting, either in person  
or remotely, he or she will receive meeting papers in advance and is encouraged to communicate his or her views on any particular topic to the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Senior Independent Director or the Group Company Secretary in advance of the meeting. These views 
are then communicated at the Board meeting on behalf of the absent Director. 58 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONTINUED
There is an agreed formal list of matters reserved for Board consideration and decision. The list includes, but is not limited to, approving the  
half-year (interim) and full-year (final) results statements, Financial Statements, approving the interim dividend and recommending a final dividend to 
shareholders, Board membership, major acquisitions and disposals, major capital expenditure, risk management, internal controls, treasury policies 
and the approval of all circulars and listing particulars. The list of matters reserved for Board decision is available under the Corporate Governance 
section of the Group’s website, www.greencore.com, and is reviewed regularly by the Board and updated as appropriate. The matters and agenda 
reserved for Board consideration are planned in order to best utilise the skills, expertise and experience of the Directors. 
In addition, the Board is responsible for the approval of the Group’s commercial strategy, trading and capital budgets. The Directors acknowledge 
that they are responsible for the proper stewardship of the Group’s affairs, both on an individual and collective basis, and it is the Board alone which 
has the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group.
The Board meets with senior management in the Group on a regular basis to ensure that the Board remains fully aware of the business and its 
operating performance. Legislative changes along with any developments in accounting, governance and other standards are communicated to, 
and discussed with, the Board and the Committees as appropriate.
There is an agreed procedure for Directors to take independent legal advice at the expense of the Company in the furtherance of their duties  
as Directors of the Company. In addition, the Directors are indemnified for any legal action taken against them in respect of matters pertaining  
to their duties as Directors, subject always to the limitations under Irish company law. The Group Company Secretary, whose appointment and 
removal is a matter for the Board as a whole, is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed. He is available to each of the 
Directors for any advice or additional services they may require.
Each month the Directors receive Group management accounts and reports. Full Board papers are sent to each Director in a timely manner  
in advance of the Board meetings. The Board papers include the minutes of all previous Board and where appropriate, committee meetings.  
In addition, the Chair of the relevant committee provides a verbal update on the committee meeting’s proceedings at the following meeting  
of the Board.
In accordance with best practice and the 2016 Code, the Board acknowledges the importance of having a recognised senior member of the Board, 
referred to as the ‘Senior Independent Director’. It is the role of the Senior Independent Director to act as a confidential sounding board for the 
Chairman and to serve as an intermediary for the other Directors when necessary. The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders, and 
other stakeholders, if they have concerns which they have been unable to resolve through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer 
or other Executive Directors, or indeed where such contact through the aforementioned channels is deemed inappropriate.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and distinct and there is a clear division of responsibilities between the two 
roles. The operational responsibility for the management of the Group has been delegated to the Chief Executive Officer who is accountable  
to the Board, whilst it is the role of the Chairman to ensure the effective running of the Board.
The role of a Non-Executive Director includes providing entrepreneurial leadership, setting the Group’s strategy, acting as a conduit between 
shareholders and management, reviewing management performance and challenging management proposals as appropriate in a clear and 
constructive manner. Non-Executive Directors must also utilise their expertise and experience to contribute to the development of the Group  
as a whole. As outlined earlier, before a Non-Executive Director is appointed to the Board, or any of its Committees, he or she is advised of the 
scheduled calendar of meetings and the time commitment involved in the role. Furthermore, he or she is required to confirm that he or she is  
able to meet the time commitment required.
The Board understands the importance of an effective evaluation process. As set out on page 53, each year the Board conducts an annual self-
evaluation, which is led by the Chairman. The evaluation focuses on individual Board members, Board effectiveness, the composition of the Board, 
the interaction between Board members, Board and committee meetings and the performance of the Board as a whole in the year under review.
Each year, as part of the performance evaluation process, the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, undertake an 
evaluation process without the Chairman’s involvement, to evaluate the Chairman’s performance. The views of the Executive Directors and the 
Group Company Secretary are also taken into account. This forms part of the broader Board effectiveness review and assists in ensuring a robust, 
independent and effective Board.
In addition to the above, at least annually, the Chairman meets with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present to 
discuss, amongst other matters, the Executive Directors, the Board as a whole, the Committees and the interaction between the Executive  
and Non-Executive Directors.
As detailed on page 53, the Committees and the individual Directors are also subject to an externally facilitated evaluation process on  
a triennial basis.

Where appropriate, the Board also establishes sub-committees on an ad-hoc basis in order to deal with any additional items of business which 
arise throughout the year. The membership of the sub-committees will depend upon the purpose for which it was established and will take into 
account the skills and expertise necessary.
US ADVISORY COUNCIL
During the year, a Group US Advisory Council (‘Council’) was set up to advise the Board on all matters relevant to the development of the Group’s 
business in the US including the integration of new business, strategy and succession planning relating to the US. The Council is chaired by Non-
Executive Director, Mr Sampson and its membership consists of the Chief Executive Officer, members from US senior management and external 
appointees as the Board may appoint from time to time. The Council will meet at least twice a year, and the Group Company Secretary will act as 
Secretary to the Council. The Council’s first meeting will take place in early December 2017 in the US Central Office in Illinois.
COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS
It is the role of the Board to promote the long-term success of the Company and to ensure that its obligations to its shareholders and other 
stakeholders are met. Therefore, the Group gives priority to effective dialogue with shareholders and ensuring active shareholder engagement. 
Throughout the year, apart from when the Group is in a close period, the investor relations team meets with institutional and major shareholders.  
In addition, following the significant votes received against two resolutions relating to remuneration at the 2017 AGM, the Remuneration Committee 
engaged with shareholders during the year to understand their views on remuneration and to consult in relation to proposal changes to remuneration 
in FY18. Further information is detailed in the Report on Remuneration on pages 63 to 93.
The Group promotes communication with shareholders and the Group welcomes queries via telephone, post or email. The Board also encourages 
shareholders to make use of their votes at all general meetings. In addition, the Group runs an active investor relations management programme 
that comprises results releases, trading updates, conference presentations and regular ongoing dialogue with the investment community. 
Shareholder presentations are made at the time of issue of the Group’s half-year and full-year results, following which the Chief Financial Officer 
provides the Board with an update on feedback received. The Board receives regular updates on analyst coverage along with details in relation  
to share price movements and analysis of any significant changes in the shareholder base.
Periodically, additional events are held which provide the opportunity for the investment community to increase its knowledge in relation to the 
Group’s vision, strategy, organisation and business model. In March 2017 the Group hosted an institutional investor and analyst seminar at the 
Group’s Food to Go facility in Northampton. In June 2017 the Group held a Capital Markets Day in Chicago, hosted by the Chief Executive Officer 
which included site visits as well as presentations from the executive and divisional management teams. 60 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS CONTINUED
Details of any major changes in the Group, including Board compositional changes, major mergers and acquisitions, divestments and other 
significant strategic developments, are announced through a Regulatory News Service of the London Stock Exchange. The Group’s website,  
www.greencore.com, provides the full text of the Annual Reports, trading statements, half-year and full-year results statements and presentations 
to analysts and investors, along with announcements released to the London Stock Exchange. A significant amount of other published material 
including news releases and share price information is accessible to all shareholders on the Group’s website. In the Investor Relations section  
of the website, shareholders and stakeholders can subscribe to receive automated email alerts when new information is posted to the site.
Shareholders can elect to receive the Annual Report in paper form, or may elect to receive an email notification advising that the Annual Report is 
available on the Group’s website. Shareholders can also elect to receive an email notification when new information concerning the Group is available 
on the Group’s website.
The Chairman, along with the Senior Independent Director and each of the Non-Executive Directors, are available to meet with shareholders at the 
AGM and also throughout the year upon request. At the AGM, separate resolutions are proposed on substantially different issues. The agenda of 
business to be conducted at the AGM includes a resolution to receive and consider the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The Chair of each 
committee is available at the AGM to address any queries shareholders may have in relation to the role and/or activities of the relevant committee 
for the year under review.
The notice of the AGM and the Annual Report and Financial Statements are sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the date of  
the meeting and details of the total number of votes cast, the number of votes for and against each resolution and the number of abstentions  
are announced at the meeting and are also available on the Group’s website following the conclusion of the AGM. In the year under review,  
the Company held its AGM on 31 January 2017, wherein all shareholders were given the opportunity to ask questions or voice any concerns.
SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETINGS
The Company operates under the Companies Act 2014 (the ‘Act’). The Act provides for two types of shareholder meetings: the AGM with all  
other general meetings being called an Extraordinary General Meeting (‘EGM’).
The Company must hold a general meeting each year as its AGM, in addition to any other general meetings held in that year. Not more than 15 
months may elapse between the date of one AGM and the next. EGMs can also be convened at the request of members holding not less than  
5% of the voting share capital of the Company. The notice period for an AGM and an EGM to consider any special resolution (a resolution which 
requires a 75% majority vote, not a simple majority) is 21 days.
No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business. Three 
members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Only those shareholders registered on the Company’s register  
of members at the prescribed record date, being a date not more than 48 hours before the general meeting to which it relates, are entitled to 
attend and vote at a general meeting.
Under the Act, ordinary resolutions may be passed by a majority of votes cast in favour, while special resolutions require a 75% majority of votes 
cast in favour. Any shareholder who is entitled to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend, 
speak and vote on his or her behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. All resolutions are determined by a poll.
The business of the Company is managed by the Directors who may exercise all the powers of the Company unless they are required to be 
exercised by the Company in general meeting. Matters reserved to shareholders in general meetings include the election of Directors, the 
declaration of dividends on the recommendation of the Directors, the fixing of the remuneration of the external auditor, amendments to the 
Articles of Association, measures to increase or reduce the Ordinary Share Capital and the authority to issue shares.
The information required to be provided to shareholders in accordance with Sections 1099 to 1110 of the Companies Act 2014 is available on  
the Group’s website.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Similar to any large group, Greencore faces a number of risks and uncertainties. The key risks facing the Group include strategic risks, commercial 
risks, operational risks and financial risks. Under Irish company law (Section 327(1) (b) of the Companies Act 2014 and the Transparency (Directive 
2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007, as amended), the Directors are required to give a description of the principal risks and uncertainties which the 
Group faces. The principal risks and uncertainties identified are set out on pages 24 to 29 and form part of this report.
Whilst the Board as a whole is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, each of the individual business unit management teams  
drive the process through which individual business unit risks and uncertainties are identified. The Board understands that the individual business 
unit management teams are in the best position to identify the principal significant and emerging risks and uncertainties associated with their 
respective business. Risks and mitigating controls common across business categories are managed and reviewed at Group level. Risks identified 
and associated mitigating controls are subject to review by the Board and the Audit Committee on a regular basis and form part of the Group’s 
health and safety, technical compliance and operational/financial audit programmes.
Further details on risks and uncertainties are outlined on pages 24 to 29.
Corporate Governance Report  
continued 61 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
Further details on how the Board and the Audit Committee have discharged their responsibilities along with the reviews undertaken by the Audit 
Committee in the financial year can be found on pages 94 to 100.
Details regarding the Group’s internal controls are highlighted on pages 61 and 62 of this report. Details of the Group’s financial risk management 
and hedging policies are set out in Note 21 to the Group Financial Statements. Details of the Group’s financial key performance indicators are set 
out on pages 20 and 21. These disclosures form part of this report.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors, after making enquiries, have a reasonable expectation that the Company, and the Group as a whole, have adequate resources  
to continue operating for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the going concern basis continues to be adopted in preparing the Financial 
Statements.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
In line with the Provision C.2.2. of the 2016 Code, the Directors have carried out a rigorous review of the prospects of the current business and its  
ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the medium term. In undertaking this review, the Directors have concluded that a three-year timeframe 
continues to be an appropriate period for this assessment given that this is the typical period for visibility of commercial arrangements with the Group’s 
customers in the Group’s strategic planning process. The objectives of the annual strategic planning process are to consider the key strategic choices 
facing the Group and to build a consolidated financial model with various scenarios, taking into account the principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Company which may threaten the Company’s solvency, liquidity, cash flow and business model.
Assumptions are built for the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and cash flow at the divisional level. These are rigorously tested by management 
and the Directors. Sensitivity analysis has been applied to reflect the potential impact of some of the principal strategic and commercial risks of 
the Company as described on pages 24 to 29. These risks could affect the level of sales and profitability of the Company and the amount of capital 
required to deliver them. A model of financing requirements is also built for the same time period taking into account the base plan and 
sensitivities against this, together with the likelihood of being able to refinance maturing committed facilities. Based on the results of this analysis, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three year period of their assessment.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, for reviewing its effectiveness and for confirming that there is a process in 
place for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks to the achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives.
The process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks has been in place throughout the financial year up to the date of the 
approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements, accords with the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting and is regularly reviewed by the Board. This system of internal control is designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The internal control systems can only provide reasonable 
assurance, rather than absolute assurance, against material misstatement or loss.
The process involves the Board reviewing and analysing the following:
• The nature and extent of the risks, including principal risks, facing the Group;
• The extent and categories of risks it regards as desirable or acceptable for the Group to bear;
• The likelihood of the risk concerned materialising and the impact of associated risks materialising as a consequence;
• The Group’s ability to reduce the incidence and impact on its business of risks that do materialise;
• The operation of the relevant controls and control processes;
• The costs of operating particular controls relative to the benefits thereby obtained in managing related risks; and
• The Group’s risk culture.
On a regular basis, the risks faced by the Group are reviewed with management and also the Board’s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee’s 
Terms of Reference (which are available under the Corporate Governance section of the Group’s website, www.greencore.com) stipulate that it 
must conduct an annual risk and internal control assessment, following on from which it must present a report to the Board on: (a) the nature  
and extent of the significant risks facing the Group; (b) the design, operation and monitoring by management of internal control systems and  
the adequacy and frequency of reports from management to the Board; (c) whether the reports give a balanced assessment of the significant  
risks and the effectiveness of the system of internal control in managing those risks; and (d) the Going Concern and Viability Statements. 62 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
INTERNAL CONTROL CONTINUED
The key elements of the system of internal control are as follows:
• Clearly defined organisation structures and lines of authority;
• Corporate policies for financial reporting, treasury and financial risk management, information technology and security, project appraisal and 
corporate governance;
• Annual budgets and strategic business plans for all operating units, identifying key risks and opportunities;
• Monitoring of performance against budgets and forecasts and reporting thereon to the Directors on a regular basis;
• A Risk Management Group which reviews key business processes and controls and their effectiveness; and
• The Audit Committee which approves audit plans and deals with significant control issues raised by the Risk Management Group or external audit.
The preparation and issue of financial reports is managed by the Group finance department, as delegated by the Board. The Group financial 
reporting process is controlled using the Group accounting policies and reporting systems. The Group finance team supports all reporting entities 
with guidance on the preparation of financial information. Each division has a Finance Director or Controller who is responsible for information which 
accords with agreed policies.
The financial information for each division is subject to a review at reporting entity and Group level by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer, along with the divisional Managing Directors. The Annual Report is reviewed by the Audit Committee in advance of its 
presentation to the Board for approval.
During the year under review, the Managing Director or the Finance Director of each division completed a Financial Internal Control Questionnaire 
which was used to identify control strengths and weaknesses across all financial areas and any weaknesses were subsequently addressed.
The Group also maintains a Risk Register which sets out the nature and extent of the risks facing each division and the Group as a whole. Each of 
the risks are prioritised in terms of likelihood and impact. The purpose of the Risk Register is to ensure that all significant risks within each business 
unit have been appropriately identified and also to ensure that all risk is mitigated or managed as appropriate. It is understood that regular and 
detailed assessment is critical due to the volatile and uncertain economic environment. Further detail on risk and risk management is set out  
on pages 24 to 29 and in Note 21 to the Group Financial Statements.
Finally, the Directors, through the use of appropriate procedures, systems and the employment of competent personnel, have ensured that 
measures are in place to secure compliance with the Company’s obligation to keep adequate accounting records. The accounting records are 
kept at the registered office of the Company.

Report on Directors’ Remuneration
LETTER FROM THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIR
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
Against the backdrop of a significant vote against two of our remuneration resolutions at the 2017 Annual General Meeting (‘2017 AGM’) and with 
a refreshed Committee, I have taken the opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review of our remuneration approach and framework.
The Committee and I have consulted and considered carefully the input from our shareholders and have sought to respond by updating the principles 
which will guide our remuneration decisions and incorporate a number of changes to the implementation of our remuneration Policy (‘2017 Policy’ or 
‘Policy’) for FY18. Our Policy was developed to ensure a clear link between the delivery of our strategy and pay outcomes. From our discussions with 
shareholders we recognise the need to provide more information to show how our strategic priorities are reflected in our performance targets and 
consistent with actual payout levels. Throughout this report we have sought to provide more information on how our Committee decisions reflect the 
strategic goals and direction of the business. 
The Committee and I have worked hard to ensure that our remuneration disclosures are clear and relevant to shareholders. In doing so, we examined 
the results of the 2017 AGM, tested our approach to remuneration and undertook an invaluable engagement exercise with shareholders. We are 
committed to ensuring that we are transparent about how pay and performance is reported at Greencore and how decisions made by the Committee 
continue to support the strategic direction of the business. 
RESULTS OF THE 2017 AGM
At the 2017 AGM, shareholders endorsed the Annual Report on Remuneration with 98% votes cast in favour. In addition to our Annual Report on 
Remuneration, we proposed the new 2017 Policy to replace the previously approved 2015 Policy. The 2017 Policy increased the maximum award level 
under the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) from 100% to 200% of salary and 150% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) and Chief Financial 
Officer (‘CFO’) respectively and introduced for the first time an additional two year holding period for awards, after a three year performance and 
vesting period, under the PSP . While 59.9% of shareholders supported the introduction of the 2017 Policy, 40.1% voted against. The amended PSP 
Rules incorporating these changes received 60.7% approval. The scale of votes against the resolutions was disappointing for the Committee as we 
had engaged with our major shareholders prior to the finalisation of the 2017 Policy proposal in September 2016 and had received broad support for 
the changes outlined. 
We have had very strong and consistent support for our remuneration approach before the 2017 AGM vote so the Committee and the Board 
immediately instigated a full analysis of the vote and feedback received, and committed to consult with our shareholders and proxy advisors to 
understand why a significant minority felt they could not support the 2017 Policy. Following our review of feedback and having discussed this with  
a large number of shareholders during our consultation the primary reason outlined was the scale of the increase in the PSP opportunity with no 
detailed rationale to show that there was a commensurate increase in targets. We did not make it clear that the stretch to achieve this potentially 
bigger pay out was increasing significantly. The increased scale of the business and overall competitiveness of our pay levels in comparison to 
relevant external market data were important considerations in our proposed Policy change and considered necessary to motivate, retain and 
appropriately reward our executive management to execute our strategy in an increasingly competitive market for top talent.
To ensure there remained appropriate stretch in the target metrics relating to the increased PSP opportunity, the Committee reviewed the strategic 
plans and determined there should be no change to the targets proposed for the awards granted in February 2017 . This represents considerable 
stretch over and above previous target levels given the significant step up in capital invested in FY16 (including seven new manufacturing facilities 
commissioned, built or acquired during the year) and reflecting the normal timescale for new facilities to ramp up to full capacity which means  
a time lag before anticipated growth and returns are fully delivered. 
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee  
(the ‘Committee’) and the Board, I am pleased to 
present my first Report on Directors’ Remuneration, 
having been appointed as Chair of the Committee 
in January 2017 .

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
continued
LETTER FROM THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIR CONTINUED
RESULTS OF THE 2017 AGM CONTINUED
The overall level of 200% of salary remains in line with FTSE 250 companies. Additional issues raised by shareholders were the overlap of performance 
measures in both long and short term incentives, the lack of some best practice features including malus and clawback in our Policy and the desire for 
more transparency on personal bonus targets. 
It is clear from the 2017 AGM vote and our consultations that the disclosure in our FY16 Annual Report did not provide sufficient detail or rationale  
to all of our shareholders on the strategic and operational context for the change proposed in the 2017 Policy. An additional challenge was the 
significant number of new Greencore shareholders following the rights issue in December 2016 which resulted in considerable churn in the 
shareholder base before the 2017 AGM vote. After the 2017 AGM it became clear that there were varying levels of understanding of the strategic 
context influencing our proposals amongst some new shareholders. 
During our consultation with shareholders, and throughout this report, we have sought to explain the background to the Policy changes in more detail. 
Following a period of sustained and substantial growth, the Committee continues to believe that the PSP opportunity is at an appropriate level to 
incentivise future long-term performance for the Company in line with our vision to be a fast-growing international convenience food leader.
We also explained that our 2017 Policy proposal introduced for the first time a holding period of two further years post vesting for all PSP awards. 
This extends our long-term incentive time horizon to five years which provides greater alignment with the long term interests of our shareholders 
and with our long-term strategy. 
REVIEW OF REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES AND PROPOSALS FOR FY18 EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION 
During our review of the remuneration arrangements, the Committee revisited our remuneration principles. The Committee sought to identify  
the most appropriate principles for the business, taking into account its underlying values set out in The Greencore Way, specifically People at the 
Core and the interests of stakeholders. Going forward, the Committee will seek to ensure that our remuneration framework remains aligned with 
the following overarching principles: 
• Alignment and fairness;
• Pay-for-performance; and
• Transparency and simplicity.
Full details of how we intend to operate these in practice are outlined on page 69. 
Following a review of Greencore’s approach to remuneration and taking into account the feedback from shareholders, the Committee is proposing 
a number of changes for FY18 executive remuneration, which I detail below. 
Proposed changes to FY18 remuneration were:
• the introduction of Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) as an additional measure for our long-term PSP awards, which will further augment 
alignment with shareholders and diversify the metrics used under the PSP;
• the extension of the malus provisions to cover short-term bonus as well as long-term PSP , which will strengthen the ability of the Company to 
withhold or forfeit remuneration in certain circumstances;
• increasing the shareholding guideline to 2x salary for the CFO which will strengthen the alignment between his interests and those of 
shareholders, and brings them in line with market practice and guidelines for the CEO; and 
• a reduction in the Return on Invested Capital (‘ROIC’) target to take into account the intensive capital investment program and Peacock  
Foods acquisition. The new target ranges reflect the medium term downward impact on ROIC as a result of the considerable increase in  
our invested capital.
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ON FY18 PROPOSALS 
The Committee contacted shareholders who hold circa 55% of our issued share capital as well as the Investment Association, ISS and Glass  
Lewis with an outline of our proposed changes and requested a meeting to obtain their feedback and input. During this process we received 
feedback from shareholders representing circa 36% of our issued share capital, and the proxy agencies, from which we received very valuable 
input. The Board Chairman and I carried out direct consultations which included a presentation on the current Group strategy so the context  
of our performance measures and metrics was fully explained. Shareholders were broadly supportive of our overall remuneration Policy and 
approach and how it links with our current strategic priorities. 
Our engagement provided some wide ranging views on remuneration in general and specifically in relation to the Group (with some divergent views 
between our US and UK shareholders) as detailed below on page 81. The Committee will keep all of these views under consideration. 
Overall, our key proposals to apply to FY18 executive remuneration were viewed positively. Following the feedback from the consultations, the 
Committee re-examined recovery provisions. In addition to the extension of the malus provision, the Committee also agreed to introduce clawback  
on all future bonuses and PSP awards. 
Throughout the consultation much of our discussions related to the introduction of TSR and the change in performance targets.  65 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
TSR PEER GROUP
In electing to include a TSR component under the PSP , the Committee was conscious of the requirement to determine appropriate peers to 
compare our TSR performance against. After careful consideration, the Committee has determined that 17 listed companies will comprise the 
peer group under the TSR measure for FY18 awards, as set out below. 
A.G. Barr plc Dairy Crest Group plc Hain Celestial Group Post Holdings, Inc. 
ARYZTA AG Glanbia plc Hilton Food Group plc Premium Brands Holdings Corporation
Britvic plc Greenyard Holdings Kerry Group SSP Group plc
Cranswick plc Greggs plc Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Total Produce plc
TreeHouse Foods
The peer companies are representative of the sector we operate in and, most significantly, are companies who face similar business challenges.  
It includes a majority of UK companies together with other European peers. We have also included five US peers. While the Committee was aware  
of concerns from some stakeholders on the inclusion of companies domiciled in a different location, we now have a substantial US business with 
approximately 40% of our revenue stream deriving from the US market.

PERFORMANCE TARGETS
A central aspect of our consultation with shareholders was the target range for the ROIC measure under the PSP . In December 2016, we completed the 
acquisition of Peacock Foods for $747 .5m, which included a significant rights issue. In addition to the changes to the remuneration framework outlined, 
the Committee spent significant time determining what impact the Peacock Foods acquisition would have on our remuneration arrangements and, 
particularly, the targets under our incentive schemes. The Committee has sought to ensure that the targets in place are suitably stretching while 
reflecting the future expected performance of our enlarged business. After careful consideration, Adjusted Earnings per Share (‘EPS’) targets for the 
PSP awards to be granted in December 2017 will remain unchanged (at 5% p.a. at threshold and 15% p.a. for maximum vesting). However, for the third 
of the award based on ROIC performance, the targets have been reduced to 10% at threshold and 13% for maximum vesting. 
As discussed previously, the invested capital of the business has expanded considerably in both FY16 (11%) and FY17 (31%). The target ranges 
reflect the medium term downward impact on ROIC as a result of the considerable increase in our invested capital. This logic and the detailed 
analysis behind it was discussed in many of the meetings with our shareholders, who recognised the need to adjust the targets as a result of the 
disconnect between the level of capital being invested by the business and the delay in the increased returns that this investment will generate 
over time in line with our long-term strategy.
Based on the increase in issued share capital during FY17, the Committee is satisfied that the target range under the EPS measure is at least as 
difficult to achieve as under previous awards.
The Committee is fully aware of the sensitivities around the lowering of performance targets among shareholders and proxy advisors. In determining  
the revisions to the targets, the Committee carefully weighed shareholder feedback, consensus forecasts and internal modelling of expected 
performance, as detailed on page 89. 
As part of our updated strategic planning post the integration of Peacock Foods, we completed an extensive review of the short and medium term 
plans with management to consider the alignment of the incentive structure with the strategic goals of the business.  66 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

From that exercise, we continue to believe that EPS and ROIC remain the key metrics for our business and long-term strategy. The combination of EPS, 
reflecting our growth objective, and ROIC, promoting capital discipline and a focus on returns, is consistent with our strategy to deliver sustainable 
growth in value for our shareholders. 
Subsequent to the detailed review and shareholder feedback, the Committee believes that the FY18 targets are at least as challenging as the 
range that previously applied. For maximum vesting levels, truly exceptional performance under each of the financial measures is required.
I want to thank our shareholders for the time they have committed to consider and discuss our approach and especially for their valuable input  
so we can better align our remuneration approach and our key proposals for FY18 with their interests. 
PERFORMANCE AND REMUNERATION OUTCOMES FOR FY17 
While much progress was achieved in FY17 with the completion of an intense operational and network expansion in the UK, and the transformational 
acquisition of Peacock Foods in the US, our financial performance in the year has been challenging and we have not met our financial targets.
Although Adjusted Operating Profit was strong at £140.1m, the Group did incur a high level of exceptional charges in the year, which amounted to 
£78.2m. It is against this backdrop that the incentive payout for our Executive Directors has been determined.
The annual bonus was based on delivery of financial performance targets (75%) and strategic and personal objectives (25%). The Committee took 
the view that no award should be made for the delivery of financial performance. Although inclusion of Peacock Foods results could have merited  
a modest payout, the Committee determined that because of the high level of exceptionals and taking the total returns for shareholders in FY17 
into account, that no bonus was justified for financial delivery. The Committee reviewed the strategic and personal targets for both Patrick Coveney 
and Eoin Tonge (further details of the targets which they were measured against are outlined on page 84). The level of strategic progress and the 
specific individual contributions by both Patrick Coveney and Eoin Tonge in navigating through the challenges were evaluated. The Committee took 
a holistic review of their performance during the year and determined that both individuals merited a bonus payout of 22% out of 25%. Given the 
business context for FY17 , 100% of bonuses earned would be deferred in shares for three years for additional shareholder alignment. Therefore no 
cash bonus is payable in respect of FY17 . 
In respect of the PSP award granted to Patrick Coveney in December 2014, the underlying EPS growth of 5.2% and together with underlying FY17 
ROIC of 12.6% (excluding the impact of Peacock Foods) resulted in a payout of 35% of his award which will vest in December 2017.
During the year, Patrick Coveney and Eoin Tonge received PSP awards of 200% and 150% of salary, respectively. Vesting is based on EPS and  
ROIC performance measured over the three years to FY19, weighted 50/50. In line with our new Policy, a two-year post-vesting holding period  
will apply to the FY17 and future PSP awards for Executive Directors.
The Committee reviewed salaries in November 2017 and determined that the salary of Patrick Coveney and Eoin Tonge would be increased  
by 2.5% to €823,728 and £410,000 respectively from 1 October 2017. This increase in salary for the Executive Directors is consistent with the 
increases for the wider employee base in the Group.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
Following a review of Non-Executive Director fees, which were last reviewed in January 2014, the basic fee for Non-Executive Directors was 
increased from €60,000 to €78,000 per annum for FY17. In addition, the fee for the Non-Executive Chairman was increased from €189,000 to 
€247,000 and the fee for the Chair of the Nomination Committee fee was increased from €5,000 to €10,000. The increase in remuneration levels  
for the Non-Executive members of the Board reflects the time commitment and responsibilities for the respective roles and duties undertaken  
by each member; and, the increase takes into account practice of other companies of a similar size and complexity. 
REMUNERATION IN FY18
We will continue to critically assess our disclosure practices to ensure our approach to remuneration is effectively communicated to all stakeholders. 
We have provided a greater level of disclosure of the personal objectives and will continue to ensure that all decisions on remuneration and the role  
the remuneration framework plays in promoting the delivery of strategy are transparently communicated to shareholders.
Finally I would like to thank my fellow members of the Committee for their full commitment and engagement in what has been an intensive year for 
the business. FY18 will be a critical year for the Group as we continue to integrate the Peacock Foods business. I remain dedicated to overseeing 
the implementation of a remuneration Policy that works for our business and delivers results for our stakeholders. Over the coming year, I intend 
to consult again with shareholders, which I know the Committee will find invaluable. I look forward to receiving your support at the 2018 AGM 
where I will be available to respond to any questions shareholders may have on this report or in relation to the Committee’s activities.

Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
continued 67 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
REMUNERATION AT A GLANCE
This section is a snapshot of the Group’s performance over the FY17 year and the remuneration received by our Executive Directors. Full details 
can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 79 to 93.
The Committee applies the following overarching remuneration principles in the design and implementation of our remuneration Policy:
• Alignment and fairness: aligning Executive Directors’ and shareholders’ interests, and ensuring pay arrangements are fair and equitable across 
the Group;
• Pay-for-performance: ensuring targets are appropriately stretching, and setting safeguards against paying for failure; and
• Transparency and simplicity: designing a simple remuneration structure, and clearly communicating remuneration decisions to shareholders.
It is in this context that remuneration outcomes for FY17 and implementation of the 2017 Policy for FY18 have been determined, as follows.
FY17 REMUNERATION OUTCOMES
ANNUAL BONUS
The annual bonus was based on a mix of financial (weighted 75% of the total) and personal/strategic (weighted 25% of the total) performance 
measures for FY17. The performance targets and actual underlying performance are set out below:

In coming to its decision the Committee considered a range of adjustments to the FY17 outturn, including the material impact of the Peacock 
Foods acquisition on financial performance for the year, which would have merited a level of financial payout, particularly around ROIC targets. 
However, the Committee took a view that in light of the significant levels of exceptional items this year and the Company’s TSR performance,  
no bonus would be payable for Group financial performance.
The Committee determined that in terms of personal performance, both Patrick Coveney and Eoin Tonge receive a bonus of 22% out of 25%. Given 
the business context, the Committee determined that for FY17 100% (rather than 50%) of bonuses earned would be deferred in shares for three 
years, for additional shareholder alignment, subject to continued employment. Further detail of their performance is detailed on pages 83 to 85. 
FY15 PSP AWARD
The Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) values in respect of the FY17 single figure relate to awards granted in December 2014. Awards were subject

REMUNERATION AT A GLANCE CONTINUED
FY17 REMUNERATION OUTCOMES CONTINUED
Therefore, 35% of the original award will vest to Patrick Coveney and Eoin Tonge in December 2017 , subject to continued employment on the vesting 
date. Eoin Tonge’s PSP award was made prior to his appointment to the Board and does not relate to his service as an Executive Director, and has 
been disclosed for information only.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY IN FY18
Element of pay Implementation for FY18
Fixed remuneration 
Base salary Salaries are reviewed annually, taking into account the Executive Director’s role, experience and performance 
as well as the average increase for the broader workforce, and supported by market data.
Salaries for FY18 are: Patrick Coveney €823,728 and Eoin Tonge £410,000 (2.5% increase for both, in line with 
the average increase awarded to the wider workforce).
Pension and benefits Per the terms of his contract, Patrick Coveney receives a taxable non-pensionable cash allowance equivalent to 
35% of his pensionable earnings in lieu of participation in a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme. Eoin Tonge 
participates in the Greencore UK Master Trust Pension Scheme which is a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme 
and receives a partial non-pensionable cash allowance equivalent to 25% of his pensionable earnings. No change 
proposed for FY18.
Pay for performance 
Safeguards and risk management Effective from FY18, malus and clawback provisions will apply to the annual bonus and the PSP both prior to 
vesting and for a period of two years post-vesting. This enables the Company to withhold payment/vesting of 
any sums and/or recover sums paid on the occurrence of specific trigger events (e.g. a material misstatement  
of the Company’s audited results, a material failure of risk management, a material breach of health and safety 
regulations, or serious reputational damage).
The Company also operates a mandatory two-year holding period for vested PSP awards; vested awards may 
not be sold during the holding period except to cover tax liabilities.
Annual bonus and Deferred  
Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
No change to maximum opportunity: 150% of salary.
The performance measures and weightings also remain unchanged: 50% adjusted EPS, 25% ROIC and 25% 
personal/strategic objectives.
50% of bonus earned will be deferred in shares for three years under the DBP .
PSP No change to award opportunities: 200% of salary for Patrick Coveney and 150% of salary for Eoin Tonge.
The performance measures and weightings will be: 1/3rd EPS, 1/3rd ROIC and 1/3rd relative TSR vs. a 
bespoke peer group.
PSP awards are subject to a three-year performance period and an additional two-year holding period.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) was approved by an advisory, non-binding shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM and took effect 
from the date of the AGM. This section presents the full Policy, for ease of reference.
The sections presented are as disclosed in the FY16 Directors’ Remuneration Report, save the following changes:
• References to financial years have been updated where appropriate;
• Pay-for-performance scenario charts have been updated to reflect FY18 salaries; 
• Wording in the Policy table has been updated to reflect our strengthened malus provisions and the introduction of clawback provisions, 
effective for awards made from FY18; and
• Wording in the Policy has been updated to reflect the addition of Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) as a third metric to PSP , effective for awards 
made from FY18.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The main aim of the Group’s Policy is to align the interests of Executive Directors with the Group’s strategic vision and the long-term creation of 
shareholder value. The Policy is intended to pay the Executive Directors competitively and appropriately, having taken into account a number of 
other factors, including the remuneration practices of other international companies of similar size and scope, the current economic climate and 
the regulatory and governance framework. The Committee also takes into consideration remuneration practices throughout the Group when 
considering Executive Directors’ pay and ensures that the Group pays its Executive Directors no more than is necessary.
REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES
The following principles have been adopted during FY17 as a framework to guide our remuneration decisions: 
Remuneration principle In action
Alignment  
and fairness
• Encouraging all employees to become shareholders;
• Operating a PSP for senior employees;
• Offering employee share plans;
• Shareholding guidelines, bonus deferral and PSP holding period for Executive Directors; and
• Shareholder value in sharp focus.
Pay-for- 
performance
• Commitment to ensuring targets are appropriately stretching and vesting levels are reflective of shareholder experience;
• No variable remuneration for mediocre performance and the inclusion of an underpin for the new TSR measure; and
• Ensuring personal objectives are accurately assessed and clearly communicated.
Transparency  
and simplicity
• Increased focus on effectively communicating decisions to shareholders through shareholder engagement and the 
Annual Report; and
• Simple incentive structure based on the measures central to our strategy and business model. 70 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

Base salary To provide the basis of a 
market competitive overall 
remuneration package.
Takes account of the role,  
skills and contribution of 
individuals.
Basic salaries are determined 
taking into account a number 
of factors, including:
• individual responsibilities, 
performance and 
experience;
• practice at other companies 
of a similar size and 
complexity;
• the pay arrangements 
throughout the organisation; 
and
• the Company’s progress 
towards its objectives.
Salaries are usually reviewed 
during November and any 
increases will normally be 
effective from the preceding 
1 October. However, the 
Committee reserves the  
right to make salary increases 
effective from any other time 
where considered appropriate.
Whilst there is no maximum 
salary, increases will normally 
be in line with the average 
increase awarded to other 
employees in the Group.
However, the Committee retains 
the discretion to make increases 
above this level in certain 
circumstances, including,  
but not limited to:
• an increase in scope and/ 
or responsibility of a role;
• a new Executive Director 
being moved to market 
competitive positioning  
over time; and
• an existing Executive 
Director falling below  
market positioning.
None.
Pension To provide post-retirement 
remuneration to ensure that 
the overall remuneration 
package is competitive.
The Chief Executive Officer 
receives a taxable non-
pensionable cash allowance  
in lieu of participation in a 
Defined Contribution pension 
scheme. The Chief Financial 
Officer participates in part  
in the Greencore UK Master 
Trust Pension Scheme which  
is a Defined Contribution 
pension scheme and receives 
a partial non-pensionable 
cash allowance. The Chief 
Executive Officer participated 
in the Defined Benefit Pension 
Scheme until it was closed to 
future accrual in 2009.
The Committee may 
determine that alternative 
pension provisions will operate 
for new appointments to the 
Board. When determining 
pension arrangements for  
new appointments, the Board 
will give regard to the cost  
of the arrangements, market 
practice and the pension 
arrangements received 
elsewhere in the Group.
The Company’s maximum
contribution/cash allowance 
for the Executive Directors is
as follows:
• CEO – 35% of pensionable 
salary; and
• CFO – 25% of pensionable 
salary.
The Chief Executive Officer is a 
deferred member of the Group’s 
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme 
which closed to future accrual 
with effect from 31 December 
2009. The value of the frozen 
scheme benefits for the Chief 
Executive Officer was £50,436  
as at 29 September 2017 .

Bonus Plan
To support the business 
strategy by incentivising the 
delivery of annual financial 
targets as well as the 
achievement of personal  
and strategic objectives.
The deferred element aligns 
the interests of Executives and 
shareholders and provides a 
strong retention mechanism. 
Performance is assessed over 
the relevant financial year.
The level of payment is 
determined by the Committee 
after the year-end, based on 
performance against targets 
and any additional factors  
they deem significant.
A proportion (normally  
50% unless the Committee 
determines otherwise) of  
any bonus is paid in cash,  
with the remainder deferred 
into a share award. Cash 
bonuses are paid following  
the year-end.
Deferred share element
The Deferred Share Awards 
will normally vest three years 
after the grant of an award 
(unless the Committee 
determines an alternative 
vesting period is appropriate).
The vesting of Deferred Share 
Awards will normally be subject 
to continued employment.
The Committee has the 
discretion to reduce the 
number of Deferred Shares if, 
prior to vesting, the participant 
is in fundamental breach of 
their employment contract.
Dividend equivalents may  
be awarded.
Effective from FY18, the annual 
bonus will be subject to malus 
and clawback provisions, i.e. 
forfeiture or reduction of the 
deferred portion or recovery  
of paid amounts, in exceptional 
circumstances. Such 
circumstances include a 
material misstatement of  
the Company’s audited  
results, a material failure of risk 
management, a material breach 
of health and safety regulations, 
or serious reputational damage 
to any member or business unit 
of the Group.
The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 150% of salary.
The award opportunity  
for bonus at threshold 
performance is nil with  
up to 50% of the award 
normally payable for target 
performance. 100% of  
the award is payable for 
maximum performance.
The bonus is determined 
based on performance against 
financial performance metrics 
and personal objectives.
Currently, 75% of the award  
is based on financial targets  
(of which 50% is based on 
adjusted EPS and 25% is based 
on ROIC) and 25% is based on 
personal and strategic goals.
The Committee may choose 
alternative performance 
measures or may adjust the 
weighting of measures in future 
years to ensure that Executive 
Directors are appropriately 
incentivised to deliver key 
strategic goals. In any year, the 
financial performance metrics 
will always account for the 
majority of the award.
The Committee sets targets 
every year to ensure that they 
are appropriately stretching.

applicable for the financial 
year under review, please

Awards normally vest based 
on performance measured 
over a period of three years  
or such other period as the 
Committee may determine.
Awards may be granted in  
the form of performance share 
awards (a conditional award  
of shares, a nil-cost option  
or a forfeitable share award).
The Committee determines  
the extent to which the 
performance measures have 
been met. The Committee will 
also consider the underlying 
financial performance of the 
business, as well as the value 
added to shareholders. The 
level of vesting may be adjusted 
where the Committee considers 
there is a material difference.
An additional two-year 
holding period will apply  
to Executive Directors’  
vested shares before they  
are released to participants. 
Dividend equivalents may  
be awarded.
In the event of a material 
misstatement of the Company’s

a material breach of health  
and safety regulations, or 
serious reputational damage  
to any member or business unit 
of the Group, the Committee 
may scale back, or impose

awards prior to vesting. 
Effective from FY18, awards  
will also be subject to clawback 
provisions, i.e. recovery of 
vested awards, in exceptional 
circumstances such as the  
ones set out above.
The maximum award level  
is 200% of salary in respect  
of a financial year.
For FY18 it is intended to  
grant awards of 200%  
and 150% to the CEO  
and CFO, respectively. 
For FY18, awards will vest 
based on Earnings per Share, 
Return on Invested Capital 
and relative Total Shareholder 
Return (‘TSR’). These measures 
will be equally weighted  
for FY18 awards, but the 
Committee may determine 
that an alternative weighting is 
appropriate for future awards.
The Committee shall have  
the discretion to determine 
that alternative performance 
measures may apply to  
future awards.
For threshold levels of 
performance, 25% of the 
award vests, increasing  
to 100% of the award for 
maximum performance.  
There is straight-line vesting of 
awards between these points.
The Committee determines 
targets each year to ensure 
that targets are stretching and 
represent value creation for 
shareholders, whilst remaining 
motivational for management.
The Company also operates a shareholding guideline for Executive Directors, details of which can be found on page 92 of the Annual Report

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT CONTINUED
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE CONTINUED
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including the exercise of any discretion 
available to it in connection with such payments), notwithstanding that they may not be in line with the Policy where the terms of the payment were 
agreed either before the Policy came into effect or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and in the opinion of 
the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
From 2001 to 2011, the Company granted market value share options under the Greencore Group Executive Share Option Scheme. As the 
Scheme expired in 2011, no further options will be granted under this scheme. At the time when this Policy came into force, all options under the 
Executive Share Option Scheme had vested and, subject to the individual’s continued employment and the rules of the scheme, the outstanding 
options may be exercised until the ten-year anniversary of the date of the award.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of 
a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Awards granted under the Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’) and the PSP:
• may be settled in cash;
• may incorporate the right to receive in cash or shares the value of dividends which would have been paid or allotted on the shares between 
grant and vesting. This may assume the reinvestment of those dividends in the Company’s shares on a cumulative basis; and
• may be adjusted in the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital or a demerger, delisting, special dividend, rights issue or other 
event, which may, in the Committee’s opinion, affect the current or future value of awards.
The Committee may amend or substitute performance conditions applicable to a PSP award if an event (or events) occurs which causes the 
Committee to consider that an amended or substituted performance condition would be more appropriate and would not be materially less 
difficult to satisfy.
The terms of the DBP and PSP may be amended in accordance with the relevant plan rules.
INFORMATION SUPPORTING THE POLICY TABLE
SELECTION OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Annual Bonus Plan is based on financial performance, as well as personal and strategic goals. The financial element for FY18 will be based on 
Earnings per Share and Return on Invested Capital. The Committee has selected these measures to ensure continued focus on the key financial 
objectives for the year ahead. The achievement of key personal and strategic goals is also considered important to drive the performance of the 
business over the longer term.
The PSP is currently based on Earnings per Share, Return on Invested Capital and relative TSR. The earnings measure incentivises Executive 
Directors to grow earnings for shareholders over the long-term, whilst the return measure ensures that the growth is sustainable and in the 
long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders. Relative TSR provides additional shareholder alignment, and incentivises our 
outperformance against companies in our sector.
The mix of annual and long-term measures is discussed in further detail in the Annual Report on Remuneration. Targets are set taking into account  
a number of factors including internal and external forecasts, and market practice.
The Committee keeps the performance measures, weightings and targets of both the annual bonus and PSP under review and reserves the right 
to adjust these if they are no longer considered to be appropriate.
REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE GROUP
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group are based on the same high level remuneration principles as for the Executive Directors.  
We believe that individuals should be rewarded based on their contribution to the Group and the success of the Group and that reward should  
be competitive in the market, without paying more than is necessary to recruit and retain individuals.
Reward packages will differ taking into account location, seniority and level of responsibility, however, remuneration packages are structured 
around common reward objectives and principles.
In addition to the Executive Directors, individuals across the Group participate in the annual bonus plan, whilst senior executives participate in  
the PSP and DBP on the same principles as the Executive Directors.
In addition, eligible employees in Ireland and the UK are entitled to join the Group’s ShareSave Schemes, which provide a means of saving and 
gives employees the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The remuneration Policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors is to pay fees necessary to attract Non-Executive Directors of the calibre 
required taking into consideration the size and complexity of the business and the time commitment of the role, without paying more than is necessary.
Details are set out in the table below:
Approach to setting fees Basis of fees Other items
• The fees of the Non-Executive Directors 
are agreed by the Board following 
recommendations by the Committee.
• The fees for the Chairman are determined 
by the Committee.
• Fees are normally reviewed every two  
years but may be reviewed more or less 
frequently if it is considered appropriate.
• Fees are set taking into account the level  
of responsibility, relevant experience  
and specialist knowledge of each Non-
Executive Director and fees at other 
companies of a similar size and complexity.
• Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic 
fee for membership of the Board with 
additional fees being paid for the role  
of the Senior Independent Director or  
Chair of a Board committee, to take into 
account the additional responsibilities  
and workload required.
• If a Non-Executive Director is a Chair of 
more than one committee, the additional 
fee is capped at the higher committee fee.
• If a Non-Executive Director is also  
the Senior Independent Director, the 
additional fee is capped at the additional 
Senior Independent Director fee.
• Additional fees may also be paid for  
other Board responsibilities or roles  
if this is considered appropriate.
• Fees are normally paid in cash.
• Neither the Chairman nor any of the 
Non-Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate in any of the Group’s incentive 
arrangements.
• Non-Executive Directors do not currently 
receive any benefits. However, benefits may 
be provided in the future if, in the view of 
the Board (for Non-Executive Directors or 
the Committee for the Chairman), this is 
considered appropriate.
• Travel and other reasonable expenses 
(including fees incurred in obtaining 
professional advice in the furtherance  
of their duties) incurred in the course of 
performing their duties are reimbursed  
to Non-Executive Directors.
• The Company may settle any tax due on 
benefits or taxable expenses.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NEW HIRES
The Group is committed to ensuring appropriate succession plans are in place, specifically in respect of senior management and Executive Directors. 
When considering the remuneration package of a potential new Executive Director, the Committee would seek to apply the following principles:
• The Committee will ensure that the package is sufficient to attract the appropriate individual, having regard to the skills, experience and 
dedication required whilst ensuring that the interests of the Group and its shareholders are aligned, whilst being cognisant of not paying  
more than is necessary.
• The structure of the ongoing remuneration package would normally include the components set out in the Policy table for Executive Directors. 
However, the Committee has the discretion to include any other remuneration component or award as it considers appropriate, taking into 
account the specific commercial circumstances, subject to the limit on variable remuneration set out below. Where any additional element is 
included, the key terms and rationale for such component would be appropriately disclosed.
• Where an individual forfeits outstanding incentive payments and/or contractual rights at a previous employer as a result of their appointment 
at the Group, the Committee may offer compensatory payments or awards in such form as it considers appropriate.
• In doing so, it will take into account all relevant factors including the form of awards, expected value and vesting timeframe of forfeited 
opportunities. When determining such ‘buy-out’ arrangements, the Committee’s intention would be that awards would generally be on  
a ‘like for like’ basis as those forfeited.
• The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be awarded (excluding any compensatory payments or awards referred to above)  
in respect of recruitment is 350% of salary, in line with our proposed revised Policy for existing Executive Directors.
• Where an Executive Director is required to relocate from their home location to take up their role, the Committee may provide reasonable 
assistance with relocation (either via one-off or ongoing payments or benefits).
• In the event that an internal candidate is promoted to the Board, legacy terms and conditions will normally be honoured, including pension 
entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards.
• To facilitate any buy-out awards outlined above, in the event of recruitment, the Committee may grant awards to a new Executive Director 
relying on the exemption in the Listing Rules which allows for the grant of awards, to facilitate in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of  
an Executive Director, without seeking prior shareholder approval or under any other appropriate Company incentive plan.
The remuneration package for a newly appointed Non-Executive Director will normally be in line with the structure set out in the Non-Executive 
Directors’ Policy table above. 76 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE CONTRACTS AND POLICY ON PAYMENTS TO DIRECTORS LEAVING THE GROUP
When determining leaving arrangements for an Executive Director, the Committee takes into account any contractual agreements including the 
provisions of any incentive arrangements, typical market practice and the performance and conduct of the individual.
Notice period Executive Directors have service contracts with the Company which can be terminated on 11 months’ notice by the Company 
and on three months’ notice by the individual.
Patrick Coveney’s current contract was entered into on 31 March 2008 and Eoin Tonge’s current contract was entered into on 
3 October 2016.
Payment in  
lieu of notice
Salary and other emoluments in lieu of notice.
Annual bonus The Committee may determine that an Executive Director remains eligible to receive a bonus for the financial year in respect 
of which he ceased to be a Director. The Committee will determine the level of bonus taking into account performance.
Any unvested Deferred Share Awards will vest in full or to such lesser extent as is determined by the Committee if the individual 
dies or ceases employment as a result of ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, the sale or transfer of his employing 
entity out of the Group or if the Committee determines exceptional circumstances exist that warrant such treatment.
If the employee leaves in other circumstances, his or her unvested Deferred Share Awards lapse.
PSP If a participant dies his PSP award will vest to the extent determined by the Committee, taking into account the extent to 
which the performance conditions have been met and if the Committee so determines the period of time elapsed since grant.
If the participant ceases to be an officer or employee of the Group as a result of his ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, 
retirement or the sale of his employing entity out of the Group, or for any other reason at the Committee’s discretion, his award 
will vest on the original vesting date, or, if the Committee so determines, as soon as practicable after the date of cessation.  
The extent to which awards vest in these circumstances will be determined by the Committee, taking into account the extent  
to which the performance conditions have been satisfied, and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period of time 
from the date of grant up to the date of cessation.
If a Director leaves in other circumstances, his or her awards lapse.
The Executive Directors’ contracts are available for shareholders to view at the AGM and also from the Company Secretary upon request.
CHANGE OF CONTROL
In the event of a change of control of the Company, Executive Directors are entitled to terminate their employment with the Company with  
30 days’ prior notice at any time within six months after the change in control if the Executive Director has reasonable grounds to contend  
that the change in control has resulted, or will result, in the diminution of his/her powers, duties or functions in relation to the Group.
If the Executive Director’s contract is terminated in the event of the change of control, the Executive Director can seek a payment from the Company 
in settlement of all and any claims arising in those circumstances. The amount of the payment (subject to deduction of income tax) will be equal to  
the sum total of his or her basic salary, the bonus paid to the Executive Director in the calendar year immediately preceding such termination and  
any retained bonus approved but unpaid for the year immediately prior to the year in which the Executive Director’s contract was terminated. These 
provisions reflect Irish employment law.
If the Company undergoes a change of control, PSP awards vest to the extent determined by the Committee. The extent to which awards vest in 
these circumstances will be determined by the Committee taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been met 
and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period of time between grant and the relevant event. Alternatively, the Committee may 
require that PSP awards are rolled over for equivalent awards in a different company.
Deferred Share Awards will vest in full in the event of a change of control or winding up of the Company.
In the event of a merger, demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which may in the opinion of the Committee affect the current or 
future value of the Company’s shares, the Committee may allow Deferred Share and PSP awards to vest on the same basis as set out above.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
The Non-Executive Directors have Letters of Appointment, the terms of which recognise that their appointments are subject to the Company’s 
Articles of Association and their services are at the direction of the shareholders.
All Non-Executive Directors submit themselves for election at the AGM following their appointment, and in line with the Company’s Articles of 
Association and Provision B.7.1. of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), each Director retires at each subsequent AGM and offers him 
or herself for re-election as appropriate. 78 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

CONSIDERATION OF WIDER EMPLOYEE VIEWS
The Committee generally considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining pay for Executive Directors.
When assessing any increases to base salary, the Committee reviews overall levels of base pay increases offered to other employees in the Group.
The Committee does not consider it appropriate to consult directly with employees regarding Executive Directors’ remuneration. However, employees 
are encouraged to become shareholders under the Company’s ShareSave Scheme and once an employee becomes a shareholder, he or she can vote 
on resolutions in respect of Directors’ remuneration along with any other resolutions put before the AGM.
CONSULTING WITH OUR SHAREHOLDERS
The Committee is dedicated to ensuring open dialogue with shareholders in relation to remuneration. In advance of any proposal to amend the 
Policy, the Committee, led by the Committee Chair, will liaise with key shareholders and proxy advisory firms to discuss the proposed amendments 
and receive their feedback. 79 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 
The following section sets out our Annual Report on Remuneration, which outlines decisions made by the Committee in relation to Directors’ 
remuneration in respect of FY17 and how the Committee intends to apply the remuneration Policy for FY18. The Annual Report on Remuneration 
will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM to be held on 30 January 2018. Where information has been audited by KPMG, this has 
been stated. All other information in this report is unaudited.
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee currently consists of three Non-Executive Directors whose collective role is to ensure that the Group’s remuneration 
arrangements are aligned with the Group’s strategy and vision. The Terms of Reference of the Committee include the determination of the 
remuneration packages for Executive Directors, the Group Company Secretary and other members of the senior management team. The 
Committee also makes recommendations to the Board Chairman and the Executive Directors in relation to the Non-Executive Directors’ fees.
The Terms of Reference for the Committee are updated as appropriate and are available under the Corporate Governance section of the Group’s 
website, www.greencore.com.
MEMBERS
The Committee currently comprises the following Non-Executive Directors:
Name Remuneration Committee position
HA McSharry Chair (appointed to Committee on 28 January 2014; Chair from 31 January 2017)
PG Kennedy Member (appointed to Committee on 11 March 2010)
JJ Moloney Member (appointed to Committee on 31 January 2017)
Mr EL Nicoli stepped down from the Committee on 31 January 2017. The biographical details for each of the Committee members are set out on 
pages 50 and 51.
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer attend meetings on 
an ad-hoc basis at the invitation of the Committee and provide information and support as requested. However, neither Executive Director is present 
when his own remuneration is being discussed.
ADVISORS
The Committee reviewed its advisors during FY16, and following a robust selection process, appointed Mercer Kepler, on 1 September 2016. Mercer 
Kepler attends Committee meetings on an ad-hoc basis and provides advice on remuneration for executives, benchmarking analysis, and updates on 
market developments and best practice. Mercer Kepler is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its code of 
conduct. The wider Mercer Group additionally provided the Group with pension actuarial services during FY17 .
The Committee is satisfied that Mercer Kepler provides independent and objective remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have any 
connections with Greencore which may impair its independence. The fees paid to Mercer Kepler in respect of work carried out for the Committee 
in the year under review amounted to £68,805.
KEY ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEAR
During FY17, the Committee held three scheduled meetings. Details of the attendances at these meetings are set out on page 59. The Committee 
held eight additional meetings to cover the significant amount of work undertaken by the Committee during the year. The key activities and 
matters discussed at these meetings included:
• Review and approval of the FY16 Report on Directors’ Remuneration;
• Review of changes to legislative, regulatory and corporate governance environment, and consideration of trends in executive remuneration;
• Review of the remuneration structure; 
• Review and approval of performance and payout in respect of FY16 annual bonus and FY14 PSP awards;
• Shareholder engagement, both prior to and following the 2017 AGM;
• Review of feedback received after the 2017 AGM and consideration of the Committee’s response;
• Approval of opportunities/award levels and performance targets for FY17 annual bonus and PSP awards;
• Approval of award levels and performance targets, including TSR peer group, for FY18 PSP awards;
• Review of the Non-Executive Board Chairman fee;
• Irish and UK Share Save Scheme;
• Review of the Committee’s Terms of Reference;
• Review of approach to remuneration and design of key principles; and
• Review of Committee effectiveness.
In discussing the above matters, the Committee considered the remuneration policies throughout the Group. 80 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

Shareholder engagement during FY17
Prior to the 2017 AGM Post 2017 AGM Augus t 	 20 1 7 	 – 	 Oc tob er 	 20 1 7 Overall engagement process
Before proposing the changes to 
the Policy in FY16 and in the lead  
up to the 2017 AGM, we focused  
on communicating the rationale  
for the increase in award levels 
under the PSP . Shareholders  
at that time were supportive  
of the change. 
Feedback was captured from 
shareholders who registered a 
negative vote against the increase  
in award levels under the PSP .
Shareholders also registered 
concerns about certain other 
aspects of our approach to 
remuneration, including:
• the use of ROIC and EPS  
under both the short-term  
and long-term incentive 
arrangements; 
• the absence of recovery 
provision under the annual 
bonus plan;
• the quality of disclosure  
around the personal targets 
under the annual bonus plan; and,
• the level of shareholding 
guidelines for the CFO.
The Committee then conducted  
a round of shareholder consultation 
in 2017. The purpose of these 
engagement meetings was to 
further develop the Board’s 
understanding of shareholder  
views on our approach to 
remuneration, to discuss the  
steps taken by the Committee  
to address the concerns of 
shareholders and consult on the 
proposed changes to the approach 
to remuneration for FY18. 
These engagements were  
incredibly helpful to understand  
our shareholders’ points of  
view. The conversations helped  
the Committee to finalise the  
alterations we have made to the 
remuneration arrangements.
Shareholders’ reasons for opposing the Policy primarily related to the increased award opportunity under the PSP , and the FY17 targets. The 
Committee consulted shareholders on this change in September 2016, receiving broad support at that time. However, the composition of our 
shareholder base changed significantly following the rights issue in December 2016, shortly before the 2017 AGM, and the level of support 
received at the 2017 AGM was impacted by this shift.
Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
continued 81 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
The Committee continues to believe that the revisions to Policy are appropriate and fair, and ultimately in the best interest of shareholders. 
Further explanations of the changes are set out in the Chair’s Letter on pages 63 to 66. During the year, the Committee undertook a consultation 
and made a number of changes aligned with best practice to remuneration for FY18 and future years, in response to feedback. Clawback has been 
introduced on incentive cycles for FY18 onwards, and malus provisions have been extended to apply to deferred bonus awards as well as the PSP . 
We have also strengthened our shareholding guidelines to 2x salary for all Executive Directors and diversified the performance measures under 
the PSP .
Change Shareholder consultation
Performance measures Shareholders were generally supportive of the addition of a TSR measure. In response to feedback on TSR, 
the Committee will also have a discretionary underpin. That underpin will take into account overall business 
performance, and will include an assessment of cash flow performance and shareholder experience over the 
performance period.
A number of shareholders were particularly interested in the construction of the proposed peer group  
to confirm their relevance as a comparator for relative TSR performance. After considering feedback from 
shareholders and proxy advisors, we engaged with shareholders again to communicate the finalised  
peer group. The peer group is disclosed on pages 65 and 89. 
Separately, certain shareholders sought confirmation of the merits of ROIC and EPS as the key performance 
measures for the business and enquired about including cash flow metrics under the incentive arrangements. 
As detailed in the Strategic Report (pages 20 and 21), ROIC and EPS are the key measures for our business 
model and strategic development; we include an evaluation of cash flow performance in the personal/
strategic element of the annual bonus plan. 
Recovery provisions Shareholders considered the extension of malus provisions to be a positive step. Certain shareholders queried 
why the revised recovery provisions did not include clawback on the cash element of bonuses. Subsequent to 
the consultation and following further legal clarification, the Committee introduced clawback to the annual 
bonus and long-term awards. 
Shareholding guideline The vast majority of shareholders supported the increased shareholding guideline. A small number of 
shareholders queried whether those guidelines will apply after the departure of an executive. Currently,  
there is no expectation or requirement for executives to hold shares after their departure. In line with evolving 
best-practice, the Committee will keep under review the size and extent of the shareholding guidelines. 
The Committee is committed to meaningful engagement with our shareholders as part of our approach to strong governance, and continues  
to welcome comments from shareholders. 82 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

NOTES TO THE TABLE (AUDITED) 
BASE SALARY
The Committee reviewed Executive Directors’ salaries in FY17 and awarded an increase of 2% for the year to Patrick Coveney. Therefore Patrick’s 
salary for FY17, effective from 1 October 2016, was €803,637. Eoin Tonge was appointed on 3 October 2016 on a salary of £400,000. Alan Williams 
did not receive a salary increase in FY17 as he had resigned.
ANNUAL BONUS
The maximum bonus opportunity for FY17 was 150% of salary for both Executive Directors. Performance against targets for annual bonus payment 
is subject to personal and strategic objectives (25% of total) as well as the achievement of demanding short-term financial targets (making up 75% 
of the total potential bonus). The bonus was based 75% on financial measures (EPS and ROIC), and 25% on personal performance against strategic 
goals. The annual bonus measures reflect the Committee’s aim of providing an appropriate balance between incentivising the achievement of key 
financial targets and specific strategic and operational objectives. Performance targets and actual outturn for the financial element are provided in 
the table below.

In coming to its decision the Committee considered a range of adjustments to the FY17 outturn, including the material impact of the Peacock 
Foods acquisition on financial performance for the year, which would have merited a level of financial payout, particularly around ROIC targets. 
However, the Committee took a view that in light of the significant levels of exceptional items this year and the Company’s TSR performance, no 
bonus would be payable for Group financial performance. 
Although trading performance was below expectations, and resulted in no payouts under the EPS and ROIC measures, significant progress was 
made in respect of challenging strategic and personal objectives. 
The strategic and personal objectives are set out on page 84 and include a significant focus on the Executive Directors’ role in promoting strong 
relations with our key stakeholders and embedding and evolving our corporate culture. The Committee also acknowledged the significant  
work undertaken by the Executive Directors throughout the year in respect of the delivery and integration of Peacock Foods. In reaching the 
payout outcome for FY17, the Committee also took into account that the calculation of EPS and ROIC had excluded any contribution relating  
to Peacock Foods.
In terms of personal performance, both Patrick Coveney and Eoin Tonge have had a strong year, delivering considerable progress against key 
strategic objectives for the Group. In this context, the Committee decided that both Patrick Coveney and Eoin Tonge should receive 22% out of 
25% of the total personal element of their respective bonuses. However, given the overall business context, the Committee determined that for 
FY17, notwithstanding the Company’s bonus deferral policy, 100% (rather than 50%) of bonuses earned would be deferred in shares for three 
years, subject to continued employment, for additional shareholder alignment. 84 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

Patrick Coveney Delivery of
Peacock Foods 
acquisition 
In line with the strategic vision for the Group, Patrick successfully delivered the 
acquisition and integration of Peacock Foods in the US, the largest acquisition ever 
by Greencore. He led the process from the identification of Peacock Foods as a 
potential target through the negotiations, fundraising and deal completion. Since 
the acquisition, the new business has been fully integrated and is performing well.
Business and  
customer  
development 
Building and maintaining excellent relationships with our customers is central 
to our ability to create sustainable value. In FY17, Patrick played a pivotal  
role in delivering extensions to a number of contracts with our leading core 
customers. As a result, the business now has multi-year contracts with our 
longest and most important customers in both the US and the UK. 
Embedding The 
Greencore Way 
The Greencore Way was developed to ensure our values would become a strong 
driving force for overall Greencore performance. During FY17 Patrick dedicated 
significant time to focus on two of the key features of The Greencore Way; Cost 
Efficiency and overall Business Effectiveness. The outcome of the major review  
is a restructure and reorganisation of the UK business which is being fully 
implemented in 2018. Led by Patrick, the strength of our culture continues to grow 
and the Committee also took particular account of strong growth in our employee 
engagement survey and key health and safety measurements being met. 
Talent leadership Succession planning is a key element of long-term planning and risk mitigation, 
particularly as our business continues to grow. Following the appointment of 
Eoin Tonge as CFO and Peter Haden as COO during FY17 from the existing 
management teams, Patrick has continued to drive the talent development 
process to build a pipeline of future leadership succession candidates. 
The Committee reviewed the annual bonus outcome in late 2017 and concluded that Patrick Coveney contributed significantly to the Company’s 
performance with strong progress against the objectives outlined above. An award of 22/25 was made reflecting the achievement against the 
strategic and personal objectives. 
Eoin Tonge Financial targets  
and cash flow 
Eoin has focused on driving initiatives aimed at reducing capital spend and 
focusing on generating sustainable cash flows for the business. For the year 
under review, Operating Cash Flow increased by £3.9m driven by increased 
Adjusted EBITDA. 
Delivery of Peacock 
Foods acquisition  
and integration 
Within three months of his appointment, together with Patrick, Eoin also  
played a key role in the completion of the Peacock Foods acquisition and  
the associated rights issue and capital financing. He has been instrumental  
in integrating the Group’s financial and operational model into the new 
component of the Group’s US division which has provided a growth platform  
of real scale for the Group. The integration of Peacock Foods has progressed 
well and Eoin has played a pivotal role in cost synergies being above 
expectation in FY17.
Talent management Since becoming CFO, Eoin completed a comprehensive review of the finance 
and operations team and reshaped its structure with a focus on centralisation 
and performance optimisation, this is currently being implemented. He has 
updated development plans for the finance and operations functions to ensure 
appropriate structures, resources and succession plans are in place.
The Committee reviewed the annual bonus outcome in late 2017 and concluded that Eoin Tonge contributed significantly to the Company’s 
performance with strong progress against the objectives outlined above. An award of 22/25 was made reflecting the achievement against the 
strategic and personal objectives.

After a review of financial performance and in order to promote further alignment with shareholder interests, the Committee determined that  
the entirety (rather than only 50%) of bonuses for FY17 will be awarded in shares, deferred for three years subject to continued employment.  
As such, no cash bonus awards have been made for the financial period. The Committee believes that this approach appropriately recognises 
each Executive Director’s performance against the non-financial targets set at the start of the year, while ensuring greater shareholder alignment 
over the longer-term.
The resulting bonus outcomes for Patrick Coveney and Eoin Tonge are therefore as set out below:

The Committee considered that these levels of bonus are appropriate in light of the Group’s development, taking into account the strategic, 
organisational and economic progress made during the financial year. Mr Alan Williams did not receive a bonus in respect of FY17 as he had resigned.

The vesting of the awards is also subject to a discretionary performance underpin, which takes into consideration a number of factors including 
Company TSR and cash flow performance over the period. The Committee considered these factors along with the underlying performance of the 
business, and determined that the formulaic level of vesting was appropriate. Awards will therefore vest in December 2017 , subject to continued 
employment on the vesting date.
Alan Williams’ FY15 PSP award lapsed in full on his resignation.
PENSION
Patrick Coveney received a taxable non-pensionable cash allowance equivalent to 35% of his pensionable earnings in lieu of participation in a 
Defined Contribution pension scheme. Eoin Tonge participates in the Greencore UK Master Trust Pension Scheme which is a Defined Contribution 
Pension Scheme and receives a taxable non-pensionable cash allowance equivalent to 25% of his pensionable earnings.
Patrick Coveney is also a deferred member of the Group’s Irish Defined Benefit Pension Scheme which closed to future accrual with effect from 
31 December 2009. The value of the frozen scheme benefits for the Chief Executive Officer was £50,436 as at 29 September 2017. His normal 
retirement age under the scheme is 60 and he will not be entitled to any augmentation of benefit in the event that he retires early.

the formulaic vesting outcome and underlying performance.
The awards will vest three years from the grant date, subject to meeting the performance conditions and continued employment. Malus provisions 
apply to the FY17 PSP awards prior to vesting. The Company introduced a mandatory two-year holding period for vested PSP awards made to

The Committee reviewed Executive Directors’ salaries in FY18 and agreed to award an increase of 2.5% for the year to both Patrick Coveney and

PENSION AND BENEFITS
Patrick Coveney and Eoin Tonge will receive pension and benefits as set out in the remuneration Policy table. Provisions remain unchanged from FY17.
ANNUAL BONUS
The performance measures and bonus opportunity for the FY18 remain unchanged from FY17 . The maximum opportunity will be 150% of salary. 
Half of any bonus earned will be deferred in shares, vesting after three years subject to continued employment. As set out in the Chair’s Letter, both 
the cash bonus and deferred bonus awards will be subject to malus and clawback provisions from FY18.
As in previous years, bonus will be based on Group financial targets (75% of maximum bonus) and on personal and strategic goals (25% of 
maximum). The financial targets are adjusted EPS (50%) and ROIC (25%). Personal and strategic goals are set in relation to each Executive 
Director’s responsibilities and are aligned with the Company’s short and medium term strategic priorities but include a long-term focus.
As in previous years, the targets for FY18 will be set with reference to budget as well as broker forecasts and other external considerations,  
and the Committee considers its approach to target-setting to be robust. If maximum performance targets are achieved, the Committee 
considers that this would represent exceptional performance and add significant value for shareholders. Performance targets are considered  
by the Committee to be commercially sensitive and have therefore not been disclosed on a prospective basis. Full retrospective disclosure  
of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s report.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE
For FY18, Patrick Coveney and Eoin Tonge will receive awards under the PSP of 200% and 150% of salary, respectively, in December 2017.
The performance measures will be based on EPS and ROIC performance targets, and a new relative TSR measure, assessed over the period  
FY17 to FY20. The performance conditions are as follows:

Report on Directors’ Remuneration

The Committee carefully weighted feedback, consensus forecasts and internal modeling of expected performance in relation to the  
performance targets.
Area D e t ail
Shareholder feedback As part of the consultation outlined previously, we wrote to shareholders with the proposed ranges for the FY18 
awards. In meeting with investors, both fund managers and governance and stewardship teams were largely 
supportive of the revision to the targets; and recognised that ROIC of 13% in 2020 is a truly stretching target.
Consensus forecast The Committee also reviewed the performance ranges against consensus forecasts available at the time. 
Based on those consensus estimates, we are confident that the revised ranges are both stretching in the 
context of our anticipated business performance and analyst expectations.
Internal modelling The Committee was provided with detailed assessments of the expected performance of the business. These 
steps were taken to ensure that the revised targets reflect the expected future performance for Greencore’s 
enlarged business. Similarly, the Committee reviewed the growth in invested capital of our business, which 
has increased from an average of £651.3 million in 2015 to £1,060.9 million in 2017.
The Committee continues to believe that EPS and ROIC are key drivers for growth and returns in the business. TSR has been introduced to further 
enhance shareholder alignment. The Committee has a robust approach to target-setting, taking into account internal and external forecasts,  
as well as market practice for similar-sized companies, and the need to set targets that are stretching yet achievable.
For the FY18 award, the bespoke TSR peer group comprises the following companies: A.G. Barr plc, Aryzta AG, Britvic plc, Cranswick plc, Dairy 
Crest Group plc, Glanbia plc, Greenyard Holdings, Greggs plc, Hain Celestial Group, Hilton Food Group plc, Kerry Group, Pinnacle Foods, Inc., 
Post Holdings, Inc., Premium Brands Holdings Corporation, SSP Group plc, Total Produce plc and TreeHouse Foods. In addition, in adjudicating 
the vesting outcome for the TSR element, the Committee will take into account overall business performance, including an assessment of cash 
flow performance and shareholder experience. 
As in previous years, the Committee will consider the underlying financial performance of the business as well as the value added to shareholders 
in adjudicating the final overall PSP vesting level. 
The awards will vest three years from the grant date, subject to meeting the performance conditions and continued employment. Malus and 
clawback provisions apply to the FY18 PSP awards both prior to vesting and for a period of two years post-vesting. A mandatory two year holding 
period for vested PSP awards applies; vested awards may not be sold during the holding period except to cover tax liabilities.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES FOR FY18
Non-Executive Director fees are determined by the Board within the limit approved by shareholders in the Articles of Association, with the 
exception of the Chairman of the Board, whose remuneration is determined by the Committee.
The Board reviewed its Non-Executive Director fees in FY17, the previous review being in January 2014, in the context of practice at companies of 
a similar size and complexity. Following this review, the fee structure was revised to, reflect the increased size and scale of the business, the time 
commitment, skills and experience required of a Non-Executive Director at Greencore. The new fees became effective from 1 October 2016.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Report of the Audit Committee
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
The purpose of this report is to provide an insight into the workings of the Committee over the past year. I would like to take this opportunity  
to thank the members of the Committee for their work during the year under review, which has been very busy including the acquisition of 
Peacock Foods, the consequential major changes to our segmental reporting analysis and the tendering of our external audit. The report includes 
an overview of these matters as well as the other principal matters which the Committee has assessed during the year, with the aim of providing  
an understanding of its essential role in protecting the interests of our shareholders through ensuring the integrity of the Company’s published 
financial information and the effectiveness of the risk management process. 
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The role, authority, responsibilities and scope of the Committee are set out in its Terms of Reference which are available under the Corporate 
Governance section of our website, www.greencore.com. The Terms of Reference, are reviewed on an annual basis and were amended in 
September 2017. 
MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee currently consists of three Non-Executive Directors: Ms SG Bailey, Ms HA McSharry and myself, each considered by the Board  
to be independent. Further details of the Committee members’ experience and qualifications can be found in their biographical details as set  
out on pages 50 and 51. The varied backgrounds of the Committee members and their broad experience and expertise from a wide variety  
of industries and knowledge of the Company allows them to fulfil the Committee’s remit and to oversee the Company’s external auditor 
effectively. The Board has determined that I have recent and relevant financial experience as required under Provision C.3.1. of the 2016  
UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘2016 Code’).
Collectively the Committee is independent, financially literate and has a knowledge and understanding of the following key areas:
• Financial reporting principles and accounting standards;
• The regulatory framework within which the Group operates;
• The Group’s internal control and risk management environment; and
• Factors impacting the Group’s Financial Statements.
Following a review the Committee, as a collective, is competent in the manufacturing sector.
In accordance with the Committee’s Terms of Reference, the Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
In line with Principle C.3 of the 2016 Code and its associated provisions, the Board ensures that there are formal and transparent arrangements in 
place for considering how corporate reporting is applied, along with monitoring risk management and internal control principles and maintaining 
a suitable relationship with the external auditor. Following a recent review of the Committee’s compliance with the 2016 Code, the Committee  
has determined that it meets the requirement of Principle C.3 and its associated provisions, along with the remainder of the 2016 Code provisions 
and associated principles within its remit.
The Committee meets at least three times in the financial year and attendance at those meetings is shown on page 59 of the Corporate Governance 
Report. The meetings of the Committee are scheduled to take place in advance of Board meetings. This affords me, as Chair of the Committee, 
the opportunity to keep the Board apprised of the key items discussed at Committee meetings. The Board also receive copies of the minutes of 
the Committee meetings. 
On behalf of the Audit Committee (the ‘Committee’) 
and the Board, it is my pleasure to present the  
Report of the Committee for the year ended  
29 September 2017 . 
JOHN WARREN
27 November 2017 95 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
Meetings of the Committee are attended by the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Group Finance Director, Head of Risk Management 
and Head of Legal and Compliance, together with any other individuals the Committee deems appropriate upon invitation. Representatives of the 
external auditor also attend Committee meetings upon invitation. Given his knowledge of the Peacock Foods business, Non-Executive Director 
Mr TH Sampson also attends the meetings. In addition, other individuals from within the Group will attend a Committee meeting at least annually 
and provide the Committee with an update on certain key areas of the business, such as health and safety, food safety, environmental, insurance 
and IT.
In my capacity as Chair of the Committee, I am available to all Board members to discuss any issues they may have, either on a collective or 
individual basis. I meet with the external auditor and the Head of Risk Management absent management on an annual basis in order to discuss any 
issues which may have arisen during the year under review. In addition, the Head of Risk Management, whose appointment or removal is subject 
to Committee approval, has direct access to both the Board Chairman and myself.
HOW THE COMMITTEE HAS DISCHARGED ITS RESPONSIBILITIES IN FY17
KEY AREAS OF FOCUS
The work of the Committee in FY17 principally fell under the key areas which are summarised below: 
Key areas of focus for FY17 
PEACOCK FOODS 
ACQUISITION
The acquisition of Peacock Foods was completed during the year. Given the complexity of the acquisition in terms of the 
geographical spread and scale, valuation, taxation and accounting expertise was relied on from various professional 
service providers who assisted with the acquisition activity. 
The valuation of assets and liabilities was performed by independent experts and the Committee has taken comfort from 
this work. Details of the significant judgements made are set out on page 96. The Committee considered the various 
accounting elements of the transaction to ensure that the Financial Statements represent a true and fair view. Committee 
members also received detailed briefings from senior management and expert service providers on the acquisition as 
part of additional Committee and Board meetings.
SEGMENTAL 
REPORTING 
Following the acquisition of Peacock Foods, the Committee performed a review of the reporting segments applied by the 
Group and whether they would remain appropriate given the size and structure of the Group post acquisition, taking into 
account the requirements of the relevant accounting standard.
As a result, the Group adopted two separate reporting segments: 
1. Convenience Foods UK & Ireland: incorporating Food to Go (i.e. sandwich, sushi and salad activities) and the other parts 
of the Convenience Foods UK & Ireland division which comprise the ready meals, chilled soups and sauces, cooking 
sauces, quiche, Yorkshire Pudding and cakes and desserts businesses as well the Irish ingredient trading businesses.
2. Convenience Foods US: comprising the total combined US business including the acquired Peacock Foods business, 
manufacturing convenience food products for many of the largest food brands, convenience retail and food service 
leaders in the US. Convenience Foods US produces a wide range of fresh, frozen and ambient products including 
sandwiches, meal kits and salad kits. 
EARNINGS  
PER SHARE 
RESTATEMENT
During December 2016, Greencore completed a rights issue to partially fund the acquisition of Peacock Foods. Following 
the completion of the rights issue, the Group was required to restate historic earnings per share to reflect the bonus 
element of the rights issue. 
The Committee reviewed the methodology behind the restatement and was satisfied that the adjustments were properly 
calculated and applied. The weighted average number of shares for both the half-year ended 25 March 2016 and the 
full-year ended 30 September 2016 were restated to incorporate the bonus share element of the rights issue. In addition, 
Basic Earnings per Share, Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share, Diluted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Diluted Earnings 
per Share were also restated to reflect the revised weighted average number of shares in issue.
DIVIDEND  
PER SHARE 
RESTATEMENT
Following the completion of the rights issue during December 2016, the Group restated its historic dividend per share, to 
reflect the bonus element of the rights issue, for the interim, final and total dividend for the year ended 30 September 2016  
for comparative purposes. Again, the Committee was satisfied as to the correctness and appropriateness of the adjustments.
RISK MANAGEMENT 
AND INTERNAL 
CONTROLS
The Committee continued to monitor the progress of the risk management framework, further details are set out on 
pages 61 and 62.  96 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Report of the Audit Committee  
continued
Key areas of focus for FY17 
EXTERNAL AUDIT The Committee monitored the activities undertaken by the external auditor to ensure both an effective audit  
and auditor independence. In September 2017, the Committee met with KPMG to discuss the FY17 audit plan. 
The Committee reviewed the half-year results statement, full-year results statement and the FY17 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements with the auditor for recommendation to the Board. Further detail in relation to the external audit  
is set out on page 98. The critical accounting policies and judgements which applied are outlined below.
AUDIT TENDERING 
AND APPOINTMENT
Following the transposition of the EU Statutory Audit Directive and EU Statutory Audits Regulation into Irish law on 17 June 
2016 (the ‘2016 Regulations’), the Group is subject to mandatory rotation of the statutory auditor after a 10 year period.
The last external audit tender was conducted in 2008 when KPMG were appointed statutory auditor to the Group.  
Under the 2016 Regulations, their tenure would expire following the FY17 audit. However, given the management focus on 
the operational and financial integration of the acquisitions completed in 2016, in particular the acquisition in December 
2016 of Peacock Foods, together with the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer in October 2016, the Committee  
believed that it would be in the best interests of the Group to seek to extend the current tenure of KPMG. Consequently,  
the Committee secured a one-year extension to the mandatory rotation of KPMG’s tenure from the Irish Auditing and 
Accounting Supervisory Authority. Therefore KPMG’s tenure as the Group’s statutory auditor will conclude at the end  
of the FY18 audit. 
As a result, and having received confirmation of their willingness to continue in office, the Committee recommended to the 
Board that KPMG continue in office for FY18. The Committee believes that it is vital that shareholders are provided with the 
opportunity to highlight any issues or concerns in relation to the appointment of the external auditor and as in prior years, 
their continuance in office for FY18 will be subject to a non-binding advisory vote at the 2018 AGM.
The Committee undertook a tender process during FY17 to ensure that the new auditor would have sufficient time for an 
orderly transition in advance of their official appointment which will take effect from the beginning of FY19. Details of the 
tendering process is set out on pages 98 and 99. 
Following a comprehensive selection process, the Committee recommended Deloitte to the Board as the Group’s new 
external auditor. Upon approval by the Board, and subject to the approval by shareholders, Deloitte’s proposed tenure 
will take effect at the commencement of FY19.
MONITORING THE INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS
• We reviewed the appropriateness of Group accounting principles, practices and policies and monitored changes to, and compliance with, 
accounting standards on an ongoing basis;
• We reviewed the half-year and full-year results statements for FY17, having discussed them with the external auditor and compared  
the results to management accounts and budgets, focusing on key areas of judgement before recommending to the Board their release; and
• We reviewed, prior to making recommendations to the Board, the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 29 September 2017 .
In undertaking this review we discussed with management and the external auditor the critical accounting policies and judgements that had been 
applied. These were:
EXCEPTIONAL  
ITEMS
Exceptional items are items which have been disclosed separately due to their amount or nature, the purpose of which is  
to assist the user in understanding underlying performance. Group management exercises judgement in assessing each 
exceptional item and analysing whether the treatment of exceptional items is consistent with accounting policies and practice. 
During the year, the Group had exceptional costs of £78.2m largely due to impairment, acquisition transaction costs, 
restructuring and integration costs. During the audit, KPMG reviewed the treatment of exceptional items and discussed the 
application of the accounting policy and the related disclosures with management. Following discussions, the Committee was 
satisfied that the identification of items as exceptional items was applied on a consistent basis and the accounting policy and 
disclosures were in line with previous practice.
ACCOUNTING FOR 
PEACOCK FOODS 
ACQUISITION
Given the significant scale of the acquisition of Peacock Foods the Committee considered with management and  
external professional service providers the judgements and estimates used by management in the fair value accounting 
of the acquisition. The Committee took assurance from the independent work undertaken by EY in assessing the fair 
value of acquisition related intangible assets and Deloitte who provided taxation advice throughout the transaction.  
The Committee also relied on the judgement, made by external property experts on the fair value of property, plant and 
equipment. In addition, KPMG also reported to the Committee on the appropriateness of valuations and judgements 
made in the fair value accounting and on the completeness of relevant disclosures in the Group Financial Statements to 
ensure statutory reporting requirements are met. Given the size of the transaction, KPMG undertook a full scope audit of 
the acquisition balance sheet at 30 December 2016. Taking all these inputs into account, the Committee has concluded 
that the fair value of the opening balance sheet has been appropriately stated in the Financial Statements.
HOW THE COMMITTEE HAS DISCHARGED ITS RESPONSIBILITIES IN FY17 CONTINUED 97 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
GOODWILL The Group had goodwill of £797.1m as at 29 September 2017 and as set out in Note 13 to the Group Financial Statements. 
As part of its audit, KPMG assessed the Group’s impairment model for each Cash Generating Unit and performed analysis 
on the assumptions which had been used by the Group in the impairment model. Following a detailed review and discussions 
with KPMG, the Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used were appropriate. As there was sufficient headroom, 
the Committee was satisfied that no impairment was required.
POST RETIREMENT 
BENEFITS
As set out in Note 24 to the Group Financial Statements, the Group operates a number of legacy defined benefit pension 
schemes, all of which are closed to future accrual and some of which have significant deficits. The defined benefit pension 
schemes are sensitive to any change in actuarial assumptions, whereby a modest change to an actuarial assumption may 
have a material impact on the reported balance. As part of its audit, KPMG evaluated and reviewed the assumptions and 
methodologies used by the actuarial advisors to the Group and made an assessment as to whether the assumptions 
made were appropriate and not materially different from external benchmarks. KPMG discussed the assumptions  
used and models by which the defined benefit pension schemes had been accounted for with management and the 
Committee, following on from which, the Committee were satisfied with the assumptions used and the methods by  
which the defined benefit pension schemes have been accounted for.
TAXATION Significant judgement is exercised by management and the Group’s tax advisor, Deloitte, in determining the amounts  
to be provided for both current and deferred tax. The final tax determination of certain transactions is often uncertain  
and may not be known for some time in the future. KPMG, during their audit, reviewed the Group’s tax positions, using 
international and local tax specialists to analyse and challenge assumptions used to determine tax provisions. Following 
on from such reviews and analysis, KPMG discussed the judgements and tax disclosures made with the Committee.  
The Committee is satisfied that the judgements made were prudent and appropriate and that the correct accounting 
treatment had been adopted. Further detail in relation to taxation is set out in Note 10 to the Group Financial Statements.
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE ASSESSMENT
Under Provision C.3.4. of the 2016 Code, the Audit Committee, upon request from its Board, should “provide advice on whether the annual report 
and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
company’s position and performance, business model and strategy.”
The Board has tasked the Committee with this role, which is incorporated into the Committee’s Terms of Reference.
In advance of providing such a confirmation to the Board, the Committee considered the adequacy of the systems and internal controls, the 
consistency of the various elements of the reports (taking into account reports received by the Board during the year), the level of information 
provided, the narrative reporting and the language used. 
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
Whilst it is the Board which is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, the Committee assists the Board in meeting its obligations  
in this regard. The Group’s internal control framework is set out on pages 61 and 62.
At least twice in the financial year, the Committee formally meets with the Head of Risk Management who provides the Committee with reports  
on the Risk Management Group’s key findings from business process and control reviews and management’s response to same.
In May 2017, the Head of Risk Management provided the Committee with an update on progress against the FY17 Risk Management Plan which 
had been approved by the Committee in September 2016. A presentation on the reports completed to date, including a number of reviews and 
actions covering Peacock Foods and cyber security, together with updates on the risk management charter, were also provided to the meeting. 
In September 2017, the Committee reviewed the Risk Management Plan for FY18 which sets out the planned activities, including staffing and 
resources, for the Risk Management Group for the year ahead driven by the maturity of the business and perceived risk level. The Committee also 
received and reviewed the final comprehensive report on the activities of the Risk Management Group for FY17. The report included detailed 
information in relation to how the Risk Management Group had delivered against the FY17 plan, a summary of its risk assessment process for  
the year under review, its key findings and comprehensive information in relation to each of the risk management reports which had been issued  
since the previous report. The Committee also undertook a review of the Risk Management Group’s mission and objectives along with its internal 
audit charter in order to assess how effectively it had performed during the year. Following the review, the Committee was satisfied that Risk 
Management Group had performed well against its mission and objectives. Furthermore, the deployment of its formalised audit approach had 
ensured appropriate escalation and accountability processes remained in place.
In light of the above, the Committee continues to be satisfied that the Group control environment remains appropriate.
In May and September, the Committee also noted reports from the Head of Risk Management in relation to good faith reporting (‘whistleblowing’). 
Under the Group’s whistleblowing policy, arrangements are in place for individuals to raise any issue, in confidence, relating to accounting, risk 
issues, auditing issues or any other impropriety or area of concern. The whistleblowing reports included information on the nature of issues 
reported, an analysis of the issues raised by location, category and type along with the outcome of the investigations into the allegations. 98 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

HOW THE COMMITTEE HAS DISCHARGED ITS RESPONSIBILITIES IN FY17 CONTINUED
EXTERNAL AUDIT 
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, is responsible for monitoring the performance, objectivity and independence of the external auditor. It is 
the Committee’s view that effective oversight of the activities undertaken by the external auditor assists in ensuring both an effective audit and 
audit independence. Part of this is to ensure that open, direct and honest communication exists between the Committee, the external auditor and 
the senior management team. In order to assist the Committee in evaluating the external audit process and to ensure continuous improvement, 
following the completion of the audit, on an annual basis each Committee member and the management team complete a questionnaire on  
the effectiveness of the external auditor and the external audit process generally. The assessment of the FY16 audit highlighted a number of 
strengths, in particular, the auditor’s strong resource commitment during the Peacock Foods transaction, as well as their understanding of the 
Group’s industry, business and risks facing the Group. During the year, KPMG performed additional analytics to support the output of their work 
providing useful insights which were welcomed by the Committee. Overall the Committee was satisfied with the high level of services provided by 
KPMG to Greencore throughout the year. 
In advance of the commencement of the annual audit in FY17, the Committee reviewed a letter provided by the external auditor confirming their 
independence within the meaning of the regulations and professional standards.
In September 2017, the Committee met with the external auditor to agree the FY17 audit plan. To ensure a quality audit, the external auditor needs 
to be aware of the business risks, therefore the Committee discussed and agreed the key business, financial statement and audit risks with the 
external auditor to ensure that the audit was appropriately directed. In addition, the external auditor’s Letter of Engagement was reviewed  
by the Committee and signed on behalf of the Group in advance of the commencement of the audit.
In November 2017, in advance of the finalisation of the Group’s Financial Statements, the Committee reviewed a report from KPMG on their key 
audit findings, including the key risk areas and significant judgements, and discussed it with them in order for the Committee to form a judgement 
on the Financial Statements. In addition, we considered the Letter of Representation and the management letter.
At least annually, the Committee meets with the external auditor absent management to discuss any issues the auditor may wish to raise. The 
Committee continues to be fully satisfied with the performance of KPMG who remain effective, objective and independent. We have therefore 
recommended to the Board that KPMG should continue in office as the Group’s auditor for FY18 and as set out on page 55, an advisory resolution 
will be put before the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) in relation to the continuation in office of KPMG as 
auditor. The last external audit tender was conducted in 2008 and KPMG were formally appointed as the Group’s auditor by shareholders at  
the AGM of the Company held in February 2009. The lead partner is rotated every five years to ensure continued independence and objectivity. 
During FY15, Tom McEvoy of KPMG succeeded David Meagher of KPMG as lead partner on the Group’s audit.
AUDIT TENDERING AND APPOINTMENT
TENDER PROCESS
The Committee undertook a tender process during FY17 to ensure that the incumbent auditor would have sufficient time for an orderly transition 
in advance of their official appointment which will take effect from the beginning of FY19. 
Following a detailed short-listing process, which included consideration of independence and ability to effectively manage the audit of a group  
of Greencore’s scale, complexity and geography, three audit firms were invited to tender for the engagement.
KPMG, as the incumbent statutory auditor since 2008, were not invited to participate in the tender process, due to their length of tenure and in 
observing the spirit of the 2016 Regulations and the UK 2016 Corporate Governance Code.  99 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
SELECTION PROCESS
Throughout the tender process a rigorous scoring procedure was employed to ensure that the firm selected will provide the highest quality  
and most effective and efficient audit. Following on from the evaluation of the tender firms, the Committee undertook a thorough and fair 
selection process:
MARCH –  
MAY 2017 
JUNE –  
AUGUST 2017 
EARLY – MID  
SEPTEMBER 2017 
LATE  
SEPTEMBER 2017
• Tender process discussed 
by Committee and 
selection panel agreed. 
• Desktop review of 
material audit firms  
was undertaken which 
was based on three  
key criteria including 
FTSE 350 experience, 
global footprint and 
level of audit fees.
• One on one meetings 
with tender firms and 
Committee Chair.
• Chief Financial Officer, 
Group Finance Director 
and Head of Risk 
Management met  
with the tender firms.
• Greencore site visits. 
• Deadline for receipt  
of proposals.
• Review of proposals 
against selection criteria.
• Committee met to 
finalise and validate the 
recommendation paper.
• Presentations by 
candidate firms  
to Committee.
• New auditor firm 
selected and agreed by 
Committee and Board.
SELECTION CRITERIA
Throughout the tender process the Committee was guided by a selection criteria that was firmly established prior to the commencement of the 
tender process. The scoring mechanism adopted was based on the selection criteria. 
The Committee evaluated each of the tender firms on four key criteria, namely:
(1) Audit Quality;
(2) Cultural Fit;
(3) Corporate Fit; and
(4) Commercial Proposition.
Under the ‘Audit Quality’ criteria, the Committee assessed attributes such as the audit skills and experience, in particular experience of the food 
market and an understanding of risks specific to Greencore. In addition, the ability to prepare detailed audit plans including the use of audit tools, 
especially data analytics, was also assessed. The candidate firms proposed transition plan and experience of transition of similar audits were also  
a key factor in assessment under this criteria.
In assessing candidate firm proposals under the ‘Cultural Fit’ criteria the Committee examined whether the candidate firm was aligned to the 
values of Greencore, as set out in ‘The Greencore Way’. In addition, the approach taken by the lead partner and the ‘top team’ in its ability to 
interact with the Committee and senior management was measured. The ability of a candidate firm to demonstrate flexibility to Greencore’s 
changing needs was also considered.
Under the ‘Corporate Fit’ measure ability to operate as a seamless global organisation whilst meeting independence requirements was also 
evaluated. The Committee, in examining candidate firms under this criteria, were looking for a depth of knowledge and presence across all 
Greencore locations. 
Finally, under the ‘Commercial Proposition’ criterion, the quality of the proposal, together with the sustainability and value of the fee proposal and 
alignment of contractual terms and conditions, were evaluated in candidate firm proposals. 
OUTCOME
The Committee robustly considered the respective merits of the tendering firms. Having considered that Deloitte demonstrated that they were 
best placed to fulfil the selection criteria, the Committee recommended Deloitte with Marguerite Larkin as lead partner, to the Board as the 
Group’s new external auditor. Upon approval by the Board, Deloitte’s proposed tenure will take effect at the commencement of FY19. Their 
appointment will be put before shareholders for approval at the 2019 AGM. The Board and the Committee would like to thank each of the other 
firms who participated in the audit tender process, and look forward to working with Deloitte in the future. 
TRANSITIONAL PROCESS
To ensure that Deloitte are well prepared for their engagement as the Group’s external auditor, transition meetings will be put in place with Group 
management, Deloitte and KPMG to fully understand the audit approach taken and conclusions reached on significant audit issues and judgements. 
During FY18 the Group will focus on the transition of the services currently provided by Deloitte including tax and payroll. The process of seeking 
suitable advisors in this regard will take place throughout FY18.  100 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

HOW THE COMMITTEE HAS DISCHARGED ITS RESPONSIBILITIES IN FY17 CONTINUED
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
Under the Committee’s Terms of Reference, the Committee is responsible for developing and implementing policy on the engagement of the 
external auditor to supply non-audit services whilst ensuring that the auditor does not provide services which are prohibited under the relevant  
2016 Regulations. The Committee has a formal approved policy in place in respect of the above, which is reviewed on an annual basis.
Furthermore, the Committee has agreed that only ‘clearly trivial’ permitted non-audit work may be undertaken by the external auditor without  
the prior approval of the Committee. All other non-audit services must be pre-approved by the Committee, whose role also includes monitoring 
the level of fees incurred for the provision of non-audit services. 
In FY17 the external auditor provided a significant amount of non-audit services in respect of the Peacock Foods acquisition, where they acted  
as reporting accountants. The Committee believes that the external auditor’s knowledge and objectivity was required and these were important 
factors in choosing KPMG to provide this service. 
In the year under review non-audit fees in the sum of €738k were incurred by the Group relating to the acquisition of Peacock Foods. No other fees 
were paid to other firms in the lead audit firms network during the year.
COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS
Following a review by the Board and the Committee of the Committee in FY17, I can confirm that the Committee continues to operate effectively 
and efficiently. I would like to thank my fellow members for their commitment, judgement and hard work undertaken during the year. 
FURTHER QUESTIONS
I will be available to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM to answer any questions relating to the role of the Committee. 
Yours sincerely

Report of the Nomination and Governance Committee
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
The role of the Committee is defined within its Terms of Reference, which can be found under the Corporate Governance section of our website, 
www.greencore.com.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE
All members of the Committee, including myself as Chair, are Non-Executive Directors in accordance with Provision B.2.1. of the 2016 Code. The 
biographical details of each member are set out on pages 50 and 51. The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. Other 
than the Committee Secretary and Committee members, no other individual is entitled to attend the meetings of the Committee, however, in order 
to ensure that the Committee carries out its role efficiently and effectively, other members of the Board, senior management and advisors may 
attend by invitation on an ad-hoc basis. No member of the Committee participates in any discussion or decision making when the matter under 
consideration relates to him or her so as to avoid any conflict of interests.
The Committee believes that the composition of the Committee remains suitably equipped to perform both their nomination and governance 
duties effectively. Diversity and succession planning remain key aspects of our nomination agenda.
The Committee is empowered to appoint the services of an independent search consultants or legal advisors as it sees fit to assist with its work. 
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE 
The Committee held two scheduled meetings during the year, at which all members attended. Furthermore, the Committee held an additional 
meeting to review the skill mix, independence, experience and tenure of the Board and to search for, and support the appointment of, the newly 
elected Non-Executive Directors. 
BOARD COMPOSITION 
Before any new member is co-opted to the Board, the Committee undertakes a review of the size and structure of the Board along with the skills, 
experience, competence and expertise required. The Committee’s role also includes developing the quality of nominees to the Board and ensuring 
that the recruitment and appointment process is conducted ethically and with rigour and integrity.
During FY17, the Committee identified and recommended to the Board that the following individuals be appointed to the Board: 
• Mr TH Sampson (Non-Executive Director) who was appointed to the Board with effect from 1 February 2017; and 
• Ambassador KF O’Malley (Non-Executive Director) who was appointed to the Board with effect from 14 March 2017. 
Due to the enlarged presence of Greencore in the US, the search criteria for these appointments included candidates that are of strong character 
and judgement, confident and commercially orientated, specifically in the US. It was not necessary to utilise the services of external consultants to 
identify the candidates. 
The Committee reviewed the composition of the Board and concluded that the members have appropriate background experience, mix of skills, 
integrity and knowledge to provide strong and effective leadership of the Company. Furthermore, the Committee believes that the composition of 
two Executive Directors and eight Non-Executive Directors is appropriate, and together with the Board, continues to keep the composition of the 
Board and the membership of each of the Committees under continuous review to ensure that each remain appropriately constituted.
As Chair of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) I am pleased  
to introduce its report for the year ended  
29 September 2017 , which details the role  
of the Committee and the work it has  
undertaken during the year.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
To ensure that the independence of the independent Non-Executive Directors is maintained, the Committee keeps the tenure and agreed 
timelines, within which tenure would not normally be extended for each of the Non-Executive Directors, under review. Each year, the Committee 
reviews the time required to fulfil the roles of Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Non-Executive Director and ensures that all members of 
the Board continue to devote appropriate time to their duties and to be effective representatives of shareholder interests. As per previous years,  
all Directors will retire at the AGM of the Company and, if appropriate, submit themselves for re-election.
Our Non-Executive Directors’ tenure on our Board as at 29 September 2017 was as follows:
Non - E xec utive 	 Direc tor s ’ 	 tenure
Number of 
N o n - E x e c u tiv e	
D i r e c to r s
0–3 years 
3–6 years 
6–8 years 
8+ years 
The Letters of Appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal 
office hours and at the Company’s AGM.
Mr EL Nicoli has confirmed his intention to step down as Non-Executive Director and Senior Independent Director in December 2016. The Committee 
recommended to the Board that, Ms SG Bailey replace Mr Nicoli as Senior Independent Director upon his retirement. 
The Committee is also tasked with ensuring that succession plans are in place for the Directors and other key executives within the Group taking into 
consideration the current Board structure, the leadership requirements of the organisation and the commercial environment within which the Group 
operates, along with the wider market.
DIVERSITY
Both the Committee and the Board are mindful of the benefits of diversity and are committed to ensuring that the Board is sufficiently diverse and 
appropriately balanced. In its work in the area of Board renewal the Board considers how diversity, in particular gender diversity, plays in ensuring a 
more effective Board through more efficient and effective decision making. This is clear from the Board’s diverse skill set, gender ratio, background 
and geographical base. In addition to ensuring that both the Board and the Committee remain committed to ensuring diversity at Board level, across 
the Group we are dedicated to ensuring that all recruitment decisions are fair and non-discriminatory. Group-wide, females made up approximately 
41% of our employed population at the end of FY17 . Further details on the breakdown of female and male employees can be found on page 31.
GOVERNANCE 
The Committee continues to work with the Board to enhance the corporate governance processes and developments in legislation and regulation. 
The Committee also considered its Terms of Reference to ensure they reflect the Committee’s remit and concluded that they remain appropriate. 
In FY18, the Committee will assist the Group Chairman in the external evaluation of the Board, where appropriate. An area of focus for the Committee 
over the coming year will be the link between diversity, strategy and developing the business. More consideration will be given to the nature, variety 
and frequency of interaction between the Board and aspiring candidates. 
I will be available at the forthcoming AGM of the Company to answer any queries that shareholders may have in relation to my role, or the role of the 
Committee generally.

the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The Directors have prepared the Group Financial Statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’). The Directors have elected to 
prepare the Company Financial Statements in accordance with FRS 101: Reduced Disclosure Framework, comprising the financial reporting 
standards issued by the Financial Reporting Council and published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, together with the 
Companies Act 2014.
In preparing these Group and Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• State that the Group Financial Statements comply with IFRS as adopted by the EU and as regards the Company, comply with FRS 101; and

determined with reasonable accuracy, and which enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with 
applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 2014, and Article 4 
of the European Communities (International Financial Reporting Standards and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2005 (the ‘IAS Regulation’).

OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT
1. OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED
We have audited the Financial Statements of Greencore Group plc for the year ended 29 September 2017 which comprise the Group Income 
Statement, the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes, including the accounting policies in Note 1. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements is Irish law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company Financial Statements, applicable 
accounting standards including FRS 101.
In our opinion:
• The Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 29 September 2017 
and of its profit for the year then ended;
• The Company Balance Sheet gives a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Company as at 29 September 2017;
• The Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union;
• The Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, FRS 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’; and
• The Company Financial Statements and Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2014 (‘Act‘) and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) (‘ISAs (Ireland)’) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.
We were appointed as auditor by the Directors on 19 August 2008 and subsequently re-appointed by shareholders at each subsequent Annual 
General Meeting to date. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is the 10 financial years ended 29 September 2017. We have fulfilled  
our ethical responsibilities under, and we remained independent of the Group in accordance with, ethical requirements applicable in Ireland, 
including the Ethical Standard issued by the Irish Accounting and Auditing Supervisory Authority (‘IAASA’) as applied to listed public interest 
entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided.
2. KEY AUDIT MATTERS: OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
In arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS £78.2M (2016 – £17.4M)
Refer to page 125 (accounting policy) and pages 134 to 135 (financial disclosures).
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group has identified and presented a significant 
amount of cost as exceptional in the year ended 
29 September 2017 in accordance with its stated 
accounting policy. 
The classification of items as exceptional affects adjusted 
earnings per share and is inherently judgemental. As a 
result there is a risk that items are not consistently classified 
as exceptional items.
Our audit procedures included evaluating the classification of transactions as 
exceptional in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. We also evaluated 
whether the accounting policy for exceptional items is appropriate and is consistent 
with previous periods.
We assessed whether items are appropriately and consistently classified as exceptional 
items. In addition we assessed the appropriateness of disclosures made in relation to 
each item classified as exceptional.
As a result of our work, we determined that items recognised as exceptional items 
are presented in accordance with the Group’s stated accounting policy. 106 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
TAX PROVISIONING £10.8M (2016 – £14.0M)
Refer to pages 122 and 123 (accounting policy) and pages 138 to 140 (financial disclosures).
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
Accruals for tax contingencies require the directors to 
make judgements and estimates in relation to tax issues  
and exposures. 
This is one of the key judgemental areas that our audit  
is focused on due to the Group operating in a number  
of tax jurisdictions, the complexities of transfer pricing  
and other international tax legislation and the time taken 
for tax matters to be agreed with the tax authorities.
In this area our audit procedures included the use of our own international and  
local tax specialists to assess the Group’s tax positions, its correspondence with  
the relevant tax authorities and to analyse and challenge the assumptions used  
to determine tax provisions based on our knowledge and experience of the 
application of the international and local legislation by the relevant authorities  
and courts.
Our assessment included consideration of alternative interpretations of tax law, 
where relevant.
We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of  
tax and uncertain tax positions.
We found the Group’s estimate of the amounts to be recognised as tax liabilities  
to be appropriate and that the disclosures provide an adequate description of the 
current status of uncertain tax positions.
ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS £606.2M (2016 – £15.8M)
Refer to page 119 (accounting policy) and pages 164 to 166 (financial disclosures).
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group completed the acquisition of Peacock Foods 
during the period see Note 31. 
The acquired business operates from a number of 
manufacturing locations and sells to a number of 
significant customers.
Accounting for the completed transaction involved 
estimating the fair value at acquisition date of the assets 
and liabilities of the business, including the valuation of 
customer relationships.
Significant judgement is involved in relation to the 
assumptions used in this process and there is a risk  
that these assumptions are inappropriate.
In this area our procedures included but were not limited to:
We engaged our valuation specialist to assist the audit team with this key  
audit matter.
We examined the information contained in due diligence reports and business  
case submissions proposing the acquisition be made to the Board of Directors.
We assessed the accounting entries used to record the acquisition, the acquisition 
date assets and liabilities of the acquired entity and the fair value adjustments  
made thereto.
We challenged the Group’s critical assumptions in relation to the identification and 
valuation of customer relationships.
We assessed whether all assets had been appropriately identified, and considered 
the appropriateness of the methodology used in the valuation of these assets.  
We compared the key assumptions used in the valuation to external data,  
where available.
We assessed the arithmetic accuracy of calculations underpinning the accounting 
for the business combination and considered whether the resulting goodwill 
balances were reasonable.
We also assessed whether the disclosures made were appropriate.
Overall, we found the key assumptions used in accounting for the acquisition  
to be appropriate.

POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS NET DEFICIT £124.8M (2016 – £162.3M)
Refer to page 123 (accounting policy) and pages 158 to 162 (financial disclosures).
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
Significant estimates are made in valuing the Group’s 
post-retirement defined benefit schemes, particularly  
the discount rate. 
Small changes in assumptions and estimates used to value 
the Group’s pension deficit would have a significant effect 
on the results and financial position of the Group.
With the support of our actuarial specialists, we challenged the key assumptions 
applied in determining the Group’s net deficit, being the discount rate, inflation rate 
and mortality/life expectancy. This included a comparison of these key assumptions 
against externally derived data.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of the 
sensitivity of the deficits to these assumptions.
Overall, we found the key assumptions used in, and the resulting estimate of, the 
valuation of the retirement benefit obligations of the Group to be appropriate. 
We found the disclosures in respect of post-retirement benefits to be reasonable.
GOODWILL £797.1M (2016 – £476.9M)
Refer to pages 119 to 120 (accounting policy) and pages 143 to 145 (financial disclosures).
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
There is a risk of irrecoverability of the Group’s significant 
goodwill balance due to potential changes in customer 
demand and preferences in certain markets and general 
cost inflation across the industry. 
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting  
and discounting future cash flows, which rely on the 
directors’ assumptions and estimates of future trading 
performance, there is a risk that the Group’s goodwill 
needs to be impaired.
We considered the appropriateness of the methodology applied by the Directors  
in determining the CGUs and calculating the impairment charges. 
In this area our audit procedures included evaluating the budgeting process upon 
which the Group’s discounted cash flow model is based. We also tested the integrity 
and mathematical accuracy of this cash flow model. 
We compared the sum of the discounted cash flows to the Group’s market 
capitalisation to assess the reasonableness of those cash flows. 
We evaluated the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group, in particular 
those relating to the forecast revenue growth and profit margins.
We compared the Group’s assumptions in relation to key inputs such as projected 
cost inflation and discount rates to externally derived data and our own assessments 
of these inputs. We performed additional sensitivity analysis on these assumptions.
We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the 
outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected 
the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill.
As a result of our work, we found that management’s judgement that no impairment 
was required was appropriate, and supported by reasonable assumptions. We found 
the disclosures to be adequate.

INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS – PARENT KEY MATTER £176.8M (2016 – £155.5M)
Refer to page 172 (accounting policy) and page 173 (financial disclosures).
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are carried in the 
Company’s financial statements at cost less impairment. 
Impairments in subsidiary undertakings are determined 
with reference to the subsidiary undertakings’ fair value.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings is significant as  
the financial position of underlying entities could result  
in an impairment charge.
In this area our audit procedures included assessing the carrying value of 
subsidiaries for any objective indicators of impairment and checking the  
accuracy of management’s calculations.
Based on the results of our testing, we consider the carrying value of  
investments in subsidiary undertakings to be acceptable.
3. OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
The materiality for the Group Financial Statements as a whole increased to £4.0m (2016: £2.5m) in line with the increase in the Group’s revenue, 
assets and normalised profit. This has been calculated using a benchmark of Group profit before taxation normalised to exclude the impact  
of the exceptional costs including those arising from the impairment of intangible assets, the costs relating to the acquisition of Peacock Foods 
and the cost associated with the planned closure of the Evercreech facility. Both Group and component audit teams performed work over the 
excluded items.
This materiality measure represents 4% (2016: 5%) of this benchmark and 32% of total reported profit before tax. We carry out audit procedures  
to assess the accuracy of the excluded exceptional items as part of our audit. 
We report to the Audit Committee all material corrected identified misstatements, all uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £150,000 
(2016: £100,000) and other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
Materiality for the Company Financial Statements as a whole was set at £3m (2016: £2.5m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Company 
total assets, of which it represents 0.21% (2016: 0.25%). 
The structure of the Group’s finance function is such that certain transactions and balances are accounted for by central Group and divisional 
finance teams, with the remainder accounted for in the operating units. We performed comprehensive audit procedures, including those in 
relation to the significant risks above, on those transactions and balances accounted for at Group, divisional and operating unit level.
We subjected 18 (2016: 17) of the Group’s reporting components to audits for Group Reporting and 5 (2016: 8) to specified risk-focused audit 
procedures. The latter were not individually sufficiently financially significant to require an audit for group reporting purposes. For the remaining 
components, the Group audit team performed analysis at a Group or Divisional level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement within these components.
SUMMARY OF SCOPE
In relation to the Group’s operating units, audits for Group reporting purposes were performed at identified key reporting components in  
Ireland, the UK and the US, augmented by risk focused audit procedures which were performed for all other components. The audit of the parent 
company was performed by the Group audit team. As set out in the tables above, these audits covered 98% of Group profit before taxation (and 
pre-exceptional items), 99% of Group total assets, 97% of total Group revenue, with the remaining 3% of Group revenue covered by specified risk 
focused audit procedures.

3. OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT CONTINUED
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above, and the 
information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved the component materiality assessments, which ranged from £1m to £2m, having 
regards to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on all components was performed by KPMG Ireland. 
Senior members of the Group audit team, including the lead engagement partner, either physically attended Divisional closing meetings or 
attended via telephone conferencing facilities, at which the results of component audits were discussed with Divisional and Group management.
4. WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON GOING CONCERN
We are required to report to you if:
• we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ Statement in Note 1 to the financial statements on the use of 
the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that 
basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; or
•  if the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 61 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
5. WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THE ANNUAL REPORT
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the Financial Statements. Our opinion on 
the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated 
below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our Financial Statements audit work, the information 
therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information.
DISCLOSURES OF PRINCIPAL RISKS AND LONGER-TERM VIABILITY
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our Financial Statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the principal risks disclosures describing these risks and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated;
• the Directors’ confirmation within the statement of Risk and Risk Management on pages 60 and 61 that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; and
• the Directors’ explanation in the statement of Risk and Risk Management of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
OTHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURES
We are required to address the following items and report to you in the following circumstances:
• fair, balanced and understandable: if we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider that the annual report and Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy;
• report of the Audit Committee: if the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; and
• statement of compliance with UK Corporate Governance Code: if the Directors’ statement does not properly disclose a departure from provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
In addition as required by the Companies Act 2014, we report, in relation to information given in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 
56 to 62, that:
• based on the work undertaken for our audit, in our opinion, the description of the main features of internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to the financial reporting process and information relating to voting rights and other matters required by the European 
Communities (Takeover Bids (Directive 2004/25/EC) Regulations 2006 and specified by the Companies Act 2014 for our consideration, are 
consistent with the Financial Statements and has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2014; and

Governance Code and the Irish Corporate Governance Annex specified for our review; and

8. RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
As explained more fully in their statement set out on pages 103 and 104, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the Financial Statements 
including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that  
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, 
other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Statements. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud or other 
irregularities is higher than for one resulting from error, as they may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control and may involve any area of law and regulation not just those directly affecting the Financial Statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on IAASA’s website at https://www.iaasa.ie/getmedia/b2389013-1cf6-458b-9b8f-
a98202dc9c3a/Description_of_auditors_responsiblities_for_audit.pdf 
9. THE PURPOSE OF OUR AUDIT WORK AND TO WHOM WE OWE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES 
Our report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 391 of the Companies Act 2014. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for our report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
year ended 29 September 2017
1. GROUP STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Group Financial Statements of Greencore Group plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) and their interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’)  
and those parts of the Companies Act 2014, applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements for the year ended 29 September 2017 are set out below.
The IFRS adopted by the EU and applied by the Group in the preparation of these Financial Statements are those that were effective for the 
accounting period ending 29 September 2017.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Group Financial Statements, which are presented in sterling and rounded to the nearest million (unless otherwise stated), have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, except where assets and liabilities are stated at fair value in accordance with relevant accounting policies.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by all the Group’s subsidiaries and associates and have been consistently 
applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The preparation of the Group Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best estimate of the amount, event or actions, 
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The Financial Statements of the Group are prepared to the Friday nearest to 30 September. Accordingly these Financial Statements are prepared 
for the 52 week period ended 29 September 2017. Comparatives are for the 53 week period ended 30 September 2016. The Balance Sheets for 
2017 and 2016 have been prepared as at 29 September 2017 and 30 September 2016 respectively.
The profit attributable to equity shareholders dealt with in the Financial Statements of the Parent Company was £17.9m (2016: profit of £90.3m).
In accordance with section 304 of the Companies Act 2014, Greencore Group Plc (the ‘Company’) is availing of the exemption from presenting  
its individual profit and loss account, which forms part of the approved Financial Statements, to the Annual General Meeting and from filing it  
with the Registrar of Companies.
NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS
There are no changes to IFRS which became effective for the Group during the financial year which resulted in material changes to the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 29 September 
2017 and have not been applied in preparing the Group Financial Statements. None of the standards are expected to have a significant effect  
on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addressed the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities. The standard replaces 
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and has been completed in a number of stages with the final version issued by  
the IASB in July 2014. The Standard includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge 
accounting. The standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. The Group will apply  
the standard for the reporting period commencing 1 October 2018.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers specifies how and when an IFRS reporter will recognise revenue as well as requiring such entities 
to provide users of financial statements with more informative, relevant disclosures. The standard replace IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction 
Contracts. The standard provides a single, principles based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers. The Group is currently 
evaluating the impact that IFRS 15 will have on its financial statements. The Group will apply the standard for the reporting period commencing 
1 October 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases sets out the principle for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessee and lessor.  
It eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and introduces a single lessee accounting model where the 
lessee is required to recognise assets and liabilities for all material leases that have a term of greater than a year. The Group is currently evaluating 
the impact that IFRS 16 will have on its financial statements. Refer to Note 28 for the Group’s operating lease commitments. Subject to EU 
endorsement the Group will apply the standard from its effective date. IFRS 16 is expected to be endorsed by the EU in 2017 with an effective  
date of 1 January 2019.
There are no other IFRS standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. 118 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GROUP STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
BA SIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Group Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of the parent undertaking and its subsidiary undertakings, together with the 
Group’s share of the results of associated undertakings.
SUBSIDIARIES
Subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group Financial Statements from the date on which control over the operating and financial policies  
is obtained, and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is 
exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. All inter-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group undertakings are eliminated on consolidation. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated except where they provide evidence of impairment.
ASSOCIATES
An associate is an enterprise over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence through participation in the financial and operating 
policy decisions of the investee, but which is not a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity.
The Group’s share of the results, assets and liabilities of an associate are included in the Group Financial Statements using the equity method  
of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the investment in the associate is carried in the Group Balance Sheet at cost plus post-
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received, less any impairments in the value of the investment.
The Group Income Statement reflects the Group’s share of the results after tax of the associate. The Group Statement of Recognised Income and 
Expense reflects the Group’s share of any income and expense recognised by the associate outside of profit or loss.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue represents the fair value of the sale of goods and rendering of services to external customers, net of trade discounts and value added tax 
in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. The Group provides trade discounts, primarily in the form of rebate arrangements or other incentive 
arrangements, to its customers. The arrangements can take the form of volume related rebates, marketing fund contributions, promotional fund 
contributions or lump sum incentives. The Group recognises revenue net of such discounts over the period to which the arrangement applies.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the buyer, it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, which generally arises on delivery 
or in accordance with specific terms and conditions agreed with customers. Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised in the period in 
which the services are rendered on the basis of services provided.
The Group maintains a capital recovery program with certain customers. The capital recovery program represents a contractual arrangement with 
customers to compensate the Group for certain capital expenditure and related installation costs. The Group accounts for equipment and leasehold 
improvements purchased under these arrangements as revenue recognised over the term of the lease. The Group also receives consideration from 
its customers for certain leasehold improvements made to the Group’s facilities. The reimbursement for these expenditures is recognised as revenue 
over the estimated economic life of the related contract. Arrangements that include leases are multiple element arrangements with one element 
being packaging services and the other element being the lease of property and equipment. Revenue is allocated to each element based on its 
relative selling price and recognised in accordance with the Group’s policy for packaging services and operating leases.
SUPPLIER REBATES
The Group enters into rebate arrangements with its suppliers. The arrangements are primarily volume related. Supplier rebates received are 
recognised primarily as a deduction from cost of sales, based on the entitlement that has been earned up to the Balance Sheet date, for each 
relevant supplier arrangement.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less depreciation and any impairments. The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its 
purchase price and any directly attributable costs.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost less residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment during its expected useful life 
using the straight-line method over the following periods:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings   25–50 years
Plant, machinery, equipment, fixtures and fittings  3–25 years 
Freehold land is not depreciated
Useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
year ended 29 September 2017 119 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
1. GROUP STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED
Subsequent costs incurred relating to specific assets are included in an asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other costs are charged to the profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to 
their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer 
exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. 
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal 
is recognised in the profit or loss. Following the recognition or reversal of an impairment loss, the depreciation charge applicable to the asset is 
adjusted prospectively in order to systematically allocate the revised carrying amount, net of any residual value, over the remaining useful life.
Gains or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and the carrying value at  
the date of sale.
ASSETS HELD UNDER LEASES
FINANCE LEASES
Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Group obtains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased item and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charge so as to achieve a constant interest charge  
on the finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings, allocated between current and non-current as appropriate. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the profit or loss 
over the lease period. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful lives or the lease term, taking 
into account the time period over which benefits from the leased assets are expected to accrue to the Group.
OPERATING LEASES
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments 
made under operating leases, net of incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period  
of the lease. Income earned from operating leases is credited to the profit or loss when earned.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The purchase method of accounting is used in accounting for the acquisition of businesses. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations,  
the fair value of the consideration for a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets 
given and liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control. The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity are 
measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. When the initial accounting for a business combination is determined provisionally, any 
adjustments to the provisional values allocated are made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are effected from the date of acquisition.
Where a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of a business acquired contingent on future events, the Group 
accrues the fair value of the additional consideration payable as a liability at the acquisition date where this can be measured reliably. This amount 
is reassessed at each subsequent Balance Sheet date with any adjustments to the liability recognised in the profit or loss.
To the extent that deferred purchase consideration and earn-out obligations are payable after one year from the date of acquisition, they are 
discounted at an appropriate interest rate and, accordingly, are carried at net present value in the Group Balance Sheet. An appropriate interest 
charge, at a constant interest rate on the carrying amount, adjusted to reflect material conditions, is reflected in the profit or loss over the earn-out 
period, increasing the value of the provision so that the obligation will reflect its settlement value at the time of maturity.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable  
net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired over the fair value of the 
consideration given (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the profit or loss in the period of acquisition. 120 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
year ended 29 September 2017
1. GROUP STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
GOODWILL CONTINUED
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. On acquisition, goodwill is allocated to 
cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit 
or loss.
Goodwill arising on investments in associates is included in the carrying amount of the investment and any impairment of the goodwill is included 
in income from associates.
ACQUISITION RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is capitalised separately from goodwill as part of  
a business combination to the extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will accrue to the 
Group and that its fair value can be measured reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable (i.e. capable of being divided 
from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or together with a related contract, asset or liability) or 
when it arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the Group or from  
other rights and obligations.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment  
losses. The carrying amounts of definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and are subject  
to impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. Any impairment charge 
is taken to the profit or loss.
The amortisation of intangible assets is calculated to write off the book value of definite-life intangible assets over their useful lives on a straight-
line basis on the assumption of zero residual value. Customer related intangible assets are amortised over periods ranging from 1–10 years. 
COMPUTER SOFTWARE
Costs incurred on the acquisition of computer software and software licences are capitalised. Other costs directly associated with developing  
and upgrading computer software programs are capitalised once the recognition criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met. Computer 
software is amortised over 5–7 years.
INVESTMENT PROPERTY
Investment property is shown at cost less depreciation and any impairment. The cost of investment property comprises its purchase price and any 
costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use. Investment property is depreciated so as to write off the cost, 
less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected life of each property. Freehold buildings held as investment property are depreciated 
over their expected useful life, normally assumed to be 40–50 years. Freehold land is not depreciated.
Rental income arising on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term of the ongoing leases and is recognised 
within other income.
In relation to the recognition of income on the disposal of property, income is recognised when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts, 
or when all necessary terms and conditions have been fulfilled.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated based on first-in, first-out or weighted average as appropriate. 
Cost includes raw materials, direct labour expenses and related production and other overheads. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price, 
in the ordinary course of business, less costs to completion and appropriate selling and distribution expenses.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost, net of provision for impairment.  
A provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will be unable to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when  
the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Any trade and other receivables included in non-current assets are carried at amortised cost in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost. Cash and cash equivalents include cash 
in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are 
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less. 121 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
1. GROUP STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Trade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently at the higher of cost or payment or settlement amounts. Where the 
time value of money is material, payables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an  
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the  
amount of the obligation.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering  
the class of obligation as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the  
same class of obligation may be small.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when  
the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is recognised in the profit or loss net of any reimbursement.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of an obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the 
obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic 
benefits is probable.
BORROWINGS
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-
bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising on  
the settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised in finance income and finance costs as appropriate.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the Balance Sheet date.
FINANCE INCOME AND EXPENSE
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and the unwind of discount on assets. Interest income is recognised in profit or loss 
as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, unwind of discount on liabilities, interest on the net defined benefit pension scheme 
liabilities, changes in fair value of hedging instruments and other derivatives that are recognised in profit or loss. All borrowing costs are recognised 
in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
FINANCIAL ASSETS
A financial asset is derecognised when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial asset, which is normally the 
case when the asset is sold or the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, and the Group has not retained substantially all risks 
and rewards of ownership and has transferred control of the asset.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability  
is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such  
an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability, and the recognition of a new liability.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The activities of the Group expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Group uses derivative financial 
instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swap agreements, to hedge these exposures.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Derivative instruments which are 
held for trading and are not designated as effective hedging instruments are classified as a current asset or liability (as appropriate) regardless  
of maturity if the Group expects that they may be settled within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date. All other derivative instruments that are  
not designated as effective hedging instruments are classified by reference to their maturity date. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is 
classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability  
if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 122 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GROUP STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgement to select the most appropriate 
valuation methods and makes assumptions that are mainly based on observable market conditions existing at the Balance Sheet date.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is sought, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. This 
documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how hedge effectiveness 
will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash 
flows of hedged items.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, derivatives are classified as:
• Fair value hedges, when hedging the exposure of changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or
• Cash flow hedges, when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a 
recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction; or
• Net investment hedges, when hedging the exposure to foreign currency differences between the functional currency of a foreign operation 
and the functional currency of the parent.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of all other derivatives which are classified as held for trading are taken to the profit or 
loss and charged to finance income or expense. These may arise from derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied because they are  
not designated as hedging instruments. The Group does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from remeasuring derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship, as follows:
CASH FLOW HEDGE
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable 
forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised within equity in the hedging reserve, 
with the ineffective portion being reported in the profit or loss as finance income or finance costs. When a highly probable forecast transaction results 
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve in equity and included in the 
initial measurement of the non-financial asset or liability. Otherwise, the associated gains and losses that had previously been recognised within 
equity in the hedging reserve are transferred to the profit or loss as the cash flows of the hedged item impact the profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised within equity in the hedging reserve is kept in the hedging 
reserve until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer anticipated to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised 
within equity in the hedging reserve is transferred immediately to the profit or loss as finance costs.
NET INVESTMENT HEDGE
Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are 
recognised directly in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve, to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is 
ineffective, such differences are recognised in profit or loss. When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the associated cumulative 
amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal.
TAXATION
The charge/credit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in the Group 
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense or directly in equity, respectively.
Current tax payable represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the Balance Sheet date, along with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Group provides in full for deferred tax assets and liabilities (using the liability method), arising from temporary differences between the tax 
base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Group Financial Statements except where they arise from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability that at the date of initial recognition does not affect accounting or taxable profit or 
loss on a transaction that is not a business combination. Such differences result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in future 
periods. A deferred tax asset is only recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences giving rise to the asset can be utilised.

year ended 29 September 2017 123 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
1. GROUP STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
TAXATION CONTINUED
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not subject to discounting and are measured at the tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the 
Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal  
of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the Group’s provision for income 
taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax 
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax 
provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Once it has been concluded that a liability needs to be recognised, the liability is 
measured. We consider the range of possible outcomes and record a liability based on the most likely single outcome, rather than alternative 
approaches which could include a weighted average probability of outcomes or an ‘all or nothing’ approach.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services 
are rendered by the employees of the Group. Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal 
retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination 
benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan 
without the possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLANS
A defined contribution pension plan is a plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate defined contribution scheme. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense within profit or loss as employee service  
is received. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
LEGACY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS
The cost of providing benefits under the Group’s legacy defined benefit pension plans is determined separately for each plan, using the projected 
unit credit method, by professionally qualified actuaries and arrived at using actuarial assumptions based on market expectations at the Balance 
Sheet date. These valuations attribute entitlement benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost), and to the current and prior 
periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit pension obligations).
 
Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised immediately  
in the Group Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through the Group Statement of Recognised Income and 
Expense in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of:
• The date of the plan amendment or curtailment; and
• The date that the Group recognises restructuring-related costs.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net legacy defined benefit pension liability or asset.
When a settlement (eliminating all obligations for defined benefits already accrued) or a curtailment (reducing future obligations as a result of a 
material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured 
using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss during the period in which the settlement or 
curtailment occurs.
The legacy defined benefit pension asset or liability in the Group Balance Sheet comprises the total, for each plan, of the present value of the 
defined benefit pension obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) less the fair value of plan assets out of which  
the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information, and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid 
price. The value of a net defined pension benefit asset is the present value of any economic benefit the Group reasonably expects to recover by 
way of refund of surplus from the plan at the end of the plan’s life or reduction in future contributions to the plan. 124 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GROUP STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group grants equity settled share-based payments to employees (through the Performance Share Plan, the Annual Bonus Plan, the Employee 
ShareSave Scheme and the Executive Option Scheme). The fair value of these is determined at the date of grant and is expensed to the profit or 
loss with a corresponding increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value is determined using a trinomial valuation 
model, as measured at the date of grant, excluding the impact of any non-market conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each Balance Sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number  
of options or awards that are expected to vest, recognising any adjustment in the profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
To the extent that the Group receives a tax deduction relating to services paid for by means of share awards or options, deferred tax is provided on 
the basis of the difference between the market price of the underlying equity as at the date of the Balance Sheet and the exercise price of the option. 
As a result, the deferred tax impact of share options will not directly correlate with the expense reported in the profit or loss. To the extent that the 
deductible difference exceeds the cumulative charge to the profit or loss, it is recorded in the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
When the exercise of share options results in the issuance of shares, the proceeds received are credited to the share capital and share premium 
accounts, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY
The individual Financial Statements of each Group entity are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (the functional currency). The Group Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is also the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.
TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit or loss, except when deferred in equity as qualifying 
net investment hedges and qualifying cash flow hedges.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are 
translated at the closing rate.
FOREIGN OPERATIONS
The Income Statement and Balance Sheet of Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of the 
Company are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
• Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the Balance Sheet;
• Income and expenses are translated at the rates at the date of the transaction, normally estimated using average exchange rates; and
• All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and on long-term borrowings and 
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity. When a foreign operation is sold, exchange differences 
that were recorded in equity are recognised in the profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Government grants for the acquisition of assets are recognised at their fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received 
and any conditions attached to them have been fulfilled. The grant is held on the Group Balance Sheet as a deferred credit and released to the 
profit or loss over the periods necessary to match the related depreciation charges, or other expenses of the asset, as they are incurred.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Expenditure on research and development is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An asset is recognised only when all 
the conditions set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.
SEGMENTAL REPORTING
The Group reports segmental information by class of business and by geographical area. The Group’s primary reporting segment, for which more 
detailed disclosures are made, is by class of business. The Group has identified two reportable segments: (i) Convenience Foods UK and Ireland;  
and (ii) Convenience Foods US. Refer to Note 2 for further information.

1. GROUP STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are those that are separately disclosed by virtue of their nature or amount in order to highlight such items within the Group Income 
Statement and results for the year. Examples of such items may include but are not limited to, significant reorganisation programmes, profits or losses 
on termination of operations, the impact of significant plant development and related onboarding of business, significant impairments of assets, 
transaction and integration costs related to acquisition activity, transaction costs related to disposal activity and litigation costs and settlements.  
Group management exercises judgement in assessing each particular item which, by virtue of its scale or nature, should be highlighted and disclosed 
in the Group Income Statement and notes to the Group Financial Statements as exceptional items. Exceptional items are included within the Group 
Income Statement caption to which they relate and are separately disclosed in the notes to the Group Financial Statements.
NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
Non-controlling interests are stated at their proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses 
applicable to non-controlling interests continue to be recognised and attributed to non-controlling interests unless the parent has undertaken to 
fund their losses.
SHARE CAPITAL
ORDINARY SHARES
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are taken as a deduction 
within equity, net of tax, from the proceeds.
TREASURY SHARES
Where the Company purchases its own share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from total shareholders’ equity and classified as treasury 
shares until such shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in 
total shareholders’ equity.
DIVIDENDS
Interim dividends payable are recognised as a liability of the Company when the Board of Directors resolves to pay the dividend and the shareholders 
have been notified in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. Final dividends of the Company are recognised as a liability when they 
have been approved by the Company’s shareholders.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
Group management makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements, which can 
significantly impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. The significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the 
Group’s Financial Statements are outlined in the relevant notes.
2. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Following the significant acquisition of Peacock Foods which completed on 30 December 2016, the Group has reviewed its reporting structure  
to ensure that it continues to reflect the Group’s organisational structure and the nature of the financial information reported to and assessed by 
the Chief Operation Decision Maker (as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments ). As a result, the Group has revised its operating segments and 
comparative segment amounts for 2016 have been restated where necessary to reflect the new format for segmentation.
The Group now reports across the following operating segments:
Convenience Foods UK & Ireland: incorporating Food to Go (i.e. sandwich, sushi and salad) and the other parts of the Convenience Foods UK & 
Ireland division which comprise the ready meals, chilled soups and sauces, cooking sauces, quiche, Yorkshire Pudding and cakes and desserts 
businesses as well the Irish ingredient trading businesses.
Convenience Foods US: comprising the total combined US business including the acquired Peacock Foods business, manufacturing convenience 
food products for many of the largest food brands, convenience retail and food service leaders in the US. Convenience Foods US produces a wide 
range of fresh, frozen and ambient products including sandwiches, meal kits and salad kits.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker monitors the operating results of segments separately in order to allocate resources between segments and 
to assess performance. Segment performance is predominantly evaluated based on operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation  
of acquisition related intangible assets. Exceptional items, net finance costs and income tax are managed on a centralised basis and therefore, 
these items are not allocated between operating segments for the purposes of the information presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
and are accordingly reconciled to the segmental information below. Intersegment revenue is not material. 126 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

6. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group operates a number of employee share option schemes which are equity settled share-based payments as defined in IFRS 2 Share-
based payments. A recognised valuation methodology is employed to determine the fair value of options granted as set out in the standard. The 
charge incurred relating to these options is recognised within operating costs. Detail of each of the employee share option schemes operated by 
the Group are set out below:
ANNUAL BONUS PLAN
Senior Executives participate in the Annual Bonus Plan as outlined in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration. In accordance with this plan, a deferred 
share award equal to a proportion of the cash bonus is awarded to the participating executives, the number of shares is calculated at market value  
on the date of allocation, to be held by a trustee for the benefit of individual participants without any additional performance conditions other than 
three years of service. The shares vest after three years but are forfeit should an executive voluntarily leave the Group within the three year time 
period, subject to normal ‘good leaver’ provisions. The charge recognised in the Group Income Statement was £1.6m (2016: £1.1m). The fair value  
of the award is equal to the share price on the grant date. The share price on the grant date, for awards granted in December 2016, was £2.43.
On 1 December 2016 and 1 December 2015, 599,359 and 447,853 respectively, awards were granted to Senior Executives of the Group under the 
Annual Bonus Plan. 130 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

Awards will be granted to Senior Executives of the Group under the Annual Bonus Plan in respect of the year ended 29 September 2017. A charge 
amounting to £0.1m (2016: £0.1m) relating to awards to Executive Directors and £0.4m (2016: £0.2m) relating to awards to other Senior Executives 
has been included in the Group Income Statement in respect of the estimated 2017 charge. The total fair value of the awards will be taken as a 
charge to the Group Income Statement over the vesting period of the awards.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
Certain employees participate in a long-term incentive scheme, the Performance Share Plan. In accordance with this scheme, participants are 
awarded an allotment of shares which will vest over three years subject to vesting conditions for growth in Return on Invested Capital and in 
earnings per share. The number of shares granted is calculated based on the market value on the date of allocation. Share options are forfeit 
should an executive voluntarily leave the Group prior to the vesting date, subject to normal ‘good leaver’ provisions. The fair value of the award  
is equal to the share price on the grant date. Further description of the scheme can be found in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration. A charge 
amounting to £1.2m (2016: £2.5m) was included in the Group Income Statement in the 2017 financial year related to these awards.

SHARESAVE SCHEMES
The Group operates savings-related share option schemes in both the UK and Ireland. Options are granted at a discount of between 20% and  
25% of the market price at the date of invitation over three, five and seven year savings contracts and options are exercisable during the six month 
period following completion of the savings contract. The charge recognised in the Group Income Statement in respect of these options was £0.7m 
(2016: £0.7m). Grant date fair value was arrived at through applying a trinomial model, which is a lattice option-pricing model. 
During the year ended 29 September 2017, ShareSave Scheme options were granted over 2,410,569 shares (UK) and 30,429 shares (Ireland), which 
will ordinarily be exercisable at an exercise price of £1.98 and €2.11 per share respectively, during the period 1 September 2020 to 28 February 
2021. The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year ended 29 September 2017 was £0.62 (UK) and £0.66 (Ireland).
During the year ended 30 September 2016, ShareSave Scheme options were granted over 1,062,107 shares (UK) and 23,618 shares (Ireland), which 
will ordinarily be exercisable at an exercise price of £2.64 and €3.14 per share respectively, during the period 1 September 2019 to 29 February 
2020. The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year ended 30 September 2016 was £0.86 (UK) and £0.96 (Ireland).

EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The charge relating to the Executive Share Option Scheme recognised in the Group Income Statement for the year was £nil (2016: £nil). Grant  
date fair value was arrived at through applying a trinomial model, which is a lattice option-pricing model. To the extent that options have vested, 
they will ordinarily remain exercisable for a period up to ten years from the date of grant and are settled in equity through the issue of shares 
once exercised.
The general terms and conditions applicable to the share options granted by the Group are addressed in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration. 
All conditions are non-market based. 
The Executive Share Option Scheme expired in 2011 and no further options have been granted under this scheme.

The average share price during the 2017 financial year was £2.38 (2016: £3.41).
The expected volatility is estimated based on the historic volatility of the Company’s share price over a period equivalent to the life of the relevant

The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences applicable to investments in subsidiaries on the basis that the  
Group can control the timing and realisation of these temporary differences, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. Given that participation exemptions and tax credits would be available in the context of the Group’s investments in subsidiaries 
and joint ventures in the majority of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, the aggregate amount of any unrecognised deferred tax liability 
arising in respect of temporary differences would be immaterial. No provision has been recognised in respect of deferred tax relating to unremitted 
earnings of subsidiaries as there is no commitment to remit earnings.
No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of certain tax losses and other attributes incurred by the Group on the grounds that there is 
insufficient evidence that the assets will be recoverable. In the event that sufficient profits are generated in the relevant jurisdictions in the future, 
these assets may be recovered. The unrecognised deferred tax asset at 29 September 2017 was £52.6m (2016: £53.8m). No deferred tax asset is 
recognised in respect of certain capital losses incurred by the Group on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that the assets will be 
recoverable. The unrecognised deferred tax asset at 29 September 2017 was £10.9 million (2016: £11.3m). Recognition of deferred tax assets is a 
key judgement in the Group Financial Statements.
FACTORS EFFECTING THE FUTURE TAX CHARGE
The tax charge in future periods will be impacted by any changes to the corporation tax rate in force in the countries in which the Group operates. 
There is a degree of uncertainty over the level of the future tax rate, due to a combination of factors including US tax reform, BEPS (Base Erosion 
and Profit Shifting) actions and the impact of Brexit on levels of UK taxation.
The main rate of UK corporation tax reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and will reduce further to 17% with effect from 1 April 
2020. The rate reductions to both 19% and to 17% were enacted during the prior period. These rate reductions have therefore been taken into 
account in the calculation of the UK-related deferred tax balances. 
In the US, the Federal rate of 35% is taken into account in the calculation of the US related balances with the State rate determined by the States in 
which the Group operates. There are proposals to reduce the federal corporation tax rate in the United States to 20%. These proposals were not 
enacted by 29 September 2017 and therefore have not been taken into account in the calculation of the US-related deferred tax balances.
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the Group’s provision for income 
taxes and deferred taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary 
course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. 
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income  
tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Adjustments in respect of prior periods arose largely on the 
settlement of tax authority enquiries and/or closure of open periods.

11.  EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE
Basic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period, excluding Ordinary Shares purchased by the Company and held in trust in respect of the 
Annual Bonus Scheme, the Performance Share Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme. The adjusted figures for basic and diluted earnings 
per Ordinary Share is calculated as profit attributable to equity holders of the Company adjusted to exclude exceptional items (net of tax), the 
effect of foreign exchange (‘FX’) on inter-company and certain external balances where hedge accounting is not applied, the movement in the  
fair value of all derivative financial instruments and related debt adjustments, the amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets (net of tax) 
and the effect of interest expense relating to legacy defined benefit pension liabilities (net of tax).

DILUTED EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE
Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding to assume conversion  
of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares. Employee Performance Share Plan awards, which are performance based, are treated as contingently issuable 
shares, because their issue is contingent upon satisfaction of specified performance conditions in addition to the passage of time. These contingently 
issuable Ordinary Shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per Ordinary Share where the conditions governing exercisability have 
not been satisfied as at the end of the reporting period. A total of 6,619,322 (2016: 6,042,288) unvested shares were excluded from the diluted earnings 
per share calculation as they were either antidilutive or contingently issuable Ordinary Shares which had not satisfied the performance conditions 
attaching at the end of the 2017 financial year. 142 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

During the year the Group recognised a £29.9m impairment charge relating to computer software and intangible assets. This charge was included as 
an exceptional item in operating costs in the Group Income Statement (Note 7).
Goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (‘CGU’s) that are expected to benefit from 
that business combination. A summary of the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill by CGU is as follows:
2017

Convenience Foods UK 408.9 406.5 
Convenience Foods US 386.1 68.3 
Ingredients and Property 2.1 2.1 
797.1 476.9
IMPAIRMENT TESTING AND GOODWILL
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing based on the business unit 
into which the business will be assimilated. Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to three individual cash-generating 
units; Convenience Foods UK; Convenience Foods US and Ingredients and Property.
The recoverable amount of all of the Group’s CGUs has been determined based on a value in use calculation. The calculation uses cash flow 
projections of CGUs based on the 2018 budget and the four year strategic plan formally approved by the Board of Directors and specifically exclude 
incremental profits and other cash flows stemming from any potential future acquisitions. Cash flows beyond the five year plan period have been 
calculated by extrapolating the year five forecast cash flows using a steady 2% (2016: 2%) growth rate (reflecting inflation but no other growth) for  
a further period of 25 years and discounting these back to present values. Applying these techniques, no impairment arose in either FY17 or FY16. 144 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
13. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
IMPAIRMENT TESTING AND GOODWILL CONTINUED
The application of a terminal value of 30 years to the cash flows has been arrived at after taking account of the Group’s strong financial position,  
its established history of earnings growth and cash flow generation, its proven ability to pursue and integrate value enhancing acquisitions and 
the nature of the Consumer Foods market.
KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE VALUE IN USE CALCULATIONS
Estimation of the carrying value of goodwill is a key judgemental estimate in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements.
CONVENIENCE FOODS UK CGU AND INGREDIENTS AND PROPERTY CGU
DISCOUNT RATE
A present value of the future cash flows of the Convenience Foods UK CGU and the Ingredients and Property CGU is calculated using a discount rate  
of 8% (2016: 8%). The discount rate used is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model adjusted for 
the Group’s specific beta coefficient together with a country risk premium. The value assigned to the UK CGU and the Ingredients and Property CGU 
discount rate is consistent with external sources of information.
The table below is a description of the approach used to determine the values assigned to each key assumption for the purpose of impairment 
testing for the Convenience Foods UK CGU and the Ingredients and Property CGU:
Key assumptions Basis for determining values assigned to key assumptions
Profitability 
growth
Future profitability is based 
on a five year plan and 
takes past experience into 
account as management 
places value on this key 
assumption based on the 
Group’s established history of 
sales and earnings growth.
Management also considers 
external sources of 
information, such as Nielsen 
market data and IGD research, 
pertaining to the estimated 
growth of the UK market as 
well as the edible oil and 
molasses food business, UK 
and Irish property market 
data, customer behaviour, 
consumer behaviour, 
competitor activity, long 
and short-term customer 
growth targets, contract wins 
and customer attrition.
In any areas of 
significant uncertainty 
Management seek to take 
a conservative approach 
to attributing values to 
key assumptions.
The value assigned to 
profitability reflects modest 
revenue growth and increased 
average future profitability 
growth rates. Revenue and 
profitability estimates are 
consistent with external 
sources of information 
pertaining to estimated 
growth of the UK convenience 
food market and profitability 
is consistent with past 
experience of the Group. 
Capital 
expenditure
Capital expenditure is 
budgeted and forecast 
by assigning values to 
the investment required 
to deliver the estimated 
future profitability growth 
of the category and to 
deliver cost savings. 
Management assigns 
this value based on past 
experience of the Group’s 
capital expenditure 
requirements as well 
as external sources 
such as quotes from 
suppliers/contractors.
Working 
capital
Working capital requirements 
are based on historical 
trends and past experience 
taking the budgeted future 
profitability into account.
As a group, Greencore has 
negative working capital. 
This is borne out by past 
experience. The Group 
assumes no change in working 
capital estimates after year 
one of the budget period.
Inflation Management considers the 
UK and Ireland inflation rate.
Values assigned to 
the inflation rate are 
consistent with external 
sources of information 
such as government and 
analyst predictions.
The prior year assumptions were prepared on the same basis.

13. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
US CONVENIENCE FOODS CGU
DISCOUNT RATE
A present value of the future cash flows of the Convenience Foods US CGU is calculated using a discount rate of 8% (2016: 8%). The discount rate 
used is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model adjusted for the Group’s specific beta 
coefficient together with a country risk premium. The value assigned to the US CGU discount rate is consistent with external sources of information. 
The table below is a description of the approach used to determine the values assigned to each key assumption for the purpose of impairment 
testing for the Convenience Foods US CGU:
Key assumptions Basis for determining values assigned to key assumptions
Profitability 
growth
Future profitability is based 
on a five year plan and 
takes past experience into 
account as management 
places value on this key 
assumption based on the 
Group’s established history of 
revenue and earnings growth 
and experience with bedding 
down new acquisitions. 
Five year profitability 
forecasts were prepared for 
the newly acquired Peacock 
Foods business during 
the year. Management 
relied on experience of the 
incumbent executive team 
and past performance in 
preparing these forecasts.
Management also considers 
external sources of information 
such as market data 
pertaining to the estimated 
growth of the US market, 
significant new contract wins, 
anticipated performance of 
new acquisitions, customer 
behaviour, consumer 
behaviour, competitor activity, 
long and short-term customer 
growth targets, contract wins 
and customer attrition.
In any areas of significant 
uncertainty Management 
seeks to take a conservative 
approach to attributing 
values to key assumptions.
The value assigned to 
revenue is consistent 
with external sources of 
information pertaining to 
estimated growth of the US 
market. Where applicable 
the value assigned to 
profitability growth in the 
US is specific to the group. 
Given the categories the 
business operates in and 
the impact of material 
customer wins, it exceeds the 
long-term average growth 
rate in the US market.
Capital 
expenditure
Capital expenditure is 
budgeted and forecast 
by assigning values to 
the investment required 
to deliver the estimated 
future profitability growth 
of the category and to 
deliver cost savings.
Management assigns 
this value based on past 
experience of the Group’s 
capital expenditure 
requirements as well 
as external sources 
such as quotes from 
suppliers/contractors.
Working 
capital
Working capital requirements 
are based on historical 
trends and past experience 
taking the budgeted future 
profitability into account.
Inflation Management considers 
the US inflation rate.
Values assigned to 
the inflation rate are 
consistent with external 
sources of information 
such as government and 
analyst predictions.
The prior year assumptions were prepared on the same basis.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Sensitivity analysis has been carried out on each of the key assumptions used in the value in use calculation for each CGU identified. The Group 
believe that any reasonable change in the assumptions applied would not give rise to the carrying value of goodwill assigned to each CGU 
exceeding the recoverable amount of that CGU. The carrying value of goodwill assigned to each CGU is not negatively impacted by a decline  
in projected cashflows of 18%, a reduction in the inflationary linked long-term growth rate to zero or an increase in the discount rate of 44%. 146 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

20. BORROWINGS CONTINUED
BANK BORROWINGS
The Group’s bank borrowings are denominated in sterling, US dollar and euro and bear floating rate interest. Interest is set at commercial rates 
based on a spread over sterling LIBOR, US dollar LIBOR and EURIBOR for periods of up to six months. At 29 September 2017, the Group’s bank 
borrowings comprised of £123m, $307m and €5m (2016: £112m, $70m amd €7.5m), with the latest maturity being March 2020.
At 29 September 2017 , the Group had available £179.3m (2016: £177 .5m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions 
precedent had been met. Uncommitted facilities undrawn at 29 September 2017 amounted to £25.1m (2016: £31.9m).
PRIVATE PLACEMENT NOTES
The Group’s outstanding Private Placement Notes of $139.5m and £18m at 29 September 2017 (2016: $139.5 and £18m) were issued as fixed rate 
debt in October 2013 ($65m) and June 2016 ($74.5m and £18m) with maturities ranging between October 2021 and June 2026.
NON-BANK BORROWINGS
The Group’s non-bank borrowings were drawn in March 2014 and bear floating rate interest that is based on a spread over EURIBOR for periods  
of six months. The funds received were swapped (using cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) from floating euro to fixed US dollar rates. At 29 September 2017, the Group’s non-bank borrowings 
comprised of €70m (2016: €70m), with the latest maturity being March 2020.
FINANCE LEASES
The Group has finance leases for various items of property, plant and equipment. Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together 
with the present value of the net minimum lease payments are set out in Note 28.
GUARANTEES
The Group’s financing facilities are secured by guarantees from Greencore Group plc and cross guarantees from various companies within the 
Group. The Group treats these guarantees as insurance contracts and accounts for them as such.
21. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks that include interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and price 
risk. These financial risks are actively managed by the Group’s treasury department under strict policies and guidelines approved by the Board of 
Directors. The Group’s treasury department actively monitors market conditions with a view to minimising the exposure of the Group to changing 
market factors while at the same time minimising the volatility of the funding costs of the Group. The Group uses derivative financial instruments 
such as foreign currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps to manage the financial risks associated with the underlying 
business activities of the Group.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
The following table analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not observable market data (un-observable inputs).
During the year, there were no transfers between the different levels identified above. 150 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

21. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates arises from its floating rate borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives. 
The Group’s policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings. This is managed by reviewing the debt profile of the Group 
regularly on a currency by currency basis and by selectively using interest rate swaps to manage the level of floating interest rate exposure.
Sensitivity Analysis for Floating Rate Debt
The full-year impact of both an upward and downward movement in each applicable interest rate and interest rate curve by 100 basis points 
(assuming all the other variables remain constant) is shown below.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group is exposed to currency risk as follows:
• Sales and purchases in certain businesses; and
• Financing.
Sales and Purchases in Certain Businesses
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases in certain businesses that are denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currency of the entity concerned. The Group utilises foreign currency contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange exposures arising from 
these transactions.
The Group’s trading entity exposures to foreign currency risk for amounts not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant entity at the 
Balance Sheet date were as follows (excluding derivative financial instruments):

Cash and cash equivalents 0.4 3.5 – 0.2 0.1 0.4
Gross Balance Sheet exposure 0.1 3.7 0.1 0.3 0.9 0.2
Financing
The Group finances its operations by obtaining funding at Group level through external borrowings, and where appropriate, these borrowings  
are designated as net investment hedges. This enables gains and losses arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings to be 
recognised in equity, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of the foreign 
operations. A foreign exchange gain of £25.8m (2016: loss of £25.7m) was recognised in equity during the period in respect of borrowings 
designated as net investment hedges.
The Group has financed its investment in the UK by directly borrowing in sterling, with the US business being funded in US dollar. Although the 
majority of the US funding is obtained by directly borrowing US dollar, an element of the funding is achieved through euro borrowings converted 
to US dollar using cross-currency interest rate swaps. 152 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK CONTINUED
Sensitivity Analysis for Primary Foreign Currency Risk
A 10% strengthening of the sterling exchange rate against the euro or US dollar exchange rates in respect of the translation of amounts not 
denominated in the functional currency of relevant entities into the functional currency would impact profit after tax and equity by the amount 
shown below. This assumes that all other variables remain constant. A 10% weakening of the sterling exchange rate against the euro or US dollar 
exchange rates would have an equal and opposite effect.

Impact of 10% strengthening of sterling vs dollar gain/(loss) (0.5) 3.5 36.7 20.0
The effect on equity of a movement between sterling, US dollar and euro would be offset by the translation of the net assets of the subsidiaries 
against which the US dollar and euro borrowings are hedged. The above calculations do not include the variability in Group profitability which 
arises on the translation of foreign currency subsidiaries’ financial statements to Group presentation currency.
LIQUIDITY RISK
The Group’s policy on funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient long-term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet 
foreseeable peak borrowing requirements with an appropriate level of additional headroom. A prudent approach to liquidity risk management  
is taken by the Group by spreading the maturities of its debt using long-term financing. The Group’s treasury department actively monitors the 
current and future funding requirements of the business on a daily basis. Excess funds are placed on short-term deposit for up to one month  
whilst ensuring that sufficient cash is available on demand to meet expected operational requirements.
During the period the Group put in place a new $249m bank facility to part fund the acquisition of Peacock Foods, which completed on 
30 December 2016. In March 2017 the maturity of the primary bank facility of £300m was extended by 1 year to March 2022. In addition,  
the Group also extended the maturity of a £50m bilateral facility bank for a further 18 months to March 2020.

CREDIT RISK
Credit risk refers to the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligations on financial assets held in the Group 
Balance Sheet. Risk is monitored both centrally and locally. The Group derives a significant proportion of its revenue from sales to a limited number  
of major customers. Sales to individual customers can be of significant value and the failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially 
impact the Group’s results. The Group derives significant benefit from trading with its large customers and manages the risk by regularly reviewing 
the credit history and rating of all significant customers.
The Group assessed the carrying value of other receivables based on management’s assessment and knowledge of the counterparty. The amounts 
due were neither past due nor impaired at 29 September 2017 .
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the Group Balance Sheet:

Revenue earned individually from two customers in Convenience Foods UK & Ireland of £274.4m and £249.3m respectively, represents more than

and £163.2m respectively represented more than 10% of the Group’s revenue).
The Group also manages credit risk in the UK through the use of a receivables purchase arrangement. Under the terms of this agreement the 
Group has transferred substantially all of the credit risk and control of the receivables, which are subject to this agreement, and accordingly, 
£41.2m (2016: £34.7m) has been derecognised at year end. 154 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to trade on a going concern basis while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. Invested capital is defined as the sum of all current and non-current assets 
(including intangibles), less current and non-current liabilities with the exception of debt items, derivatives and retirement benefit obligations.  
The Group monitors the Return on Invested Capital of the Group as a key performance indicator, the calculation is set out on page 179.

hedged item. All other derivative instruments are classified by reference to their maturity date.
Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swaps
The Group utilises cross-currency interest rate swaps to swap floating rate euro denominated debt of €70m into fixed rate US dollar debt  
of $96.7m. The floating rate is based on EURIBOR. The euro to US dollar swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Interest Rate Swaps
The Group utilises interest rate swaps to convert floating rate sterling debt and floating rate US dollar debt into fixed rate debt liabilities.  
The principal amount of the Group’s borrowings which are swapped at 29 September 2017 total £90m and $30m (2016: £100m and US$30m).  
In addition, the Group has entered into forward starting interest rate swaps of £100m and $40m, split into four tranches of £25m and eight 
tranches of $5m each respectively, commencing in October 2018 and October 2019 respectively with maturities in October 2021. The total 
nominal value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges under lAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement at 
29 September 2017 was £140m and $70m inclusive of forward starting derivatives (2016: £150m and $30m). At 29 September 2017, the fixed  
interest rates varied from 0.558% to 2.387% (2016: 1.25% to 2.10%) with maturities ranging from October 2018 to October 2021 (2016: October

LEASES
Lease provisions consist of: (a) provisions for leasehold dilapidations in respect of certain leases, relating to the estimated cost of reinstating 
leasehold premises to their original condition at the time of the inception of the lease as provided for in the lease agreement; and (b) provisions 
for onerous contractual obligations for properties held under operating lease. It is anticipated that these will be payable within ten years.
During the year the group recognised provisions on acquisitions of £23.3m related to lease obligations.
REMEDIATION AND CLOSURE
Remediation and closure obligations were established to cover either a statutory, contractual or constructive obligation of the Group.
Remediation and closure obligations amounting to £6.1m provided in the year relates to the exit from the Evercreech facility. The opening 
provision relate to the remediation costs associated with former sugar processing sites.
TRANSACTION COSTS
The transaction costs provision related to transaction costs incurred to 29 September 2017 relating to the acquisition of Peacock Foods.
OTHER
Other provisions primarily consist of provisions for potential litigation and other claims related to the acquisition of Peacock Foods.
24. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes in all of its main operating locations. The Group also has legacy defined benefit 
pension schemes, which were closed to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION SCHEMES
The total cost charged to income of £7.5m (2016: £7.3m) represents employer contributions payable to the defined contribution pension schemes  
at rates specified in the rules of the schemes. At year end, £0.7m (2016: £0.7m) was included in other accruals in respect of defined contribution 
pension accruals.

24. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED
LEGACY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEMES
The Group operates four legacy defined benefit pension schemes in the Republic of Ireland (the ‘Irish schemes’) and three legacy defined benefit 
pension schemes and two legacy defined benefit commitments in the UK (the UK schemes). The Projected Unit Credit actuarial cost method has 
been employed in determining the present value of the defined benefit pension obligation arising, the related current service cost and, where 
applicable, past service cost. 
These plans have broadly similar regulatory frameworks. Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment decisions and contribution 
schedules, lies with the Company and the respective boards of trustees.
All of the legacy defined benefit pension schemes are closed to future accrual and there is an assumption applied in the valuation of the schemes 
that there will be no discretionary increases in pensions in payment. Scheme assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Group’s cash contributions to its pension schemes are generally determined by reference to actuarial valuations undertaken by the schemes’ 
actuaries at intervals not exceeding three years and not by the provisions of IAS 19 Employee Benefits . These funding valuations can differ materially 
from the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits . In particular the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities under IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits is determined by reference to the yield on high grade corporate bonds of comparable duration to the liabilities. In contrast the discount 
rate used in the ongoing valuation is generally determined by reference to the yield on the scheme’s current and projected future investment portfolio. 
Where a funding valuation reveals a deficit in a scheme, the Group will generally agree a schedule of contributions with the Trustees designed to 
address the deficit over an agreed future time horizon. The Group has agreed funding valuations in respect of all its relevant obligations including 
the UK Defined Benefit Scheme in March 2017. Based on these agreed valuations, cash contributions are expected to remain unchanged at 
approximately £15m in FY18. All of the schemes are operating under the terms of funding proposals agreed with the relevant pension authorities. 
Actuarial gains and losses and the associated movement in deferred tax are recognised in retained income via the Group Statement of Recognised 
Income and Expense.
Full actuarial valuations were carried out between 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2017. In general, actuarial valuations are not available for public 
inspection, however, the results of valuations are advised to the members of the various schemes.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN RISKS
The employee benefit plans expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: 
Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If assets underperform this 
yield this will create a deficit. The plans hold equities which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility 
and risk in the short term. The allocation to equities is monitored to ensure that it remains appropriate given the plans’ long-term objectives. 
Discount rates: The discount rates employed in determining the present value of the schemes’ liabilities are determined by reference to market 
yields at the Balance Sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the associated 
post-employment benefit obligations. Changes in discount rates impact the quantum of the liabilities. 
Inflation risk: Some of the Group’s pension obligations have an inflation linkage; higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although in most 
cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation). The rate of inflation is derived from the 
RPI in the UK. The breakeven rate in the Eurozone is used for the basis for the Irish inflation assumption. 160 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

LEGACY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEMES CONTINUED
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN RISKS CONTINUED
Longevity risk: In the majority of cases, the Group’s legacy defined benefit pension schemes provide benefits for the life of the member, so 
increases in life expectancy will therefore give rise to higher liabilities. 
The size of the obligation is sensitive to judgemental actuarial assumptions. These include demographic assumptions covering mortality, economic 
assumptions covering price inflation and benefit increases, together with the discount rate. The expected return on plan assets is also a key judgement.
The principal actuarial assumptions are as follows:
 
 
UK Schemes Irish Schemes
2017 2016 2017 2016
Rate of increase in pension payments* 3.05% 2.95% 0% 0%

Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on information from published statistics and experience in all geographic 
regions and are selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of the relevant plans. In relation to the UK, this has been 
done by reflecting the characteristics of the membership using Club Vita research combined with the CMI 2016 model for future improvements in 
mortality. The average life expectancy, in years, of a pensioner retiring at 65 is as follows:

The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analysis 
intends to provide assistance in understanding the sensitivity of the valuation of pension liabilities to market movements on discount rates, 
inflation rates and mortality assumptions for scheme beneficiaries.
The Trustees invest the funds in a range of assets with the objective of maximising the fund return with a view to containing the cost of funding  
the scheme whilst at the same time maintaining an acceptable risk profile. In assessing the risk profile the Trustees take account of the nature and 
duration of the liabilities. Approximately 29% (2016:26%) of the UK funds and 70% (2016:49%) of the Irish funds are invested in liability matching 
investments. The Trustees review investment strategy regularly.

GREENCORE GROUP PENSION SCHEME CONTINGENT ASSET
The Greencore Group Pension Scheme (‘the Scheme’) has a mortgage and charge relating to certain property assets of the Group with a carrying 
value of £5.2m (2016: £5.2m ) for use as a contingent asset of the Scheme. Under the terms of the mortgage and charge, should a disposal of these 
property assets occur that meets certain requirements, the Scheme is entitled to a portion of the sale proceeds. The maximum amount recoverable 
by the Trustees of the Scheme under the mortgage and charge is the amount required for the Scheme to meet the minimum funding standard 
under the Pension Acts 1990–2009. 
GREENCORE UK LEGACY DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME
In 2013, the Group entered into arrangements with the legacy Greencore UK Retirement Defined Benefit Scheme (‘the UK Scheme’) to address 
£40.0m of the actuarial deficit in the UK Scheme. The substance of this arrangement is to reduce the cash funding which would otherwise be 
required based on the latest actuarial valuation, whilst improving the security of the UK Scheme members’ benefits.
On 10 May 2013, the Group made a contribution to the UK Scheme of £32.8m. On the same day, the UK Scheme’s trustees invested £32.8m in 
Greencore Convenience Foods Limited Partnership (‘SLP’) as a limited partner. SLP was established by Greencore Prepared Meals Limited, a 
wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, to hold properties of the Group and loan notes issued by Greencore Convenience Foods Limited Liability 
Partnership (‘LLP’). LLP was established by SLP and holds certain trade receivables of the Group. As at 29 September 2017, SLP held properties 
with a carrying value of £17.1m (2016: £17.6m), trade receivables with a carrying value of £36.0m (2016: £33.1m), and a call on restricted cash of £nil 
(2016:£2.9m) in the Group Financial Statements. The properties are leased to other Group undertakings. As a partner in the SLP , the Scheme is 
entitled to a semi-annual share of the profits of SLP until 2029.
These partnerships are controlled by the Group, and as such, they are fully consolidated as wholly owned subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 10 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits , the investment held by the Scheme in SLP , does not represent a plan asset 
for the purposes of the Group’s consolidated accounts. Accordingly, the Scheme’s deficit position presented in the Group Financial Statements 
does not reflect the investment in SLP held by the Scheme. Distributions from SLP to the Scheme are treated as contributions by employers in the 
Group Financial Statements on a cash basis.

The Company and certain subsidiaries have given guarantees in respect of borrowings and other obligations arising in the ordinary course of the 
business of the Company and other Group undertakings. The Company and other Group undertakings consider these guarantees to be insurance 
contracts and account for them as such. The Company treats these guarantee contracts as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes 
probable that a payment will be required under such guarantees.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 357, Companies Act 2014, the Company has guaranteed the liabilities of certain subsidiary undertakings in 
the Republic of Ireland for the financial year ended 29 September 2017 and as a result, such subsidiary undertakings have been exempted from 
the filing provisions of Companies Act 2014.
Various subsidiaries of the Group are subject to legal proceedings. Provisions for anticipated settlement costs and associated expenses arising 
from legal and other disputes are made where a reliable estimate can be made of the probable outcome of the proceedings.
The Group provided bank guarantees to third parties for amounts of £9.2m (2016: £3.1m).
31. ACQUISITION OF UNDERTAKINGS
ACQUISITION IN THE CURRENT YEAR
PEACOCK FOODS
On 30 December 2016, the Group acquired 100% of CB-Peacock Holdings Inc. (‘Peacock Foods’), a US based convenience food manufacturer. 
Peacock Foods is headquartered in Geneva, Illinois and operates seven manufacturing facilities across the US which offer two million square feet of 
manufacturing capacity and employs approximately 1,150 staff at these facilities. The acquisition transformed the Group’s US business and provides 
further opportunities for growth by significantly increasing the Group’s scale, exposure to leading brands in fast growing categories, extending  
its presence in new channels and with new customers, building its manufacturing footprint and, widening its geographical reach, enhancing its 
management talent and growing its potential for future profitability.
The principal factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill on the acquisition of Peacock Foods is the expected realisation of future growth 
potential with new and existing customers in fast growing categories, the synergies that will be achieved by the enlarged group, expansion in the 
US market and a highly skilled management team. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
As part of the acquisition the Group acquired trade receivables with a fair value of £42.7m. Management estimate that acquired receivables will be 
collected in full. Acquisition related costs of £15.2m were charged to exceptional items in the Group Income Statement for the year ended

The post acquisition impact of the Peacock Foods acquisition on the Group was to increase revenue by £617.2m and Group net profit by £5.4m. If 
the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the Group’s financial year, revenue would have been £207.3m higher and the Group net profit for 
the year would have been £2.1m higher.

ACQUISITION IN THE CURRENT YEAR CONTINUED
HEATHROW
On 26 June 2017 , the Group entered into an asset purchase agreement with Tasties of Chester Limited. The Group agreed to purchase the business, 
including the related assets (‘Heathrow’), which manufactures and sells breaded and ‘food to go’ products of the seller for a total consideration  
of £4.9m. The acquisition provides the Group’s Convenience Food division with additional manufacturing capacity to meet the expanding demand 
within the sector.
The principal factor contributing to the recognition of goodwill on the acquisition of Heathrow is the expected realisation of production and purchasing 
synergies with existing customers, through the complementary product offering of Heathrow with the existing product offering of the Group.
As part of the acquisition the Group acquired trade receivables with a fair value of £1.5m. Management estimate that acquired receivables will  
be collected in full. Acquisition related costs of £0.4m were charged to exceptional items in the Income Statement for the year ended 
29 September 2017.
The post acquisition impact of the Heathrow acquisition on the Group was to increase revenue by £2.7m and decrease Group profit by £0.5m.  
If the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the Group’s financial year, revenue would have been £7.1m higher and the profit for the year 
would have been £1.4m lower.

ACQUISITION IN THE PRIOR YEAR
ATHERSTONE
On 22 July 2016, the Group acquired 100% of The Sandwich Factory (‘Atherstone’), a manufacturer of food to go products for the UK convenience 
food market. The company employs approximately 480 staff at its purpose-built facility in Atherstone, Warwickshire. The acquisition provides the 
Group’s Convenience Food division with additional manufacturing capability to meet the expanding demand within the sector.
The principal factor contributing to the recognition of goodwill on the acquisition of The Sandwich Factory is the expected realisation of production 
and purchasing synergies with existing customers, through the complementary product offering of The Sandwich Factory with the existing product 
offering of the Group.
As part of the acquisition the Group acquired trade receivables with a fair value of £8.2m. Management have collected in full acquired receivables. 
Acquisition related costs of £1.0m and £0.3m were charged to exceptional items in the Group Income Statement for the year ended 30 September 
2016 and 29 September 2017 respectively. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
The post acquisition impact of The Sandwich Factory acquisition on the Group was to increase revenue by £12.4m and Group profit by £0.4m.  
If the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the Group’s financial year, revenue would have been £35.9m higher and the profit for the year 
would have been £1.0m higher.

1. COMPANY STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Company Financial Statements of Greencore Group plc (‘the Company’) were prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’). In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies 
the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted 
IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Acts 2014 and has set out below where advantage  
of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. 
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
• A Cash Flow Statement and related notes;
• Comparative period reconciliations for tangible fixed assets and share capital;
• Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
• Disclosures in respect of capital management;
• The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs; and
• Disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and include the equivalent 
disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• Certain disclosures required by IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments; and
• Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: disclosures.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial 
statements. The company adopted FRS 101 for the first time in the prior financial year.
The financial statements have been prepared in sterling and are rounded to the nearest million.
PROFIT AND LOSS
The profit attributable to equity shareholders dealt with in the Financial Statements of the Parent Company was £17.9m (2016: profit of £90.3m).  
In accordance with section 304 of the Companies Act 2014, the Company is availing of the exemption from presenting its individual Income 
Statement to the Annual General Meeting and from filing it with the Registrar of Companies.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company’s functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Balance Sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement.
TRADE AND OTHER DEBTORS
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost net of provision for impairment.  
A provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will be unable to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the 
probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Any trade and other receivables included in non-current assets are carried at amortised cost in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost. Cash and cash equivalents include cash 
in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are 
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Trade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently at the higher of cost or payment or settlement amounts. Where the 
time value of money is material, payables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
INTRA-GROUP GUARANTEES
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a 
contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Notes to the Company Financial Statements
year ended 29 September 2017 172 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. COMPANY STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FINANCIAL ASSETS
Investments in subsidiaries and associated undertakings are held at cost. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events  
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, 
the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. When the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
FIXED ASSETS
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each fixed asset during its expected useful life 
using the straight-line or reducing balance methods over the following periods:
Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 3–25 years 
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company grants equity settled share-based payments and share awards to employees (through the Executive Share Option plan, the Share 
Award Scheme, the Performance Share Plan and employee ShareSave Schemes). In the case of these options, the fair value is determined using a 
trinomial valuation model, as measured at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
When the exercise of share options results in the issuance of shares, the proceeds received are credited to the share capital and share premium 
accounts, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
TAXATION
The expense charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in the Statement 
of Recognised Income and Expense or directly in equity.
Current tax represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted, 
at the balance sheet date along with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Company provides in full for deferred tax assets and liabilities (using the liability method), arising from temporary differences between the tax 
base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Financial Statements except where they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability that at the date of initial recognition does not affect accounting or taxable profit or loss on a 
transaction that is not a business combination. Such differences result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in future periods. 
A deferred tax asset is only recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences 
giving rise to the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not subject to discounting and are measured at the tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at  
the Balance Sheet date. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where  
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLANS
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate defined contribution scheme. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as employee service  
is received. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN
Pension benefits are funded over the employees’ years of service by way of contributions to a legacy defined benefit scheme operated by the 
Company. Pursuant to IAS 19.31, as the Directors of the Company are unable to determine the portion of the pension scheme assets and liabilities 
which relate to the employees of the Company, the Company has accounted for the contributions as if the scheme were a defined contribution 
scheme. Contributions to the plan are charged to the Income Statement as due. Any difference between the amounts charged to the Income 
Statement and contributions paid to the pension scheme are included in debtors or creditors in the Balance Sheet.
SHARE CAPITAL
ORDINARY SHARES
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are taken as a deduction, 
within equity net of tax, from the proceeds.

SHARE CAPITAL CONTINUED
TREASURY SHARES
Where the Company purchases the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from the total shareholders’ equity and 
classified as treasury shares until they are cancelled. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included 
in total shareholders’ equity.
DIVIDENDS
Interim dividends payable are recognised as a liability of the Company when the Board of Directors’ resolves to pay the dividend and the shareholders 
have been notified in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. Final dividends of the Company are recognised as a liability when they 
have been approved by the Company’s shareholders.
CASH FLOW
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available to it under FRS 101 not to prepare a statement of cash flows.

8. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Company operates a legacy defined benefit pension scheme and a defined contribution pension scheme, with assets held in separate trustee 
administered funds.
Some employees of the Company are members of a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme, which is operated in conjunction with other 
Group companies. The defined benefit pension scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution pension scheme on the grounds that 
the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. The defined 
benefit pension scheme of which some employees are members is not included on the Balance Sheet of the Company as it is not possible to 
determine the proportion of the assets and liabilities of the scheme that relates to the Company on a reasonable and consistent basis. The assets 
and liabilities associated with the defined benefit pension scheme are recognised on the Balance Sheet of Irish Sugar DAC. A substantial number 
of deferred beneficiaries of the scheme were employees of entities that either no longer trade or are no longer owned by the Group.
Total pension costs for the year amounted to £nil (2016: £2.7m) in respect of legacy defined benefit pension schemes and £0.4m (2016: £0.4m) in 
respect of defined contribution pension schemes. At year end, £0.03m (2016: £0.03m) was included in other accruals in respect of amounts owed 
to the scheme.
Disclosures in relation to this and all other Group legacy defined benefit pension schemes are given in Note 24 to the Group Financial Statements.
9. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company grants share options under various share option plans as detailed in the Report of the Directors. A charge of £3.5m (2016: £3.2m) 
was recognised in the Income Statement of the Company in respect of the employees of the Company. All disclosures relating to the plans are 
given in Note 6 to the Group Financial Statements.
10. FINANCIAL GUARANTEE CONTRACTS
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 357, Companies Act 2014, the Company has guaranteed the liabilities of certain subsidiary undertakings  
in the Republic of Ireland for the financial year ended 29 September 2017. Where the Company has entered into financial guarantee contracts  
to guarantee the indebtedness of such subsidiaries, the Company considers these to be insurance contracts and accounts for them as such.
The Company is party to cross guarantees on Group borrowings. These are treated as insurance contracts and accounted for as such.
1 1 .  STATUTORY INFORMATION
During the period the average number of persons employed by the Company (excluding Non-Executive Directors) was 26 (2016: 26).
Directors’ remuneration is disclosed in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and in Note 32 to the Group Financial Statements.

Alternative Performance Measures
The Group uses the following Alternative Performance Measures (‘APMs’) which are non-IFRS measures to monitor the performance of its 
operations and of the Group as a whole: Pro Forma Sales Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Operating Margin, 
Adjusted Profit before Tax (‘PBT’), Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Share, Maintenance and Strategic Capital Expenditure, Operating 
Cash Flow, Net Debt and Return on Invested Capital (‘ROIC’).
PRO FORMA SALES GROWTH
The Group uses Pro Forma Sales Growth as a supplemental measure of its performance. The Group believes that Pro Forma Sales Growth 
provides a more accurate guide to underlying revenue performance. Pro Forma Sales Growth for FY17 adjusts reported revenue to reflect 
ownership of both Peacock Foods and The Sandwich Factory for the full period of both FY16 and FY17 and excludes the impact of the Heathrow 
acquisition. These figures are also presented on a constant currency basis and exclude the impact of the 53rd week in FY16.

Pro Forma Sales Growth (%) 11.9 5.9 9.4 
In the US, the business operates the majority of its revenue contracts on a pass-through basis where the business takes ownership of the materials 
but is entitled to pass on the price of materials directly to the customer as part of its finished goods. Accordingly, while revenue and cost of sales 
can be impacted by changes in material inflation or deflation, these changes do not impact profit delivery, therefore volume growth is a more 
important indicator of performance. 
Pro Forma Volume Growth for Convenience Foods US was approximately 7% in the year.
ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN 
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted Operating Margin are used by the Group to measure the underlying and ongoing 
operating performance of each business unit and of the Group as a whole.
The Group calculates Adjusted Operating Profit as operating profit before amortisation of acquisition related intangibles and exceptional charges. 
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted Operating Profit plus deprecation and amortisation. Adjusted Operating Margin is calculated as Adjusted 
Operating Profit divided by reported revenue.

Adjusted Operating Margin:

ADJUSTED EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (‘EPS’)
The Group uses Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS as key measures of the overall underlying performance of the Group and returns generated 
for each share.
Adjusted Earnings is calculated as Profit attributable to equity holders (as shown on the Group’s Income Statement) adjusted to exclude exceptional 
items (net of tax), the effect of foreign exchange (FX) on inter-company and external balances where hedge accounting is not applied, the movement 
in the fair value of all derivative financial instruments and related debt adjustments, the amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets (net  
of tax) and the interest expense relating to legacy defined benefit pension liabilities (net of tax). Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing Adjusted 
Earnings by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year, excluding Ordinary Shares purchased by Greencore and held 
in trust in respect of the Annual Bonus Plan, the Performance Share Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme, and after adjusting the weighted 
average number of shares in the prior year for the effect of the rights issue and related bonus issue on the average number of shares in issue. 
Adjusted EPS is also referred to as Adjusted Basic EPS.

financial years indicated.

ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX (‘PBT’)
Adjusted PBT is used as a measure by the Group to measure overall performance before associated tax charge and exceptional items. Exceptional 
items are deemed to be one-off in nature.
The Group calculates Adjusted PBT as Profit before taxation, excluding tax on share of profit of associate and before, exceptional items, pension 
finance items, amortisation of acquisition related intangibles, FX on inter-company and certain external balances and the movement in the fair 
value of all derivative financial instruments and related debt adjustments.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE 
MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
The Group defines Maintenance Capital Expenditure as the expenditure required for the purpose of sustaining the operating capacity and asset 
base of the Group, and of complying with applicable laws and regulations. It includes continuous improvement projects of less than £1m that will 
generate additional returns for the Group.
STRATEGIC CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
The Group defines Strategic Capital Expenditure as the expenditure required for the purpose of facilitating growth and developing and enhancing 
relationships with existing and new customers. It includes continuous improvement projects of greater than £1m that will generate additional 
returns for the Group. Strategic Capital Expenditure is generally expansionary expenditure creating additional capacity beyond what is necessary to 
maintain the Group’s current competitive position and enables the Group to service new customers and/or contracts or to enter into new categories 
and/or new manufacturing competencies.
The following table sets forth the breakdown of the Groups purchase of property, plant and equipment and purchase of intangible assets 
between Strategic Capital Expenditure and Maintenance Capital Expenditure:

Net cash outflow from capital expenditure 123.3 103.1 
OPERATING CASH FLOW
The Group uses Operating Cash Flow to measure the amount of cash generated by the operating activities of each business unit and of the Group 
as a whole.
The Group calculates Operating Cash Flow as the net cash inflow/(outflow) from operating and investing activities before Strategic Capital 
Expenditure, contributions to legacy defined benefit pension schemes, interest paid, tax paid, acquisition of undertakings, net of cash acquired, 
disposal of undertakings, contract acquisition costs and disposal of investment property.

Total borrowings (539.0) (357.3)
Cash & cash equivalents 19.8 25.5 
Net Debt (519.2) (331.8) 
RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (‘ROIC’)
The Group uses ROIC as a key measure to determine returns from each business unit, along with the measurements of potential new investments. 
The Group uses invested capital as a basis for this calculation as it reflects tangible and intangible assets the Group has added through its capital 
investment programme, the intangible assets the Group has added through acquisition, as well as the working capital requirements of the business.
The Group calculates ROIC as net Adjusted Operating Profit after tax (‘NOPAT’) divided by average invested capital. NOPAT is calculated as Adjusted 
Operating Profit plus share of profit of associates before tax, less tax at the effective rate in the Income Statement. Invested Capital is calculated as  
net assets (total assets less total liabilities) excluding Net Debt and the balance sheet value of derivatives not designated as fair value hedges, it also 
excludes retirement benefit obligations (net of deferred tax assets). Average Invested Capital is calculated by adding together the invested capital from 
the opening and closing balance sheet and dividing by two.
The following table sets forth the calculation of net operating profit after tax (‘NOPAT’) and invested capital used in the calculation of ROIC for  
the financial years indicated in respect of the Group.
