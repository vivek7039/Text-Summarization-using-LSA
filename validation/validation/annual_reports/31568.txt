focus on the many ways in which this commercial momentum  
is being driven. Our opportunity for geographic expansion 
continues to broaden; our sales partners are highly engaged 
and effective, continuing to deliver long term, valuable 
customers; and we are investing in educating developers, 
partners and customers on the power of RPA and the required 
skills to take advantage of it. Our rapidly growing Technology 
Alliance Program, which increasingly positions Blue Prism as the 
‘Operating System’ for digital workforce deployments, presents 
us with further opportunities to develop new revenue streams.
The Group has had a strong start to the first quarter of FY2018  
and as such now expect revenues for the full financial year to be 
comfortably ahead of existing market expectations. Funded by 
the anticipated net proceeds of the Placing we have announced 
today, the additional investment planned for FY2018 to support 
our global growth is expected to increase our revenue growth in 
the next financial year. The 2018 financial year shows every sign 
of being yet another exciting year of growth for Blue Prism. ”

About Blue Prism
The Group’s enterprise-grade 
software enables the automation of 
manual, rules-based, administrative 
processes to create a more agile, cost 
effective and accurate back-office.
Blue Prism’s RPA software delivers  
the world’s most successful digital 
workforce in execution for our 
customers and has executed over  
1bn transactions. Our customers 
include Aegon, BNY Mellon, 
Commerzbank, IBM, ING, Maersk, 
Nokia, Nordea, Procter & Gamble, 
Raiffeisen Bank, Siemens, Westpac 
and Zurich. 
As at 31 October 2017, Blue Prism 
had 187 employees based out of 
offices in Newton-le-Willows and 
London (UK), Sydney (Australia), 
Tokyo (Japan), Bangalore (India), 
Austin, Miami, Chicago, New York 
and San Francisco (US).
What is RPA?
In a perfect world, people interact 
with customers, have ideas and make 
improvements, whilst IT implements 
business rules and logic, bulk processing 
and consistent decisions. In the real 
world, IT has not traditionally been 
capable of adapting or developing at 
the speed of business needs. So people 
end up filling the gaps between 
systems and processes – taking them 
away from the really valuable work.
With Blue Prism, people can get on 
with valuable customer interaction, 
making judgements and improving the 
business. And with Blue Prism’s Robotic 
Process Automation technology, it 
implements business rules and logic, 
bulk processing and consistent 
decisions. How? The Blue Prism digital 
workforce provides businesses with an 
enterprise-strength technology solution 
that supports the pace of business 
change and evolving industry 
requirements.
The vision & the reality The digital workforce
Blue Prism Group plc, a 
UK-headquartered global 
software company, is a 
leader in Robotic Process 
Automation (“RPA”),  
which enables blue-chip 
organisations to create a 
digital workforce powered 
by Blue Prism’s software 
robots that are trained to 
automate routine 
administrative tasks. 
Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”) provides organisations with a fully automated, 
digital workforce that can be more cost-effective, more operationally efficient, 
faster and more accurate. The result to the enterprise is greater productivity from a 
better performing human workforce, freed up to do more value-added tasks. 
Essentially, RPA replicates human action.
What is Blue Prism RPA?
Our latest software (Version 6.0) enables RPA adoption in a way that is far more 
secure, consistent, reliable and scaleable. Importantly, Blue Prism complements 
traditional IT solutions and front office productivity tools. It provides an enterprise-
wide and consistent automation platform with embedded controls and governance 
that is managed by the organisation itself.
What is a Blue Prism software robot?
The Blue Prism software robot is software which mimics the way a human interacts 
with software applications. The software robot is trained by operational staff, who 
have no coding knowledge, to perform routine, rules-based processes, across 
multiple applications if required, no matter how complex and with no human 
intervention. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

The benefits
Improving accuracy and efficiencies
Blue Prism’s digital workforce operates far more effectively 
than humans do, in delivering rote tasks quickly, accurately 
and at scale. Software robots do not get tired or bored, so  
in terms of pure transactional processing, they achieve far 
more efficiency during routine, repetitive, rule-based work. 
Importantly, this opens up opportunities for humans to 
commit more time and focus on higher value activities, those 
which require communication, empathy, judgement-based 
problem solving and so on.
Cost reduction and increased productivity
A software robot can run consistently for 24 hours, 7 days 
a week. It will execute the most tedious and repetitive 
activities with precision and without interruption. Activities 
such as data validation, reconciliation or retrieval of specific 
information from a large data sample will typically be 
executed with far greater speed and granularity than a 
human could ever possibly achieve. The result of which 
being significantly increased productivity.
Stronger security and compliance
Greater accuracy, more granular processing power and 
reduced dependence on human labour, means Blue Prism’s 
software robots allow for a much more manageable 
framework of delivering multiple processes, simultaneously, 
across the enterprise. As such, risk can be mitigated 
significantly, whilst security is strengthened from minimising 
human fraud, error, intrusion and malpractice. Blue Prism’s 
enterprise-grade RPA also enables businesses to strengthen 
compliance, as data and processes can stay in a more secure, 
on-premise setting and be better protected via a digital 
workforce, which can conceal sensitive information from 
people, whilst still being processed at speed and scale  
via automation.

Shop Direct
The advantage of Blue Prism’s RPA technology can 
be seen in the scale of impact delivered, and value 
generated, for a major player in the retail sector.
Shop Direct, one of the UK’s largest pure-play digital retailers, has automated 
approximately 130 processes to date using Blue Prism and continues to return 
328,000 hours annually (and rising) back to its business. As a result, the Company 
was also able to generate £16m in incremental revenue from just one  
single process.

It is also possible to combine the operational benefits  
of RPA with social benefits.
At Lighthouse Works in Florida – a not-for-profit social enterprise which exists  
to support people in living, learning and earning with vision loss – Blue Prism 
software robots are helping employees complete tasks such as scheduling,  
billing and claims processing, thereby expanding the scope of jobs that visually 
challenged workers can complete. After deploying Blue Prism’s RPA, blind 
workers could complete tasks in their entirety 4 to 6 times faster and  
3 times more efficiently than before, for an estimated cost saving of  
nearly 65 per cent.

MARKET OVERVIEW
DELIVERING 
TOMORROW’S 
DIGITAL WORKFORCE 
WORLDWIDE
We believe that the combination of intelligent automation 
targeted at transformational change, supported by technical 
partners and a robust methodology is appealing to both our 
distribution partners and our customers, and along with our 
public status and strengthened balance sheet, sets us apart 
from other RPA vendors.
MARKET REVIEW
Supported by Board level conversations between global 
consulting firms and their clients, Intelligent Automation,  
the digital enterprise, robotics and the future of work are all 
themes that RPA plays well to, and this is driving the market 
into global expansion. As today’s major organisations look  
to find new ways of interacting with their customers, it is 
becoming clear that RPA can become a transformational 
enabler to the digital enterprise and not just a tactical 
automation tool focused on cost reduction.
This is reinforced by increasing media and analyst 
attention. For example, in November, the primary 
product category search terms on Gartner Inc’s website,  
a leading technology research and advisory firm, were 
Cloud, Internet of Things, Blockchain and RPA.
Blue Prism has helped shape the growth in media, analyst 
and industry awareness of RPA throughout the year,  
and endorsement for the RPA market continues to be 
supported by an increasing number of independent 
commentators. According to McKinsey
*
, the introduction 
and development of business process automation offers 
returns on investment, in the first year alone, of up to  
200 per cent. Such rapid growth and adoption – and the 
recognition of the value RPA can provide at the enterprise 
level – stems from an increasing demand at Board level to 
introduce automation technologies into their business. 
Analysts and media continue to point to the scale of 
opportunity ahead, as enterprises look to RPA to 
automate legacy business processes at a time when 
their talent, technology and time resources are 
constrained.
**
 Industry analysts are starting to make 
significant forecasts of a large, growing market size for 
RPA – with one business consulting and market research 
firm forecasting the RPA market to reach up to $8.75bn  
by 2024
***
 – and we can see already the demand from 
growing levels of interest.
COMPETING IN THE MARKET PLACE
Against an increasingly positive wider market, Blue 
Prism continues to emerge as an important thought 
leader in the market for RPA. We were 1 of only 2 
British companies, and the only RPA vendor, to feature 
in Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT") 
Technology Review’s 50 Smartest Companies of 2017. 
We continue to grow and deepen our partnerships with 
global consulting and implementation firms who, with 
us, are working to make customer engagement with 
RPA increasingly transformational. We also partner 
with niche and specialised players with a specific 
geographic, industry or functional focus who make  
a valuable contribution to our revenue mix. 
Although the US remains a key priority strategically,  
we have opened offices in Australia, Japan and India 
resulting in encouraging early revenues in the Asia 
Pacific region. Japan is the world’s third largest

economy. It has one of the worst demographic “time-
bombs” of the developed world with many baby-boomers 
already moving into retirement. The workforce is 
shrinking and production must be maintained. Japan is 
culturally pre-disposed towards automation, based on 
positive experience in manufacturing (especially robotics 
in automotive) and the high value its society places 
culturally on the quality of products and relationships. 
Japan is in the earliest stages of RPA adoption and Blue 
Prism is quickly building a presence there with key 
customer wins including Dai-ichi Life and DeNa via 
partners including Accenture, EY, RPA Technologies  
and Deloitte. 
We have plans for further geographic expansion in FY2018 
in the Americas, localisation and specialisation in Europe, 
and entering new areas of the Asia Pacific region.
As with any growth market, there is healthy competition. 
Industry analysts such as Forrester and HfS Research 
continue to highlight UIPath and Automation Anywhere 
alongside Blue Prism as the three leaders in the market. 
Against that competition, Blue Prism continues to 
differentiate on enterprise scale, security, performance 
and adaptability. We believe competitors will invest not 
just in distribution, but in product development to directly 
compete in the enterprise space and we continue to invest 
in our own software product to maintain its position and 
to increase its value to the customer. This value arises in a 
variety of business outcomes, which we reference further 
down in this report, and in the comfort of knowing the 
solution is going to meet data security, regulatory 
compliance, and governance requirements.
In 2017 we released Blue Prism Version 6 which 
included a number of software enhancements to help 
internationalise the product, make it easier to use, 
faster to deploy, more intelligent and responsive. For 
example, Version 6 now includes:
• Intelligent Surface Automation and Adaptive 
Positioning Technology to give the robots more 
sophisticated and flexible “visual” capabilities when 
reading applications.
• Certified reference architectures for all the main 
cloud vendors (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, IBM)  
to offer rapid scale-out and Artificial Intelligence 
Capabilities.
• Enhanced security and encryption controls that provide 
greater configurability and flexibility to ensure 
absolute secure connectivity, data storage and access 
across an extended range of deployment models.
• Double byte character support to enable 
international languages, and the ability to translate 
and localise our own user interface.
• An improved Control Room giving real time 
visibility of robot activity, health and digital 
workforce achievements. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
OVERVIEW
Since the flotation of Blue Prism in March 2016 we have 
seen significant progress in the RPA market and in our 
business.
There have been advances in the size and visibility  
of the RPA market and it is clear that RPA as a 
technology offering is now high on the agenda for  
many organisations. The growing interest in the  
market for RPA from new and existing participants  
is testament to its increasing importance. 
Blue Prism is both driving and benefiting from this 
evolution of the market. In the period, we have seen  
a significant increase in sales, a substantial growth of our 
customer base and further strengthening of our market-
leading position whilst managing the cost  
base and cash flow with real discipline.
The executive management has successfully executed the 
strategy for growth set out at the time of the flotation. 
Our principal route to market is through  
our partner channel which is now highly engaged  
and growing in sophistication and global reach and  
has contributed enormously to our growth.
THE BOARD
The Board, which was formed just prior to flotation,  
is functioning well and interacting effectively with the 
executive management contributing a good balance of 
skills and experience. Gary Johnson, our Chief Financial 
Officer (“CFO”) at the time of flotation, has decided to 
step down from the Board. Gary has made a significant 
contribution over the past 3 years developing and 
strengthening the financial systems to support our 
expansion and growth. Ijoma Maluza has joined the 
Board as CFO and will continue to build on the strong 
platform established by Gary. 
While businesses experiencing rapid growth, such as 
Blue Prism, often face managerial challenges, the Board 
is fully engaged with the executive management team 
to ensure that the Group is positioned to address the 
growth challenge head-on. In particular, ensuring the 
ongoing recruitment of senior experienced staff with 
strong track records who can proactively engage in the 
challenge of building a world-class technology Company.
OUR PEOPLE
Without the energy, commitment and enthusiasm of the 
Blue Prism employees the rapid growth and financial 
performance of Blue Prism would not be possible. We 
thank them for another year of hard work and 
execution.
OUTLOOK
In the year ahead, we are focused on maintaining our 
growth momentum. The attractiveness of our market 
will inevitably encourage competition. However, we 
believe 2018 will be a year in which we extend and 
capitalise on the clear lead we have built in the 
enterprise market for RPA, positioning us to deliver 
another exciting year of growth.

OVERVIEW
FY2017 was a year of global growth and growing 
commercial momentum. We have seen significant increases 
in our revenues, customer numbers, geographic coverage 
and in our skilled developer base. Alongside this, we have 
doubled our employee base and opened 3 new offices 
globally. We have also seen significant growth in industry 
recognition of the RPA sector, and strong, global 
endorsement of Blue Prism’s leading position in the market. 
As our business has developed, so has the market we 
serve. The RPA market is now advancing beyond the 
early hype stage and our indirect partner channel 
continues to grow and diversify in recognition of this 
shift. This channel was responsible for sourcing all new 
customers in FY2017 and there was a healthy number of 
upsells given that two thirds of our customer base joined 
the roster in FY2017. In addition, all 21 expected 
renewals in the year were secured.
We are pleased to report that total recognised revenue 
for the year ended 31 October 2017 increased by 155 per 
cent to £24.5m (FY2016: £9.6m) driven by sales from 
both new and existing customers. Sales momentum built 
throughout the year such that our exit run-rate (monthly 
recognised, recurring licence revenue) stood on  
31 October 2017 at £2.8m per month (FY2016: £0.95m  
per month): a strong foundation for FY2018 and beyond.
EBITDA losses for the period were £9.4m (FY2016: £5.2m) 
and adjusted EBITDA losses for the period were £8.3m 
(FY2016: £4.7m), being EBITDA before share-based 
payments, foreign exchange gains/(losses) and IPO costs 
(FY2016), to remove the effect of volatile share-based 
payments expenses , foreign exchange gains/(losses)and 
one off IPO costs, both representing continued 
investment in our global expansion. Cash and cash 
equivalents at 31 October 2017 were £16.3m 
(31 October 2016: £11.8m).

EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY
The Group set out a growth strategy at the time of its 
IPO based on 4 strategic objectives. During the past  
12 months we have continued to make meaningful 
progress against each, as follows:
BUILDING SCALABLE DEVELOPMENT, SALES  
AND DELIVERY CHANNELS
Blue Prism’s sales strategy is to achieve broad and scalable 
sales growth through a global channel of distribution 
partners. This partner sales channel includes a wide  
range of highly engaged partners, comprising some of 
the world’s largest consulting firms such as Accenture,  
EY, IBM, KPMG, Deloitte and HCL as well as specialist 
technology and digital transformation firms, such as 
Thoughtonomy, DXC, RPAi, Symphony and Reveal Group. 
All of the 324 new customers in FY2017 were sourced 
through the channel for the first time (FY2016: 90 per 
cent), including an increase in reseller deals.
The Group launched a partner certification programme 
during the period, designed to maintain the highest levels 
of quality assurance in our sales and delivery model.  
11 partners are now certified and, in March 2017, EY 
became the first partner to achieve Gold status, followed 
later in the year by Accenture. As interest in RPA 
continues to increase, our focus remains to ensure the 
Group is best equipped to service increasing demand by 
maximising and optimising this partner distribution 
channel.
The Group has seen strong levels of industry recognition 
and community support, as evidenced by the scale of 
attendance and quality of sponsors at our Blue Prism 
World events. Almost 2,000 customers and partners 
attended events in San Francisco, New York, London, 
Tokyo and Sydney. With premium sponsors including 
Accenture, EY, Deloitte, KPMG, IBM, and Capgemini, we 
go into 2018 with the confidence of having leading names 
in the sectors we serve supporting our long-term vision.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
CONTINUED
INCREASING BUSINESS WITH THE 
GROUP’S CUSTOMERS
During the first 6 months of the year, the Group 
introduced an account management function to help 
improve the effectiveness of customer management 
following the initial sale. This has proven effective in 
driving increased adoption in the legacy direct accounts. 
We have been working on rolling this out into the 
indirect model with early signs of success. In FY2017 the 
Group secured 264 upsells across 131 customers, a 
meaningful increase on the 81 upsells secured across  
47 customers in the prior financial year. 49 of the 131 
customers who upsold during the period upsold more 
than once with approximately 27 per cent of all 
customers buying more licences in the period. Renewals 
of existing licences also continue to be healthy with all  
21 of those due in the period secured (FY2016: 12). 
These increasing levels of adoption are a result of our 
customers’ engagement with RPA and the subsequent 
return on investment they see from increased use of our 
software.
The Financial Services sector is one of many realising real 
benefits from RPA. For example, a leading Middle East 
retail bank is using Blue Prism software robots to process 
over 15,000 transactions daily, bringing greater 
operational efficiency, accuracy and speed along with a 
70 per cent reduction in fraud. Elsewhere in the sector, 
within the first 12 months of its Blue Prism deployment, 
BNY Mellon rolled out 222 robots in 35 of its different 
businesses, spanning 147 different business functions. 
Turnaround time has been reduced by an average of 62 
per cent, including reducing one particular process from 
10 days to 24 hours while also improving error rates.
Blue Prism RPA has also delivered significant business 
benefits, within just 6 months of deployment, to a 
leading Fortune 500 financial services provider in the  
US – with over $3tn of life insurance in force worldwide. 
Blue Prism’s software robots were deployed to support 
an enterprise-wide programme of strategic revenue 
growth, which needed to be deployable at speed and 
across all its subsidiary businesses and functional areas. 
Using Blue Prism enabled the organisation to improve 
customer experience and reduce costs by eliminating an 
onerous, lengthy re-underwriting backlog. It took just 
10 months to put the robotic operating model in place, 
and since deployment Blue Prism RPA has resulted in a 
$500,000 one-time cost avoidance and delivered more 
than $3m savings from run rate cost reductions annually.
In addition to process automation, the value of Blue 
Prism’s RPA can be realised in its positive impact on 
customer experience. A leading global payments services 
provider – which in 2016 completed 791m transactions 
for its consumer and business clients – needed to 
improve customer experience whilst expanding 
automation capabilities throughout the organisation. 
Automating more than 15 processes to date, Blue Prism 
delivered end-to-end automation of financial 
transactions whilst enabling the Company to maintain 
full regulatory compliance, and with seamless 
integration with existing infrastructure. It took only half 
a year to see the returns on investment of using Blue 
Prism RPA, with $1.3m worth of savings generated in the 
first 6 months, resulting in a 3.6 times return on the 
investment in the RPA programme. Employee 
satisfaction and productivity also increased with 12 FTEs 
reassigned to more cognitive, value-added tasks, as 
employee attrition reduced due to the elimination of 
repetitive and non-value added work.
Similarly, the advantage of Blue Prism’s RPA technology 
can be seen in the scale of impact delivered, and value 
generated, for a major player in the retail sector. Shop 
Direct, one of the UK’s largest pure-play digital retailers, 
has automated approximately 130 processes to date 
using Blue Prism and continues to return 328,000 hours 
annually (and rising) back to its business. As a result,  
the Company was also able to generate £16m in 
incremental revenue from just one single process.
It is also possible to combine the operational benefits of 
RPA with social benefits. At Lighthouse Works in Florida  
– a not-for-profit social enterprise which exists to support 
people in living, learning and earning with vision loss – 
Blue Prism software robots are helping employees 
complete tasks such as scheduling, billing and claims 
processing, thereby expanding the scope of jobs that 
visually challenged workers can complete. After deploying 
Blue Prism’s RPA, blind workers could complete tasks in 
their entirety 4 to 6 times faster and 3 times more 
efficiently than before, for an estimated cost saving of 
nearly 65 per cent.
The breadth of RPA use cases is phenomenal with Blue 
Prism software already in use across more than 40 
industry sectors. It is hard to imagine an industry that 
could not benefit from RPA. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

EXECUTING ON THE GROUP’S US 
MARKET STRATEGY
The Group has continued to invest in the US which is a 
market of strategic importance. We are pleased to report 
that Blue Prism has grown its US customer base by 419  
per cent over the last financial year and the Americas 
operations now accounts for 36 per cent of Group revenues 
(FY2016: 28 per cent). In absolute terms, the Group’s US 
customer base has advanced from 26 customers at the end 
of FY2016 to 135 (or 28 per cent of total customers) at the 
end of FY2017 (FY2016: c.17 per cent). US customers include 
BNY Mellon, Western Union, Pfizer, AIG, Fannie Mae, 
Walgreens and IBM.
Investment in people is the most important part of our 
expansion plans and, during the financial year, the 
Group grew US employees by 150 per cent to 65 (FY2016: 
26). This team now represents c.35 per cent of the 
Group’s total global employee base.
The Group will continue to invest in the US so it can meet 
the growing demand for RPA in what remains the world’s 
largest and most important software market. Against this 
backdrop, we are encouraged by progress in the Group’s 
home EMEA market and emerging APAC market. In FY2017 
the Group’s APAC customer count grew from 3 at the close 
of FY2016 to 52 at the close of FY2017, with a recognised 
revenue contribution of £2.2m.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
CONTINUED
REINFORCING THE GROUP’S MARKET LEADERSHIP 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RPA ADOPTION
The launch of Version 6, billed as the “Operating 
System” edition of our software, has helped to build on 
Blue Prism’s profile as a thought leader in the RPA 
market. This latest release of our software is designed 
with the specific requirements of enterprise level 
deployment as an execution platform, or “operating 
system”, supporting the digital enterprise.
During the year, advances have been made with our 
Technology Alliance Program (“TAP"). Originally 
designed with the architectural objective of positioning 
Blue Prism as the de-facto “operating system” for digital 
workforce deployments, the programme has enjoyed an 
encouraging reception from customers, partners and 
commentators. We have already announced TAP 
collaborations with partners including Microsoft, 
Appian, Captricity, and IBM. 
We believe that the TAP offers Blue Prism the potential 
to find new revenue streams. For example, Appian 
offers Blue Prism as an extension to its low code 
application development and BPM platform and extends 
its automation footprint. FY2018 will see us invest in 
further commercialisation and extension of the 
Technology Alliance Program.
Skills shortages can, as with any early market, hold back 
customer adoption. In FY2017, the Group established a 
formal Education Services department to bring customer 
and partner education under one roof. This has resulted 
in a 389 per cent increase in accredited Blue Prism 
developers to 3,096, a 408 per cent increase in (now 
outsourced) accreditation exams to 4,176 across 44 
countries, and the introduction of new accredited roles 
to align with our ROM delivery framework and 
methodology.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Customer and sales growth 
The 609 software licence deals secured during the 12 
months ended 31 October 2017 equates to more than 3 
times the number of software licence deals won in the prior 
year.
Software licence deals FY2017 FY2016
New 324 96
Renewals 21 12
Upsells 264 81
Total 609 189
We experienced impressive growth in the number of new 
customers: two thirds of our current customer base 
signed-up to Blue Prism in the period bringing the total 
to 477. Given that most customers buy on a “land and 
expand” strategy, this represents a meaningful sales 
opportunity for us over the medium term providing we 
can continue to ensure that customers get real value 
from their use of the software.
Existing customers also continued to increase their 
adoption of our product at a healthy rate. 264 upsells 
were secured across 131 customers in FY2017, 
representing a 225 per cent increase on FY2016. All 
renewals that were due in the period were achieved.
It is increasingly apparent that customer success is more 
likely when customers, supported by our partners, adopt 
Blue Prism’s Robotic Operating Model (“ROM"). The ROM 
is a best practise delivery framework and methodology 
designed to provide assurance and light touch governance 
to maximise business benefits whilst meeting security, 
scalability and compliance objectives. We promote the 
ROM vigorously and have created a full partner 
enablement programme so that our partners may 
integrate it into their wider methodologies. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Employees
As at 31 October 2017, Blue Prism had 187 employees 
worldwide, compared to 86 at the end of FY2016 and 127 
at the end of H117. Whilst this level of growth inevitably 
places challenges on the Company, the management team 
has worked hard to build new organisational 
infrastructure. In particular, we have strengthened the 
management team with key appointments including Shail 
Khiyara, Chief Marketing Officer; Pat Geary who stepped 
into the newly-created role of Chief Evangelist; and Nicola 
Bergstrom who joined Blue Prism to lead Human 
Resources. We also implemented a new, scalable, 
accounting platform and invested in a corporate 
development team to co-ordinate and build the people, 
systems and processes needed for a larger organisation. 
Having made extensive use of our own robots in product 
development, we are now starting to scale their use into 
other parts of the business for flexibility, accuracy  
and efficiency.
Our Public Company status and employee share ownership 
schemes are enabling us to attract high quality talent. We 
will continue to invest in people to support our growth 
plans, and in systems and processes to provide an 
organisational platform for the next phase of 
Blue Prism’s growth.
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
This has been a successful year for Blue Prism. Our 
product and the global partner sales channel built to 
commercialise it have delivered real sales momentum, 
strengthening our market position and underpinning 
our belief in our long-term potential. In FY2018, the 
focus remains on addressing the global demand for RPA 
software through our indirect go to market model with 
particular investment in geographical expansion and  
in our Technology Alliance Program.
The Group has had a strong start to the first quarter  
of FY2018 and as such now expect revenues for the full 
financial year to be comfortably ahead of existing 
market expectations. Funded by the anticipated net 
proceeds of the placing we have announced today, the 
additional investment planned for FY2018 to support 
our global growth is expected to increase our revenue 
growth in the next financial year. The 2018 financial year 
shows every sign of being yet another exciting year of 
growth for Blue Prism.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Introduction
The financial results for 2017 reflect a year of strong 
organic growth and greater global reach through our 
partner network.
Revenue
Recognised revenue for the year increased 155 per cent 
to £24.5m (FY2016: £9.6m).
Recurring licence revenue accounted for 90 per cent of 
recognised revenues at £21.8m (FY2016: £8.2m: 85 per 
cent recognised revenues). Professional Services 
revenues increased to £2.2m (FY2016: £1.3m) mainly 
due to a significant increase in training revenues 
reflecting the significant growth in our customer base. 
Non-recurring revenue was £0.5m (FY2016: £0.2m) and 
included £0.2m in sponsorship revenues from our 
partners’ attendance at the Blue Prism World events 
staged during the year.
The monthly exit run rate, which illustrates the 
momentum of recognised recurring licence revenue, 
stood at £2.8m for October 2017. This has grown 196 per 
cent in the year from £0.9m per month for October 2016. 
The exit run rate is the recurring licence revenue released 
to the profit and loss account in the month of October.
Revenue from EMEA operations grew 100 per cent to 
£13.8m (FY2016: £6.9m), representing 56 per cent of 
total revenues. Revenue from the Americas operations 
grew to £8.9m (FY2016: £2.7m), representing 36 per 
cent (FY2016: 28 per cent) of total revenues. New 
operations opened in the year in APAC generated 
£1.8m (FY2016: £nil) of recognised revenue (7 per cent) 
reflecting a significant start for the region in a very 
short period of time. 
Loss from operations
Losses from operations were £9.5m (FY2016: £5.3m), 
which includes share-based payments of £1.1m  
(FY2016: £0.36m), foreign exchange losses of £0.03m 
(FY2016: gain £0.3m) and IPO costs of nil (FY2016: £0.5m).
Adjusted losses from operations (losses before share-
based payments and foreign exchange losses), £8.4m 
(FY2016: £4.7m) were impacted by the growth in total 
contracted revenue which resulted in increased sales 
introduction commissions, see note 7, since the Group 
policy is to expense sales commissions on the whole 
contract regardless of its length immediately on first 
signing the contract. The nature of this is that the 
nearer the contract is signed to the year end then the 
lower the attributable margin is on that contract in the 
year. However there is no impact of commissions on the 
margin in the following years of the contract.
Foreign exchange gains
The entity generated foreign exchange losses during  
the period of £0.03m (FY2016: gain £0.32m). The losses 
generated during the period have arisen as a result of the 
changes in the GBP: USD exchange rate during the period.
Other comprehensive income
During the year the translation of the overseas 
subsidiaries from their local currency into the Group’s 
reporting currency resulted in other comprehensive 
income of £0.3m.
Statement of financial position
Deferred income, which is the value invoiced less  
the recognised revenue, grew 162 per cent to £27.3m 
(FY2016: £10.4m), as a result of strong growth in new 
business and the advance payments of £5.2m from  
a small number of customers. Of the £27.3m at  
31 October 2017, £23m will be released in 2018 and  
the balance over the remaining periods of the contract.
Trade and other receivables increased to £14.9m 
(FY2016: £5.6m) as the Group enjoyed a strong end to 
the financial year. There are no intangibles on the 
balance sheet and research and development costs have 
been fully expensed as incurred as none of these met 
the criteria for capitalisation. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
18 – 19
Cash flows
Cash and cash equivalents at 31 October 2017 were £16.3m (31 October 2016: £11.8m). Net cash for the year increased as a result of 
advanced payments from customers of £5.2m. Once again, strong growth and contract payment term negotiations have enabled us to 
fund operating losses organically and bring forward investments from 2018 without the need to use any of the funds raised at the 
IPO. We continue to focus on being cash-generative in the medium term.
Additionally, the Group has a £2.0m Revolving Credit Facility which is currently unutilised.
Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs")
The Group tracks a number of KPIs to identify trends in the trading performance and to benchmark progress of key objectives.
The detailed numbers comparing the current financial year to the previous financial year are shown below:

Recognised revenue: Being the total revenue recognised in the 
Group’s profit and loss account.
Monthly run rate: Being the amount of recurring software licence 
revenue recognised in the Group’s profit and loss account in the 
last month of the financial year. This is an indicator of the level of 
licence business the Group would achieve on a monthly basis if 
there was no new business generated in the future and if there 
were 100% renewals.
Operating loss: Being the total loss in the period.
Adjusted loss: Being the operating loss before share-based 
payments and foreign exchange gains/(losses). This is seen to be 
an accurate measure of the trading position of the business.
Cash: The level of cash in the business dictates the amount of 
investment the Group can make and is therefore considered to 
be one of the most critical KPIs.
Cash generated from operations: This is seen as a good indicator of 
how the business is managing its cash.
Number of customers: This metric is a clear indicator of the 
progress of the business in the market.
Total number of staff: The number of staff in the business is 
closely monitored to ensure we have the right mix of sales to 
non-sales staff and is also the major cost driver for the business. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
Risk Description
GROWTH STRATEGIES
Failing to successfully implement its  
growth strategies
The Company intends to carry out certain growth and expansion strategies. The Group’s 
growth and future success will be dependent to some extent on the successful completion of 
such growth and expansion strategies currently or proposed to be undertaken by the Group 
and the sufficiency of demand for the Group’s software. The execution of the Group’s growth 
and expansion strategies may also place strain on its managerial, operational and financial 
reserves and the failure to implement such a strategy may adversely affect the Group’s 
reputation, business, prospects, results of operation and financial condition. The Board manages 
these growth strategies against the market conditions, the cash available and the monthly 
performance of the Group against budget and reforecasts.
CHANNEL PARTNERS
Dependence on Channel Partners
GROUP’S OPERATING MODEL
Failure of the market to accept the Group’s 
operating model of a fully automated Digital 
Workforce 
SOFTWARE RELIABILITY
Undetected defects in the software provided by 
the Group
SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE
The Group’s software may not perform as 
expected and the Group could be at risk of 
defects which adversely affect its customers 
The Group sells its software robots through Partners and has established a partner accreditation 
programme to enable potential customers to select a partner suitable for their needs. There can 
be no guarantee that these Partners sell the Group’s software robots to their end-customers. 
The loss of certain key Partners (and the resulting loss of indirect customers contracted via those 
Partners) could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and financial condition.
A large proportion of the Group’s target market still uses traditional systems relying on human 
driven activities for the major part of their operations. The Directors believe the market 
needs further education on the virtues of its software machine-driven technology, and on 
how to integrate it into its current operations. Potential customers may however favour more 
traditional methodologies and/or be cautious about investing in the Group’s software due to 
lack of education as to how it operates. Failure by the Group to bring about a change in the 
market’s readiness to accept a new technology will lead to slower than projected growth  
in the Group’s revenues and profits.
The Group’s business involves providing customers with reliable software. If the software 
contains undetected defects when first introduced or when upgraded or enhanced, the 
Group may fail to meet its customers’ performance requirements or otherwise satisfy 
contract specifications. As a result, it may lose customers and/or become liable to its 
customers for damages and this may, amongst other things, damage the Group’s reputation 
and financial condition. The Group endeavours to negotiate limitations on its liability in 
its customer contracts, however, defects in either the software developed on behalf of 
customers or developed and sold by the Group could result in the loss of a customer, a 
reduction in business from any particular customer, negative publicity, reduced prospects 
and/or a distraction to its management team. A successful claim by a customer to recover 
such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s reputation, business, 
prospects, results of operation and financial condition.
There is no guarantee that the Group’s software will perform as intended. Costs spent on 
developing the software may therefore not be recouped and this may result in reduced 
profitability for the Group. As the Group’s software is complex, it may contain defects or 
vulnerabilities which may not be detected until after their deployment to end customers. 
These could result in the Group’s customers being vulnerable to security attacks or adverse 
performance. The Group moreover may not always be able to identify the cause of 
performance problems in its software. The Group’s business would be harmed if any of the 
events described above caused its end customers or potential end customers to believe  
the Group’s software is not reliable or secure.
The Group is exposed to a number of potential risks which may have a material effect on the 
reputation, financial or operational performance.
It is not possible to identify or anticipate every risk that may affect the Group, or the materiality of that risk, however, the principal risks 
and uncertainties faced by the Group are set out below.
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal controls and is fully supported by the Audit Committee.

SECURITY BREACHES
Security breaches of the Group’s or customer’s 
systems 
The Group is often required and authorised by its customers to work with confidential information 
in the deployment of the Group’s software and services. Although the Group employs security and 
testing measures for the software it deploys, these may not protect against all possible security 
breaches that could harm the Group’s or its customers’ business. Any compromise of the Group’s 
security could harm its reputation or financial condition and, therefore, its business. In addition, 
a party who is able to circumvent the Group’s security measures could, among other things, 
misappropriate proprietary information, interrupt the Group’s operations or expose customers to 
computer viruses or other disruptions. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against 
the Group. Whilst the Group will, where possible, seek to ensure that its customer agreements 
contain provisions that limit the Group’s liability, the Group may need to enforce these provisions  
to enjoy the benefit of them, with the associated risk and expense.
CYBER-ATTACKS
The Group’s software may be at risk from cyber-
attacks
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES
The Group may be adversely affected by 
technological change in the artificial intelligence 
industry
MARKET
The Group faces strong competition in a rapidly 
evolving market
GROWTH MANAGEMENT
Growth management
The Group relies on information technology systems to conduct its operations. Because 
of this, the Group and its software are at risk from cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks can result 
from deliberate attacks or unintentional events and may include (but are not limited 
to) third parties gaining unauthorised access to the Group’s software for the purpose of 
misappropriating financial assets, intellectual property or sensitive information, corrupting 
data, or causing operational disruption. If the Group suffers from a cyber-attack, whether by 
a third party or insider, it may incur significant costs and suffer other negative consequences, 
such as remediation costs (including liability for stolen assets or information) and repairing 
any damage caused to the Group’s network infrastructure and systems. The Group may also 
suffer reputational damage and loss of investor confidence. If the Group suffers a cyber-
attack, this could expose the Group to potential financial and reputational harm.
The Group expects that new artificial intelligence technology will continue to emerge and 
develop, therefore it is possible that this technology may be superior to, or render obsolete 
or unmarketable, the technology that the Group currently offers. Any failure of the Group to 
ensure that its software remains up to date with the latest technology may have a material 
impact on the Group’s competitiveness and financial performance. The Group plans to continue 
to develop innovative solutions for its customers but there can be no assurance that the Group 
will be able successfully to develop new products and expand its business as planned or that 
these new products will be successful or profitable. The Company’s success will depend, in part, 
on its ability to develop and adapt to these technological changes and industry trends.
Although the Directors believe that significant barriers to entry exist in the markets in which 
the Group operates, including for example the technical skill and expertise required to develop 
its technology, the Group may face an increasing amount of competition. Competitors may 
seek to develop software which more successfully compete with the Group’s current product 
range and they may also adopt more aggressive pricing policies or undertake more extensive 
marketing and advertising campaigns. This may have a negative impact on sales volumes or 
profit margins achieved by the Group in the future. The Group would also face an increase in 
competition if its competitors adopted but further developed the Group’s software or if there 
were new entrants to the market with comparable or competitively superior technology.
The Directors believe that further expansion, either organically or through acquisition, may be 
required to capitalise on the market opportunities available to the Group. Such expansion is 
expected to place further demands on management, support functions, sales and marketing 
functions and other resources of the Group. In order to manage the further expansion of the 
Group’s business and the growth of its operations and personnel, the Group may be required to 
expand and enhance its infrastructure and technology, and enhance its operational and financial 
systems and procedures and controls from time to time in order to match that expansion. 
This could have a material cost to the Group. Historically, the Group has invested in its people, 
infrastructure, processes and policies to enable and support continued revenue growth but 
its future success will depend, in part, on its ability to continue to manage this anticipated 
expansion. There can be no assurance that the Group’s current and planned staff, infrastructure, 
systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support its expanding operations in the 
future. If the Group fails to manage its expansion effectively, its business, prospects and results of 
operations may be materially and adversely affected.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
At 31 October 2017 the Board comprised the Chairman, 2 Executive Directors and 3 Non-Executive Directors whose Board and 
Committee responsibilities are set out below.
Board Audit Committee Remuneration Committee
Jason Kingdon Chairman Chairman – –
Alastair Bathgate CEO Member – –
Gary Johnson CFO Member – –
Chris Batterham Senior Independent NED Member Member Member
Ken Lever Independent NED Member Chairman Member
Charmaine Eggberry Independent NED Member Member Chairman
The Board meets formally on a regular basis to monitor operating 
issues, risk and trading performance, to review forecasts, strategy 
and policy, to consider key projects and to oversee shareholder 
reporting. The Board is responsible for corporate governance and 
delegates operational control to the Executive Directors. 
The Chairman and NEDs have held meetings throughout the year 
with the various senior managers to improve insight into the 
business operations and the marketplace. 
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the decision  
of the Board that covers the key areas of the Group’s affairs.  
The schedule includes approval of the Annual Report and any 
other financial statements, the adoption of the budgets and 
business plans, material financial commitments, and the release  
of inside information.
The Board considers its overall size and composition to be 
appropriate, having regard to the experience and skills which the 
Board members bring together. The Board confirmed that Chris 
Batterham, Ken Lever and Charmaine Eggberry are independent 
in character and judgement. The Chairman, Jason Kingdon is not 
independent, however the Board considers that Jason Kingdon’s 
long experience as Chairman of the Board of Blue Prism Limited 
(which until the IPO was the Parent of the Group) will be of 
benefit to the Board in providing continuity of knowledge and 
additional industry expertise to the Group.
Directors’ indemnities
At the date of this Directors’ and Corporate Governance Report, 
indemnities are in force for both the Directors and the Company 
Secretary, to the extent permitted by law and by Blue Prism Group 
plc’s Articles of Association, in respect of losses arising in their 
capacity as officer of any member of the Blue Prism Group. In 
addition, Blue Prism has purchased and maintained throughout 
the year Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of 
itself and its Directors and officers.
Board committees
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Ken Lever (Chairman), Chris 
Batterham and Charmaine Eggberry. The committee meets at least 
twice per year and more frequently if required. The committee is 
responsible for monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
statements, monitoring the quality of the internal controls, reviewing 
significant financial reporting issues, overseeing the relationship with 
the external auditors (including advising on their appointment, 
agreeing the scope of the audit and reviewing the audit findings). 
Executive Directors or other members of the management team  
may be invited to attend meetings.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Charmaine Eggberry 
(Chairman), Ken Lever and Chris Batterham. The committee 
meets at least twice per year and more frequently if required. 
The committee is responsible for determining and agreeing 
with the Board the framework for the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors and other designated senior management 
and determining the total remuneration packages including 
where appropriate bonuses, incentive payments, share option 
awards and other share awards. The remuneration of the 
Non-Executive Directors will be determined by the Chairman 
and the Executive members of the Board. No Director will be 
involved in any decision as to his or her own remuneration.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system  
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The 
processes to identify and manage the key risks of the Group 
are an integral part of the internal control environment. Such 
processes, which are regularly reviewed and improved as 
necessary, include strategic planning, approval of annual 
budgets, regular monitoring of performance against budget 
(including full investigation of significant variances), control  
of capital expenditure, ensuring proper accounting records  
are maintained, the appointment of senior management and 
the setting of high standards for health, safety and 
environmental performance.
The effectiveness of the internal control system and 
procedures is monitored regularly through a combination of 
review by management, the results of which are reported to 
and considered by the Audit Committee. The system of 
internal control comprises those controls established to 
provide assurance that the assets of the Group are 
safeguarded against unauthorised use and to ensure the 
maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability 
of financial information used within the business or for 
publication. Any system of internal control can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss, as it is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failing to achieve the business objectives 
of the Group.
Relations with shareholders
The Group is committed to open communications with all its 
shareholders. Communication is primarily through the Company’s 
website and the Annual General Meeting. All shareholders will 
receive a copy of the Annual Report (electronic or hard copy 
depending on shareholder preference) and an interim report at 
the half year will be available on the Company’s website. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Accounts.

Provision of information to the auditors
Each of the Directors at the time when this Report of the Directors is approved has confirmed that:

• Each Director has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a Director in order to be aware of any information needed 
by the Company and the Group’s auditors in connection with preparing their report and to establish that the Company and the 
Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
Post balance sheet events
The Group is looking to place approximately £40m (before transaction fees) by way of a primary fundraising. The Directors

balance sheet and provide Blue Prism with the financial flexibility to address new opportunities as they emerge.
Areas of investment include:
• Expanding the Company’s sales and marketing activities across the US, Asia Pacific and EMEA.
• Continuing to develop and scale the Company’s global Channel Partner network through further engagement and partner 
certification programme.
• Investing in the commercialisation of different partnership opportunities through the Company’s Technology Alliance Program, 
which aims at positioning Blue Prism as the de facto “operating system”.
• Building the Blue Prism ecosystem to support our growth and enhancing the recently established Education Services department 
to support Blue Prism developers.
• Reinforcing the Company’s market leadership by investing further in our product and its differentiation, following the release of 
Blue Prism Version 6.
• Investing in people, process and infrastructure to support the growing business.
The Directors expect these investments to start generating incremental revenue during the financial year ending 31 October 2019.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2017 Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
28 – 29
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
elected to prepare the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs") as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. The Directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London 
Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the financial statements are made available on a website.  
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing 
integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BLUE PRISM GROUP PLC
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Blue Prism Group plc (the “Parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for  
the year ended 31 October 2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income, the 
consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the consolidated statement of changes in 
equity, the Company statement of financial position, the Company statement of changes in equity, the Company statement of cash 
flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 October 
2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s or the Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at 
least 12 months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Key audit matter International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) note that there is a presumed significant 
audit risk arising from inappropriate or incorrect recognition of revenue unless conditions 
exist that permit the rebuttal of that risk.
Due to the different elements of the contracts entered into by the Group and the length 
of those contracts also varying, the key risk of material misstatement arises both from the 
recognition of revenue around the year end (cut-off) and the revenue recognition policy itself, 
as detailed within note 2 of these financial statements, ensuring it is in line with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. 
Cut-off risk arises around the correct apportionment of revenue to the correct accounting 
period and subsequent amount deferred at the year end. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
30 – 31
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. At 
the planning stage we set an overall level of materiality for the financial statements as a whole based on our understanding of the 
elements of the financial statements that are likely to be of greatest significance to users. In order to reduce to an appropriately low 
level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to 
determine the extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as 
immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, 
when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
Planning materiality for the Group as a whole was set at £368,000 (2016: £118,000), which represents 1.5% (2016: 1.25%) of Group 
revenue. Revenue provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining materiality and has been concluded as the most 
relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the Group, while also providing a more stable measure year on year when 
compared to the Group loss before tax. The increase in percentage from 1.25% to 1.5% used to generate the Group materiality is a 
consequence of the Group being in its second year reporting under IFRS and due to the absence of a major Group restructure and 
the initial public offering which took place in 2016. Parent Company materiality has been set at £132,000, reflecting 1.5% (2016: 
1.25%) of total assets of the entity, which has been deemed the most suitable benchmark for a non-trading holding Parent 
Company. The percentages used have increased due to the same reasons as the Group.
Performance materiality
Based upon our assessment of the risks within the Group and the Group’s control environment, performance materiality for the 
financial statements has been set at £276,000 (2016: £82,600), being 75% (2016: 70%) of planning materiality.
Performance materiality levels used for the 2 key components identified within the Group were based upon the same benchmarks 
and percentages detailed for the Group, due to each component being consistent in both nature, audit risks identified and control 
environment to the Group as a whole. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was 
£175,500 to £100,500 (2016: £61,950 to £60,900).
Reporting threshold
The reporting threshold is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £18,400  
(2016: £2,360), which is set at 5% (2016: 2%) of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
How the key audit matter was 
addressed by our audit scope
Our procedures included reviewing the Group’s adopted revenue recognition policy in 
accordance with the requirements of IAS 18 – Revenue. We have reviewed the adopted  
policy, and confirmed that consistent application has been adhered to throughout the year.
Furthermore, we have performed specific substantive testing over each revenue stream, 
including the following:
• Generating expectations of contract revenue recognised during the period based upon 
both ongoing contracts entered into in the prior period and contracts entered into during 
the current period, taking into consideration the revenue days applicable to the financial 
year. Inputs into this calculation have been tested substantively including selecting a 
sample of items and tracing to source documentation such as customer contracts. We have 
also traced from the source listing of revenue generating items back into the population 
used to generate expectations to ensure completeness. For those contracts spanning over 
the year end, a sample of the balances deferred were re-calculated.
• Verifying a sample of non-recurring/non-contract revenue recognised in the year, 
reconciling to underlying agreements, cash receipt and appropriate trigger events for 
revenue recognition.
• Critically reviewing the existence and accuracy of deferred revenue balances shown in  
the statement of financial position at year end to ensure no material misstatements  
were identified. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including the Group’s system of 
internal control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements at the Group level. 
In determining the scope of our audit we considered the size and nature of each component within the Group to determine the 
level of work to be performed at each in order to ensure sufficient assurance was gained to allow us to express an opinion on the 
financial statements of the Group as a whole.
We obtained an understanding of the internal control environment related to the financial reporting process and assessed the 
appropriateness, completeness and accuracy of Group journals and other adjustments performed on consolidation.
Classification of component
Two components have been identified as significant (defined as those that contributed greater than 15% of Group revenue) and 
have been audited for Group reporting purposes.
The 2 significant components audited for Group reporting purposes accounted for 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s revenue, 86% 
(2016: 65%) of the Group’s loss before tax and 59% (2016: 62%) of the Group’s total assets and have been subject to a full scope 
audit. The Group audit team carried out these audits using materiality levels specified above.
The remaining 3 components not identified as significant have been reviewed for Group reporting purposes, using analytic 
procedures to corroborate the conclusions reached that there are no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated 
financial information of those components.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual 
Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 29, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as 
the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
This report is made solely to the Parent Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Parent Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Parent Company and the Parent Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF 
CHANGES IN EQUITY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2017 Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS") and their interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(“IASB"), as adopted by the European Union. They have also been prepared with those parts of the 2006 Companies Act applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.  
It also requires Group management to exercise judgment in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas where significant 
judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in note 2.
Changes in accounting policies
a) New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 November 2016
There were no new standards or interpretations effective for the first time for periods beginning on or after 1 November 2016. 
None of the amendments to standards that are effective from that date had a significant effect on the Group’s financial statements. 
b) New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective
The following new IASB standards, interpretations and amendments, which are not yet effective and have not been adopted early 
in these financial statements, may have a material impact on these financial statements:
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The Directors have 
begun to assess the potential effects of this standard on the business and, in particular, if it will have any impact on the way revenue 
is recognised. A study is underway to fully understand and identify the impact on:
i) revenue recognition; and
ii) accounting for commission on sales.
The Company is taking external advice and has set up a working committee to do the following:
IFRS 15 considerations What is the issue? Actions Potential impacts on the Group
Transitional 
arrangements
The IASB provides a choice of 
transition methods for the 
implementation of IFRS 15. The Group 
needs to determine which adoption 
approach is the most appropriate for 
the business.
Review all contracts 
completed by 1 November 
2017 and due to be completed 
by 1 November 2018 to 
ascertain the most 
appropriate adoption 
approach.
Blue Prism is planning to apply the 
standard retrospectively, using the 
practical expedient to not restate 
contracts that begin and end within 
the same annual accounting period.
Identify contracts 
with customers
IFRS 15, as specified in its name, 
applies to contracts with customers. 
Blue Prism transacts through third 
parties but the contractual 
relationship for the software licence is 
directly between Blue Prism and the 
end user. There is a requirement to 
clearly identify who Blue Prism’s 
customer is in relation to this 
standard, the end user or the third 
party who sold the software to the 
end user.
Review the nature of our 
contracts to ascertain 
principal/agent position and 
confirm the end user is Blue 
Prism’s customer.
It is expected that Blue Prism is to be 
considered the principal, with the 
end user as its customer concerning 
licensing of the software. This is due 
to access to the software being 
provided by means of a key provided 
by Blue Prism to the end user and 
the contractual relationship 
concerning the licence is between 
Blue Prism and the end user.
Identify each 
performance 
obligation  
in our contracts
Support services for:
a) upgrades; and
b) end users and third 
party consultancy 
firms
Standard support services are included 
in the software licence fee. In 
addition, the end user may purchase 
extended support. There is a 
requirement to determine if the 
customer support obligations for 
separately purchased customer 
support programmes are distinct from 
the inclusive support obligations.
Review our contracts to 
identify the inter-relationship 
between licences and 
upgrades.
It is likely that the promises to license 
the software and provide upgrades 
will be regarded as distinct due to 
the software being capable of being 
used without the upgrades. 
Therefore the value of consideration 
under the contracts needs to be 
allocated between the obligations, 
and revenue recognised when the 
various obligations are performed.

IFRS 15 considerations What is the issue? Actions Potential impacts on the Group
Identify each 
performance 
obligation in our 
contracts
There is a requirement to ascertain 
over what period each distinct service 
is delivered. In addition, it needs to be 
determined if the end user has a right 
to access or right to use the software. 
Evaluate contracts against 
the criteria described.
Ascertain whether the benefits 
are received rateably or not.
Review the metrics for the 
support activities across the 
different versions of the 
software and how this moves 
over the life of that version.
It is expected that the licence will  
be regarded as a right to use the 
software at a point in time, 
therefore meaning consideration 
allocated to the licence would then 
be recognised as revenue at that 
point. Currently revenue is 
recognised over the licence term and 
therefore IFRS 15 is likely to result in 
the acceleration of recognition of 
some revenue.
Determining the 
transaction price
There is a requirement to determine 
the stand alone selling price for each 
distinct performance obligation, such 
that this revenue can be recognised as 
each performance obligation is met.
Carry out a stand alone 
selling price exercise.
Transaction price is expected to be 
identified by either valuing the 
upgrade service using the cost plus 
approach with the licence value 
being determined on a residual 
basis. Alternatively, it may be that 
“upsell” prices can be used as a 
starting point for estimating the 
value of the licence obligation, with 
the upgrade service being valued as 
a residual.
Consideration of 
financing
Blue Prism usually receives payment 
for its services annually in advance. 
There is a requirement to assess 
whether there is a significant 
financing component where payments 
are received more than 12 months 
upfront.
Review quantum of payment 
terms more advantageous 
than annually in advance for 
potential existence of a 
significant financing 
component.
Amortisation will need to be 
matched with the period over which 
the relevant contract services are 
provided. Therefore, if the Group’s 
recognition of licence income is 
accelerated, and this forms the bulk 
of revenues under the standard, 
then the current policy of expensing 
commissions may not require 
substantial amendment.
Costs of obtaining contracts
Sales commission Currently Blue Prism expenses all 
commissions to the P&L as they are 
incurred. Under IFRS 15, Blue Prism 
will be required to capitalise sales 
commissions under certain conditions. 
In this case, the amortised 
commissions will be matched over the 
period the relevant contract services 
are provided.
An analysis of the 
commissions incurred over 
the relevant transition period 
needs to be undertaken and 
compared with the margins 
and periods of performance 
obligations identified during 
the revenue analysis.
Amortisation will need to be 
matched with the period over which 
the relevant contract services are 
provided. It may be that if Blue 
Prism’s recognition of licence income 
is accelerated, and this forms the 
bulk of revenues under the standard, 
then the current policy of expensing 
commissions may not require 
substantial amendment.
This project commenced in November 2017 and is expected to be completed prior to the year-end October 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The impact of this standard is being 
considered by the Directors and any impact, especially around the value of debtors, is yet to be fully investigated.
IFRS 16 Leases, effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The Directors are assessing the impact of this standard 
and the possible impact of any leases being capitalised on the balance sheet. A full review is yet to take place. Due to the pace of 
growth of the business this will be more appropriately reviewed during 2018. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
1 Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a 
single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full. The financial 
statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS") and their interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB"), as 
adopted by the European Union. They have also been prepared with those parts of the 2006 Companies Act applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. Due to the nature of the Group’s business model, which involves annual invoicing of software licences and 
recognising the revenues over the period of the contract, and due to the fast growth of the business, the deferred revenue account 
has grown significantly which has created the negative balance sheet in the financial statements. The deferred income is non-
refundable and so the Directors are confident that the business has sufficient working capital to satisfy liabilities as they arise.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.  
It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas where significant 
judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in note 2. 
Group reorganisation and IPO
During 2016 the Group was subject to restructuring prior to the IPO. Blue Prism Group plc was positioned at the top of the Group as 
the new Parent Company, with the former Parent, Blue Prism Limited, becoming a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Blue Prism 
Group plc through a share-for-share exchange. Such Group reorganisations are outside of IFRS3 as the Company does not meet the 
definition of a business and as such has been accounted for as a Group reorganisation rather than a reverse acquisition. 
The Group reconstruction in 2016 has been accounted for using merger accounting principles. Therefore, the consolidated financial 
statements of Blue Prism Group plc are presented as if Blue Prism Group plc and Blue Prism Limited had always been part of the 
same Group. Accordingly, the results of Blue Prism Limited for the entire year ended 31 October 2016 are shown in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
Transaction costs that relate directly to the issue of new equity instruments were accounted for as a deduction from equity. Where 
IPO transaction costs related to both the listing of pre-existing and newly issued shares, those costs have been allocated 
proportionally between profit or loss and equity on the basis of the proportion of the new shares issued.
Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue depending on the substance and legal form of the contracts with its customers. Revenue is 
recognised once a legally binding contract between the Group and its customers has been established and the delivery of the 
service has commenced. Service delivery is triggered by providing a “software key” to the customer, and the commencement date of 
the licence is reached, allowing them access to the software for the licence period.
Revenue includes the provision of a licence through a software key, follow up support, and maintenance, throughout the term of 
the licence. Provided the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the Group will receive consideration, 
revenue from the provision of a licence and follow up services is recognised from the licence start date over the period of the 
licence, which is also the period in which the services are rendered, on a straight-line basis.
Licence fee revenues, support revenues, and maintenance revenues are bundled together, as the revenue streams have no individual 
value as standalone items, due to the specific nature of the software, and the specific nature of the support services and 
maintenance. As such, these elements are considered as being intertwined and therefore inseparable due to their value together. 
Maintenance is incurred throughout the licence term on an ongoing basis. Support is provided throughout the licence period, and 
varies depending on how the customer chooses to deploy the software.
Revenue for these licences, support, and maintenance are recognised on an accruals basis; when invoiced in advance, the income is 
deferred in the statement of financial position and recognised in the income statement over the length of the licence and 
maintenance period. This policy is consistently applied across all customers and contracts.
Professional services revenues are recognised when the service has been delivered. If billed in advance, the income related to consultancy 
days not yet delivered at the end of the period is deferred and recognised in the income statement when the service takes place.
Training revenues are recognised at the point the training course has been completed.
Sales commission
Sales commission is recognised in the profit and loss in wages and salaries at the point at which the contract is signed and paid once 
the initial invoice has been collected. This is recognised up front as opposed to deferring this cost over the period of the contract as 
it is deemed an introductory fee, and is not affected by the future performance of a contract.

Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
they operate (their “functional currency”) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of 
unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in profit or loss. At the balance sheet date the non-sterling 
balances of the overseas entities are retranslated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date and the foreign exchange gain or loss  
is shown in foreign exchange reserves.
During the period the Board has made the decision to change the functional currency of Blue Prism Software Inc, a wholly-owned 
subsidiary within the Group, to US dollars. The decision to change the functional currency to US dollars was made as a consequence 
of sales volumes increasing in the prior period and expenses becoming increasingly US dollar denominated. As a result of this, with 
effective 1 November 2016, the Board made the decision to change the functional currency to US dollars.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services provided in the ordinary course of business and are stated net of  
any provision for impairment. Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial 
difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default, or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of 
the amounts due. The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the 
future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of 3 months or less.
Financial assets
The only financial assets held by Blue Prism Group plc are trade receivables and other cash and cash equivalents. Due to their short 
term nature, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables approximate their fair value. 
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method other than those categorised as fair value through income statement.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a 
financial liability or financial asset.
The Group’s Ordinary Shares are classified as equity instruments.
Share-based payments
Where equity-settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by 
adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount 
recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Non-vesting conditions and market 
vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a 
charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for 
failure to achieve a market vesting condition or where a non-vesting condition is not satisfied.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured 
immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the 
remaining vesting period.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is 
charged with the fair value of goods and services received.
Defined contribution pension schemes
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the 
year to which they relate.
Leased assets
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group (an “operating lease”), the 
total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term 
on a straight-line basis. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
1 Accounting policies continued
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of relevant temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
temporary differences can be utilised. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of an item of 
property, plant and equipment initially recognised includes its purchase price and any cost that is directly attributable to bringing 
the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. 
Depreciation is calculated under the straight-line method to write off the depreciable amount of the assets over their estimated 
useful lives. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Computer equipment – straight line over 3 years
Research and development expenditure
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised if, and only if, the Group can demonstrate all of the following:
(i) the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the asset under development;
(ii) the product or process is technically and commercially feasible; 
(iii) its future economic benefits are probable;
(iv) the ability to use or sell the developed asset; and
(v) the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the asset under development.
Currently, development expenditure does not meet the criteria to be capitalised as it is not possible to reliably measure the 
expenditure attributable to the RPA (see note 2). This development expenditure is expensed as incurred. If the criteria is met, future 
capitalised development expenditure would be measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any. 
Any future capitalised development expenditure will be amortised on a straight-line method when the services are ready for sale or 
use. In the event that it is no longer probable that the expected future economic benefits will be recovered, the development 
expenditure would be written down to its recoverable amount.

2 Key accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated 
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below.
• Licence fee revenues, support revenues, and maintenance revenues are bundled together, as the revenue streams have no 
individual value as stand alone items, due to the specific nature of the software, and the specific nature of the support services 
and maintenance. As such, these elements are considered as being intertwined and therefore inseparable due to their value 
together. Maintenance is incurred throughout the licence term on an ongoing basis. Support is provided throughout the licence 
period, and varies depending on how the customer chooses to deploy the software. The key judgements are that the different 
elements are bundled together due to the fact the 2 parts are intertwined with each constituent part been deemed to have  
no value as a stand alone function, and as such all elements are recognised together, spread over the licence period.
• Research and development costs – Under IAS 38, Research and development costs, internally generated technology should be 
capitalised if the capitalisation criteria are met. Assumptions and judgements are made with regard to assessing the expected 
future economic benefits, the economic useful life and the level of completion of the databases. Under IAS 38, at the point where 
activities no longer relate to development but to maintenance, capitalisation is to be discontinued.
The key judgements here are defining the cut-off point between when research ends and development starts, and reliably 
measuring the expenditure attributable to the asset. An assessment is made when looking at the costs incurred and criteria for 
development costs, including the commercial and technical viability of the costs being assured. The main costs attributed to research 
and development costs is that of payroll, with research and development team tasked with other aspects of quality assurance, 
customer support, project management, along with other tasks. Therefore, further to considerations above, it is therefore difficult 
to ascertain the cut-off between research and development, and to quantify any value between each within the business. 
3 Financial instruments – risk management
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note 
describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further 
quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes 
for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that all Group entities will be able to continue on a going concern basis while maximising 
its long-term return to shareholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of Company equity only, comprising issued capital, 
share premium, reserves and retained earnings. The Group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements and has 
no borrowings.

3 Financial instruments – risk management continued
General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst 
retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the 
effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function. 
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s 
competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new customers 
before entering contracts. 
The Board has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the 
Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when 
available. 
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial 
institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating “A” are accepted.
Further disclosures regarding trade and other receivables, which are neither past due nor impaired, are provided in note 12.
Cash at bank and short-term deposits
The Group’s cash is held on deposit with the Group’s principal bankers. 
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises when individual Group entities enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their 
functional currency. The Group’s policy is, where possible, to allow Group entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional 
currency, with the cash generated from their own operations in that currency. Where Group entities have liabilities denominated in 
a currency other than their functional currency (and have insufficient reserves of that currency to settle them), cash already 
denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere within the Group.
During the year the Group’s potential exposure to currency risk has increased due to the increased level of business in the US. The 
Group is predominantly exposed to currency risk on the balances held in working capital within the Group and the exposure is 
concentrated therefore in the movement of the US dollar against sterling. The effect of a strengthening and weakening of 10% of 
the US dollar against sterling at the reporting date on the working capital balances held at this date, on the basis that all other 
variables remained constant, would have resulted in the following pre-tax profit or (loss) impact for the year as follows:
10% 
strengthening
£’000
10% 
weakening
£’000
US dollar to sterling 724 (890)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in 
meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.  
To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain cash balances (or agreed facilities) to meet expected requirements for a period of at least  
90 days. 
The maximum exposure to liquidity risk is the trade payables and sales introduction commissions accrued at the year end, these are 
all current and expected to be settled within 90 days of the year end.

The Blue Prism Group has tax losses of approximately £29,636k (31 October 2016: £16,945k) to carry forward against future profits. 
The tax value of such losses amounted to £7,099k (31 October 2016: £3,756k). The UK tax losses have no expiry date. US tax losses 
expire after 20 years if not utilised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
temporary differences can be utilised. On the basis there is insufficient evidence that future taxable profits will be available to 
utilise the tax losses (note 14), no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the trading losses carried forward. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

16 Share options
In February 2016 the Company established an Employee Share Plan and a Non-Employee Share Plan (together the “Share Plans”). 
The Employee Share Plan is administered by the Remuneration Committee of the Board and the Non-Employee Share Plan is 
administered by the Board. Awards under the Share Plans take the form of options to acquire Ordinary Shares with an exercise price 
equal to the market value of an Ordinary Share on the date of grant. All employees of the Group may be granted awards under the 
Employee Share Plan. Non-Executive Directors and consultants of the Group may be granted awards under the Non-Employee Share 
Plan. All options under the Share Plans are 10-year options. The Employee Share Plan options for staff vest over a 3-year period, one 
third each year. Directors’ options under the Employee Share Plan vest at the end of the 3-year period. Options awarded under the 
Non-Employee Share Plan vest over 3 years, one third each year.
In December 2016 the Company established a Company Share Option Plan (the “CSOP”). The CSOP is administered by the 
Remuneration Committee of the Board. The CSOP has been designed so as to be capable of being certified as a “Schedule 4 CSOP” 
(as described in schedule 4 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003). The rules of the CSOP have been drafted so as to 
mirror those of the Employee Share Plan save where a different approach is required to ensure that the CSOP may qualify as a 
Schedule 4 CSOP. The awards under the CSOP take the form of options to acquire Ordinary Shares with an exercise price equal to the 
market value of an Ordinary Share on the date of grant. The CSOP is used in conjunction with the Employee Share Plan when 
making Awards to the Group’s UK employees, such that for staff the total number of options in an award (under the Employee 
Share Plan and CSOP combined) vest over a 3-year period, one third each year, although the relative proportions of options due to 
vest under the CSOP and the Employee Share Plan may vary from year to year. Directors options under the CSOP vest at the end of 
the 3-year period from the date of grant.

In August 2017 the Company established 2 new plans to facilitate and encourage purchases of the Company’s shares by employees 
of the Group in the UK and USA.
For the Group’s UK employees, the Company established a Share Incentive Plan (the “SIP”). The SIP has been designed so as to be capable 
of being certified as a “Schedule 2 SIP” (as described in schedule 2 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003). The SIP is open to 
all of the Group’s UK employees. Participating employees may elect to save funds by means of deductions from pre-tax salary up to a 
maximum contribution per employee of £1,800 per tax year. Funds thus deducted are held for the benefit of the employee under a UK 
resident trust established for the purpose (the “SIP Trust”). The trustee of the SIP Trust uses the accumulated funds each month to make 
market purchases of Ordinary Shares to be held under the SIP Trust for the employee (“Partnership Shares”). For each Partnership Share 
purchased under the SIP, the Company awards one free matching Ordinary Share, also to be held under the SIP Trust (a “Matching 
Share”). Matching shares must normally be retained within the SIP Trust for 3 years from the date they are awarded. 
For the Group’s US employees, the Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). The ESPP is designed to be a 
qualified employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423 of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Participating 
employees may elect to save funds by means of deductions from post-tax salary to be accumulated towards the purchase of Ordinary 
Shares up to a maximum contribution per employee of $25,000 per tax year. Funds are accumulated during a series of “Offering Periods”, 
normally of 6 months each, at the end of which the employee may use the accumulated funds to purchase Ordinary Shares or to have the 
funds repaid to them without interest. If the funds are used to purchase Ordinary Shares, the purchase may be made at a discount of 15% 
from whichever is the lower of the market value of Ordinary Shares at the beginning or the end of the Offering Period.
During the year 1,193,203 (2016: 5,436,853) share options have been granted under the above schemes. The cost of these options in 
the first year under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was £1,512,703 (2016: £732,323) . Of this £1,131,433 has been charged to 
the profit and loss for the year (2016: £362,081).
The exercise price of options outstanding at 31 October 2017 ranged between 78p and 1344p (2016: 78p and 308p) and average 
contractual life left for all options is 8.65 years (2016: 9.25 years).

Fair value
The fair value of share options issued in the year has been measured using the Black-Scholes model using the following key 
assumptions: 
Assumption Description and purpose
Volatility In the absence of historic volatility data, expected volatility has been estimated using the volatility of 
comparable companies. The volatility used was between 30% and 31%.
Expected time to exercise The expected time to exercise used was 5 years.
Dividends It was assumed no dividend would be paid.
Option exercise price The option exercise price determined was the share price at the date of the award for the US awards 
and the price on the day before the date of the award for the non-US awards, in accordance with the  
US ISO option rules.
Risk free rate The risk free rate applied was based on the 5 year UK government bond yields at the time of the valuation.
Retention of employees It is assumed 100% retention of employees.

Areas of investment include:
• Expanding the Company’s sales and marketing activities across the US, Asia Pacific and EMEA.
• Continuing to develop and scale the Company’s global Channel Partner network through further engagement and partner 
certification programme.
• Investing in the commercialisation of different partnership opportunities through the Company’s Technology Alliance Program, 
which aims at positioning Blue Prism as the de facto “operating system”.
• Building the Blue Prism ecosystem to support our growth and enhancing the recently established Education Services department to 
support Blue Prism developers. 
• Reinforcing the Company’s market leadership by investing further in our product and its differentiation, following the release of 
Blue Prism Version 6.
• Investing in people, process and infrastructure to support the growing business.
The Directors expect these investments to start generating incremental revenue during the financial year ending 31 October 2019.

1 Accounting policies
The Company has applied the Group accounting polices consistently during the period. 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are for the period ended 31 October 2017. The financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a 
going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS") and their interpretations which 
have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB"), as adopted by the European Union. They have also been 
prepared with those parts of the 2006 Companies Act applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements have been applied in the preparation of these 
financial statements.
Investments
The initial investment arising on the share for share exchange at the IPO was recognised at £nil in accordance with IAS 27.13 as Blue 
Prism Limited had net liabilities at the date of acquisition. Subsequent investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less 
any adjustments for impairment.
2 Loss for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Parent Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss 
account for the year. 
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
3 Financial instruments – risk management
The use of financial instruments and capital is managed by the Board to reduce the financial risks being faced, which primarily relate 
to credit and liquidity.
Credit risk
Financial instruments which potentially expose Blue Prism to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents. The maximum exposure 
to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset. Cash equivalents are deposited only with independent 
major financial institutions with minimum rating credit of “A”.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in 
meeting its financial obligations, including balances due to wholly-owned subsidiaries, as they fall due.
