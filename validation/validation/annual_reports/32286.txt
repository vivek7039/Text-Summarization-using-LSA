Financial statements Additional information Governance Strategic report Chairman’s statement
bpha’s success has helped attract  
good people and good people are  
key to continued success.
I am writing this statement in the immediate aftermath of the 
tragic event of the Grenfell Tower fire in which so many people 
have sadly lost their lives. Everyone here at bpha extends their 
sympathy to all involved. There will be a need to review the 
information that emerges from the Inquiry as that unfolds; in the 
meantime working with fire service representatives we have 
looked again at bpha tenants’ safety and the fire precaution 
measures that are in place in the tower blocks that bpha owns. 
Tenants’ safety continues to be our number one priority. 
The year to 31 March 2017 has seen continued progress in many 
areas, details of which are set out in the pages which follow. In this 
statement, I wish to focus upon governance, people and strategy.
Governance 
Following my appointment as Chair in February 2015, the Board 
concluded that bpha’s governance would benefit by working to 
a greater extent through committees; this would facilitate greater 
scrutiny outside of the formal Board meetings by specialist 
Non-Executive and Independent Members who could bring 
both constructive challenge and support to the Executive 
whilst providing greater assurance to the Board. 
Accordingly the Finance & Treasury Committee was established in 
2015 under the Chairmanship of Dr Martin Hurst, a then recently 
appointed non-executive member of the Board. In the two years 
since, I believe that this committee has proved very effective.
Development of new housing has been at the heart of bpha’s 
activities for many years. Post-Brexit referendum, there are 
numerous economic and political uncertainties and whilst bpha is 
committed to building new homes, this needs to be done prudently 
so as to protect the organisation’s long term viability. In 2017, the 
Board established a Development Committee to provide greater 
assurance and scrutiny over all development activity. Paul High, a 
co-opted independent Board member with extensive sector house 
building experience, has been appointed to Chair this committee. 
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the members 
of the Service Improvement Panel, The Resident Inspector Team 
and the Complaints Review Panel for their hard work and vital 
contribution throughout the year to governance, scrutiny, 
engagement and to driving further improvements.
People
The ongoing process of Board succession sadly means that we also 
had to say goodbye to three colleagues and I should like to take this 
opportunity to express my thanks to Neil McGregor-Patterson and 
Geoff Potton for their service to bpha, both of whom stepped down 
in 2016 after serving their full-term of six years, and to Sarah Ireland 
who, as the executive lead for development, played a significant role 
in the success of that department over the last decade. 
In addition to the appointment of Paul High, I was delighted to 
welcome Jill Ainscough to the Board as Chair of the Remuneration 
and Nominations Committee, replacing Neil. Ian Ailles has agreed 
to serve as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. Ian will succeed 
Peter Male and Peter will remain as Senior Independent Director. 
Profiles of all the non-executive members of the Board appointed 
since I took over as Chair are set out on page 13.
Over the last three years bpha has made a lot of new 
appointments at executive and head of service level which 
helped drive improvements as we grew in a carefully controlled 
manner. I am certain that the widened committee structure and 
new Board appointments have strengthened the range of skills 
and experience which complements the management team and 
provides a firm basis for future success.
Strategy
The Board has held a number of detailed strategic discussions 
during the last 12 months. We supported the Executive in committing 
to investment to support new ways of working, including a greater 
emphasis on remote and flexible working and in investing in IT to 
drive efficiencies. We take a long-term view and critically examined 
all aspects of our strategy and operations, including our capacity 
to deliver both Value for Money and more new homes. 
We have set out in these financial statements details of bpha’s 
business model and strategy, how we are investing in people to 
build capability and our development programme. To continue 
to be successful bpha needs to have the right people at all levels; 
bpha’s success has helped attract good people and good people 
are key to continued success. I should like to take this opportunity 
to thank everyone at bpha for their contribution to this success and 
in delivering service for the benefit of all our customers.

02 Chief Executive Officer’s review
A long term business with  
a forward‑looking vision.
Kevin Bolt addresses the 2017 staff conference. 
bpha’s 2017 Financial Statements highlight that this has been an 
extremely successful year for the association, in many respects its 
best ever, which underlines the strength of the current business 
model. Naturally I am very happy with how things have gone but 
what excites me even more is the less visible, but in many ways 
more important, investment that has been made during the year 
in the association’s longer term potential.
At the moment, people seem to be getting quite used to 
unexpected events in their lives be they political, social, economic, 
national or global, so that is the world that bpha has to be strong 
enough, smart enough, resilient enough and committed enough to 
succeed in as we approach the 2020s. In short, we want the bpha 
business model to be flexible enough to cope with the unexpected 
whilst we maintain our commitment to building more homes and 
looking after the customers and homes that we already have. 
In 2016, the Board approved a strategy called ‘Fit for the Future’ 
and this year, with the help and commitment of our staff, we have 
started to deliver this. As detailed on page 7, we have established 
a new business unit operational model that has been designed 
to be both scalable and modular. It will bring greater focus and 
transparency to service delivery, the performance of our assets 
and the overall operational efficiency of the association. Ongoing 
investment in this model over the coming 12 to 24 months will 
enable bpha to continue to perform strongly and ensure we are 
able to adapt to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 
‘Housing Market’ environment of the 2020s and beyond.
We have set out in the pages that follow how we are investing in 
improvements to systems and technology and how we intend to 
deliver improvements to the customer experience whilst driving 
greater Value for Money. Fundamental to all of this are the many 
different people who play key roles within bpha. On pages 6 to 13 
we have detailed how we are investing for growth and how we are 
attracting new talent and growing our own talent. 
We are a long term business with a forward looking vision that 
states we are here: 
To build communities where people can live  
happily in a home they can afford.
Our day to day purpose or mission is that:
We will continue to build and maintain quality homes  
and thriving communities by being increasingly  
efficient and always considering those we house.
Our vision and mission will only be achieved if we have the 
ambition, strength and capability to be adaptable and resilient 
along the way. 2016/17 was a great year for the association and 
I am confident that the full value of our investment and the level of 
our achievement will only become apparent over the coming years. 
I am looking forward to our journey to the 2020s and beyond.

05 Report and financial statements 2017
Financial statements Additional information Governance Strategic report Business model and strategy
Over the last five years, bpha has 
transformed its financial performance. 
This year, we’ve unveiled our new 
business unit structure and corporate 
strategy to continue on this journey.
Financial strength enables an organisation to take choices 
about how it deploys resources and the services it prioritises. In the 
following sections, we have summarised the choices we have made.
We are a strong, financially viable organisation with an efficient 
operating model that delivers Value for Money, and we are well 
placed to continue supplying new homes to meet the strong 
housing demand in our geographic area. 
We exist to help those who cannot currently afford to rent or buy 
through the private market to access a home. We continue to 
operate within a tight geographical area between Oxford and 
Cambridge, centred on Bedford. These areas have some of the 
most expensive housing in the country where house prices are 
commonly between 10–12 times the average salary. Whilst this 
is generally an economically active area with high levels of 
employment, there are some areas of economic deprivation. 
Across the region, many people in low paid employment cannot 
access housing privately – so the need for affordable housing 
remains acute. 
We serve a diverse customer group including tenants, shared 
owners and Help to Buy customers with a range of ages and 
economic circumstance who have different service requirements. 
It is important that we continue to supply a range of dwelling types 
of different sizes and tenures to meet the varied needs of our 
demographic groups. 
Our ambition has not changed – to build or supply homes to as 
many people in need as we can, manage our housing assets 
and tenancies as efficiently as possible, and deliver a service 
that provides exceptional Value for Money for our customers.
But how we work is changing and this year we have restructured 
the organisation to work through a new business model. We now 
have seven business units along with a number of support services. 
To grow successfully, we recognise we need to invest in our support 
infrastructure and to continuously improve our customer offering. 
Our new business units will help inform decisions through improved 
metrics, facilitate clearer reporting, and help deliver greater 
Value for Money during the year ahead and in years to come.

Investing for  
growth.
We are embracing changes in technology and in workforce 
trends to ensure we have the skills we need for the future. 
Our people are central to our future ambition and we 
recognise that the skills that have made us successful to date 
may not be the skills we need tomorrow. The development of 
our people strategy sets out how we will attract and retain 
the right people, embed our values, and use technology to 
drive efficiency and get us closer to our communities. 
To grow successfully, we need good people at all levels 
across bpha. Our strongly improved finances mean we are in a 
position to invest in people, systems and process automations 
that will deliver increased efficiencies in the longer term. 
Our Executive Leadership Team is supported by the 
Senior Management Team, which manages the operational 
areas across bpha. This team has been reinvigorated over the 
last two years with a significant number of new appointments 
bringing fresh insights from both within the housing sector 
and from the commercial world, thereby increasing our 
management capability and our capacity for change. 
Creating the right culture
We work from modern open-plan offices which enables 
closer collaborative working across departments. This year, 
we have further improved the office environment with the 
addition of a hot-desking zone which complements the bright 
and modern working environment.
We work hard to involve employees in all aspects of working 
life and to create more opportunities for close working across 
teams, regardless of locations. The office design facilitates 
regular all-staff briefings and we hold an annual employee 
conference to celebrate success and build momentum. We 
continue to develop efficient working practices, such as the 
launch of a new intranet last year and use of online 
collaboration tools. 
We have an Employee Management Forum which 
provides opportunity for engagement and consultation with 
representative members of staff. We recognise the importance 
of health and wellbeing at work and have supported a series 
of related initiatives. We have also created a number of 
opportunities for staff to give back to the communities we 
serve. Every member of staff has the opportunity to spend 
a day volunteering in our communities and in March 2017, 
we were a contact centre for Red Nose Day, taking tens of 
thousands of pounds in donations on the night. 
Our approach to change has been to clearly and openly 
articulate our strategy and to fully engage with staff. This 
approach helps attract and retain good people and we 
believe it has been a key factor in delivering significant 
financial and operating improvements. 
10 With flexible and mobile working becoming increasingly 
important, we are investing in the systems and technology 
to enable our staff to work remotely. Our ambition is to 
work together wherever we are and respond to our 
customers’ ever-changing needs. 
During the year, we moved our entire frontline home 
agent team from being office based to being community-
based mobile workers. We have invested in high-powered 
lightweight laptops that can operate in tablet mode to 
facilitate frontline staff when meeting customers or 
working away from the office. This investment in new 
technologies is bringing our frontline staff closer to our 
customers. We expect to deliver efficiencies through this 
way of working and are now rolling out mobile working 
across other teams within the organisation. 
This investment is part of our wider digital strategy to 
ensure our workforce has a digital DNA to support our 
drive to shift customer transactions to digital channels. 
The new technologies and systems are changing how 
bpha works. Various projects are underway to integrate 
our internal systems thereby allowing us to automate 
processes and improve efficiency. 
The new technology helps us to 
work on the move while staying 
in touch with our colleagues in 
the office, making us more 
efficient and helping to deliver 
better customer service.

Growing our 
own talent – 
the employee 
perspective.
We are committed to developing and growing our people. 
Over the last year, 33 staff have been promoted to more 
senior roles and we have a management training programme 
to enable more of our operational staff to grow into 
leadership positions. 
Developing our people and offering opportunities to progress 
in different roles is key to attracting great people. A number 
of learning and development initiatives are being rolled out 
this year to grow our own talent through apprenticeships and 
graduate intake, as well as enhancing career development for 
existing employees by supporting professional qualifications. 
Annie Lougheed
Annie joined us in 2004 as 
a Homeless Admin Assistant 
and has risen through the ranks 
in various housing roles since 
then, including Housing/Income 
Officer, Family Intervention 
Case Worker, Assistant Housing 
Manager and Project Manager. 
During this time, she has 
completed two housing 
qualifications paid for by us, 
and she became a Home 
Processing Manager in 
June 2017.
Annie says: “I love working for 
bpha because of the people, 
not just my colleagues but our 
customers as well. I have been 
able to make a difference to 
our customers on a daily basis 
throughout my career and 
I enjoy working with them. 
I can now make strategic 
management decisions based 
on experience and insight 
through my customer-facing 
roles, and currently lead a new 
team which is working towards 
improving the experience for 
customers moving into our 
homes. I now also have the 
privileged opportunity to pass on 
my skills to others and encourage 
other people to progress and 
develop their careers at bpha. 
I find working at bpha a very 
rewarding experience.”
Daniel Walby
Daniel started his career with us in 
August 2012 as a Junior IT Support 
Analyst on the IT Help Desk, having 
previously worked in IT Sales. As  
the IT department grew in size, 
Daniel’s own career has blossomed. 
He became a Senior IT Support 
Analyst, and was then promoted to 
IT Service Desk Lead in December 
2016, with responsibility for Help 
Desk service and supporting the 
transition of staff to mobile working 
through better technology.
Daniel says: “You can definitely  
build a career at bpha. Two of our 
current IT Support Analysts started 
in the Help to Buy team before 
moving to IT, and both now have 
good careers in IT ahead of them. 
The move to mobile working has 
been a massive transformational 
change, but it’s an exciting project 
because it will change people’s lives 
and how they work. We embrace 
change here, which promotes a 
continuous learning and development 
cycle, keeps the role interesting and 
makes every day different.”
Humera Ahmed
Humera joined our Finance team 
in 2010 as a Business Support 
Officer and worked compiling 
Management Accounts for the 
organisation before moving to 
the Asset Management and 
Performance Team as a Senior 
Data Officer in February 2017. 
Humera’s roles in Finance gave 
her exposure to learn about the 
business and people, enabling her 
to work across the organisation. 
She chairs bpha’s Employee 
Management Forum (EMF), which 
supports staff and helps boost their 
wellbeing through various activities 
and initiatives. Outside of work and 
family commitments she joined 
Bedfordshire Police as a Special 
Constable in November 2016. 
Humera said: “I enjoy working 
with all the people at bpha and the 
commitment that they have, and the 
fact that I’m now in a position to be 
able to help them through the EMF 
is great. Everybody is approachable 
here from the top to the bottom, 
which is quite important. We have 
got a good reputation in the 
community and people regularly 
make positive comments about us, 
and that’s a nice thing for us to hear.”
Jordan Taylor
Jordan was promoted to 
the role of Surveyor in bpha’s 
Property Services team in 
January 2017 after joining 
bpha in July 2014 as a Help to 
Buy Assistant. Having studied 
Surveying and Construction 
Management at College, Jordan 
was interested in a career in 
that industry, particularly in 
social housing, so was keen  
to work for bpha after we were 
recommended by friends. 
Jordan says: “I’m not an 
academic person, but after 
getting career advice I was 
interested in construction so 
did a course and really enjoyed 
it. I knew people who worked for 
bpha had recommended it and 
said there was opportunity to 
move around and develop your 
career, so I kept an eye out for 
a position and secured a role in 
the Help to Buy team, and am 
now a Surveyor. What’s good 
about bpha is having a work 
environment where people are 
nice and welcoming, and want 
to help you progress and are 
very supportive, whatever you 
want to achieve.”
12 Attracting new skills 
– the non‑executive 
perspective.
Effective strategic leadership looks both inside and outside. 
Having a unitary Board with members bringing a blend of 
different industry and sector experience gained at Board 
level brings the outside in, ensuring the organisation learns 
from best practice and has appropriate skills to meet the 
organisation’s needs. 
We believe good Board leadership is all about constructive 
challenge and strategic thinking, focusing energies on always 
looking a little further into the future. It’s about really ensuring 
that all angles have been looked at and always pushing to 
see if our performance could be better.
Jill Ainscough
Non-executive director 
and Chair of the 
Remuneration and 
Nominations Committee
Jill joined the bpha Board in 
October 2016 as a non-executive 
director and took over as our 
new Chair of the Remuneration 
and Nominations Committee. Jill 
brings over ten years of Board 
experience to bpha, following 
a career in strategic leadership 
where the last post she held 
was Chief Operating Officer 
and Board member at Ofcom. 
Jill lives in bpha’s operating area 
and this is her first Board post in 
social housing. 
Jill says: “I’ve been pleased to 
see the level of commercial 
awareness and corporate 
efficiency at bpha. And I’ve seen 
first-hand how customers are at 
the heart of everything bpha 
does. Because the Board is not 
involved in the day-to-day 
operations, we can focus on 
always looking a little further 
into the future.”
Paul High 
Co-opted member of the 
Board and Chair of the 
Development Committee  
and Bushmead Homes
Paul brings us over 36 years’ 
experience in residential 
development and property 
management, the majority of which 
has been in the housing association 
sector. He was responsible for the

A year in development
We have a long track record of delivering 
affordable homes and are committed to 
building quality affordable homes across  
our operating area.
Warburton House, 
Cambridge
Joint venture
Warburton House is our first flexi-care scheme for older people, 
comprising 74 apartments for shared ownership or social rent. 
It forms part of the Ninewells development in the attractive and 
sought after area of southern Cambridge – Warburton House 
was built by Bushmead Homes in partnership with Hill Residential. 
The prestigious scheme opened its doors to residents in February 
2017, providing one and two bedroom apartments arranged over 
four floors, with amenities including a cinema, hair salon and 
communal gardens. 
At the heart of this vision is the ‘green fingers’ design concept: a 
series of green spaces that make a connection with the countryside 
and act as viewing corridors to the Gog Magog Downs.
Across our core operating area, high 
property values make it difficult for 
aspiring home owners to get on the 
property ladder, ensuring high demand 
for our shared ownership properties 
which in turn supports the development 
of much needed affordable homes.
Our development team has both the 
critical mass and strength in depth 
to deliver the planned sustainable 
development programme of at least 500 
homes per year in a cost-effective way. 
We have a long track record of developing 
affordable homes on large strategic sites, 
but we develop in a number of ways to 
maximise our scale – these include working 
through joint ventures and rural exception 
schemes. We ensure that development 
choices offer Value for Money.

Banbury, Oxfordshire
Large strategic site
Longford Park is the first large strategic site we have delivered 
in Cherwell as the preferred registered provider working with 
a consortium of major house builders. The newbuild scheme of 
affordable homes is nestled within a larger mixed tenure residential 
development. Located in the small village of Bodicote, near the 
market town of Banbury, the scheme provides a wide variety of 
house types and sizes including two, three and four bedroom 
houses as well as one and two bedroom apartments. 
We completed 55 new homes at Longford Park in the year.  
This site will be completed over three phases and will deliver  
a total of 191 new affordable homes.
Pilgrims House,  
Bedford, Bedfordshire
Value for Money
Pilgrims House is the site of bpha’s former head office which 
has now been converted into 23 one and two bedroom shared 
ownership apartments. Pilgrims House was built in 1991, and 
following our move to new head offices, detailed analysis was 
undertaken of all options for the property. Working closely with 
Bedford Borough Council, it was recognised that affordable shared 
ownership properties offered the best Value for Money alternative. 
Bedford faces a shortage of affordable housing and, in this 
town alone, it is estimated that another 5,000 new homes are 
needed by 2031.
Hermitage Road,  
Earith, Cambridgeshire
Rural exception scheme
Hermitage Road is scheme of 11 new bungalows with private 
gardens and car parking provision. The scheme was a rural 
‘planning exception’ site and the planning consent protects 
the identified natural habitats while providing much needed 
affordable housing for the area. 
The scheme was funded through a combination of bpha funding 
and £415,000 of recycled capital grant. These homes will provide 
affordable housing to local people in housing need in perpetuity 
as the homes are exempt from Right to Buy and allow for a 
maximum of 80% staircasing in the shared ownership homes.

At 31 March 2017, we were building  
27 developments across 15 locations.
Wixams Parcel J,  
Bedfordshire
Parcel J is the latest phase of the development of Wixams 
Village in Bedfordshire. Approximately four miles south 
of the town centre of Bedford, Wixams will eventually 
become four new villages centred around lakes, offering 
new schools, community centres, shops and a railway 
station. In the next year, we are set to complete 18 homes 
for shared ownership and 25 for affordable rent. The 
development of our affordable housing on the site meets 
the high-priority need for affordable family homes in 
the area. The Wixam’s development plan is inspired by 
Ebeneezer Howard’s Garden City Movement, in which 
open space and landscape work together with buildings 
to create distinctive places.
Because the demand for new housing 
in our operating area significantly 
exceeds our capacity to supply it, 
we have established a process to 
determine where our development 
resources should be best invested to 
deliver the greatest Value for Money. 
Our development model enables us 
to grow both bottom line surplus and 
balance sheet strength. We drive this 
by applying strict development criteria 
to maximise return and minimise risk.
Development criteria
In assessing whether to commit 
to a development, the following 
factors are modelled/applied:
• Conservative key development 
assumptions are used.
• All significant proposed 
schemes are subject to internal 
scrutiny and formal reporting 
from treasury employees 
who are independent of the 
development department.
• Internal Rate of Return (IRR) 
must achieve a minimum 
hurdle rate set on the basis of:  
IRR hurdle =  
30 year cost of funds + 
interest cover requirements + 
risk buffer uplift
• Developments must normally 
enhance balance sheet value, 
i.e. asset value generated for 
charging as security is greater 
than net development cost, 
so that overall balance sheet 
capacity is enhanced.
• Our business plan is regularly 
remodelled throughout the 
year. Impact of potential future 
schemes is formally reviewed 
against the updated business 
plan to ensure continued 
sufficiency of liquidity and 
security, and avoidance of 
over‑commitment.

Mill View, Hauxton,

Situated on the A10 leading to Royston, the site will 
provide 70 extra-care apartments for those aged 55 
and over, comprising 25 one bedroom homes for rent 
and 45 two bedroom homes for shared ownership. 
The building will form part of a larger scheme of 425 
new homes on the plot and will meet the needs of 
Cambridge’s growing older population in an area 
where median house prices are 11 times higher than 
median incomes. Estimated completion is spring 2018. 
The scheme reflects the needs identified by both the 
government, and Cambridge City Council for more 
suitable accommodation for older people to ensure they 
can access the care and support they need from their 
own homes in later life. The service charge for each 
apartment will include for an element of care provision, 
which can be increased as the individual needs of residents 
evolve over time.

Operating and financial review
Against a backdrop of economic and 
political change, we have delivered  
our best ever surplus underpinned  
by a strong operating performance. 
The last financial year has seen us achieve our strongest ever 
financial results against a challenging external environment. We 
operate in a region with a high demand for affordable homes and 
our focus on our core social housing business and control of costs, 
together with a controlled development programme, has resulted in 
improvements over the five year period from 2013 to 2017, including:
• operating surplus growth from £35.5m in 2013 to £54.9m in 2017; 
• overall operating surplus as a percentage of turnover of 
44.8% (2015/16: 39.5%) maintained over this five year period;
• underlying surplus growth from £4.3m in 2013 to £30.9m in 2017;
• development or acquisition of 508 new homes  
(2015/16: 450) at a gross cost of £57.3m (2015/16: £47.6m); 
• security headroom risen to £141m (2016: £80m); and
• further strengthening of liquidity with strong operational cash 
flow resulting in debt falling by £6m to £746m (2016: £752m). 
The five year summary opposite, together with the commentary 
that follows, present key performance metrics in order to illustrate 
our business model and the activities, changes and improvements 
that have been achieved during this period.

Operating surplus
As detailed in the table on the previous page, the underlying surplus 
for the year (prior to tax, pension actuarial adjustments, termination 
costs and movements in fair value) has grown from £4.3m in 2013 to 
£30.9m in 2017 (2016: £17.2m). This significant improvement in our 
performance has been driven by contributions from development 
and asset sales and benefits from refinancing undertaken in 
previous years. These improvements continue to be underpinned by 
strong operating performance from our core social housing lettings 
activities which has been achieved in spite of the 1% social housing 
rent cut which took effect at the start of the year.
As detailed in the Value for Money section on pages 24 to 29, 
during the year we have made investments in people, processes 
and systems in order to deliver better customer service. The 
cost of this investment has largely been met through internally 
generated efficiencies. Margins on social housing lettings of 
44.5% have only fallen a little over the year, with performance 
ahead of business plan.
We remain strongly focused on social housing. Social housing 
lettings activity remains the core component of our business, 
generating turnover of £83.9m, or 68% of total turnover. Our 
social housing lettings and other social housing activities together 
account for over 94% of our total turnover. 
Over the five years from 2013 to 2017, our total operating surplus 
has grown from £35.5m to £54.9m (2016: £48.6m). Details of 
the operating surplus and margin on social housing lettings 
are set out in the chart below. 
Development and sales
Across our region, rental yields are strong with market rents 
considerably exceeding social rents. Property prices are high, 
generating shared ownership demand and the opportunity to 
cross subsidise the development of further rented units. We have 
a skilled and integrated development team with a strong track 
record of delivering new homes. Bushmead Homes, our build for 
private sale subsidiary, is continuing to grow at a measured pace 
but without creating an undue level of sales risk exposure.
During the year, we developed or acquired 508 new affordable 
homes (2015/16: 450) at a gross cost of £57.3m (2015/16: £47.6m). 
This level of delivery has been consistently achieved over the 
five year period from 2013 to 2017. Gog Magog Partnership LLP 
completed 56 private sale units and therefore our 25% share 
was 14 units. The strong controls in place over new development 
commitments have ensured that, during the five years, first tranche 
surpluses have contributed to an increased operating surplus and 
completed units have added to balance sheet strength, providing 
some resilience to any market downturn. We have a long-term 
consistent track record of development delivery, and in the year 
delivered 2.8% new units when measured as a proportion of 
total units owned and in management. This compares well to a 
benchmark delivery of 1.6% new units developed as a percentage 
of total units owned and in management (as taken from HCA 
Global Accounts 2016).
Turnover from first tranche shared ownership sales and sales to 
other social housing providers (part of our other social housing 
activity) has grown from £5.2m in 2013 to £27.8m in 2017 (2015/16: 
£29.4m). To ensure the development of new social and affordable 
housing for rent is economically viable, subsidy of the building cost 
is required. The surplus generated by our first tranche shared 
ownership sales of £11.1m in 2017 (2015/16: £7.8m) is a key 
component of our development model.

ownership with 
Help to Buy.
At the start of 2014/15, we were awarded the Help to Buy 
agency for the South East and East of England by the 
Homes and Communities Agency (HCA). We were 
pleased when this contract was extended to March 2017. 
It has since been extended again, to March 2019, and 
continues to contribute a surplus to our overall results. 
If the government extend the scheme further, we would 
hope to continue to provide this service post March 2019 
across the UK. During the three years of Help to Buy: 
Equity Loan scheme (to March 2017), 81,014 properties 
were bought with an equity loan. The total value of these 
equity loans was £3.59 billion, with the value of the 
properties sold under the scheme totalling £18.05 billion. 
The mean purchase price of a property bought under 
the scheme was £222,830, compared with a mean equity 
loan of £44,321. Most of the home purchases in the Help 
to Buy: Equity Loan scheme were made by first time 
buyers, accounting for 65,474 (81%) of total purchases.
Site development on a mixed rented and shared ownership model 
generally works well across our region but, in some areas and for 
some tenure types, shared ownership surplus alone is not sufficient 
and grant is required. We are fortunate to have significant Recycled 
Capital Grant Funds (RCGF), totalling £10.8m (2016: £19.2m), which 
can provide future subsidy. During the year, we have utilised £13.2m 
of RCGF and anticipate that the balance will provide essential future 
subsidy for the development of new affordable homes.
Asset management sales and staircasing performed strongly this 
year, contributing £8.6m (2016: £3.5m) to the overall surplus. This 
result is driven in part by increased numbers of units sold and in 
part by higher surplus per property due to the type of dwelling 
sold. The vast majority of our stock performs well economically 
and therefore there is no imperative for stock rationalisation. 
Hence this asset management activity is mainly driven by 
customer demand, such as staircasing by shared owners, rather 
than as part of a wider asset management strategy. Whilst such 
surpluses help fund further development, our business model 
does not rely upon this. 
Service delivery
During the year, we invested £22.8m (2016: £23.2m) in maintaining 
and improving existing stock, of which £11.4m (2016: £11.7m) was 
capitalised and £11.4m (2016: £11.5m) was charged to revenue. 
Detailed stock condition data makes future maintenance liabilities 
visible and enables us to plan work in cost effective packages, 
which can vary greatly from year to year. During the year to 31 
March 2017, 2,520 properties were resurveyed to keep our stock 
condition data up to date. We have been 100% Decent Homes 
Standard compliant since 2010.

Financial strength
Our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, 
major repairs included (EBITDA MRI) has grown during the five 
years from 2013 to 2017 from £34.8m to £59.9m (2015/16: £51.3m). 
Over the same period, despite growth in stock and associated 
funding, interest costs are little changed. Consequently EBITDA 
MRI as a percentage of interest payable and similar charges, has 
grown from 105% in 2013 to 174% in 2017 (2015/16: 147%). This is a 
sector standard measure which is used to assess the level of 
headroom for meeting interest payments on outstanding debt 
and is important when raising further funding. The growth in the 
EBITDA MRI / interest ratio shows that we are in a strong position 
to more than meet our financing obligations whilst continuing to 
invest in our housing properties.
Our total assets less current liabilities have reached £1,118m 
(2016: £1,097m) and this has risen steadily from £909m in 2013. 
The asset base has been funded through a combination of retained 
reserves of £194m (2016: £169m), long term funding of £738m 
(2016: £752m) and other long term liabilities of £186m (2016: £176m). 
Other long term liabilities are detailed in the notes to the financial 
statements and include government grant, pension liabilities and 
market value of financial instruments. The pension liability of 
£27.6m (2016: £23.9m) represents our share of a long term liability 
under the Local Government Pension Scheme which has been 
closed to new members since 2010. The market valuation of 
financial instruments of £66.2m (2016: £64.2m), has deteriorated 
by £2m during the year. This valuation has fluctuated significantly 
from month to month during the year, with variations sometimes 
exceeding £10m, though the derivatives strategy executed in 
2015/16 significantly reduced the volatility that would otherwise 
have been experienced.
During the year, our housing fixed assets increased by £26m 
and our property portfolio (owned and managed) increased by 
290 units to 18,186. This was the net impact of completions from 
the development programme less the sale of units developed for 
other organisations, customers’ staircasing to 100% and other 
asset sales.

At 31 March 2017, £751m of funding was drawn against total 
facilities of £953m (includes £3m overdraft) and £45.2m of cash 
was immediately available. Our facility headroom has risen to 
£244m from £184m last year mainly due to £75m of additional 
revolving credit facilities that were put in place during the year. 
Our security headroom (made up of undrawn facilities which are 
fully secured and available to draw against plus cash on deposit) 
has risen to £141m from £80m last year. The improvement in 
security headroom is the result of many factors including the 
charging of newly developed units, which are achieving high 
values often in excess of original appraisal, and amendments 
made to the charging of property security against existing loan 
facilities which has increased the efficiency of this charging.
This strong liquidity means that all development commitments 
could have been met from existing facilities without the need 
to raise new funding or to rely upon operational cash flows. 
As detailed in the group cash flow statement, strong operational 
cash flow in the year has meant that drawn debt actually fell by 
£5.6m over the year to £750.8m (2016: £756.4m), despite £57m of 
development expenditure.
As reported last year, following the results of the UK’s referendum 
on membership of the European Union and the decision to exit 
the EU, the UK lost its AAA status and Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 
removed the one notch uplift previously widely applied to the 
sector. Accordingly bpha’s rating was restated as A+ in line with 
our stand-alone credit profile (SACP). Following our 2016 annual 
review with S&P, our credit rating was re-affirmed as A+. Our 
financial viability status remained at the highest level of V1, in 
recognition of our financial strength.

At 31 March 2017, 92% of our drawn debt 
was at a fixed rate of interest, of which the 
majority comprised fixed rate capital 
market debt and bank debt hedged 
through embedded swaps. Only 16% 
related to stand‑alone swaps with 
exposure to margin calls.
69% of our loan facilities mature after ten 
years. We have very limited short term 
refinancing risk since facilities due to 
mature over the next three years are 
mostly attributable to £100m of undrawn 
revolving credit facilities (RCF).
Our liquidity position increased year on 
year and at 31 March 2017 we had £244m 
of available liquidity after securing £75m 
RCF during the year. Our development 
commitments are fully funded.
23 Report and financial statements 2017
Financial statements Additional information Governance Strategic report Value for Money
We have a Value for Money (VfM) strategy which sets out the 
framework of how efficiencies and savings are generated and how 
the delivery of ‘value’ is measured. When measuring value, we look 
at quality as well as cost. We use various sources of benchmarking 
data, including the HCA Global Accounts and Housemark.
At bpha, VfM means:
• spending less – delivering services on budget and on time, 
with procurement achieving the lowest possible cost without 
harming quality;
• spending well – delivering our services efficiently;
• spending wisely – demonstrating that we have achieved our 
objectives within budgetary constraints; and
• spending fairly – demonstrating that all services and benefits 
are distributed equitably.
The Board has concluded that we have been successful in delivering 
VfM, having continued to maintain tight control of operational costs, 
invest in improvements to service delivery and existing stock, deliver 
new homes and restructure our funding at lower cost. The full bpha 
Value for Money self-assessment report can be viewed at:  
www.bpha.org.uk/valueformoney
Generating value is at the heart of all  
that we deliver at bpha and is considered  
at all levels in our organisation. 
Over the past year, we have delivered VfM across three areas:
Return on assets
• Developed and acquired 
508 homes at a cost of 
£57.3m.
• Property sales delivering 
a surplus of £19.7m.
• £4m investment into Gog 
Magog Partnership LLP 
has returned £2.1m profits.
• £22.8m invested in 
maintaining and 
improving stock. 
Resident satisfaction
• 7 percentage point 
increase in 
overall satisfaction for 
general needs tenants.
• 16 percentage point 
increase in overall 
satisfaction for 
shared owners.
• 27% reduction in number 
of complaints received.
• Increased satisfaction that 
rent and service charges 
offer value for money.
Social and environmental 
• Increased the energy 
efficiency of our homes 
– our SAP ratings rose to 
73.52 and next year we will 
carry out improvements 
to ensure we have no 
properties in the lowest 
SAP bands. 
• Increased number of 
aids and adaptations with 
98 major and 315 minor 
adaptations carried out 
to support our disabled 
and older tenants.
• Resident and staff 
volunteers contributed 
over 2,700 hours to 
improve our communities. 
• Financial inclusion team 
generated additional £181k 
of benefit income to reduce 
tenant debt.

2. Benchmark Data Housemark April 2016 
Conversion of head office 
into affordable homes.
The conversion of our old head office, Pilgrims House, in the centre of Bedford, into affordable homes is an example of the use of 
financial modelling to inform decisions. We had outgrown our accommodation and decided that the option of occupying two office 
sites would mean losing out on the efficiencies that being located on one site with our repairs contractor would offer. A business case 
was constructed using suitable analysis and scenario testing to support the office move to a new location and the application was 
made using the Permitted Development planning rights route to obtain a change of use to provide new affordable homes. We explored 
a number of options for redeveloping the site including selling the site in its existing state, and concluded that we would generate the 
most value by converting Pilgrims House into apartments for sale. Modern and affordable housing in the centre of Bedford is in high 
demand, evidenced by nearly the entire scheme selling off plan.

Value for Money performance
During 2016/17, we achieved a strong overall performance for 
Value for Money across a range of indicators. For the first time, 
we have benchmarked bpha Limited to a comparable group of 
housing associations in terms of size and geography, as well as 
nationally. This has shown that our performance is generally 
within or stronger than the upper quartile of our benchmarking 
group, reflecting our tight focus on financial controls, younger 
stock profile and commitment to building new homes. 
Our operating margin on social housing lettings is high by sector 
standard and we also perform better than the upper quartile of 
our peer group on this measure. Feeding into this performance, 
our headline social housing cost per home
1
 is between the lower 
and median quartile compared to our peers. 
1. As defined on the sector scorecard as management and service charge 
costs plus routine, planned and major repairs expenditure plus other 
social housing expenditure, all divided by social housing units managed.

Our repairs and maintenance costs per home are also between 
the lower and median quartile compared to our peers, reflecting 
our relatively young stock and efficiency of procurement. Our 
management cost per home is between the upper and median 
quartiles compared to our peers.
Aligning our 
development and 
operating areas.
During 2016/17, we redefined our core operating area 
to encompass 11 local authorities across the Oxford 
to Cambridge arc, and withdrew from seeking new 
development opportunities in South Oxfordshire and the 
Vale of White Horse. By concentrating our stock in core areas, 
we can maximise our efficiencies in management and service 
delivery costs. We will also benefit from developing strong 
relationships in these areas to ensure we are in a good 
position to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise.

Value for Money continued
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, 
major repairs included (EBITDA MRI) is used to measure financial 
strength. We perform strongly on this measure against our peers, 
being above the upper quartile. When we look at EBITDA MRI as 
a percentage of interest payable and similar charges, we perform 
between the lower and median quartiles of our peer group. This is 
a sector standard measure which is used to assess the level of 
headroom for meeting interest payments on outstanding debt 
and our performance reflects our relatively high gearing.
Future improvements to VfM
As our operating costs are already low by sector standards, 
our focus for the future is on generating the most value from 
our activities. Our restructuring into business units will require 
changes and investments which will continue into 2017/18 and 
beyond. The management of our operations through business units 
will result in a more commercial approach to asset management 
to ensure we get the best VfM performance from all our assets. 
Our investment in technology will deliver efficiency savings and 
increase consistency in service delivery once achieved. However, 
these improvements will not be realised immediately and will be 
delivered over the next two years.

Footnote – how our benchmarking was conducted
Registered providers are required to set out the absolute and comparative costs of delivering services. In looking at comparative costs, it is important to compare to 
a peer group as well as making a global comparison, so we have reviewed the HCA Global Accounts for year ended 31 March 2016 and applied the following criteria:
• included associations with 50% or more of social housing stock within the eastern and south eastern regions;
• from this group, we excluded associations with over 30,000 units in order to retain associations of a comparable size;
• we then excluded associations with less than 7,000 units again in order to retain associations of a comparable size; and
• this resulted in a peer group of 13 associations. The peer group contains seven associations with a larger number of social housing units than bpha and six with 
a smaller number of units. For full details, please see our Value for Money self-assessment report at www.bpha.org.uk.
In some cases, the HCA Global Accounts records or measures data applying different criteria to that used in other sections of these financial statements. Therefore, 
to ensure true comparability to National and Peer Group, in some cases, such as EBITDA MRI interest cover percentage, the figures in this section will differ to those 
shown elsewhere in the financial statements. 
We are proud of our development track record and the graph 
of units developed as a percentage of social housing units owned 
illustrates a strong performance relative to our peers. In 2017, our 
performance on this measure was above the upper quartile of 
our peer group, however, there is a wide range of performance 
amongst our peers on this measure.
Improving the community  
at Queens Park, Bedford.
During the year, properties in the Queens Park area in Bedford 
were scheduled for replacement roofs. However, during the 
survey phase, we recognised that we would achieve greater 
Value for Money by combining these works with other 
improvements to enhance the properties. 
In total, 194 properties have benefitted from the programme 
of work which has included reroofing, communal area 
improvements and repair of existing boundary walls and 
gates for a total contract value of c£900k. We worked with 
councillors, highways and community development, our 
resident inspectors, street rangers and fire safety officers 
to ensure that the project ran smoothly. 
It has been completely refreshed. 
It looks like a new area now. This has 
given us a sense of pride and it has 
really brought the community together.

Regulatory framework
The HCA, as social housing regulator, continues to rate us as G1, 
meaning that we are properly governed, and V1 meaning that the 
association is financially viable and has the capacity to mitigate 
its exposures effectively.
Registered providers are required by the HCA to certify their 
compliance with the Governance and Financial Viability Standard. 
We confirm that we comply in all material respects with the Standard.
Corporate governance
During the year, we complied with our chosen code of governance, 
namely the National Housing Federation Code of Governance 2015.
The Board recognises its responsibility for all aspects of the 
business and has in place a comprehensive and effective 
governance framework. The Board has reserved to itself, through 
its terms of reference, essential functions and significant matters 
which cannot be delegated.
In order to deliver effective governance and to manage risk, 
the Board has established three committees, the Audit and 
Risk Committee, the Finance and Treasury Committee and 
the Remuneration and Nominations Committee, all of which are 
governed by written terms of reference approved by the Board. 
The Board has established a Development Committee which will 
commence operations during the financial year 2017/18 to provide 
additional assurance and oversight in relation to the group’s

recommendations about how performance might be improved. 
During the year, our resident scrutiny was delivered through our 
Service Improvement Panel and a team of resident inspectors. 
The Service Improvement Panel comprises residents and operates 
independently to ensure we meet our co-regulatory requirements. 
The work of the Service Improvement Panel is governed by terms 
of reference which provide that its primary objectives are:
• scrutiny and challenge – to monitor, scrutinise and challenge 
our performance to ensure continual improvement and 
development of best practice in service delivery for current 
and future residents;
• resident involvement – to ensure that residents are involved  
at the highest level of decision making and that our strategic 
direction in service delivery reflects the needs and aspirations 
of our customers and residents; and
• customer service – to ensure that we are meeting our customer 
service obligations.
Alongside the Service Improvement Panel, the Customer 
Complaints Panel monitors and reviews our complaints processes 
and works with us to identify where improvements can be made. 
An online engagement and scrutiny tool is being developed. This 
will create a virtual community through which ongoing scrutiny 
work will primarily be delivered.

Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Governance Subsidiary company governance 
The Board retains the ultimate responsibility for the governance 
of its subsidiary companies and has reserved to itself the power 
to appoint and remove directors to/from the Board of any of its 
subsidiary entities.
The Board has determined that the Board of Bushmead Homes 
Limited should be chaired by a non-executive or co-opted Board 
member, in order to provide appropriate independent oversight of 
all development activity.
Internal control assurance 
The Board acknowledges its overall responsibility for establishing 
and maintaining the whole system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. This responsibility applies to the 
association and all of its subsidiaries.
The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. This 
provides reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board cannot delegate ultimate responsibility for the system 
of internal control, but has delegated responsibility to the Audit 
and Risk Committee to regularly review the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control. The Board receives minutes of all Audit 
and Risk Committee meetings, which normally take place four 
times a year.
The Senior Management Team, which comprises the 
Executive Leadership Team together with the departmental 
heads, formally discusses lessons learned from reviews of the 
internal control framework, and systems and processes are 
strengthened accordingly.
Governance report continued
Tenant engagement.
We recognise the importance 
of residents having the opportunity 
to scrutinise our performance.
34 The Board has received the annual report of the internal 
auditor which did not identify any matters that would undermine 
the overall integrity of the system of internal control. This approach 
is underpinned by the ISO 9001 registration, which provides a 
recognised quality assurance standard for managing and auditing 
our operational procedures. The Board has determined that the 
system of internal control of the organisation is effective.
The process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks we face is ongoing and has been in place 
throughout the period commencing 1 April 2016 up to the 
date of approval of the this Report and financial statements.
The key elements of the control framework include:
Board and Committees
• Formal Terms of Reference for Board and Committees.
• Delegated authorities.
• Established reporting to Board and Committees.
• Committee structure (with suitably qualified independent 
members) providing depth and breadth of scrutiny 
and challenge.
Risk management
• Clearly defined management responsibilities for the 
identification, evaluation and control of risks.
• Established fraud and bribery policies.
• Strategic business planning process with detailed financial 
budgets and forecasts.
•  Established authorisation and appraisal procedures for all 
new initiatives and commitments.
• In-house corporate finance expertise.
• Regular monitoring of loan covenants.
People
• Formal employee recruitment, and learning and 
development policies.
• Whistleblowing policy.
• Health and safety ethos embedded across the association; 
policies and procedures reinforced via mandatory training 
and practical seminars.
External assurance/regulatory scrutiny
• Internal audit programmes designed to evaluate effectiveness 
of controls for all areas of the business in a rolling programme 
– bespoke audits for new risks when appropriate.
• Annual external audit.
• Specialist support commissioned when appropriate.
• Reports to HCA through a range of regulatory returns.
• ISO 9001 assurance.
The control framework is underpinned by monthly performance 
reports which are used to monitor performance against annual 
targets. These reports include monitoring of customer satisfaction, 
housing management, financial results and repairs and maintenance 
performance and, where applicable, KPIs are benchmarked both 
with HouseMark peer group results and other sources.

Risk and assurance
We recognise that the upside of risk is 
opportunity and that we will choose which risks 
to accept, which to mitigate and which to avoid 
as we operate and develop our business.
Over the last year, we have continued to develop and embed our 
strategic approach to risk management. The Board understands 
that there is a balance to be maintained between key risk areas, 
and that in some areas of activity it may be appropriate to accept 
some carefully assessed risks in order to deliver our strategy. 
Our approach to risk management has built upon the process that 
was adopted in the last financial year and is consistent with our 
continuous improvement ethos. All managers within bpha are 
trained in risk management which encompasses many different 
aspects from risk identification, mitigation, scoring and reporting 
and how this feeds through to Board reporting and assurance. 
Training includes consideration of how current or proposed 
activities fall within bpha’s defined risk appetite. 
We have detailed below aspects of the approach, focusing in 
particular upon risk scoring and risk appetite.
Risk scoring
All individual risks are recorded in departmental risk registers 
which are consolidated, reviewed, moderated and reported. We 
score risks based upon likelihood of a risk occurring multiplied by 
the impact if the risk event were to happen. Both likelihood and 
impact are scored on a scale of 1–10. We also consider what 
mitigations are in place to reduce likelihood and/or impact. 
In scoring risks, we use a defined scoring matrix to ensure 
consistency of approach. There are agreed definitions for 
each score, but these can be summarised as:
36 Our principal risks and uncertainties
Risk Impact Mitigation Change
Health and safety 
and HR Resources
There are many potential risks that could arise 
to tenants and employees from failure to fully 
comply with health and safety requirements. 
More generally, there are risks associated 
with dependency on key employees.
Considerable focus upon health and safety at all 
levels which is managed by a cross functional 
strategic health and safety group. Compliance 
updates are regularly reported to the Board. Steps 
have been taken to identify key staff dependencies 
and to recruit/train additional staff to provide 
organisational resilience.
Brexit, political 
and welfare  
reform
Rollout of Universal Credit and changes from 
the Housing and Planning Act 2016 could 
impact rent income and arrears. Uncertainty 
about Government’s housing policy and 
initiatives pre-Brexit.
Universal Credit is being rolled out across 
our operating region, but due to relatively high 
levels of economic activity and employment we 
are less exposed to welfare reform risk than some 
associations. Increased focus on debt management 
and mobile working has facilitated closer customer 
contact to ensure risks are tightly managed and 
controlled. Within our financial plans, we have 
updated assumptions and undertaken 
sensitivity analysis.
Financial and 
economic
Uncertainty in financial markets and other 
global economic challenges could adversely 
affect the UK’s economy and housing market 
with consequent financial impact.
Our business plan is fully funded and liquidity 
has improved. Our treasury strategy and policy, 
approved by the Board annually, outlines our risk 
strategy for, amongst others, financial market risk, 
liquidity risk and counterparty risk. These risks are 
monitored quarterly, ensuring we perform within the 
parameters of the strategy and that we remain loan 
covenant compliant.
IT service 
disruption and 
data regulatory 
compliance
Increased dependence on technology  
means any loss of core operational  
systems and technology would disrupt  
our ability to operate. Increased risk of 
malicious attack from hackers or malware. 
Business continuity plans are maintained and 
tested, and external advice is taken to ensure that 
these plans are robust. There is ongoing investment 
in software systems and IT infrastructure, which is 
designed to reduce the risk of external threats and 
other disruptions to core services. For example, 
during 2016/17 we have implemented enhanced 
firewalls, improved website security and introduced 
email screening software.
Element Scale/Appetite Description
Health and safety 
1
Minimal
Only accept minimal risk in this area. Due to the nature 
of operations, we seek to minimise health and safety and service 
delivery risk to as low a level as possible whilst accepting that 
from time to time certain risks, such as lone working, will occur. 
For other risks such as gas safety, a zero risk tolerance approach 
is adopted.
Finance and treasury
2
Cautious
We are prepared to accept the possibility of some well managed 
risk in this area. Appropriate risk buffers over and above covenant 
and liquidity thresholds, are required for both existing and 
future activities.
Legal and regulation 
2
Cautious
This is in line with a “comply or explain” principle, where the 
approach must be justifiable and based on sound decision making.
Reputation
2
Cautious
Tolerance for reputational risk is limited to those events 
where there is little or no chance of significant repercussion 
for the organisation.
Strategy
3
Balanced
We accept that to meet our strategic goals, there may be 
times in which riskier options may have to be pursued. We will 
therefore accept some clearly defined risk but only on the basis 
of well assessed opportunities within a controlled and 
measurable framework.
Risk appetite
bpha’s risk appetite has been defined and approved at Board. All new activities or proposed contracts, such as proposed developments 
or treasury activities, are assessed against our risk appetite before commitments are made. Risk appetite is measured on a scale from 
zero to five, ranging from total avoidance to acceptance of speculative risk, and is considered in relation to five elements:

Philippa Spratley
Company Secretary

the UK and Republic of Ireland. 
The financial statements are required by law to give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the association

steps as are reasonably open to it to safeguard the assets of the 
association and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
The Board is responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
association’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the association as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of the Board

43 Report and financial statements 2017
Financial statements Additional information Governance Strategic report 1. Legal status
bpha Limited (the association) is registered under the Co-
operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 Register 
(No:26751R) and is registered with the Homes and Communities 
Agency (HCA) (No:LH 3887) as a social landlord. It is a public 
benefit entity. 
2. Principal accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
bpha Limited is the ultimate parent undertaking for the group and 
has prepared consolidated financial statements as there are three 
subsidiaries, bpha Finance plc, Bushmead Homes Limited and 
CPLhomes Management Services Limited, that are considered  
to be material components of the group. The group financial 
statements consolidate the accounts of the association and all  
of its subsidiaries at 31 March 2017.
Subsidiary financial statements are prepared for the same 
reporting periods as the association, using consistent accounting 
policies except where indicated in the notes to the financial 
statements. Intra-group balances and transactions, including 
unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, are 
eliminated in full on consolidation.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements of the group and association are 
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 102 (FRS 102) which is the 
applicable financial reporting standard in the UK and Republic of 
Ireland and the Statement of Recommended Practice: Accounting 
by Registered Social Housing Providers Update 2014 (SORP 2014), 
and comply with the Accounting Direction for Private Registered 
Providers of Social Housing 2015. The transition date to FRS102 
that forms the basis of these statements is 31 March 2014.
Going concern
The group and association’s business activities, its current 
financial position and factors likely to affect its future 
development are set out within this report and financial 
statements. The group and association has in place long-term 
borrowing facilities which provide adequate resources to finance 
committed reinvestment and development programmes, along 
with the group and association’s day to day operations. The group 
and association also have a long-term business plan which shows 
that they are able to service debt facilities whilst continuing to 
comply with lenders’ covenants.
On this basis, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the 
group and association has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future, being a period  
of at least twelve months after the date on which the report and  
financial statements are signed. For this reason, the group and 
association continue to adopt the going concern basis in these 
financial statements.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the association’s assets, other 
than investment property, are reviewed at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount 
is estimated. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-
generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Additionally, 
because the association’s assets are held for their service 
potential, the depreciated replacement cost is also considered  
as part of the impairment review. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the 
cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-
generating unit” or “CGU”).
The calculation of the recoverable amount for impairment testing, 
including the depreciated replacement cost of housing properties 
held for social benefit, is an accounting estimate that may have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an 
asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Joint arrangements
Joint arrangements are those contractual undertakings in which 
the group exercises joint control over the operating and financial 
policies of the arrangement. Where the joint arrangement is 
carried out through a legal entity, it is treated as a jointly 
controlled entity. Joint arrangements are held as fixed asset 
investments, shown at cost, less any amounts written-off.
Where the group has entered into a contractual arrangement that 
is classed as a jointly controlled entity, the jointly controlled entity is 
accounted for using the equity method, which reflects the group’s 
share of the profit or loss, other comprehensive income and equity 
of the jointly controlled entity.
Turnover
Turnover comprises rental and service charge income receivable 
(net of void losses), first tranche sales of shared ownership 
properties, sales of properties built for sale, supporting people 
income, fees, and other services included at the invoiced value 
(excluding VAT where applicable) of goods and services supplied in 
the year, amortisation of deferred capital grants, and other revenue 
grants receivable. It also includes, in accordance with FRS 102, 
amortisation of Social Housing Grant (SHG) by applying the accrual 
model such that deferred grant income is released as income over 
the life of the asset. Revenue grants are recognised when the 
conditions for receipt of agreed grant funding have been met.
Rental income is recognised from the point when properties 
under development reach practical completion or otherwise 
become available for letting. Income from property sales is 
recognised at the point of legal completion of the sale.
Cost of sales
Included within operating costs are costs relating to newly 
developed properties sold in the year. These costs include 
expenditure incurred during the course of development of 
those properties, including capitalised interest, direct overheads, 
marketing and other incidental costs incurred during the course 
of sale of those properties.
Improvements to existing properties
The amount of expenditure incurred which relates to an 
improvement, which is defined as delivering an increase in the net 
rental stream or the life of a component, is capitalised. Expenditure 
incurred on other major repairs, cyclical and day-to-day repairs to 
housing properties is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income in the period in which it is incurred.
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2017
44 2. Principal accounting policies continued
Leased assets
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over 
the lease term. The aggregate benefits of lease incentives are 
recognised as a reduction to the expense recognised over the 
lease term on a straight line basis. 
Value Added Tax
The association charges Value Added Tax (VAT) on some of 
its income and is able to recover part of the VAT it incurs on 
expenditure. The Statement of Comprehensive Income includes 
VAT to the extent that this is suffered by the association and not 
recoverable from HM Revenue & Customs.
Interest payable
Interest payable is capitalised on borrowings to finance 
developments to the extent that it accrues in respect of the period of 
development. Capitalised interest is calculated on borrowings of the 
association as a whole to the extent that they can be deemed to be 
financing the development programme. Other interest payable is 
charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year.
Corporation Tax
The association has charitable status and is not subject to 
Corporation Tax on surpluses arising as a result of, or earned  
in furtherance of, its charitable objectives.
The association is considered to pass the tests set out in Paragraph 1 
Schedule 6 Finance Act 2010 and therefore it meets the definition 
of a charitable association for UK Corporation Tax purposes. 
Accordingly, the association is potentially exempt from taxation 
in respect of income or capital gains received within categories 
covered by Chapter 3 Part 11 Corporation Tax Act 2010 or Section 256 
of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such 
income or gains are applied exclusively to charitable purposes.
The association has a number of subsidiary companies, some 
of which do not have charitable status and which therefore are 
subject to Corporation Tax. For these entities, the charge for 
Corporation Tax is based on the result for the period and takes  
into account deferred taxation. Deferred taxation is provided on 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation  
and accounting purposes, unless it is probable that the difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Housing properties and other tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes 
the cost of acquiring land and buildings, directly attributable 
development costs, interest at the average cost of borrowing for  
the development period, and expenditure incurred in respect of 
improvements. Improvements are works which result in an increase 
in the net rental income, such as a reduction in future maintenance 
costs, or result in a significant extension of the useful economic life  
of the property in the business. Only the direct overhead costs 
associated with new developments or improvements are capitalised.
Housing properties are principally properties available for rent 
and properties subject to shared ownership leases.
Properties under construction are stated at cost within fixed assets 
and are transferred into housing properties when completed. The 
costs of shared ownership properties under construction are split 
proportionately between current and fixed assets; the proportion 
relating to expected first tranche sales is classed as a current asset 
and the remaining element is classed as a fixed asset which is 
transferred into housing properties when completed.
Land donated by local authorities and others is added to cost  
at the market value of the land at the time of donation.
Depreciation
The association separately identifies the major components 
which comprise its housing properties and charges depreciation, 
so as to write down the cost of each component to its estimated 
residual value on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life. 
The group believes that the periods used are reasonable based 
on their experience. The most material assumption is the lives of 
housing property components: these were determined in 2010 when 
component accounting was first adopted. Where a component is 
replaced, any residual carrying value is fully written off in the year 
of replacement, and the cost of the replacement component 
is capitalised.
Care Home properties are depreciated over the length of the 
related Lease Agreements. 
Shared ownership properties are not depreciated and are held at 
cost less any proportion sold.
Major components are treated as separable assets and depreciated 
over their expected useful economic lives as detailed below:
Assets Years
Structure 100
Kitchens 20
Bathrooms 30
Heating systems – boilers 12
Heating systems – radiators 30
Roofs 60
Windows and doors 30
Electrics 30
Lift – refurbishment 20
Lift – renewal 60
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Furniture and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis 
over the expected economic useful lives of the assets, which range 
between two and ten years. Long leasehold offices are stated at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value. Short leasehold offices 
are depreciated on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed if there is an indication of a significant change since  
the last annual reporting date in the pattern by which the Group 
expects to consume an asset’s future economic benefits.
Investment properties
Investment properties consist of commercial properties and 
other properties not held for social benefit or for use in the 
business. Investment properties are measured at cost on initial 
recognition and subsequently at fair value at the year end date, 
with changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. Fair value is determined annually by 
appropriately qualified external valuers and is derived from current 
market rents and investment property yields for comparable 
properties, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, 
location or condition of the specific asset. No depreciation is 
provided on investment properties.

Concessionary loans 
A concessionary loan is a loan made or received between a public 
benefit entity or an entity within a public benefit entity group and 
another party:
(a) at below the prevailing market rate of interest;
(b) that is not repayable on demand; and
(c) is for the purposes of furthering the objectives of the public 
benefit entity or public benefit entity parent.
These loans are measured at the amount advanced at the 
inception of the loan less amounts received and any provisions  
for impairment. Any associated grant is recognised as deferred 
income until the loan is redeemed.
The association has a number of arrangements that are 
considered to be concessionary loans:
HomeBuy and other similar schemes – under the HomeBuy 
scheme, the association received HomeBuy grant representing  
a percentage of the open market purchase price of a property in 
order to advance interest free or low interest loans to a homebuyer. 
The loans advanced by the association meet the definition of 
concessionary loans and are shown as fixed assets investments on 
the Statement of Financial Position. The HomeBuy grant provided 
by the government to fund all or part of a HomeBuy loan has been 
classified as a deferred income creditor, due in more than one year.
In the event that the property is sold, the association recovers the 
equivalent loaned percentage value of the property at the time of 
the sale. The grant is reclassified to Recycled Capital Grant Fund 
when the loans are redeemed up to the amount of the original 
grant and to the extent the proceeds permit. The association is 
able to retain any surplus proceeds less sale costs attributable  
to the equivalent loaned percentage share of the value of the 
property. If there is a fall in the value of the property, the shortfall 
of proceeds is offset against the grant creditor.
Rent and service charge agreements – the association has 
made arrangement with individuals and households for arrears 
payments of rent and service charges. These arrangements are 
effectively loans granted at nil interest rate.
Properties for sale
Properties held for sale including shared ownership properties 
and property under construction are stated at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Cost comprises materials, direct labour 
and direct development overheads. Net realisable value is based 
on estimated sales price after allowing for all further costs of 
completion and disposal.
Basic financial instruments
Tenant arrears, trade and other debtors – recognised initially  
at transaction price. Tenants and other debtors that are collected 
through the administration of payment plans or over an agreed 
finite period of time are discounted to determine their net present 
value with a subsequent impairment evaluation undertaken  
and resultant impact recorded in the Statement of  
Comprehensive Income.
Trade and other creditors – recognised initially at transaction 
price. If the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, for 
example if payment is deferred beyond normal business terms, it 
is measured at the present value of future payments discounted 
at a market rate for a similar debt instrument.
Interest-bearing borrowings classified as basic financial 
instruments – recognised initially at fair value less attributable 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the straight line 
method, less any impairment losses. Where the group has incurred 
a premium or discount on its bond issues, the balance is shown net 
against the associated bond liability and is charged over the term 
of the debt using the straight line method.
Investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and 
associates – recognised at transaction price including attributable 
transaction costs.
Cash and cash equivalents – comprise cash balances and call 
deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of the group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Current asset investments
Current asset investments are stated at market value and include 
mark to market collateral deposits and investments.
Liquid resources
Liquid resources are readily disposable current asset investments. 
They include some money market deposits held for more than 
24 hours that can only be withdrawn without penalty on maturity 
or by giving notice of more than one working day.
Social housing and other grant
Social housing grants received in relation to assets that are 
presented at deemed cost at the date of transition to FRS 102 have 
been accounted for using the performance model as required by 
SORP 2014. In applying this model, such grant has been presented 
as if it were originally recognised as income within the Statement  
of Comprehensive Income in the year it was receivable and is 
therefore included within brought forward reserves.
Social housing grants received since the transition date in relation 
to newly acquired or existing housing properties are accounted 
for using the accrual model set out in FRS 102 and SORP 2014. As 
required by SORP 2014, grant is carried as deferred income in the 
Statement of Financial Position and released as income within the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income account on a systematic 
basis over the useful economic lives of the assets for which it was 
received. In accordance with SORP 2014, the useful economic life  
of the housing property structure has been selected (see table of 
useful economic lives on page 45).
Where a Social Housing Grant funded property is sold, the grant 
becomes recyclable and is transferred to a Recycled Capital 
Grant Fund (RCGF) or Disposal Proceeds Fund (DPF) until it is 
reinvested in a replacement property or repaid. If there is no 
requirement to recycle or repay the grant on disposal of the 
assets, any unamortised grant remaining within creditors is 
released and recognised as income within the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Grants relating to revenue are recognised as income in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income over the same period as  
the expenditure to which they relate once performance-related 
conditions have been met.
Grants due from government organisations or received in 
advance are included as current assets or liabilities.
Notes to the financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 March 2017
46 2. Principal accounting policies continued
Social housing and other grant
Other grants include grants from local authorities and other 
organisations. Grants in respect of revenue expenditure are 
credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the same 
period as the expenditure to which they relate.
Deferred income
Deferred income comprises both premiums on leases which are 
released over the life of the lease and other income received, such 
as unamortised grants, which is carried forward over the lives of 
the assets concerned.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position 
when the association has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation. Provisions are recognised at the best 
estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at 
the reporting date.
The association’s receivables provision policy is based on review 
of the age profile of its debt, historical collection rates and the 
class of debt. Bad and doubtful debts are provided on all debtors’ 
arrears and are dependent on the status of the tenancy or debtor 
and on the age of the debt.
Current tenant debtors are provided for at a level which is  
based on reviews of individual balances, while former tenants  
are provided for in full. Other debtors are reviewed on a  
case-by-case basis.
Other financial instruments and hedging
The association uses interest rate swaps to reduce its exposure 
to future increases in interest rates on floating rate loans. Amounts 
payable and receivable in respect of these agreements are 
recognised as adjustments to interest payable over the period 
of the agreement. These interest rate swaps are classified either 
as basic or other financial instruments in accordance with the 
requirements of FRS 102.
Other financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and 
are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date. 
The group considers whether each individual derivative contract  
is hedge effective. If it is hedge effective, the group considers 
whether or not to hedge account for the derivative contract 
according to business circumstances and then applies this 
consistently in successive years over the life of the contract.  
To the extent that a derivative is not hedge effective, or the group 
chooses not to hedge account, the gain or loss on remeasurement 
to fair value is recognised immediately in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. Derivatives are carried as assets when 
the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value  
is negative.
The fair value of derivatives is disclosed in note 19.
Pension costs
The association operates a defined benefit pension scheme which 
closed to new members from 31 March 2010.
The assets of the closed scheme are invested and managed 
independently of the finances of the group. These pension 
scheme assets are measured using market values and pension 
scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method 
and discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality 
corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability. In 
accordance with FRS 102 section 28, the pension scheme surplus 
(to the extent that it is recoverable) or deficit is recognised in full. 
The movement in the scheme surplus/deficit is split between 
operating charges, finance items and, in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, actuarial gains and losses.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice 
of independent qualified actuaries. Costs include the regular 
cost of providing benefits which, it is intended, should remain a 
substantially level percentage of the current and expected future 
earnings of the employees covered. Variations from the regular 
pension costs are spread evenly through the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income over the average remaining service lives 
of the current employees.
There are a number of critical underlying assumptions when 
measuring the defined benefit scheme, including standard rates 
of inflation, mortality, discount rates and anticipation of future 
salaries. Variation in these assumptions may significantly impact 
the defined benefit obligation and annual expense. These 
assumptions and calculations are prepared by an  
independent actuary.
These actuarial assumptions may have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year. Refer to note 20 for 
the valuation of the Local Government Pension Scheme deficit 
funding contributions and valuations of defined benefit  
assets/liabilities.
Since 1 April 2010, a defined contribution scheme has been 
available to employees. The charge to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income which represents the association’s 
contribution to the scheme for the accounting period is detailed  
in the notes to the financial statements.
Other employee benefits
The policy of the association is to recognise the cost of all 
employee benefits to which employees have become entitled  
as a result of service rendered during the reporting year.
Contingent liabilities
A contingent liability is either a possible but uncertain obligation 
as a result of a past event, or present obligation that arises from 
past events but is not recognised because:
• it is not probable that an outflow of economic resources will  
be required; or
• the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with 
sufficient reliability.
The association’s policy is not to provide for contingent liabilities. 
Full disclosure is made within the financial statements.
Capital commitments
These are predominantly commitments towards developments 
which have been contracted and which have started on site, or 
which have been approved by the association’s Board.

54 11. Taxation
The association has charitable status and is not subject to corporation tax on surpluses arising as a result of, or earned in furtherance 
of, its charitable objectives.
The association has a number of subsidiary companies, some of which do not have charitable status and which therefore are subject  
to corporation tax. For these entities, the charge for corporation tax is based on the result for the period and takes into account 
deferred taxation. Deferred taxation is provided on differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting 
purposes, unless it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The tables below present disclosure in respect of Bushmead Homes Limited, whose results are consolidated into the bpha  
group accounts.

58 18. Debt analysis
Bank and building society loans are secured by specific charges on the association’s housing properties and are subject to fixed 
rates of interest (excluding margin on the loan) ranging from 1.29% to 10.64% and at variable rates linked to LIBOR. Our syndicated 
loan facility has an amortised repayment profile under which the first repayment was made in March 2017 and the loan will be fully 
repaid by March 2040. The other bank and building society loans will be repaid by December 2047.
In March 2016, the association secured £80m of funding arranged through The Housing Finance Corporation (THFC) under the 
Affordable Homes Guarantee Programme. £36m was secured directly through THFC and £44m was secured through the European 
Investment Bank (EIB). Of this, £69m has been drawn down and a further £11m is available to be drawn from the EIB. At 31 March 2016, 
the funding was secured by cash collateral until property security charging could be completed, which occurred during the year ended 
31 March 2017.
During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group raised £200m by issuing a bond through its subsidiary, bpha Finance plc. The £200m 
bond carries a coupon of 4.816%, is repayable in 2044 and is secured by specific charges on the association’s properties.

59 Report and financial statements 2017
Financial statements Additional information Governance Strategic report 19. Financial instruments
The association has stand-alone International Swaps and Derivatives Association arrangements in order to hedge against the long 
term risk of an increase in variable interest rates under its principal loan facility. As a Co-operative and Community Benefit Society 
with charitable objectives and a social landlord registered with HCA, the association does not trade for profit and is regulated by 
HCA which has issued extensive guidelines on the use of derivative instruments by registered social landlords.
The association has applied this guidance in entering into derivative transactions which include ‘swaptions’, in which the bank 
counterparties have the right to enter an equal and opposite swap at various dates in the future and these are detailed in the table 
below. The commencement dates of these swaps range from 27 February 2004 to 28 March 2014.
During the prior year, the association undertook a comprehensive strategy in relation to all financial instruments in order to reduce the 
risk of margin calls in relation to stand-alone swaps and to reduce future interest costs. The association terminated a number of swaps 
and partially terminated some others and at the same time entered into new embedded swaps. The association’s exposure to margin 
calls has been materially reduced as a result of this restructuring.
The interest rate swaps detailed under (i) below are hedge effective, but the association has chosen not to hedge account for these.

In addition to the stand alone interest rate swaps detailed in (i) to (iii) above, the association also entered into an embedded forward 
fixed rate transaction for a nominal amount of £11m under its Affordable Housing Finance Facility funded by the European Investment 
Bank. This transaction was entered into on 20 June 2016, with a mark to market exposure being incurred until the advance date of 
6 June 2017. As at 31 March 2017 the market valuation liability of this forward fixed rate transaction was £1.38m.
Association information has not been separately disclosed within this note as group is materially the same as association.
20. Pensions
The association is an admitted member of the Bedfordshire Pension Fund (the fund). This is a multi-employer scheme with more than 
one participating employer, which is administered by Bedford Borough Council under the regulations governing the Local Government 
Pension Scheme, and is a defined benefit scheme. The association closed admission of new members to the fund from 31 March 2010. 
At 31 March 2017, there were 116 (2016: 142) employees who were active members of the fund.
The employer’s contributions to the fund by the association for the year ended 31 March 2017 totalled £1,756k (2016: £1,797k), which 
included both a lump sum contribution and an amount relating to current employees for which the employer’s contribution rate from 
1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017 was 19.6%. From 1 April 2017, the employer’s contribution rate will increase to 21.1% with an additional lump 
sum cash contribution of £1,127k to be made in the next year (estimated total contributions for 2017/18: £2,049k). 
Notes to the financial statements continued

Triennial actuarial valuations of the fund are performed by an independent, professionally qualified actuary using the projected unit 
method. The most recent formal actuarial valuation was completed as at 31 March 2016 and the next will be completed during 2019. 
The market value of the fund assets at 31 March 2016 was £1,733m and the level of funding was 71%. The main actuarial assumptions 
used in the valuation were:
2016
Valuation
% per annum
2013
Valuation
% per annum
Salary increases 3.20% 3.30%
Future pension increases 2.10% 2.50%
Financial assumptions
The main financial assumptions used by the actuary in assessing liabilities on a basis consistent with FRS 102 were:
2017
% per annum
2016
% per annum
Pension increase rate 2.40% 2.20%
Salary increase rate 2.70% 3.20%
Discount rate 2.60% 3.20%
In 2016, the scheme actuaries had calculated that a discount rate of 3.5% could be applied, but the association decided to take a more 
cautious approach and applied a rate of 3.2%. In 2017, the association considered that the reduced discount rate assumption of 2.6% 
used by the actuaries was sufficiently prudent and followed the actuaries’ recommendation.
Mortality assumptions
The post retirement mortality assumptions used to value the benefit and obligation at March 2016 are based on the fund’s ‘VitaCurves’. 
Mortality improvements from the 2013 valuation are in line with the 2013 version of the Continuous Mortality Investigation longevity 
improvements model which assumes a 1.25% p.a. improvement in mortality rates.
Based on these assumptions, the average future life expectancies at age 65 are:
Males

Financial statements Additional information Governance Strategic report 29. Joint arrangements
The association holds 50% of the shares in each of two joint arrangement companies, The Oxfordshire Care Partnership (OCP) and 
The Gloucestershire Care Partnership (GCP). The joint ventures are managed through a board of trustees on which the association 
and its partner, The Orders of St John Care Trust (OSJCT), are equally represented.
OCP’s and GCP’s principal activities are the provision of care to elderly people through care homes. OCP and GCP provide housing, 
accommodation, nursing or other assistance to people who are elderly or disabled and the provision of associated facilities and 
amenities for such people. The joint arrangements have been structured such that the association owns the care homes and receives 
rents on these, and that OSJCT is the care home operator and takes the financial and other risks associated with the operation. If the 
profits OSJCT attains from the operations exceed an agreed level, the excess will be retained by OCP and GCP. If the operations are loss 
making, the loss is sustained by OSJCT and therefore, other than a small contribution to certain fixed costs, OCP and GCP would not 
suffer any loss.
Any surplus from the joint arrangement companies shall be applied solely towards the promotion of charitable objects as determined 
by the trustees. No profits by way of dividends will be distributed to the members of the companies.
bpha group holds a major repairs fund on behalf of OCP to cover the costs of such repairs as per the agreement with OCP as shown  
in note 16.
Under FRS 102 section 15 ‘Investment in Joint Ventures’, the association is required to prepare additional information including, on an 
equity accounting basis, its share of the results of the joint arrangement companies for the period to 31 March 2017 and the net assets 
as at 31 March 2017. However, since the association has no rights to the net profits or assets of the companies and has no rights to 
dividends, other returns or to assets in the event of being wound up, the association considers that it has no equity interest in the 
ventures and, accordingly, consolidates a nil interest.
30. Investment in associates
bpha Limited (via Bushmead Homes Limited) has a 25% interest in Gog Magog Partnership LLP, whose principal activity is the development 
of residential accommodation for private sale and of affordable residential accommodation for sale to registered providers.

using the equity method. Within the subsidiary undertaking individual financial statements in which the investment is held, this is held as 
a fixed or current asset investment shown at cost less amounts written off.
bpha Limited is required to prepare additional information including its share of the associate’s turnover for the period to 31 March 2017
