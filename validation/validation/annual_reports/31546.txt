Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Rapid growth in the online retail market has 
been a key contributor to growth in the UK 
logistics market over the last five years
5
.
The UK total E-commerce market (which 
includes food and travel) has grown from 
£0.8bn in 2000 to £114bn in 2015 and 
£133bn in 2016 (16% annual growth)
6
.
This increase brings logistical challenges 
for our customers. In particular, for retailers 
the continuing trend of omni-channel 
retailing requires specialist logistics 
knowledge and skills. 
More and more of our customers require an 
end-to-end solution and this is driving the 
need for additional optimally located 
warehousing space, increased use of IT 
systems and more complex warehouse 
operations, including returns management, 
product repair and online market place sales.
This offers significant opportunities for our 
newly acquired business, iForce, which has 
the required technology, processes and 
skills to deliver a seamless retail customer 
experience on behalf of existing and new 
customers.
Manufacturing,  
Industrial and Bulk (MIB)
Our markets
We offer focused, efficient and 
cost effective end-to-end supply chain 
solutions to businesses across  
a range of sectors
The overall UK logistics market was valued at 
approximately £70.3bn in 2015
1
.
Historically, the overall market has grown in line 
with underlying growth in economic activity.
During the period 2011 to 2015 the market  
grew at an aggregate CAGR of 2.4% per 
annum
2
. The market is large and also highly 
fragmented with upwards of 50,000
3
 
participants, with Eddie Stobart accounting  
for less than 1% market share
4
. 
Within this overall growth rate, we are seeing 
the E-commerce sector growing at a much 
faster rate than other sectors, in response to 
structural changes in consumer spending 
patterns. In other sectors where growth more 
closely reflects the market rate, we are seeing 
opportunities from customers who are 
increasingly outsourcing their in-house 
operations.
Eddie Stobart remains well positioned for 
growth due to the scale of our network and our 
pay-as-you go model, complemented by our 
sector expertise and consulting-led approach, 
and our extensive warehouse capacity of 
c.6.4m sq.feet (excluding sites we operate for 
customers). 
We operate across four key sectors of the 
market, chosen specifically because of the 
complementary nature of their demand patterns 
across the sectors, driving effective  
utilisation and profitability  
in both our warehouse  
and transport  
operations*.
We provide services to MIB customers, 
which include the movement of raw 
materials and components used in 
manufacturing processes, aggregates and 
cement to construction sites, as well as the 
specialist delivery of fuel. 
This market is highly fragmented and 
relatively under-invested in terms of its 
supply chain, especially when compared to 
more advanced sectors such as Retail and 
Consumer.
This presents Eddie Stobart with an 
opportunity for growth at a rate faster than 
the underlying sector, through industry 
consolidation and the introduction of a 
multi-user offer.
This is evidenced by the fact that while the 
MIB sector is only expected to grow at 1% 
per annum
7
, Eddie Stobart's revenue grew 
by 37% in the year.

Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consumer Europe Retail
Store-based retailing in the UK was 
estimated to be worth £361bn 2016 and is 
expected to grow at a rate of 0.4% per 
annum to 2021
8
.
The key trend in this sector is a decline in 
recent years of in store sales, due to 
increased competition from discounters,  
as well as the move from bricks and mortar 
sales to online retailing
8
.
This in turn, has led to increased price 
competition in the store-based retail market. 
As a result of the above, retailers are 
continually reviewing their supply chains to 
identify opportunities to reduce costs, whilst 
maintaining the effectiveness of their in-store 
and online offers.
The most recent trends show increasing 
numbers of retailers are now considering 
outsourcing more elements of their supply 
chain in order to leverage their own cost base.
This, we believe, will increasingly lead to the 
outsourcing of logistics operations to scalable 
logistics operators, such as Eddie Stobart. 
The UK’s fast moving consumer goods market 
(FMCG), is relatively mature with forecast growth 
at less than 1% per annum to 2020
9
.
This long-established sector includes the 
movement of manufactured products, 
comprising a broad range of both ambient and 
temperature-controlled goods, such as milk, 
soft drinks and personal care goods.
This sector is dominated by large international 
brands within large UK operations. Their 
logistics solutions are a mix of in-house and 
pre-existing outsourced solutions.
As with the Retail sector, a combination  
of low growth and price competition is 
expected to result in market participants 
focusing more on core competencies, as 
well as seeking to increase efficiencies, by 
outsourcing to specialist logistics providers.
Our European operations are headquartered 
in Genk, Belgium and comprise two 
divisions: car storage and distribution and 
general cargo. There are c.400 people 
working in our European businesses.
We also operate in joint venture arrangements 
at three sites relating to inspection and 
preparation of finished vehicles. Please see 
note 4 on page 92 of the accounts for  
further information on the structure of  
these operations.
Car storage and distribution
At our site in Genk, we can store up to 5,000 
vehicles and provide pre-delivery inspection 
services for new cars and repair and renewal 
services for used vehicles. The site is 
operating at full capacity for our blue-chip 
customer base that includes the major 
European and Japanese manufacturers.
We operate c.104 specialist car carriers, half  
of which are based in Prague in the Czech 
Republic, delivering and collecting vehicles  
to and from dealerships in Belgium, the 
Netherlands, Luxembourg and the United 
Kingdom. Annual throughput currently exceeds 
300,000 vehicles. We are seeing significant 
growth with customers in the used and ex-hire/
lease car sectors, where additional value-
added services generate further revenue. 
General cargo
We provide long-distance Full Truck Load 
(FTL) transport for a number of major 
international customers across Europe, 
including the United Kingdom, Benelux, 
Germany, Czech Republic, Italy, Spain and 
Switzerland. Our fleet of c.139 vehicles is 
based in three locations: Prague, Sevlievo  
in Bulgaria and Bucharest in Romania. 
Support is also provided to our UK Special 
Operations team in relation to the Federation 
Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), Formula 
One World Championship™ 2018.
Growth strategy
Our strategy for growth in Europe is to 
leverage our existing UK customer 
relationships and seek accretive 
acquisitions that will give a step-change  
in scale and a broader platform.

05
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Our operating model 
Eddie Stobart operates across the whole supply 
chain, delivering innovative logistics solutions. 
We operate within four key sectors of the market 
and offer a range of services across the  
supply chain.
We offer dedicated and multi-user warehousing 
facilities and following the acquisition of iForce 
we have broadened our capabilities in providing 
e-commerce fulfilment services and returns 
management.
Eddie Stobart operates a pay-as-you-go, 
shared-user network operating in 
complementary sectors.
We maximise fleet utilisation by carrying loads 
for multiple customers in one vehicle and 
manage movements using state-of-the-art 
technology to minimise empty miles. This allows 
for greater flexibility and profitability, which can 
be passed on to customers in the form of  
lower charges.
The scale of our network, which is unique 
among UK logistics providers, is key to the 
success of this model.
We have a market-leading vehicle utilisation rate 
when compared to the industry average. 
Peaks and troughs in customer demand are 
driven by seasonal trends, with the period 
between Black Friday and Christmas being the 
busiest of the year for our customers within 
E-commerce, Retail and Consumer sectors.
During the peak periods our activities are 
supported by under-utilised assets in the trough 
period in the MIB sector, allowing us to provide 
continued high levels of services, coupled with 
high levels of efficiency and utilisation.
Our transport model is typically pay-as-you-go, 
with jobs priced on agreed times for loading, 
travelling, unloading and travel to the next pick 
up point, with fuel costs being a simple flow 
through as prices increase and decrease.
This gives the customer greater transparency 
on the time and miles components that make 
up the commercial rate they pay. 
The customer takes the risk on loading and 
unloading times, with any benefits from 
improvements made retained by the customer 
through lower prices and fuel costs. Improvements 
in agreed running times are typically shared 
between Eddie Stobart and the customer . 
Our competitors typically operate on cost plus 
contracts that dedicate individual vehicles to 
specific customers (often in customer livery) 
with charges passed to the customer on a 
Our consulting-led
approach
Our pay-as-you-go 
model
Identifying customer needs 
and responding with bespoke 
solutions
Our operating model 
Our customers pay for what  
they use
fixed-price or rate-based pricing structure. 
Under this model, vehicles typically return 
empty to depots and wait for their next load.
A consulting-led approach is fundamental to 
our growth strategy of accessing new business 
opportunities across the supply chains of new 
and prospective customers. This includes 
design and delivery of solutions.
The Directors continue to believe that the Eddie 
Stobart model is unique and supports the trend 
for customers to outsource their logistics 
operations. Our model is difficult to replicate as 
it requires a large-scale network, innovative 
technology and the ability to operate on a 
shared-user basis.
Our strong leadership team, including our leaders 
within iForce, Speedy Freight and Logistic People, 
has a breadth of sector expertise. This team is 
key to the successful development and operation 
of our business model.
A key element of our business model and 
growth strategy is to ensure that we have high 
quality operational sites capable of meeting our 
customers’ requirements for storage and 
distribution of their goods. 
Given the relative scarcity of high quality sites in 
key strategic locations and the long lead-times 
for new developments, we have a special 
projects team with the skills and knowledge to 
work with landlords and developers to source 
and secure capacity to meet current and 
anticipated future demand. 
This capacity is delivered through a range of 
transactions, new leases, pre-lets with 
developers and re-gearing existing sites. We 
obtain value for shareholders by capitalising on 
our covenant strength, which allows us to enter 
into arrangements for profit sharing and capital 
investments by landlords. 
The Group’s leasehold properties are held on 
institutional lease terms at or below market 
rents. Since the start of the 2017 financial year 
the Group has secured an additional 1,100,000 
sq.ft. of high quality operational capacity across 
five sites to meet increasing customer demand. 
Even with these sites coming online the Group 
is currently operating at close to full capacity. 
The Group has also entered into an agreement 
to take a further 840,000 sq.ft. of new property 
in Corby (August 2019) and an option to 
develop a site in Warrington which would allow 
a further 620,000 sq.ft. of warehouse space to 
be available in 2020.
The special projects team is also planning 
further upgrades to the Group’s truckstop 
operations, including potential new sites in the 
South and Midlands, and continues to generate 
value for the Group by offering its warehousing 
and logistics expertise to third parties.
Our operating model provides
the platform to offer a full range
of bespoke solutions for customers

Organic growth and increasing  
market share 
We have achieved double digit growth in 
underlying revenue most notably in the 
E-commerce and MIB sectors. Our acquisition 
of iForce, an E-commerce fulfilment specialist, 
brought new customers to the Eddie Stobart 
group and broadened our service offering, 
enabling us to win further new contracts in  
this sector. We invested in MIB specialist 
equipment and skilled employees to deliver  
a number of new contract wins.
Targeted acquisitions
As well as broadening our E-commerce 
fulfilment capabilities, we now offer a complete 
returns management service as a result of the 
acquisition of iForce. We also acquired control 
of Speedy Freight, a same day business-to-
business freight service provider. These 
acquisitions have broadened our service 
offering capabilities enabling us to provide new 
services to existing customers as well as win 
new ones. We have utilised cross-selling 
opportunities between these businesses and 
our core business. We acquired the remaining 
50% of Logistic People, a recruitment services 
provider, to further enhance our ability to  
recruit drivers. 
Investment in technology and 
systems 
We have continued to invest in upgrading and 
simplifying our end-to-end technology platform.
By streamlining our back-office processes, 
including our fleet and asset management 
system, which monitors servicing and 
maintenance of vehicles and equipment,  
we are improving our overall efficiency.

Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Chairman’s statement
Philip H Swatman
Chairman
“Eddie Stobart is much more 
than a haulage business”
Overview
Having joined the Board as Chairman of  
Eddie Stobart Logistics in April 2017, I’d like  
to take this opportunity to welcome all our new 
shareholders to the business. Notwithstanding 
the changes in ownership in recent years,  
the business has continued to maintain its 
traditional high standards of customer service 
and integrity, as well as develop new service 
offerings and expand in new sectors. 
People and Board
In addition to my appointment, Christopher 
Casey and Stephen Harley joined as  
Non-executive Directors, bringing strong 
financial and operational expertise to the 
Board.
Our Board is compact and the Directors have 
an extensive range of skills. We are able to 
remain tightly focused on the continued 
development of our business, under the 
outstanding leadership of our Chief Executive 
Officer, Alex Laffey. We can also leverage 
opportunities as and when they come, 
responding quickly and efficiently.
I have been particularly impressed by the 
enthusiasm and dedication of all our staff,  
who have been instrumental to ensuring we 
deliver our service promise to customers. 
It is really important to me that all our people 
receive the right training to do their jobs 
effectively. We will continue to invest by offering 
training courses across a range of disciplines, 
allowing employees at all levels to expand their 
knowledge and skills. 
Financial performance
Eddie Stobart performed strongly in 2017, 
achieving significant growth and securing  
a number of new contract wins. We have 
leveraged our warehousing and transportation 
model and completed a number of successful 
acquisitions, all of which adds to our skills and 
capabilities and positions us well across high 
growth markets. 
The core business of transport and logistics 
remains competitive. We pride ourselves on 
differentiating our quality of service levels, 
which is critical to our customers' operations, 
and providing tailored offerings which 
contribute to their efficiency. Our profitability is 
enhanced by industry leading levels of 
utilisation and skilful procurement and 
management of the assets used in our 
business.
Our overall performance in the year gives us 
confidence that we will continue to make 
progress against our growth strategy in the 
year ahead. Continued strong cash generation 
enabled the Group to pay an interim dividend of 
£5.0m (1.4 pence per share) during the year. 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 
£15.8m (4.4 pence per share), making a total of 
£20.8m, (5.8 pence per share) for the 2016/17 
financial year. 
Outlook
The new financial year has started well  
and in line with the Board’s expectations.  
I am encouraged by our continued strong 
operational and customer performance.  
Based on the performance of the businesses 
we have acquired in 2017 and major contract  
wins, supported by a strong new business 
pipeline, the Board is confident of further 
growth in the year ahead.
In terms of the wider business environment,  
we continue to see encouraging trends in all 
sectors with new and existing customers 
considering outsourcing, so that they can 
concentrate on their core operations and 
customer offerings. We have also seen further 
consolidation in the logistics sector in 2017 and 
early signs indicate that the trend will continue, 
providing further opportunities for growth. 
Whilst our existing business in continental 
Europe is small, we have ambitions to develop 
this, replicating our successful model in the 
UK. We will be keeping the Brexit position 
under review but, to date, we have seen no 
significant impact from Brexit on our business. 
Finally, I would like to thank all employees, 
customers and wider stakeholders for their 
continued support, hard work and valuable 
contribution.

a leading provider of end-to-end supply

Group results
Our Group revenues have increased by 9.4%  
to £623.9 million for the year to 30 November 
2017 (2016: £570.2 million). Underlying EBIT* 
has increased by 17.4% to £48.5 million  
(2016: £41.3 million) whilst operating profit 
decreased by 1% to £26.6m (2016: £26.8m).
I am extremely pleased with the significant 
progress we’ve made in our first year as an 
AIM listed company in terms of delivering our 
commitments and strategy in our targeted 
sectors of Retail, Consumer, Manufacturing, 
Industrial and Bulk and E-commerce.
Effective implementation of our business 
strategy has been key to our success and I am 
proud of what we’ve delivered through the 
platform of our unique network and consulting-
led approach. 
Eddie Stobart focuses on providing cost-
effective innovative logistics solutions to our 
customers across the supply chain. In my 30 
years within the retail industry, I have become 
acutely aware of the importance of building 
and developing close working relationships 
with customers.
We invest in our customer relationships to 
ensure we deliver high levels of customer 
service and provide innovative solutions in  
a rapidly developing market. 
During the year, we have continued to grow 
through new customer wins and renewal of 
contracts with long-term existing customers  
in the four key sectors in which we operate. 
In April we acquired iForce, an e-fulfilment 
specialist, providing a comprehensive 
e-commerce offer to a wide range of retailers.
 
We also acquired control of Speedy Freight a 
same day business-to-business freight service, 
through the purchase of 50% of its shares. 
Both of these acquisitions have broadened our 
service offering and capabilities, enabling us to 
provide new services to existing customers, as 
well as win new customers. As a result of these 
acquisitions we have also benefitted from a 
number of cross-selling opportunities.
To support our development within our key 
strategic growth sectors, we have recruited 
new people into the business to help deliver 
excellent service levels to our customers. 
We are also investing in industry-leading 
technology and equipment needed to continue 
to provide advanced supply chain operations 
to our blue-chip customers in the rapidly 
developing logistics market. 
Operational performance 
In order to deliver growth, our operations  
team has had to flex and continually review  
the network, ensuring we are able to deliver  
the high levels of service that our  
customers demand. 
In addition, all of our people have needed to 
develop new skills and embrace changes in 
the way we operate, as we simplify ways of 
working and at the same time, take on new and 
exciting contracts which demand more 
complex solutions. 
The acquisition of iForce brought new 
customers in the E-commerce sector, 
contributing to our significant increase in 
revenue of 111% to £103.4 million in the year 
(2016: £49.1 million). 
We have seen good growth in our more 
established Retail operations, where we are 
now working with the majority of the UK’s top 
five retailers.
Our MIB sector is now our largest segment  
and has also seen significant growth during  
the year of 37% to £182.0 million (2016: 
£132.7million). This has been delivered through 
a combination of the full year effect of 2016 
contract wins, as well as organic growth with 
existing new contract wins through the period. 
Within Consumer, revenues in the year were 
down by 12% to £144.6 million (2016: £164.6 
million). This was due to the loss of one 
significant contract, which I am now pleased  
to say has been successfully re-secured. 
The business has achieved a number of high 
profile contract wins during the year and we are 
proud of the new customer relationships we 
have recently started.
Adding to these wins, we are delighted to have 
renewed a number of contracts within our 
existing portfolio of blue-chip customers, worth 
an estimated £41 million and secured a further 
£89 million of new volume with new and 
existing customers.
Furthermore, we have integrated our under-
performing ports business into the wider 
transport network in order to improve utilisation 
and profitability.
Software and technology
We recognise the critical role that systems and 
technology play in the modern supply chain.  
In 2017 we made further investments in our 
technology capability across our business, 
both operational and back-office.

We continue to invest in the best available tools 
and systems to simplify ways of working, 
improve efficiency and ensure our people are 
well equipped to deliver service excellence. 
This has included the successful replacement 
of the in-vehicle systems and telemetry 
throughout the entire Eddie Stobart vehicle 
fleet, delivering industry-leading, custom-
designed equipment and software.
 
Our acquisition of iForce now allows us to 
include leading E-commerce software as part 
of our service offering. The iForce system offers 
customers a full end-to-end supply chain 
solution which is modular in design allowing 
customers to use all or part of the solutions  
on offer.
As we move forward, our ongoing system 
development programme is designed to 
streamline and simplify our operations, keeping 
us at the forefront of the industry in delivering 
service excellence and advanced end-to-end 
supply chain solutions. 
Brand update
Since listing in April 2017, our brand licencing 
arrangement with Stobart Group has not 
changed, with the present financial 
arrangements ending in February 2020.
We have options beyond 2020 to continue our 
licencing arrangements;
• Pay £3 million a year for continued use  
of the licence
• Purchase a perpetual licence for £15 million 
for use in the logistics market
• Purchase a perpetual licence for £50 million 
for unrestricted use
The team at Eddie Stobart is passionate about 
our name and the leading brand. However, we 
also recognise that following the introduction of 
our new strategy and the recent acquisitions,  
we need to review our position given the 
broader range of supply chain services we  
now offer.
The Board is committed to reviewing all options 
and we will ensure we consider the views and 
interests of our people, customers and 
shareholders before deciding on the best  
way forward.
People
The commitment of the leadership team and the 
engagement and support from all employees 
has been key to our success in delivering our 
plans. I would like to thank the whole team for 
their enthusiasm and dedication, without which 
our listing on AIM and these results would not 
have been possible. 
The market today is very different to a few 
years ago due to the shift in retail shopping 
habits and the advent of online shopping. This 
has resulted in our customers looking for more 
than the traditional support from their logistics 
providers. 
Our staff are now required not only to 
understand their own roles within the 
organisation but also what is important to 
specific customers. 
As a result, our people plan is focused on 
upskilling and developing our existing people, 
as well as attracting the best people across the 
industry to support our exciting growth agenda. 
Our Training Academy has been recognised as 
a leading facility by customers, suppliers and 
industry advocates. Opening up our services 
supports our wider strategy to supply skilled 
drivers and warehouse operatives to 
businesses through their supply chain  
resource services.
In 2017, we expanded the commercial offering 
of our training to the wider market, opening up 
a second Training Academy just outside Rugby 
in the Midlands, complementing our existing 
facility in Warrington.
We are pleased with our progress this year and 
as a result, we are well placed to continue with 
our growth strategy in the year ahead.

Although statutory IFRS results should be used in assessing the performance of the Group, the Directors believe that a more relevant presentation of 
the financial results for the period is arrived at by excluding the impact of the exited Ireland Retail segment from the 2016 comparator and by adding 
back the share of profit from equity accounted investees, employee share scheme costs funded by the previous parent holding group, investees and 
management charges, amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items and including the gain arising on lease agreements. In doing so 
we arrive at a more representative view of the underlying trading performance of the business during the year. A full reconciliation of these measures 
to their statutory equivalent is set out in note 4 of the accounts and definitions for these measures can be found below:
1 Underlying revenue is defined as revenue less revenue from the exited Ireland Retail segment.
2 Underlying EBIT is defined as profit from operating activities before exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, Group’s share of profit from equity accounted investees, employee 
share costs funded by previous parent holding group, investor and management charges and including the gain arising on any lease agreements.
3 Underlying EBITDA is defined as Underlying EBIT before depreciation of property, plant and equipment.
4 Adjusted profit before tax is defined as profit or loss before tax adding back exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles and including the gain arising on lease agreements.
5 Adjusted free cash flow is defined as cash generated from operating activities less purchase of property, plant and equipment adding back proceeds from the sale of property, plant and 
equipment and adding back income taxes paid and the cash impact of exceptional items.
6 Adjusted earnings per share is defined as profit after tax adding back exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles and including the gain arising on lease agreements divided by 
the weighted average basic and diluted number of shares in issue at 30 November 2017 (see note 12).
• Strong underlying sales growth
• E-commerce sales increased 111% and 
MIB sales were up 37%. This provides a 
healthy balance to our portfolio
• Our growth in profitability is demonstrated 
by underlying EBIT* growth of 17% while 
underlying EBIT margin* improved from 
7.5% to 7.8% 
• We are pleased by the progress made by 
the companies we have acquired. They are 
performing in-line with expectations
• Operating profit fell by 1%, principally due 
to non-recurring IPO costs
• Significantly improved financial position with 
net debt reducing from £165.5m to £109.5m
• Final dividend proposed of 4.4 pence per 
share making a total of 5.8 pence per share 
for the full year in line with our progressive 
dividend policy

The Group’s revenue of £623.9m for the year ended 30 November 2017 
was 9.4% higher than in the previous year (2016: £570.2m) on a reported 
basis. Excluding the exited Ireland Retail segment underlying revenue* 
for the 12 months to 30 November 2017 was a 13.6% increase over the 
comparable period in 2016, with 8% being driven by revenue generated 
from new acquisitions (see note 6).
Within the 2017 financial year there has been a substantial growth in 
three of our four market sectors.
Our E–commerce revenues grew by 111% from £49.1m to £103.4m helped 
by strong organic growth and the acquisition of iForce in April 2017.
The Manufacturing Industrial and Bulk (MIB) segment is now our largest 
segment at £182.0m and grew £49.3m (37%). This growth was delivered 
by a combination of the full year effect of 2016 contract wins, organic 
growth with existing customers and new contract wins in the year.
Growth in these two sectors provided further balance and diversification 
to our business. Due to the complementary nature of the demand 
patterns versus Retail and Consumer this further contributed to our 
sector leading levels of utilisation.
Our Retail sector grew from £152.2m to £168.6m (11% growth), the 
majority of which represents a strong performance in a mature market. 
This sector has benefited both from the full year effect of 2016 and 2017 
contract wins. We now work with most of the major UK retailers.
Revenue in our Consumer sector reduced by £20.0m to £144.6m (-12%).  
This was due to the loss of one significant contract, which I am now 
pleased to say has been successfully re-secured.
We will continue to review our contract base to ensure acceptable levels 
of profit are achieved commensurate with the exceptional levels of 
service provided.
Within the year we renewed £41m of existing contracts and secured an 
additional £89 million of new volume with existing and new customers.
Profit and margins
Underlying EBIT* for the 12 months to 30 November 2017 was £48.5m 
and in line with market expectations. Despite the challenges facing our 
customers in the traditional Retail and Consumer sectors, underlying 
EBIT margin* increased from 7.5% to 7.8%. 
This outcome was the result of a number of factors:
• Strong performance in the high growth sectors of MIB and  
E-Commerce
• Good contributions from our acquisitions
• Continuing programme of optimising our warehouse portfolio and 
generation of value from our warehousing expertise
• Absorbed plc costs and the integration of our unprofitable ports 
business into the network
• The benefit of further network efficiencies 
• The delayed contract start-up costs caused by several new contracts 
going live in the first quarter of 2018 rather than in 2017

Financial statements Governance Strategic report Chief Financial Officer's statement continued
Cash flow and funding continued
Adjusted free cash flow* was £30.0m (2016: £28.8m) in 2017. The main 
drivers were the improved underlying trading performance (underlying 
EBITDA* of £55.3m versus £47.4m in 2016), offset by the one-off 
working capital impact of acquiring iForce and Speedy Freight balance 
sheets at acquisition and working capital investment in the remainder of 
the Group as the business continues to grow. 
The Group increased levels of net capital expenditure as the business 
continues to invest in systems and technology, specialist assets to support 
growth in our growing MIB sector and also in warehousing infrastructure.
Net interest payments reduced from £10.3m in the prior year to £7.7m in 
the current year reflecting the reduction in both the quantum of bank 
debt and the margin charged, for which we will receive further full year 
cash benefit during 2018.
The cash tax charge was a net payment of £2.7m in the year as 
compared to a £1.7m payment in the prior year. 
Within the year, the cash cost of acquisitions was £48.3m. The 
acquisitions related to iForce, Speedy Freight and the remaining 
non-controlling interest in Logistic People, more information on which 
can be found in note 6 of the accounts.

On 13 April 2017 the Group entered into a senior facility agreement for 
£100.0m with a syndicate of lenders comprising the Bank of Ireland, 
BNP Paribas, Allied Irish Bank and KBC Group. The facility is subject to a 
variable rate of interest and is repayable in full in April 2022. On 25 April 
2017, we drew down the full finance facility of £100.0m and repaid the 
previous finance facility of £139.0m (using proceeds of the IPO). The 
residual capitalised bank fees associated with the previous facility of 
£6.6m were taken directly to the income statement and have been 
classified as an exceptional item in note 5 of the accounts.
In July 2017 we entered into a four year interest rate hedging arrangement 
with a 12 month deferred start date covering £60m of the term facility providing 
a substantial hedge against the current upward trend in interest rates.
During the year we also entered into a new revolving finance facility with 
KBC Group which provides access to £75.0m (2016: £50.0m) though 
normally restricted to £65.0m (2016: £40.0m). The facility is subject to a 
variable rate of interest and is in place until 2021.

Proceeds raised from the IPO were used to refinance existing debt, with 
net debt falling from £165.5m to £109.5m. As a consequence, both the 
quantum and the cost of debt financing has decreased and this will flow 
through in lower interest costs going forward.
Finance costs before exceptional finance items for the year were £9.7m, a 
substantial reduction of £6.3m on the prior year (2016: £16.0m). At current 
run rate, the decreased quantum of borrowing and improved interest rates 
would have an annualised effect of a further reduction of £3.0m of finance 
costs if levels of borrowing remained constant. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional items for the year were £16.8m, reduced by a £4.6m credit, 
explained below. Of this £13.4m related to the IPO, associated bank 
refinancing and exceptional costs relating to the acquisitions made 
during the year.
The remaining exceptional costs of £3.4m related to restructuring the 
business, in particular the costs of exiting the Ireland Retail segment. 
The benefits of these charges will flow through in lower costs and 
increased EBIT in future years.
In 2017 a £4.6m credit was recognised in exceptional items relating to a 
leasehold property at Goresbrook Park. Due to increased business demand 
the Company undertook a major redevelopment of our strategically important 
site at Goresbrook Park, Dagenham, funded by our landlord, which increased 
the revenue earning capacity by over 100%, added significant additional 
state-of-the-art warehousing capacity, improved transport operations facilities 
and enhanced rail connectivity. In conjunction with this redevelopment we 
surrendered our existing lease and signed a new 26 year institutional lease 
at market rent appropriate to the new facility. As a consequence certain 
credits relating to the original lease were released to the profit and loss 
account, namely the unamortised portion of the original two year rent free 
period and the provision for the contractual uplifts of rent over the original  
17 year lease term. The aggregate amount of these credits was £4.6m.
Given the relative magnitude of the amount released, the Company is 
disclosing this as an exceptional credit in the year. However, as releases of 
this nature flow naturally from our continuing strategic development of our 
warehousing portfolio, and may well occur in the future, the Directors consider 
that this forms part of the underlying trading performance of the business.

Acquisitions
On 28 April 2017 the Group completed the acquisition of iForce Group 
for a consideration of £45.0m (£8.0m shares and £37.0m in cash).
For the period 28 April 2017 to 30 November 2017, iForce Group generated 
sales of £39.6m and operating profit before exceptional items of £2.8m.
On 4 July 2017 the Group acquired 50% of the share capital and 
deemed control of Puro Ventures (trading as Speedy Freight) for an 
initial payment of £4.1m. For the period from acquisition to the year-end 
Speedy Freight contributed £9.5m in sales and operating profit before 
exceptional items of £1.0m.
On 7 August 2017 the Group entered into a business purchase 
agreement to acquire trucks, trailers and a contract from Canute 
Haulage for a consideration of £1.
On 30 August 2017 the Group acquired the remaining 50% of Logistic 
People which was already fully consolidated for a consideration, of up to 
£7m, £5m of which was paid on completion.
In both the Speedy Freight and Logistic People acquisitions, an element 
of consideration has been deferred in order to incentivise management 
to maximise shareholder value over the course of the next three years. 
All acquisitions are trading in line with expectations.

passionate workforce who make 
Eddie Stobart a great place to work"
We focus on the performance of our people to 
help achieve our growth targets. We support 
them by providing training, offering structured 
career development plans and recruiting highly 
skilled individuals who complement and enhance 
our business.
 
We directly employee c.5,700 colleagues who are 
essential to the success of our business. In

additional support through our peak periods.
Our training ranges from one day to 11 weeks 
with no more than nine trainees per group. 
Eddie Stobart has 17 driver trainers including 
one driver training manager and three head 
office staff trainers, all with different skills. We 
also have a DVSA delegated examiner to run 
the examinations, as well as three SQA Grade 
One accredited ADR instructors (transportation 
of dangerous goods).
We also offer various development 
opportunities for our warehouse colleagues 
including MHE (professional fork lift truck) and 
a Warehouse to Wheels programme for those 
wishing to progress into driver roles. 
We continue to work with our health and safety 
team to develop and maintain standards 
across our sectors through the delivery of 
various courses and qualifications, such as 
manual handing and IOSH managing safety.
Leadership and management
In order to develop effective leaders at all levels 
in our business and promote high performing 
teams, we deliver a number of internal 
leadership and management initiatives. 
Our in-house ‘Role of the Leader’ programme 
provides strategic leadership capabilities whilst 
our catalogue of management development 
training allows us to improve management 
skills and enhance our succession planning 
pipeline. 
These programmes will be further improved  
by the launch of our Learning Management 
System in 2018, that will enhance the delivery 
to employees of development opportunities 
through e-learning.
We regularly review our talent pipeline through 
our succession planning and appraisal 
processes, defining structured career plans  
for all functions that have allowed a number of 
employees to progress to senior roles within 
the business. We also continue to support 
relevant professional qualifications across  
all functions.
Our people development plans drive 
transformational change and foster 
agility to support our ambitious 
growth strategy 
Our approach
As the business strategy has developed into 
wider sectors, we have reviewed our people plan 
to ensure we have the right skills and capabilities 
needed to deliver excellent service to our 
customers. With the broad range of services  
we offer, and roles we have to support our 
customers, it is important that we attract, and 
maintain good relations with talented colleagues. 
Externally, our strategy is to recruit individuals  
with skillsets that can add value to our business 
whilst internally, investing in the training and 
development of our colleagues is essential to the 
efficiency and sustainability of our business.
Training and development 
We place strong emphasis on providing our 
people with the right training and development 
opportunities to do their jobs effectively. This 
helps to improve our internal skills-base as well 
as create a more engaged workforce. We offer 
a range of training courses and qualifications; 
from developing employees to use the 
innovative IT systems that have been 
implemented across the business, to the  
driver specific courses offered. 
We currently offer in excess of 40 driver specific 
courses and qualifications from the standard 
Driver Certificate of Professional Competence 
(DCPC) to more specialised ADR and ALLMI 
qualifications to customer specific training 
requirements.

Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Recruitment
We recruit individuals with the talents and the 
results-driven attitude we need to meet the  
high standards of performance which our 
customers expect. 
Our robust recruitment process allows us to 
select the best candidates for the right job.
We use a variety of aptitude tests and 
personality assessments to support our 
recruitment process and immediately identify 
any skills gaps that can be addressed.
We recruit and train all our potential and 
existing employees in accordance with our  
five core values; we encourage openness and 
honesty, act with compassion, integrity and

with their teams, incorporating video messages 
from both our Chief Executive and Chief 
Operating Officer.
 
We have a well-established monthly driver and 
warehouse representatives forum to 
communicate and engage with these 
representatives. The purpose of these sessions 
is to ensure representatives are focused and 
understand the roles they have in supporting 
our business strategy, along with sharing site 
and regional business news. 
In addition to this, we also hold a national 
annual meeting where all Eddie Stobart driver 
and warehouse representatives come together. 
Our executive team provides a business 
update and listen to their concerns as well as 
discussing pay arrangements. 
Training Academies and 
driving schools
Training is a top priority for Eddie Stobart and 
our academy has been recognised as a 
leading facility by customers, suppliers and 
industry advocates.
Over the past twelve months we have opened 
our facilities to the wider industry, providing 
training to drivers across the logistics sector.  
In January 2018, a second driving school facility 
was launched in the Midlands, complementing 
the existing school in Warrington.
Designed to raise the overall quality and 
quantity of both new and existing talent, we 
offer and run dedicated training courses across 
the following areas:

and transportation of dangerous goods
• Warehousing systems and operational 
training
Our apprenticeship programme 
In April 2016 we introduced apprenticeship 
programmes at our depots in Appleton,  
Crick and Dagenham where 56 employees 
have taken the opportunity to develop their 
knowledge across a range of key skills  
areas of:
• Team leading
• Business administration
• Sales

combining Safe and Fuel Efficient Driving 
(SAFED), Safe Urban Driving (SUD) and

talent into our business, we launched a new 
graduate programme in January. The scheme 
is designed to provide business knowledge 
and hands-on training graduates will need to 
become future leaders of our business.

opportunities to experience a wide range of 
different environments, as well as working

striving to improve diversity in all areas across all 
levels and types of roles across our business.

and support women to develop skills and 
experience they need to progress in our 
business.

2017, a non-profit organisation that provides 
resources for both women and men in the 
business of logistics, transportation, supply chain 
management and technology.

Digital investment is also evidenced across  
our dedicated and multi-user warehousing 
portfolio, where newly-introduced warehouse 
management systems optimise and directs the 
flow of product through receiving, put-away, 
picking, packaging, yard management and 
despatch. This drives high levels of control,

Simplified back-office
We have also streamlined back-office 
processes, including our fleet and asset 
management system through which vehicles 
and equipment are serviced and maintained  
to ensure optimal efficiency and utilisation.  
Also our ongoing HR system upgrades are 
supporting our people plan and simplifying and 
controlling processes such as recruitment,

us to commercialise our offering. 
Technology-enabled  
end-to-end supply chain
E-commerce software
The acquisition of iForce means Eddie Stobart is now able to offer customers a full E-commerce 
proposition through iForce’s sector leading modular software supporting a range of operations, 
including:
• Multi-channel fulfilment and warehousing 
• Returns processing and margin recovery 
• Dynamic carriage and delivery management 
• Online stock clearance solutions 
Many of these services can be delivered as an online SaaS-based service, offering customers 
speed of start-up, flexibility and removing the need for costly and complex infrastructure 
investments. 
The rich functionality embedded in these products has been developed over many years of close 
cooperation with a variety of leading on-line and multi-channel retailers. The software affords much 
greater flexibility and agility to respond to trends and changing customer needs than standard 
commercially available systems
John Court
Chief Information Officer 
“We're proud to deliver leading 
software and solutions. It’s at the heart 
of what we do, allowing our customers 
to meet their service commitments”
Technology continues to play a critical role in all 
of today’s advanced supply chain operations, 
unlocking efficiencies, driving service 
innovations and underpinning every leading 
end-to-end supply chain. It has also become  
an accepted part of modern-day living and the 
continued growth in e-commerce activity in 
particular has served to redefine customer  
service standards and set the bar operationally 
and digitally.
Our targeted technology investments have 
progressed to plan through the year, with the 
successful introduction of several solutions 
designed to enhance further operational 
efficiency, support business growth and 
simplify back-office processes.
Our In-Cab technology
State-of-the-art in-vehicle technology is now 
deployed across the entire Eddie Stobart fleet. 
Each vehicle is equipped with a custom-
designed in-vehicle device, the Eddie Stobart 
DriveTab, which supports and guides the driver 
in a range of activities, including vehicle safety 
checks, driving style feedback and working 
instructions. It also provides highly detailed 
GPS-based positional feedback to operational 
controllers and customers alike to deliver 
further insight into all planned and current 
activity across the operation.
The technology also offers the ability to control 
operations across all sectors, planning and 
repositioning vehicles in real-time to ensure 
service is delivered in the most efficient and 
optimal fashion.

How we do it – our software platform
Eddie Stobart delivers its solutions in two ways; tailored software from some of the world’s leading specialist platform providers underpins its 
exacting operational standards. These solutions are integrated with Eddie Stobart’s own proprietary, in-house developed and controlled  
software products. 
This software strategy allows Eddie Stobart the opportunity to leverage the expertise and intellectual property of leading technology partners whilst, 
through its own in-house development capability, it delivers software solutions quickly and flexibly to meet the specific needs of our customers.
Together this represents an unrivalled customer proposition with access to a range of market-leading third party solutions, spanning the whole supply 
chain, combined with access to in-house developed proprietary software products. 
Secure, stable and scalable environment
With such a high dependence on its systems and technology, Eddie Stobart utilises some of the most modern, third party data centre facilities, 
delivering high availability and operating to high security standards. 
We continue to invest in security infrastructure and toolsets and an on-going programme of cyber-vigilance is also in place, with staff awareness 
initiatives and constant monitoring for potential cyber-threats.

Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Corporate social responsibility
“We continue to develop our CSR practices to support our 
employees, our customers and the environment”
Ethical behaviours
We ensure our policies and processes provide clear guidance to all 
employees. We have a Code of Business Conduct which explains our 
ethical standards as an organisation and how we expect our employees 
and suppliers to act. We also have a whistleblowing policy, providing 
guidance to all employees so that they know that they can raise a 
concern about any possible wrongdoing on an anonymous basis. 
We are committed to preventing modern slavery and human trafficking 
from occurring within any part of our business and supply chain and 
continue to focus on improving the effectiveness of our systems and 
controls in this area. Our Modern Slavery Act statement is available on  
our website www.eddiestobart.com
Health, safety and wellbeing
Eddie Stobart has a strong culture of promoting health and safety 
standards throughout our business and we are continually seeking ways 
to improve. We monitor, and report internally to members of the 
Executive Management Committee and the Board, our accident 
frequency rates and types of injuries sustained using a dedicated Health 
and Safety IT management system. This helps us to benchmark the 
health and safety performance of specific sites and sector groups and 
take targeted actions to introduce safety improvement initiatives.
We invest in safety training for all employees, particularly for our drivers 
and warehouse operatives. We track individual performance by reviewing 
driving records and incident reports. All employees, including drivers and 
warehouse operatives, who join Eddie Stobart receive an induction course 
at our Training Academy which contains a strong emphasis on health and 
safety. All drivers and warehouse operatives who join Eddie Stobart on a 
temporary basis receive a safety briefing before starting work which 
emphasises the safety standards we expect them to adhere to. All drivers 
are required to undertake 35 hours of driving standards training in every 
five-year period to retain their Certificate of Professional Competence In 
2017 we updated our Eddie Stobart Driver Handbook, which contains 
guidance and advice on reducing the risks of work-related driving. We 
continually seek to raise the awareness of the importance of safe working 
practices including by promoting Road Safety Week by communications 
to all employees about the importance of safety on roads and driving 
within speed limits. 
There is a dedicated team within Eddie Stobart responsible for setting 
health and safety standards and monitoring performance against those 
standards within the Company. iForce and Speedy Freight also have 
dedicated health and safety teams who promote our health and safety 
culture and ensure appropriate training of employees for the roles  
they undertake.
We have comprehensive policies on safe working and accident 
management and on maintenance and servicing of our assets and 
equipment. In addition customers often require us to operate to specific 
safety-related standards. Our internal heath and safety teams undertake 
regular risk assessments and reviews to check that applicable policies 
and standards are being adhered to. Remediation plans are put in place 
in relation to any issues identified and implementation of agreed actions 
is monitored.
Protecting the health,safety and wellbeing of our employees, those who 
work with us and those who are affected by our business operations is  
a responsibility we take very seriously. We know that fitter, healthier 
employees are not only happier and more productive, but also suffer 
fewer work related incidents. Through our briefing pack for our managers 
and other initiatives, we are raising awareness of the importance of 
mental and physical wellbeing for all our employees. 
Environment
We recognise the importance of environmental protection and continue 
to work with partners such as the FTA Logistics Carbon Reduction 
Scheme, the Environmental Forum and Wholesale Power to implement 
initiatives to save fuel and energy where we can.
The engines on all our fleet are the cleanest available, meeting Euro 6 
emission standards. We will continue to investigate new technologies to 
further improve our environmental standards.
By investing in planning technology and improving fleet utilisation,  
we reduce empty vehicle miles, minimising the overall impact on the 
environment.
We measure and monitor our operational carbon footprint in order to 
assess our environmental impact and are pleased that our scope one* 
and scope two** emissions have reduced in 2017 (based on 
calculations in line with DEFRA guidelines). We will continue to work on 
ways to further reduce our carbon footprint.
* Scope one (direct) GHG emissions are derived from the consumption of gas, oil and vehicle fuel.
**  Scope two (electricity direct) GHG emissions are derived from the consumption of purchased electricity.

Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Risk management and principal risks Risk management and principal risks
Risk management framework
The Board is ultimately responsible for setting the Group’s risk appetite 
and for overseeing the effective management of risk. The Board has 
delegated oversight of risk management and internal controls to the 
Audit Committee. Day to day risk management is the responsibility of  
the senior management team. 
A robust and detailed assessment of the risks facing the Group has  
been undertaken by the senior management team, with support from  
an external advisor.
 
A Group level risk register is maintained recording  
the mitigating factors and actions in place for each risk.
 
The risk register 
is regularly reviewed by senior management and a report on that review 
is submitted to the Audit Committee.
 
The principal risks facing the Group have been identified by the Directors 
(with senior management input) and the mitigating actions agreed.
 
Economic environment risk
Changes in the economic environment, whether resulting from the UK’s decision 
to withdraw from the EU or otherwise, changing government policy and legislation 
or other external factors, may adversely affect our business and our customers’ 
businesses. For example: more complex rules for cross border transport and 
restrictions on the movement of workers from Europe may affect the Group’s 
operations and financial position and changes in planning legislation or 
property-related policies may adversely affect the property market and our  
ability to enter into commercially attractive property transactions and generate 
value from our property expertise.
The decision to withdraw from the EU resulted in uncertainty about the future 
economic environment for our business and our customer’s business. Although 
uncertainty continues, we have experienced no significant impact to date. We 
continue to consult widely, including with our customers, to understand better the 
potential impacts of the withdrawal from the EU on our business and ensure we 
are well-placed to respond to any such impacts.
The Group monitors developments and proposed changes in government 
policies, legislation, regulation and other factors that may impact our business 
and our customers’ businesses. Our strategy is kept under close review to ensure 
we respond to any such impact. 
We have also taken steps to ensure security of labour in our transport and 
warehousing operations by upstream vertical integration into labour recruitment 
services and by investing in our Driver Training School.operations and/or 
reputation. 
Operating environment risk
Customer demand for outsourced logistics and warehousing services may change, 
reflecting the changing behaviours of consumers. There may be changes in the 
availability of high quality warehouse capacity and other property opportunities to 
support business growth. New technologies may emerge that change the nature  
of the logistics industry. 
We continually review and monitor market developments including new technologies, 
property opportunities and emerging logistics business models, and review our 
strategy accordingly. The Group stays in close contact with its customers to ensure we 
understand and can respond to their changing needs. We continue to invest in 
developing our own state of the art technology in order to stay at the forefront of 
technological expertise in the logistics industry. 
People risk
Loss of one or more key members of the senior management team or failure to 
retain and attract experienced and skilled people at all levels across the business 
could also have an adverse impact.
The management team is appropriately rewarded for its efforts and succession 
plans are in place across key positions in each of the businesses.
We take pride in creating a positive workplace environment, through training, 
engagement, rewards and values. 
Principal risks Mitigation
26
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Customer risk
Loss of one or more of our key customers could have a material impact on Group 
revenues.
We believe that the best way to mitigate this risk is to continue to deliver excellent 
levels of service at competitive rates.
We monitor our key customer dependency regularly and seek to balance our 
exposure to each market sector we operate in by targeting new customer 
opportunities. We typically have longstanding customer relationships; a number 
of key relationships have lasted for longer than 15 years. 
A healthy pipeline of new opportunities is being evaluated. This risk is also 
mitigated by our strategy of building a balanced portfolio across the sectors  
we operate in.
Systems and technical risk
A failure of a key IT system, unauthorised access or a cyber security breach could 
have a significant impact on operational performance, company reputation and 
financial performance.
We partner with industry leading, formally audited and accredited data centre 
organisations. All core server infrastructure is replicated in a dual data centre 
configuration. Disaster recovery is formally tested annually.
We continue to invest in cyber-security measures, tools and infrastructure in  
line with industry best practice and operate an information security steering  
group with Executive Management Committee representation. Independent 
security testing is regularly conducted by specialist security organisations and  
we have access to specialist technical resources in the event of a significant 
cyber incident. 
Financial risk
Failure to meet covenants in financing documents could result in lack of available 
funding. Lack of available cash could result in the Company being unable to meet 
its financial obligations.
Net debt is monitored on a daily basis and banking facilities are reviewed  
against future expected cash flow movements to ensure that adequate facilities 
are in place.
Legal and regulatory risk
We are required to comply with extensive and complex legal and regulatory 
requirements. Non-compliance could result in significant fines, reputational 
damage (and possibly criminal proceedings), withdrawal of operating licences 
and closure of sites. Changes in laws and regulations could have an adverse 
impact on operations and financial performance
We have systems and procedures in place to ensure compliance with, and to 
manage the impact of, and changes in, government legislation and regulation 
such as agency worker regulations, vehicle operating procedures and 
environmental requirements.
Health and safety risk
Our business involves operating vehicles and other assets, and working in 
environments, that can be a risk to people and property. Our primary concern is 
to minimise, to the extent possible, the risk of harm to people who work in our 
business or are affected by it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Induction sessions for new employees (including our drivers and warehouse 
operatives) involve health and safety training and we run an on-going health and 
safety training programme. We also have a comprehensive suite of health and 
safety procedures that all new joiners must confirm they will adhere to. 
We have a dedicated Head of Health, Safety, Quality and Environment who 
oversees a team responsible for setting our health and safety standards and 
monitoring compliance with our comprehensive health and safety processes and 
procedures. This team undertakes health and safety reviews of our sites and 
customer sites to ensure compliance with appropriate standards. There are 
well-established accident reporting procedures and reviews are undertaken after all 
significant incidents to ensure our policies have been followed and that we enhance 
our standards where we can to reduce the risk of future accidents occurring. 
Reputational risk
Our potential to win new business or develop existing relationships could be 
adversely affected by a material incident and negative press could affect public 
perception of our brand. Such incidents could include a significant failure to 
deliver a customer project, wrong-doing or fraud by an employee, breach of our 
IT security system, a natural disaster such as a fire or flood preventing us from 
operating from a site or a major health and safety incident. 
We have comprehensive processes and procedures in place to manage 
operational risk and adherence to those processes and procedures is regularly 
reviewed by our HSQE team. We also have business continuity plans in place and 
escalation processes to ensure significant incidents are dealt with promptly and 
effectively. Our communications with the press are handled by our Head of 
Communications and experienced external PR advisers.

Governance statement
“The breadth of experience of the Directors 
enables the Board to provide strong and effective 
stewardship of the business. We seek to ensure 
fairness and integrity in all our decisions”
Since the Company was listed on AIM in April 2017, we have focused 
on ensuring that our governance structure supports effective decision-
making, enhances our business and protects the interests of  
our stakeholders. 
During 2018, we will continue to focus on promoting good governance  
that supports delivery of our strategy and encourages openness and 
accountability throughout the business. 
We have kept our strategy under review as the repositioning of the 
business as a provider of end-to-end supply chain logistics, begun  
by Alex Laffey as Chief Executive in 2015, has been continued.  
The Board has overseen the acquisitions of iForce and Speedy Freight 
which have broadened our capabilities and expanded the services we 
can offer our customers. In the coming year, we will continue to focus on 
growth opportunities for the business across the supply chain, organic 
and by acquisition and will regularly review our strategy. 
We are pleased to have established an Audit Committee that, in addition 
to monitoring the integrity of our financial reporting, ensures there is 
appropriate governance and challenge around the accounting treatment 
of transactions undertaken during the year. The Audit Committee also has 
responsibility for oversight of our internal controls and risk management 
framework. Significant progress has been made in formalising our risk 
management framework and input from the Executive Board has been 
critical to the steps taken to embed appropriate risk monitoring and 
mitigation throughout the business. Our enhanced understanding of our 
risks ensures that Board decision-making is supported by the right 
discussions and considerations. Further information about matters the  
Audit Committee has considered is set out on page 33.
Further information on the remuneration arrangements for the Directors 
and senior management is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 34 and 35.

Executive 
Management Committee
The Executive Management Committee 
members have responsibility, with the 
Chief Executive Officer, for implementing 
the Group’s strategy and managing the  
day to day operations of the Group.
Board
The Board is responsible for the Company’s strategy and oversees the conduct of its business.
The Board
Role of the Board 
The Board considers and approves the Company’s strategy, budget, 
material transactions and corporate actions and oversees the 
Company’s progress towards its strategic objectives. There is  
a written statement of matters which require Board approval.
Board members
The Board is comprised of three independent Non-executive Directors 
and two Executive Directors. The Non-executive Directors were 
appointed shortly before the IPO in April 2017.
 
The two Executive 
Directors joined Eddie Stobart prior to that and were both closely 
involved with the IPO and the development of the Company’s post-
admission growth plans. Alex Laffey became Chief Executive  
in May 2015. Damien Harte joined as Chief Financial Officer in  
December 2016.
There is a clearly documented division between the executive role  
of the Chief Executive and the role of the Non-executive Chairman.
Skills and experience
The Board members bring a wealth of commercial and financial 
expertise to the Board from a variety of backgrounds. The Directors 
believe that as a Board they have an appropriate mix of skills and 
experience to provide strong and effective leadership. Please see the 
Directors’ biographies on pages 28 and 29 for further information on 
their skills and experience.
Independence 
All of the Non-executive Directors (including the Chairman) are 
considered to be independent.
 
Independence of the Non-executive 
Directors is reviewed annually and the Board has determined that each 
of them continues to demonstrate strong independent judgment and 
there is no relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of 
their independent judgment.
Board Committees 
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration 
Committee. Each of the Non-executive Directors is a member of these 
Committees.
 
The Executive Directors and other members of senior 
management attend at the invitation of the Committee. Given the  
size of the Board it was not considered necessary to establish a 
Nomination Committee.
Please see page 33 for further information on the activities of the  
Audit Committee and page 34 for further information on the activities of 
the
 
Remuneration Committee. 32

distribution site near J18 on the M1, the Ports operation in Widnes 
and the operations in Gent, Belgium, giving them first hand 
experience of our operational sites.
Performance evaluation 
The effectiveness of the Board is essential to the success of the Group. 
A performance evaluation process was undertaken based on a series  
of questions prepared by the Company Secretary with input from the 
Chairman. The questions related to the Board and its Committees and 
covered matters such as size of the Board, opportunities to review 
strategy; performance of the Chairman, the mix of knowledge and skills 
on the Board; succession; and the effectiveness of the Board and the 
Directors.
The results of the performance evaluation confirmed that the Board and 
its Committees are operating effectively to discharge their responsibilities 
and there is an appropriate mix of skills and experience among Board 
and Committee members, which facilitates constructive discussion.  
The Board agreed that areas for focus in the coming year to enhance 
further the effectiveness of the Board include succession planning and 
additional site visits to assist in maintaining focus on the Group’s 
strategy as its operations expand.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of Christopher Casey as Chairman and 
the two other independent Non-executive Directors. 
Meetings and attendance 
The Audit Committee has met four times since it was established in  
April 2017. T wo meetings took place during the financial year  
ended 30 November 2017. All members attended all Committee meetings.  
The Committee is scheduled to meet three times during the current  
financial year.
The meetings are attended by the Chief Financial Officer, the Finance 
Director and the Group Head of Finance. The external auditor also 
attends at all meetings. Other members of senior management attend 
meetings by invitation.
Committee members meet at least once a year without 
management present.
Activities 
Activities of the Audit Committee since it was established have 
included:
• Reviewing the financial results for the full year for approval by 
the Board
• Considering the appropriateness of preparing the financial 
statements on a going concern basis 
• Advising the Board in relation to ensuring that the financial 
statements taken as a whole are fair and balanced.
• Approving the audit plan and considering the findings of the 
external auditor for the financial year ended 30 November 2017 
• Considering the appointment of the internal auditor 
• Reviewing and considering risk management and internal controls 
• Receiving reports on specific risk issues such as insurance risk  
and cyber security
• Approving polices adopted by the Company such as its 
treasury policy
Significant accounting judgements 
The Audit Committee, together with the Board, considered the areas of 
significant accounting judgment in connection with the preparation of the 
financial statements, including the following:
• Determination of control of Speedy Freight and valuation of deferred 
consideration (see note 6B to the financial statements on pages 64 
and 67)
• Valuation of intangible assets arising on the acquisitions of iForce 
and Speedy Freight (see note 6 to the financial statements on pages 
64 and 67)
• Accounting for warehousing-related transactions (see note 5 to the 
financial statements on page 63)
Audit Committee report
• Treatment of amounts received by employees in connection with the 
IPO funded by former parent company of the Group (see note 8 to 
the financial statements on page 69)
• Classification of items as exceptional for the purposes of the 
disclosure in the financial statements (see note 5 to the financial 
statements on page 63)
External auditor:
The Audit Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditor  
and reviews their performance and on going independence. The Audit 
Committee has reviewed the independence of KPMG LLP and the 
conduct of the audit for the financial year ended 30 November 2017.  
The Committee concluded that the external audit process has been 
effectively run and that KPMG LLP remains independent and has 
recommended their reappointment. The external auditor attends all 
Committee meetings and the Committee meets with the external auditor 
without management present at least once a year. 
Internal audit 
The Chairman of the Committee participated in the process for selection of 
a firm to provide internal audit services to supplement the assurance work 
undertaken by the Company’s Health and Safety, Quality and Environment 
team (HSQE team). The appointment of BDO LLP to provide internal audit 
services was approved by the Committee in January 2018. A partner at 
BDO LLP will provide services equivalent to having a Head of Audit within 
the business and the Committee has approved an internal audit plan for the 
2018 financial year. Internal audits will be undertaken on a co-sourced basis 
with the HSQE team where appropriate. BDO LLP will report to each 
scheduled meeting of the Committee.
Internal controls 
The Group’s risk management systems are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has delegated responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management to the 
Audit Committee. This covers all material controls including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management systems. 
In undertaking these reviews, the Committee is supported by a number 
of sources of internal assurance from within the Eddie Stobart 
business, in particular the assurance work done by the HSQE team 
and presentations from senior management on risk areas.
No material control failings have come to light during the financial 
year ended 30 November 2017 and no weaknesses in financial 
control resulted in any losses or contingencies that would require 
disclosure in the financial statements.
Risk management and internal controls 
The Board is responsible for the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal controls. The Committee has received a report 
on operating policies and procedures in place, the assurance work done 
to check adherence to those polices and the follow up actions taken to 
address any issues identified. A whistleblowing policy is in place to 
encourage employees to report any malpractice or illegal acts or 
omissions and is reviewed by the Committee each year.

Our approach to remuneration 
The Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration of Directors and senior management supports the delivery of the Group’s strategy. We set 
remuneration packages at a level that is appropriate for the market the Group operates in whilst taking into account the need to attract and retain 
talented people.
In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors and senior management have the opportunity to receive long term variable reward, dependent on 
achievement of appropriate performance conditions, that are linked to delivery of shareholder value. Executive Directors have been granted awards 
under the Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) with a target linked to shareholder value and other members of senior management have been 
granted awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) with targets linked to Total Shareholder Return and achievements of an EBITDA target.
 
Further information on the MIP and LTIP , and the relevant performance conditions, is set out on page 84 in the paragraph headed Share-based 
Incentive Schemes and note 25 to the financial statements.
The maximum opportunity under the performance-related incentive plans for the Executive Directors could, depending on vesting outcomes, be a 
significant proportion of their overall longer-term remuneration package. This outcome is designed to incentivise the delivery of our growth strategy 
and other strategic and business objectives.
Directors’ remuneration in the year ended 30 November 2017

Please see note 8 on page 69 of the accounts for information about the aggregate amount of remuneration paid to or receivable by directors of the 
Company during the financial year including the directors who resigned at or before the IPO.
Following the IPO in April 2017, certain directors were paid an individual cash bonus by Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Limited, the ultimate 
parent of the Company prior to the IPO. These payments, in aggregate £7.2m, were fully funded by Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Limited from 
the proceeds of sale of shares in the Company placed in conjunction with the IPO and there was no economic or financial consequence for the 
Company or any member of the Group. Please see note 8 on page 69 to the accounts for further information.
No payments were made in the financial year ended 30 November 2017 to past directors and no payments were made in connection with the exit of 
any director.

Our approach to remuneration in 2018
The Committee believes that the value of the total employment packages 
of the Executive Directors, including the extent of performance-related 
elements of those packages, are appropriate. No material change to the 
remuneration or benefits of the Directors is planned for the year ending 
30 November 2018. In order to continue to incentivise the senior 
management team it is anticipated that awards under the LTIP will be 
granted to senior managers as approved by the Remuneration 
Committee. The Executive Directors do not participate in the LTIP .
Non-executive Directors 
There will be no changes in the fees paid to the Non-executive Directors 
which will remain as follows:

Committee – £150,000 per annum
• Non-executive Director, Chairman of the Audit Committee – £70,000  
per annum

Share-based incentives schemes 
Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”)
The MIP was established to align the interests of the executive Directors 
with those of shareholders and will reward the Executive Directors if 
shareholder value is created.
 
On Admission the Executive Directors 
subscribed for A ordinary shares (MIP Shares) in a subsidiary of the 
Company which shares can, subject to certain conditions, be sold to  
the Company in future at an aggregate value equivalent to a maximum 
of 8% (relevant percentage) of the increase in shareholder value over a 
share value hurdle (“hurdle”). The hurdle is 10% above the placing price 
per share on Admission and will increase on a compounding basis by 
10% per annum for each of the three years from the date the MIP Shares 
were issued.
At the end of the three year period following the issue of the MIP Shares, the 
Executive Directors can elect to sell the MIP Shares to the Company or the 
Company can elect to purchase them for cash or in return for shares in the 
Company (at the Company’s discretion). The value of the MIP Shares on the 
date the election is made (Exercise Date) will be the Relevant Percentage 
multiplied by the amount by which the Company’s Ordinary Share price 
exceeds the Hurdle (based on a 90 day average share price) multiplied by 
the number of issued ordinary shares at Admission. If the Company elects 
to purchase the MIP Shares in return for ordinary shares in the Company the 
number of ordinary shares will be based on the MIP Share value and share 
price of the ordinary shares on the Exercise Date.
 
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) 
The LTIP was established to reward members of the senior management 
team by offering them nil cost options. The LTIP has been designed 
flexibly to be capable for future use by the Company and not only for  
the award of nil-cost options. The LTIP requires participants who have 
received an award to appoint Link Market Services Trustees Limited to 
hold applicable ordinary shares on trust for the LTIP participant for the 
applicable holding period. No awards have been granted to Directors 
under the LTIP .
Share incentive Plan (“SIP”)
 
A UK HMRC-approved Share Incentive Plan was established on 
Admission and a grant of free shares was made to employees in order 
to ensure employees are incentivised and their interests aligned with 
those of the Company.
 
No further awards have been made under this 
scheme. The trustee is Link Market Services Trustees, an independent 
professional body, which has acquired 1,687,500 shares which are held 
in trust for the benefit of the participating employees. Eligible employees 
will forfeit their shares if they cease to be employed by the Eddie Stobart 
Group during the three year period from Admission, except in permitted 
circumstances. The SIP has been designed flexibly to be capable of 
future use by the Company and not just for the free share offer at the 
time of Admission.
 
Further information on the share-based incentive schemes is included in 
note 25 on page 84 of the accounts.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent Company financial statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM Rules 
of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent
• For the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU
• For the parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements
• Assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
• Use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations,  
or have no realistic alternative but to do so
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
 
Under the Companies Act and applicable regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report and a Directors’ Report that 
complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board 10 April 2018 and signed on behalf of the Board and each Director by;

the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union;

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include 
the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest 
effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. In arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows: 40
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Eddie Stobart Logistics plc continued
The risk Our response
Existence, accuracy and 
presentation of revenue 
(£623.9m) 
Refer to page 55 
(accounting policy) and 
page 60 (financial 
disclosures). 
Accounting basis and presentation
The Group generates income through a number of 
reporting components and from a diverse range of 
activities, which include the operation of its core 
transport business, the use and management of its 
warehousing estate and the provision of ancillary 
services, including in relation to property.
Certain material individual transactions arising from 
these activities are complex and may relate to multiple 
contracts or documents. These transactions require 
management to make judgments in order to determine 
the appropriate basis and timing of recognition of 
income deriving from those transactions, and their 
associated presentation within the Consolidated Income 
Statement. Such judgments could be influenced by 
conscious or unconscious bias.
Management override
Revenue includes amounts recorded via manual 
invoicing and manual journals, including those used for 
the recording of certain complex transactions such as 
those related to property. 
Manual entries represent a heightened level of risk that 
management might override automated or manual 
controls over the identification and disclosure of revenue 
transactions, such that the basis and timing of 
recognition is not appropriately considered or such that 
a full understanding of the components of financial 
performance is not presented.
For each of the components where existence and 
accuracy of revenue was determined to be a key audit 
matter, our procedures included:
• Substantive testing: We obtained detailed listings 
of revenue transactions and selected specific 
transactions for testing in order to consider their 
individual accounting treatment. We obtained, as 
appropriate, third party evidence, including bank 
statements and supporting contracts and 
agreements, to enable us to understand the 
substance of the transactions. We investigated those 
transactions with unexpected or unusual 
characteristics. 
• Accounting analysis: We assessed the period and 
value of income recognised in relation to the 
identified significant judgmental transactions by 
considering the basis for the accounting judgements 
applied by the directors compared to the 
requirements of the relevant accounting standards 
and underlying commercial agreements. For revenue 
from services related to property, this included 
procedures to assess the completeness of 
transaction documentation and assessing the 
relationship between the parties involved and 
challenging whether associated ongoing lease 
commitments were at a market rate.
• Management override: We obtained detailed 
listings of journal entries recorded in revenue and 
reviewed for any unusual postings, by reference to 
both value and type. For unexpected or unusual 
transactions identified during our testing we obtained 
third party evidence to challenge management’s 
explanations as to whether the basis and timing of 
revenue recognition was appropriate. Where the 
entries related to property transactions we undertook 
the accounting analysis referred to above.
• Assessing transparency: We have considered the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of 
the accounting policies in the key areas of judgment 
and quantum of material elements with respect to 
these transactions. 41

The risk Our response
Impairment of goodwill in 
relation to Puro Ventures 
and iForce (£35.5m) 
Refer to page 53 
(accounting policy) and 
page 74 (financial 
disclosures).
Forecast based valuation
When carrying out the goodwill impairment review, 
determining the recoverable amount for each cash-
generating unit (“CGU”) requires the Directors to make 
judgements over certain key inputs in the value in use 
discounted cash flow models. These include revenue 
growth, discount rates and long term growth rate 
assumptions. 
In particular, revenue growth forecasts within the Puro 
Ventures (Speedy Freight) and iForce CGUs contain 
significant risk as, being recent acquisitions, there is a 
lack of forecasting history, and the forecasts include 
rapid growth assumptions and therefore are sensitive to 
downward trends. 
 
Our procedures included:
• Historical comparison: We assessed the accuracy 
of the Group’s historical forecasts by comparing to 
actual results in the period since acquisition. Where 
relevant we factored this into our sensitivity analysis
• Our sector experience: We challenged the 
underlying trading forecasts within the Group’s value 
in use discounted cash flow models for Puro 
Ventures and iForce, including considering the long 
term growth rates used, and we involved our own 
corporate finance specialists to critically assess the 
discount rates applied by the Group. 
• Sensitivity analysis: We performed several 
scenario-based sensitivity analyses for each CGU to 
assess the implications of the Group’s assumptions 
not being met. For each scenario considered we 
assessed the remaining headroom between the 
recoverable and carrying amount.
• Comparing valuations: We compared the 
recoverable amounts within the Group’s overall value 
in use discounted cash flow models, including those 
for Puro Ventures and iForce, to the Group’s overall 
market capitalisation.
• Assessing transparency: We considered the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of 
impairment testing, and whether disclosures in 
relation to the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in assumptions 
properly reflected the risks inherent in the valuations.
Accounting for 
acquisitions
• iForce Group Limited: 
(Consideration to obtain 
control £45.0m; Goodwill 
and intangible assets 
acquired £43.2m)
• Puro Ventures Limited: 
(Consideration to obtain 
control: £18.7m; 
Goodwill and intangible 
assets acquired: £18.0m)
• TLP Limited: 
(Consideration to obtain 
remaining equity: £5.0m)
Refer to page 50 
(accounting policies) and 
page 65 (financial 
disclosures).
During the year the Group acquired controlling interests 
in iForce Group Limited, Puro Ventures Limited (trading 
as Speedy Freight) as well as purchasing the remaining 
shares within TLP Holdings Limited. These acquisitions 
have had a material impact on the financial statements, 
resulting in the recognition of goodwill, intangible assets 
and amounts owing in respect of deferred and 
contingent consideration.
Accounting treatment
In assessing control, judgment was required in 
determining the ability of the remaining shareholders 
within Puro Ventures to restrict the extent to which the 
Group was able to control the investee, and therefore 
determine the date at which the Group gained control 
for the purposes of consolidation.
Our procedures included:
• Accounting analysis: We reviewed each 
acquisition’s sale and purchase agreements. For 
Puro Ventures we assessed the factors determining 
control to understand the rights of any remaining 
external shareholder interests. We assessed whether, 
and at what point, control was obtained as well as 
the appropriateness of not recording a Non 
Controlling Interest, and compared our assessment 
to that of the Directors. 
• Accounting analysis: For both Puro Ventures and 
TLP we challenged the appropriateness of the 
assessment of the amount of consideration that 
should be accounted as remuneration, and critically 
assessed the period over which the remuneration is 
recognised. 42
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The risk Our response
Accounting for 
acquisitions (continued)
Accounting treatment (continued)
Accounting for the put and call option on the Puro 
Ventures acquisition involved judgement as to whether 
to record a Non Controlling Interest.
Accounting for both the Puro Ventures and TLP 
acquisitions required assessment as to whether an 
element of the contingent consideration should be 
accounted for as remuneration, and over which period 
this should be recognised.
Forecast-based valuation
The valuation of the contingent consideration, including 
the put and call options in relation to Puro Ventures, 
required the directors to make judgements around the 
future performance of the business.
Intangible assets of £25.7m were recognised as a result 
of the acquisitions of iForce and Puro Ventures. These 
were valued, using input from a third party valuation 
expert, based on discounted cash flow forecasts, which 
require judgment by the Directors around key 
assumptions such as revenue growth, discount rates 
and long term growth rates.
• Benchmarking assumptions: We considered each 
business’ track record and the evidence behind the 
Directors’ assumptions of future trading performance 
in evaluating the valuation of the contingent 
consideration recognised in respect of Puro Ventures 
and TLP .
• Our sector experience: In respect of the iForce 
and Puro Ventures acquisitions, we applied our 
knowledge of the business and industry to evaluate 
the intangible assets identified and the fair value 
recognised, including through the involvement of our 
own corporate finance specialists.
• Assessing transparency: We have considered the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of 
the acquisitions.
Accounting for the IPO 
Refer to pages 57 and 58 
(accounting policy) and 
pages 63 and 69 (financial 
disclosures).
As a result of, or concurrent with, the Group’s Initial 
Public Offering (IPO), changes to the Group’s capital 
and financing structure were implemented.
The accounting treatment of costs which arose in 
connection with the IPO required judgment from the 
Directors. 
Refinancing of borrowing
Accounting for the Group’s new borrowing facilities 
required judgment from the Directors over whether the 
changes represented the entrance into a new facility or 
the modification of an existing facility.
Accounting application
Judgment was required over both the allocation of 
transaction costs between the Consolidated Income 
Statement and the Share Premium reserve, and over the 
accounting treatment and disclosure of bonuses paid 
by the pre IPO parent company.
Our procedures included:
• Accounting analysis: We obtained the agreements 
regarding the new borrowing facilities and reviewed 
the relevant terms in order to consider whether the 
change in arrangements amounted to a new facility 
under accounting standards.
• Substantive testing: We substantively tested the 
expenses allocated to Consolidated Income 
Statement and to the Share Premium reserve, 
obtaining supporting evidence for each item 
selected and determining whether their treatment as 
share issue or transaction cost was appropriate.
• Assessing transparency: We have considered the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in this area.
Recoverability of the 
parent company’s 
investment in, and debt 
due from, group 
subsidiaries 
(Investments £65.3m million, 
amounts due from £122.3m)
Refer to page 90 
(accounting policy) and 
pages 92 and 93 (financial 
disclosures).
Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the parent company’s 
investments in subsidiaries represents 35% of the 
company’s total assets and the intra-group debtor 
balance represents the remaining 66% of the company’s 
total assets. The investments’ and debtors’ 
recoverability are not at a high risk of significant 
misstatement or subject to significant judgement. 
However, due to their materiality in the context of the 
parent company financial statements, this is considered 
to be the area that had the greatest effect on our overall 
parent company audit.
Our procedures included: 
• Tests of detail: Comparing the carrying amount of 
100% of investments and intra-group debtors with 
the relevant subsidiaries’ draft balance sheet to 
identify whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, 
were in excess of their carrying amount and 
assessing whether those subsidiaries have 
historically been profit-making.
• Assessing subsidiary audits: Assessing the work 
performed by the Group and subsidiary audit teams 
on all of those subsidiaries and considering the 
results of that work, on those subsidiaries’ profits 
and net assets.
• Our sector experience: For the investments where 
the carrying amount exceeded the net asset value, 
comparing the carrying amount of the investment 
intragroup and debtors with the expected value of 
the business based on a discounted cash flow 
projections.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was initially set 
at £1.35m at the planning stage and was subsequently revised to £1.1m, 
determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before tax and 
exceptional items, of which it represents 5%. 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was 
set at £1m, determined with reference to a benchmark of gross assets, of 
which it represents 0.5%.
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding £67,500, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s twenty reporting components, we subjected eleven to full 
scope audits for group purposes. The Group team instructed component 
auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant 
risks detailed above and the information to be reported. The Group team 
approved the component materialities, which ranged from £0.3m to 
£1.1m, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the 
percentage illustrated opposite.
The work on five of the eleven components was performed by 
component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the parent 
company, was performed by the Group team. The Group team 
performed procedures on the items excluded from Group profit before 
tax and exceptional items. 
The Group team visited eight component locations in three locations to 
assess the audit risk and strategy. Video and telephone conference 
meetings were also held with these component auditors and the majority 
of the others that were not physically visited. At these visits and 
meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in 
more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then 
performed by the component auditor.

4. We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of  
the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate or there is an 
undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over  
the use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date  
of approval of the financial statements. We have nothing to report in 
these respects.
5. We have nothing to report on the other information in 
the Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information presented in  
the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion  
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly 
stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the 
information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work 
we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report 
and the directors’ report; 
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial 
year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. 
6.  We have nothing to report on the other matters on which 
we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
• we have not received all the and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects
7. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 38, the 
directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements 
including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and, parent Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to 
do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s 
report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law,  
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 November 2017
1. Principal Accounting Policies
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc (formally Greenwhitestar UK plc) (the ‘Company’) is a company limited by share capital, incorporated and domiciled in the 
United Kingdom. The address of the Company’s registered office is Stretton Green Distribution Park, Langford Way, Appleton, Warrington, WA4 4TQ. 
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 30 November 2017 and the comparative year ended 30 November 
2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interest in associates and jointly controlled entities. The 
Group and its subsidiaries provide value added logistics, distribution and warehousing services for its clients across a wide range of service sectors  
and industries. 
Statement of compliance
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the 
International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Basis of preparation
The Group and Company accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years in these Consolidated Financial Statements, 
and have been applied consistently by Group entities unless otherwise stated.
Going concern
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. To 
assist in this process, management has completed a budgeting process for the financial year ending 30 November 2018, incorporating a detailed 
income statement, cash flow analysis and statement of financial position, and a forecasting exercise for a period of six months beyond this. The 
Directors have assessed the funding requirements of the Group and the Company and compared them to banking facilities available. This exercise 
has not identified any issues that would suggest any significant risk to the Group’s continued trading position and the forecasts demonstrate that the 
Group is expected to remain within its existing finance facilities and their associated covenants. The Directors have therefore adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Basis of measurement
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except derivative financial instruments which are measured 
at fair value. 
The Directors have considered the fair values of all debtors and creditors and have determined that their fair values equate to their carrying values.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 30 November 2017. Control is 
identified when the Group has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns from its power 
over the investee. The Group controls an investee where:
• Power over the investee exists (the ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)
• Exposure or rights to variable returns via its involvement with the investee exists
• The Group has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect those returns
There is a general presumption that majority voting rights results in control, however where the Group has less than a majority of voting rights, or 
similar rights, the Group considers all relevant fact and circumstances in assessing whether it has the power over an investee including:
• Contractual arrangements with the other vote holders of the investee
• Rights arising from the other contractual arrangements
• The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
The Group reassess whether or not it controls the investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to elements of control. 
Consolidation arises when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control over the subsidiary. Assets, 
liabilities, income, expenses and cash flows of an acquired or disposed of subsidiary during the year are included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements from the date the Group gained control and until the date the Group ceased control of the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to any 
non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the 
Financial Statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-Group assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. 
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared for the same reporting year 
as the Parent Company. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction. Any 
investment retained is recognised at fair value.
i. Business combinations – business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date (when control is 
transferred to the Group). The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• The fair value of the consideration transferred
• The recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree
• If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree; less the net recognised 
amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 51
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
1. Principal Accounting Policies continued 
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business 
combination are expensed as incurred. 
ii. Non-controlling interests – for each business combination, the Group measures any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at their proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, which are generally at fair value.
 Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their 
capacity as owners. Adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. No 
adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
iii. Subsidiaries – subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
iv. Loss of control of a subsidiary – on a loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling 
interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
v. Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities (equity-accounted investees) – associates are those entities in which the Group has 
significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the 
Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. Jointly controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the 
Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. 
Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities are accounted for under the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The cost of 
the investment includes transaction costs. 
 The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity-accounted 
investees from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. When 
the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment, including any long-term 
interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an 
obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
vi. Transactions eliminated on consolidation – intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from 
intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity 
accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in 
the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Company’s Board of Directors, collectively the 
Group’s chief operating decision maker, to assess performance and allocate capital or resources.
Foreign currency
i. Foreign currency transactions – transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at 
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are 
retranslated at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost at the 
beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the 
exchange rate at the end of the year.
ii. Foreign operations – the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are 
translated at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at exchange rates at the dates 
of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign currency translation 
reserve (translation reserve) in equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the 
cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments
i. Non-derivative financial assets – loans and receivables, including financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Loans and receivables 
comprise cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other receivables. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with 
maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by 
the Group in the management of its short-term commitments. 52
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 30 November 2017
1. Principal Accounting Policies continued 
ii. Non-derivative financial liabilities – financial liabilities are recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or expire. The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category. Such financial liabilities are 
recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs.
 Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Other financial 
liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, debt securities issued, bank overdrafts, and trade and other payables.
 Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash 
and cash equivalents for the statement of cash flows.
iii. Share capital – ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a 
deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
iv. Derivative financial instruments and hedging – the group uses interest rate swap derivative financial instruments to hedge its risks associated with 
interest rate fluctuations. All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are 
carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is 
determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is 
appropriate, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or 
transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at 
inception to be highly effective.
 Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the consolidated 
income statement. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the 
nature of the hedging relationship, which in the case of the single financial instrument held by the Group is a cash flow hedge. 
 Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the 
period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs. However, when the forecast transaction results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial 
carrying amount of the asset or liability.
 If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the 
consolidated income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its 
designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction 
occurs and are then transferred to the consolidated income statement or included in the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability 
as above.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, 
any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use including any directly attributable capitalised 
borrowing costs and an estimate of any future costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. 
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date they are available for use or, in respect of self-constructed assets, from the 
date that the asset is completed and ready for use. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their 
estimated residual values using the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation is generally recognised within administrative expenses in profit or loss, unless the amount is included in the carrying amount of another 
asset. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. 
The estimated useful lives for significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:
• Freehold buildings: 2%-5% per annum straight line
• Leasehold land and buildings: 1% straight line, or period of lease if shorter
• Vehicles and trailers: 3-10 years straight line and 25% reducing balance as appropriate
• Plant and equipment: 3-7 years straight line and between 15%-20% reducing balance as appropriate
• Fixtures and fittings: 3-5 years straight line and between 20%-33% reducing balance as appropriate 53
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
1. Principal Accounting Policies continued 
Assets under construction
Assets under construction at operating depots are capitalised as assets-under-construction. The cost of assets-under-construction comprises its 
purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use. Assets-under-construction amounts 
related to development projects are presented as a separate asset within Property, Plant and Equipment. Assets-under-construction is not 
depreciated. Once the asset is complete and available for use, depreciation is commenced.
Intangible assets and goodwill
These comprise software development and implementation costs, trademarks and brands and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment (see below). Costs incurred in developing the Group’s own brands are expensed as incurred.
Separately acquired brands and customer lists are shown at historical cost. Software, brands and customer lists acquired in a business combination 
are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
These assets are deemed to have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful lives.
Goodwill that arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented within intangible assets. The measurement of goodwill at initial recognition is 
explained in the Basis of consolidation policy set out above. Subsequently, Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs 
are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are 
recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
• It is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use
• Management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it
• There is an ability to use or sell the software product
• It can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits
• Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available
• The expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over their estimated useful lives, from the date that they 
are available for use.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
These are as follows:
• Software development and licences; 3 years
• Rights to trademarks, brand names and customer relationship lists; 6 to 15 years
• Franchise contracts; 10 to 15 years
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Impairment
i. Non-derivative financial assets – a financial asset not classified at fair value through profit or loss, including an interest in an equity-accounted 
investee, is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that loss 
event(s) had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. 
ii. Non-financial assets – the carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at  
each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit 
(CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the 
smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. 54
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 30 November 2017
1. Principal Accounting Policies continued 
Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment 
testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of 
goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss and available for sale. The classification 
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. At 30 November 2017 the Group held no financial assets available for sale. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. 
Assets in this category are classified as current assets. 
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial 
assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group 
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Gains or losses arising 
from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ category are presented in the income statement within ‘other 
net gains’ in the period in which they arise. 
Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the income statement as part of other income when the 
Group’s right to receive payments is established. 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a Group of financial assets is impaired.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in 
payments (more than 30 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income 
statement within ‘administration expenses’. When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade 
receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘administration expenses’ in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash in hand, demand deposits, and highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of 
cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle, and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location 
and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. 
Employee benefits
i. Short-term employee benefits – short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related 
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
ii. Defined contribution plans – a defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a 
separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are 
recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which related services are rendered by employees. 55

Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as 
consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value is measured by an independent third party to review and calculate fair 
values using the Log-normal Monte-Carlo stochastic model. The fair values of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
• Including any market performance condition (for example, an entity’s share price)
• Excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets and remaining 
an employee of the entity over a specified time period)
• Including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save)
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. The total 
expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. 
In addition, in some circumstances employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated 
for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between service commencement period and grant date. 
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment 
to equity. 
When the options are exercised, the Company either issues new shares, or uses own shares purchased for this purpose. For issued new shares, the 
proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value) and share premium. 
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, and the 
charge will be treated as a cash settled transaction.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer 
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined based on the expected future 
cash flows. When it has a material effect, these are discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of any discount is recognised as a finance cost. The policies used to determine specific 
provisions are:
i. Lease remediation and site restoration – provisions are established over the life of leases to cover remedial work necessary at termination under 
the terms of those leases. Guidance for the total cost is made with reference to independent third party quantity surveyors reports and spread 
over the terms of the lease.
ii. Onerous contracts – a provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are 
lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the 
expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group 
recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
iii. Employee restructuring – a provision for employee restructuring costs is made once the Group is committed to any restructuring plans, which 
require a change to the status of employees that have a cost implication.
iv. Insurance claims are assessed on a case by case basis, with the estimated costs of claims based on the advice of the Group’s external 
insurance advisers.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the 
Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. The Group 
recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and 
when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities. The amount of revenue is not considered to be reliably measurable until all 
contingencies relating to the sale have been resolved. In practice this means that revenue is generally recognised as follows: 56
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 30 November 2017
1. Principal Accounting Policies continued 
(a) Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the 
goods. For other goods, it is when despatched, or packaged and made available for collection.
(b) Warehouse and distribution service contracts
Revenue is recognised when the service is rendered. Invoicing varies by contract, but is typically either in line with work performed or initially on a 
budgeted volume basis with later adjustment to reflect actual activity. Where a contract contains elements of variable consideration, the Group will 
estimate the amount or revenue to which it will be entitled under the contract. Variable consideration can arise as a result of incentives, performance 
bonuses, penalties or other similar items.
(c) Training and other contracts 
Revenue is recognised over the life of the contract in proportion to the costs of providing the services.
(d) Franchise revenue and franchise contracts 
Franchise revenue is recognised gross to reflect franchisor management of invoicing, collection and credit risk. Revenue in respect of franchise 
contracts is recognised at the point in which a franchise agreement has been signed and fees in respect of the franchise have been received, at 
which point they are not refundable.
(e) Sales of services – Property 
At certain sites where the company has entered into leases, arrangements have been entered into with a third party, under which the Company 
received fees for property-related advisory fees. Revenue earned from providing property associated services is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement at the fair value of the consideration received/receivable, net of professional fees, associated costs and VAT . 
The Company continues to be successful in providing property related services included to third party investors as part of its core strategy and the 
growth of its warehousing estate. It has earned fees of £10.4m (2016: £4.6m; 2015:£9.1m) with a strong pipeline of future projects and work going 
into 2018. Management has made the judgement that the fees are payments for the provision of property services to a third party investor that may 
be recorded as the revenue at the time of the transaction.
In forming that judgement the Company has considered whether the leases it has entered into are operating leases and whether the future rentals 
are at market value and accordingly, whether the fees received can be attributed to delivered property services.
(f) Sale of services – Consultancy 
In line with the stated strategy of consulting led logistics, the Group offers a range of consultancy services including property, logistics, IT consulting 
and integration services. In the year to November 2017 these totalled £6.7m (2016: £1.2m).
Government grants
Government grants received on capital expenditure are generally deducted in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset purchased. Grants for 
revenue are recognised initially as deferred income at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will 
comply with the conditions associated with the grant, and are then recognised in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful 
life of the asset. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis in 
the periods in which the expenses are recognised.
Leases
i. Leased assets – assets held by the Group under leases which transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that 
asset. Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the Group’s Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position.
ii. Lease payments – payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Where 
leases contain escalation clauses that stipulate specific increases to the rental payable, the operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line 
basis. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease. Minimum lease payments 
made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is 
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rental income
Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the 
total rental income, over the term of the lease. 
Finance income and finance costs
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest 
method. Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and the net interest cost from accounting for 
defined benefit pension schemes. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are 
recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. Foreign currency gains and losses on financial assets and financial liabilities are reported 
on a net basis as either finance income or finance cost depending on whether foreign currency movements are in a net gain or net loss position. 57

1. Principal Accounting Policies continued 
Exceptional items
Items that are material in size or nature are presented as exceptional items in the income statement. The Directors are of the opinion that the 
separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying business performance. Events which may give rise 
to the classification of items as exceptional include restructuring of business units and the associated legal and employee costs, and other significant 
gains or losses. Items of expenditure relating to the initial public offering (IPO) and the acquisition of business assets have been treated as 
exceptional items during the year, as well as costs associated with the refinancing and closure of swap arrangements during the year and a gain 
arising on a lease agreement (see note 5).
Alternative performance measures (APMs)
Underlying results are used in the day-to-day management of the Group. They represent statutory measures adjusted for items which in the 
Directors’ view could distort the understanding of performance and comparability year on year. Note 4 provides a reconciliation between APMs and 
statutory IFRS measures.
Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a 
business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other Comprehensive Income.
i. Current tax – is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any tax liability arising 
from the declaration of dividends.
ii. Deferred tax – is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for
• Temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss
• Temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities to the extent that the Group is able to 
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future
• Taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill
New standards and interpretations

The new standard is a single global revenue standard that 
contains a single model that applies to two approaches, being 
at point in time and over time. For complex transactions with 
multiple components, variable consideration or extended 
periods, application of the standard can lead to revenue being 
accelerated or deferred in comparison to current IFRS.
Periods beginning 
1 January 2018, 
deferred from 
1 January 2017.
Management are currently 
evaluating the potential impact of 
the new standard and are not 
intending to adopt during FY18.
IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments
IFRS 9 was introduced in 2014 as a complete standard 
including the requirements previously issued and the additional 
amendments to introduce a new expected loss impairment 
model and limited changes to the classification and 
measurement requirements for financial assets.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Judgements and Fair Value estimates 
Significant accounting judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s’ accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors have made the following judgements that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below) 
and have been identified as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments.
i. Lease commitments – at the point of entering into a new lease, management make best efforts to assess the pricing, size, quality, location and fit for 
new warehouse space, to which a commitment is being made. In making this assessment management must take a view on market rentals, which is 
inherently a critical accounting judgement. If the rental is subsequently deemed to be above market rate then there is a risk that the contract could 
prove to be onerous and may also impact the ability to recognise any revenue from property related services that have been provided. In addition a 
critical accounting judgement has been applied in assessing whether a new lease signed by the Group was a new lease or whether it had 
modified the pre-existing lease. The Company concluded that because it was a major redevelopment with significantly different terms that the 
new lease was a substantially different asset. In the absence of guidance in IAS 17 as to how to determine whether a lease had been terminated 
or modified, it was appropriate for the release of the deferred lease liability to be recognised as a gain in the period. However, given the 
magnitude of the release and its unusual nature, management determined that the impact of this transaction should be disclosed separately.
ii. Classification of certain leases – judgement is required in certain leases that contain buyback clauses over the extent of risk that remains at the 
end of the lease term and therefore whether the lease is classified as a finance or operating lease. This judgement is made at the outset on a 
case by case basis. However, once these judgements have been made, no change to the lease classification is expected.
iii. Assessment of control – for non-wholly owned acquisitions judgement is required in evaluating the facts and circumstances in order to assess 
and determine whether and when the business has control. In making this determination, management look closely at whether the Group has the 
ability to influence the returns generated by the investee through being able to direct its activity and also whether the investee is exposed to 
variable rates of return.
iv. Bonus payments in respect of the IPO – during the financial year cash bonuses were paid to the Directors and employees of the Eddie Stobart 
Logistics plc in relation to the IPO by Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Limited, the ultimate parent company of the Group prior to the IPO, from 
the proceeds of sale of shares placed in the IPO. There was no economic or financial consequences for the Company or any member of the 
Group from this payment and therefore no charge has been recognised in the Group as a result.
v. Refinancing of borrowing (note 21) – judgment is required when accounting for the re-financing of the Groups borrowings. An assessment of the 
terms and structure of both the original and replacement facility is made to determine the treatment of capitalised borrowing costs. Where the 
re-financing is deemed to result in the extinguishment and replacement of the original loan the corresponding costs are released in full to the 
income statement.
Key sources of estimation in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
i. Useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment – the useful lives of intangible assets rely on various internal and external 
factors which could turn out to be different from the assumptions employed in determining their useful life. The useful lives of property, plant and 
equipment is also dependent upon estimates of the period over which an asset is expected to generate profits, which includes an assessment of 
the reliability, longevity and cost of maintenance of those assets. The Board periodically reviews the major classes of assets to ensure that the 
periods over which they are amortised or depreciation is appropriate.
ii. Impairment of goodwill – the Group is required to perform an annual impairment test on goodwill by reference to its value in use or its fair value, 
less costs of disposal. This requires an estimate of future business performance, cash flows and discount rates all of which rely on estimates and 
judgements of future events and may therefore be subject to change.
iii. Taxation – the tax balances are calculated based on an assessment of the tax treatment of income and costs and the availability of tax losses and 
Group reliefs. The calculation of deferred tax balances also includes an estimate of future profits and assumptions regarding future tax treatments, 
for example in relation to the deductible of the brand intangible. The calculations are prepared in consultation with third party advisers but due to 
the estimates and judgements required may still be subject to change. 59
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Judgements and Fair Value Estimates continued
iv. Contingent consideration and valuation on put and call option (note 6) – Where the measurement of an investment involves the future 
performance of the business to be considered, management must exercise judgment and form a view of the probable outcome at the 
measurement points. Subsequent change to this valuation that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either 
in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income unless the contingent consideration is classified as equity. In such circumstances, 
changes are recognised within equity. Changes in contingent consideration arising from additional information, obtained within one year of the 
acquisition date, about facts or circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognised as an adjustment to goodwill. The contingent 
consideration calculation date is 31 May 2018 and therefore given the relative proximity to the 30 November 2017 balance date, the risk of 
material misstatement is considered to be low. The first point at which the put and call could be exercised is 31 May 2021, and therefore the risk 
of material misstatement is considered to be greater, given that the level of accuracy in forecasts and estimates reduces over longer periods.
v. Property, plant and equipment (note 13) – The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is the 
estimated amount for which property could be exchanged on the acquisition date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length 
transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably. The fair value of items of plant, equipment, fixtures and 
fittings is based on the market approach and cost approaches using quoted market prices for similar items when available and depreciated 
replacement cost when appropriate. Depreciated replacement cost reflects adjustments for physical deterioration as well as functional and 
economic obsolescence. No material misstatement is expected in the following year but inclusion of the estimate is considered appropriate in 
view of the exercise conducted on the acquired Canute assets, as detailed in note 6.
vi. Intangible assets (note 14) – The Group has significant investments in indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill at 30 November 2017 as a 
result of acquisitions of businesses and purchase of such assets. The carrying value of indefinite intangible fixed assets at 30 November 2017 is 
£87.8m (2016: £71.4m). These assets represent the fair value of customer relationships acquired in a business combination, which are 
determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, whereby the subject asset is valued after deducting a fair return on all other assets 
that are part of creating the related cash flows and Brand names held under licence which are valued at their amortised cost. This involves the 
preparation of discounted cash flow projections, which require an estimate of both future operating cash flows and an appropriate discount rate. 
Such estimates are inherently subjective and can have a material impact on the result of the impairment test.
vii. Trade and other receivables (note 17) – The fair values of trade and other receivables are estimated at the present value of future cash flows, 
discounted at the market rate of interest at the measurement date. Short-term receivables with no stated interest rate are measured at the original 
invoice amount if the effect of discounting is immaterial. Fair value is determined at initial recognition and, for disclosure purposes, at each annual 
reporting date. Provisions for impairment of receivables are established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due.
viii. Fair value estimates in share schemes (note 25) – Judgement is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the Group’s 
share-based payment plans. Note 25 describes the key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values. In 
addition estimates are made of the number of awards that will ultimately vest and judgement is required in relation to the probability of meeting 
non-market-based performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees in the plans. The complexity of the assessment and the 
sensitivity of the assumptions are described in note 25. 60

4. Alternative Performance Measures Reconciliations
Alternative performance measures (APMs)
Underlying results are used in the day-to-day management of the Group, and represent statutory measures adjusted for items which, in the Directors’ 
view, could distort the understanding of comparability and performance of the Group year on year. These items include the impact of the exit from the 
Ireland Retail segment, exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, share of profit from equity accounted investees, employee share 
scheme costs which were fully funded by the previous parent holding group and investor and management charges. 
Investor and management charges incurred under the previous private equity ownership will not recur in the future and therefore do not form part of 
the underlying trading performance of the Group. Amortisation of acquired intangibles is added back as the charge is non-cash. The share of profit 
from equity accounted investees represents joint ventures which run in collaboration with existing Group businesses. The employee share scheme 
costs were funded by the previous parent holding group and therefore, whilst they result in an accounting entry to the Group, they do not represent a 
cash cost. The gain arising on lease agreement has been added back into underlying profit as it arose as part of the strategy around management of 
the property portfolio, full disclosure is provided in note 5.

Restructuring costs comprise costs of integration plans, legal costs, significant redundancy costs, business reorganisation and restructuring undertaken 
by management as the business continues to centralise and integrate acquisitions. These are principally expected to be one-off in nature.
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc was listed on the London Stock Exchange on 25 April 2017, with the consequence that a number of professional and 
adviser costs were incurred. These costs have been classified as exceptional. 
The Group has been acquisitive during the year, with further one-off non-trading expenses incurred in the investments in iForce Group, Puro Ventures 
(trading as Speedy Freight), The Logistics People and certain assets and liabilities of Canute. The acquisition costs of £1.72m include £1.34m in 
relation to contingent consideration accounted for as remuneration. Further details can be found on this activity in note 6.
In 2017 due to increased business demand, the Company undertook a major redevelopment of our strategically important site at Goresbrook Park, 
Dagenham. Funded by our landlord, it increased the revenue earning capacity by over 100%, added significant additional state-of-the-art 
warehousing capacity, improved transport operations facilities and enhanced rail connectivity. In conjunction with this redevelopment we surrendered 
our existing lease and signed a new 26 year institutional lease at market rent appropriate to the new facility. As a consequence certain credits relating 
to the former lease were released to the profit and loss account, namely the unamortised portion of the original two year rent free period and the 
provision for the contractual uplifts of rent over the original 17 year lease term. The aggregate amount of these credits was £4.6m.
Given the relative magnitude of the amount released, the Group have disclosed this as an exceptional credit in the year. However as releases of this 
nature flow naturally from our continuing strategic development of our warehousing portfolio, and may well occur in the future, it has been reported 
as part of the underlying trading performance of the business in note 4. 
The Group exited a significant contract in Ireland during the year and the exceptional costs of £2.4m represent the repatriation of equipment to the 
UK, termination of equipment lease contracts, storage, decommission and disposal costs of the assets.
A new term loan was arranged in parallel to the listing, with the result that the residual capitalised bank fees relating to the previous loan were written 
off to the income statement within finance costs, in addition to swap closure costs. 64

6. Acquisitions continued 
a. iForce Group 
On 28 April 2017, Eddie Stobart Logistics plc acquired, through its wholly-owned subsidiary ESLL Group Limited, 100% of the share capital of 
iForce Group Limited, a leading E-commerce service provider which supports customers with industry-leading software and operational capability. 
The consideration payable was transferred upon acquisition and no further contingent consideration is payable. Transaction costs associated with 
the acquisition have been recorded in the income statement classified as exceptional costs (note 5).
Goodwill arising on the acquisition represents the projected profitability of the iForce Group, including the assembled workforce, together with further 
potential to exploit synergies between Group business units and within the logistics sector as a whole. None of this goodwill is expected to be 
deductible for corporation tax purposes.
Subsequent to acquisition management performed a review of the carrying value of all of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the aggregated 
companies within the iForce Group. This review resulted in a number of fair value adjustments.
The fair value adjustments arose primarily as a consequence of a purchase price allocation exercise using a recognised third party and done in 
accordance with IFRS 3 and IAS 38, in addition to adjustments made to receivables provisioning, timing of the recognition of costs and ensuring 
sufficient site restoration provisioning.

6. Acquisitions continued 
b. Puro Ventures (trading as Speedy Freight)
On 8 July 2017 the Group purchased 50% of the share capital of Puro Ventures Limited, which trades as Speedy Freight. Speedy Freight has a 
rapidly growing franchise model and specialises in urgent business to business, same day delivery. 
In the view of management, the acquisition of the remaining available equity is probable through the existence of a call option and a put option, 
exercisable in future periods, with the amounts payable under the options dependent on the future trading results. Acquisition of the remaining 50% 
shareholding is expected to result in a higher payment than for the controlling interest due to the rapid projected growth of the business.
The Directors have undertaken a review of the relevant acquisition and the shareholder agreements and have determined, based on that review and 
actual operational arrangements since acquisition, that they have the power to direct the relevant activities of the Speedy Freight business and that 
they have exposure to variable returns from the exercise of that power. On this basis, and also taking into account the existence of the put and call 
arrangements set out above, the Group has consolidated the results of Speedy Freight from the date of acquisition.
Subsequent to the acquisition, management performed a review of the carrying value of all of the identifiable assets and liabilities within Speedy 
Freight. This review resulted in the following assets and liabilities being restated to their fair value on acquisition as presented in the table below:

Cash settlement 4,127
Contingent consideration 2,766
Liability in respect of the put and call 11,855
Total consideration transferred 18,748
Goodwill arising on acquisition 9,242
The goodwill arising on acquisition represents the projected profitability of the acquired business, synergy benefits and the future expected success 
of the well-established and rapid growth franchise. None of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for corporation tax purposes. The fair value 
adjustments are provisional. 
The contingent consideration reflects management’s best estimate of the cash expected to be payable at future dates based on the latest forecast 
information and is dependent upon the business meeting future targets. The amount recorded as contingent consideration on the first 50% is 
£2.766m. The liability in respect of the put and call for the second 50% is £11.855m. There is a variable element to both payments, however the 
outcome will be a minimum overall payment of £13.2m or a higher payment as a consequence of a calculation that takes earnings before interest 
and tax (EBIT) and applies a multiple across a range of different measurement points. 
The purchase agreement also contains good leaver and bad leaver provisions, in order to protect the Group’s interests which have a ceiling and floor 
in the calculations. The difference between consideration payable under the good leaver and bad leaver calculations is treated as remuneration and 
will be recorded in the income statement over the put and call option period. A charge of £0.94m has been recorded in the year, classified as an 
exceptional item, along with the other transaction costs associated with the acquisition (see note 5).
The fair value adjustments arose primarily as a consequence of a purchase price allocation exercise using a recognised third party and undertaken in 
accordance with IFRS 3 and IAS 38, in addition to adjustments made to receivables provisioning and the timing of the recognition of costs. Fair 
values used in the acquisition of the above business interests are provisional until a period of 12 months from the date of acquisition has elapsed 
whereupon they become final. 67

6. Acquisitions continued 
c. Canute
On 7 August 2017 the Group entered into a business purchase agreement between Eddie Stobart Limited and Canute Haulage Group Limited for 
certain assets and liabilities consisting of 38 tractors and tankers, 53 trailers, approximately 50 employees (administrative and drivers); a licence to 
occupy a Brentwood Essex business address and all the Canute policies and protocols, under a business purchase agreement. 
The acquisition is strategic to provide a further foothold within the important manufacturing (MIB) business segment and in a location where the 
Group is well placed to substantially improve fleet utilisation. The acquired assets and liabilities were initially recorded at £6m each. The business 
was acquired for consideration of £1, subject to the successful novation or buy out of the lease arrangements.

The goodwill arising on acquisition represents the projected profitability of the acquired business as part of the Eddie Stobart network with enhanced 
possibilities to better utilise the fleet. None of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for corporation tax purposes. The fair value adjustments are provisional.
Transaction costs associated with the acquisition have been recorded directly to the income statement, classified as exceptional costs (note 4).
The fair value adjustments arose as a result of a revaluation of the property plant, and equipment to market value. 
d. TLP Holdings Limited
On 30 August 2017 AHL Anglia Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 50% share capital of TLP 
Holdings Limited (“TLP"), having acquired the initial 50% of TLP's shares in January 2016. TLP provides driver related services and is expected to 
support the Group with its anticipated growth plans, primarily through the recruitment of drivers for the Group’s fleet. 
The total consideration payable for the remaining 50% of TLP's share capital comprised an initial cash payment of £5,050m and contingent 
consideration of up to £2m, based upon the business meeting future targets. The contingent consideration is measurable over the following three 
years and is in place to incentivise management to achieve strong commercial results. The entirety of the contingent consideration is linked directly 
to the recipient’s future employment will therefore be accounted for as remuneration and recorded directly in the Income Statement, with £0.4m 
recognised during the year ending 30 November 2017. 
Transaction costs associated with the acquisition have been recorded directly in the income statement (note 5).

Total Directors’ remuneration 908 234
The aggregate amount of remuneration paid to or receivable by directors of the Company during the financial year (including the current directors 
and those who resigned at or before the IPO) was £8.1m (2016: £234k), of which the aggregate value of any Company contributions paid or payable 
to a pension scheme, whether as a cash allowance or otherwise, was £62k (2016: £13k). This figure includes individual cash bonuses paid in 
conjunction with the IPO that were fully funded by Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Limited, the ultimate parent prior to the IPO, from the proceeds 
of sale of shares placed in the IPO. There was no economic or financial consequence for the Company or any member of the Group in connection 
with the payment of these individual cash bonuses.

allowance in lieu of a pension contribution. 
* None of the directors have received cash under any incentive arrangement in the financial ended 30 November 2017. Awards under the MIP were granted to A Laffey and D Harte in the financial

* An adjustment in respect of prior periods was made following an updated view concerning the future tax deductibility of the brand intangible.
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% became effective from 1 April 2017. The rate reduction to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 
has been substantively enacted and therefore the standard rate of corporation tax for the year ended 30 November 2017 was 19.33% (2016: 20.0%). 
Following a review of the expected maturity profile of the deferred tax liability a rate of 17% has been applied at 30 November 2017 (2016: 17%).
Factors that may affect future tax expenses
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets in respect of trading losses with a tax value of £0.9m (2016: £1.2m) in the UK and therefore, to the 
extent that these losses may be used against profits arising in future periods, the effective tax rate on these profits may be reduced. Other than 
certain items noted in the tax reconciliation above, there are no other significant factors that may affect future tax expenses.
11. Dividends
At the date of approving these financial statements, no final dividend has been approved. However, the Directors have recommended a final

12. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable 
to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the potentially dilutive instruments into ordinary shares.

14. Goodwill and Intangible Assets continued
Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life because there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which it is expected to generate net cash 
inflows for the Group. Factors taken into consideration in this judgement are the long period over which the business has been established, the 
strength of brand awareness and the longevity of the industries in which the business is involved.
A summary of the movement and the value of goodwill additions during the year is detailed below.

A description of goodwill acquired is provided in note 6. During the year a reclassification of goodwill in the Ports cash generating unit (CGU)  
to General Transport occurred to reflect the way the business is now being managed. In the initial consideration of whether Ports was a separate  
CGU in 2014, management factored in the independence of the local leadership team, the self-run fleet, differing work practices and contracts  
and the non-harmonised financial and operating systems. As part of the strategic transformation of the Group to a customer oriented approach, 
organisationally structured into sectors, a number of changes have been made which have had a consequential impact on the definition of the Ports 
CGU. All employee contracts have been changed to Eddie Stobart terms and conditions, assets are now considered to be fully shared, services are 
provided centrally and full integration from a previously autonomous organisation into one which is run by a Sector Director has been achieved. 
Management have therefore deemed it appropriate to reclassify the Ports CGU into the General Transport CGU.
Annual test for impairment
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill and other intangibles are allocated to business segments the lowest level at which those assets are 
monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined from value-in-use calculations. 
The value-in-use calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management for year one and cash flow 
projections for years two to five using growth rates that are considered to be in line with the general trends in which each CGU operates, with the 
exception of iForce and Speedy Freight, with both businesses expected to achieve rapid growth over the following 2-5 years. Terminal cash flows are 
based on these five year projections, assumed to grow perpetually at 2.5%. In accordance with IAS 36, the growth rates for beyond the forecasted 
five years do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industry. The key assumptions forming inputs to the cash flows are revenues and 
operating cash flows. Margins have been assumed to remain broadly at existing levels and management remain confident of delivering on these 
plans. However in the event that this plan is not delivered, there is a future risk of impairment. All forecasts have been discounted at a post-tax 
discount rate of 8.8% (2016: 12.0%), with the decrease during the year representing the lower cost of debt, a reduced risk free rate and a favourable 
size premium. No impairment losses have been recognised in the year.
Sensitivity
All of the CGUs are sensitive to the discount rate and projected margins. However, management believes that no reasonable adjustment to the 
discount rate or projected margins would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount. 76

All joint ventures have a reporting year end of 31 December. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption to produce additional financial 
statements for those joint ventures whose financial year end is not co-terminus with the Group Financial year. IAS 27 allows the use of an alternative 
financial year end date for joint ventures on the basis that it would be impractical to align the joint venture year end as it is currently aligned to the 
year end of the other parties participating in the joint venture. Under IAS 27 we are required to make adjustment to the financial statements for any 
significant transactions or events that may arise at the date of signing these statements. No such adjustments are necessary. 
During the financial year, the Group received dividends of £416,000 (2016: £nil).

Loan notes
On 27 April 2017 the loan notes of £33.9m (30 November 2016: £32.3m) were repaid to Greenwhitestar Holding Company 2. 
Borrowing facilities
On 13 April 2017, the Group signed a senior facility agreement with a new syndicate of lenders, providing a finance facility of £100.0m with 
associated fees of £2.7m. The facility which is secured on shares in the subsidiaries of the Group, and is subject to a variable rate of interest and 
certain conditions, is repayable in full in April 2022. On 25 April 2017, the Group drew down the full finance facility of £100.0m and repaid the previous 
finance facility of £139.0m. The residual capitalised bank fees associated with the previous facility of £6.6m were taken directly to the Income 
Statement and have been classified as an exceptional item.
Included in the analysis above are financing fees of £2.7m on the new facility at 30 November 2017 (30 November 2016: £7.3m), which have been 
netted against the principal term loans outstanding. During the period refinancing fees of £1.0m (30 November 2016: £1.7m) were amortised through 
the Consolidated Income Statement. 
In the UK, the Group has access to a revolving invoice discounting finance facility of up to £75.0m (31 May 2016: £50.0m) though normally restricted 
to £65.0m (31 May 2016: £40.0m), which is dependent upon and secured against assets within the Group. The facility is subject to a variable rate of 
interest and is in place until 2021.
 
The Group has finance facilities in Belgium which are secured against assets in that region and comprise an overdraft of €1.5m, subject to a variable 
rate of interest and available over seven years to 2021, and a loan of €3.0m, subject to a fixed rate of interest and repayable in equal quarterly 
instalments to 2021. During the year a new facility of €1.5m has been agreed at a fixed rate of interest and repayable in equal quarterly instalments to 
2021. The facilities are secured against specific assets in the Group. 79

Financial risks and capital management
Through its operations, the Group is exposed to the following financial risks:
• Funding and liquidity risk
• Credit risk from trade receivables 
• Interest rate cash flow risk from variable rate bank loans
• Foreign exchange risk
In the process of managing these financial risks, the Group uses the following financial instruments:
• Cash at bank
• Bank loans
• Trade receivables, including amounts owed by associates and joint ventures
• Trade and other payables, including amounts owed to associates and joint ventures
• Finance leases and hire purchase agreements
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on reducing financial risk as far as possible and therefore seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The policies and strategies for managing specific financial risks are summarised as follows:
(i) Funding and liquidity risk
The Group finances its operations by a combination of equity, bank loans, leases, working capital and retained profits. The Group undertakes 
short-term cash forecasting to monitor its expected cash flows against its cash availability and finance facilities. The Group also undertakes 
longer-term cash forecasting to monitor its expected funding requirements in order to meet its current business plan, in the context of its existing  80
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 30 November 2017
21. Financial Assets and Liabilities continued
facilities and to identify any requirement for future funding facilities. The Group monitors its current and forecast financial performance against its 
banking covenants to ensure that it remains compliant with their requirements. The Group also maintains an active dialogue with a wide range of 
finance providers in order to ensure that it is aware of all possible sources of finance when it is assessing the availability and cost of providing for the 
funding requirements in the current business plan.
ii) Credit risk
The Group’s principal exposure to credit risk is in its trade receivables arising from credit sales. A large proportion of the Group’s trade receivables 
are covered by insurance, with £42.5m covered at 30 November 2017 (2016: £34.7m). In accordance with this insurance policy and also carried out 
as Group policy in other uninsured credit sales, the Group carries out procedures to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering into new 
contracts, sets credit limits accordingly and monitors outstanding receivables balances in accordance with these. The Board places significant 
emphasis on credit control and any changes in debtor payment profiles are identified and acted upon. The age profile of outstanding trade debtors 
as at 30 November 2017 is shown in note 17, together with associated provisions against recoverability, which gives an indication of the level of 
credit risk to which the Group is exposed.
(iii) Interest rate cash flow risk
Some of the Group’s borrowings are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to interest rate cash flow risk. The Group’s exposure to floating 
rate interest is modelled in its budgets and forecasts. The Group’s principal strategy is to manage its treasury position to reduce borrowing 
requirements and therefore its exposure to interest cost. As such, the current exposure to volatility in interest rates is limited and the Group estimates 
that a rise of 0.5% in interest rates would have reduced pre-tax profits by approximately £607,000 for the year ended 30 November 2017 (2016: 
£180,000 pre-tax profits).
(iv) Foreign exchange risk
The Company’s functional currency is Pound Sterling. The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk, primarily with 
respect to the Euro. Due to the significant degree of natural hedging arising from purchases and receipts in Euros, which largely mitigates the 
transactional and financial reporting foreign exchange risk, the Board does not currently seek to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk. The 
Group estimates that a 5% weakening of the Euro from the year end exchange rate would decrease net assets by approximately £596,000 (2016: 
£1,220,000 decrease in net assets).
Capital management
Capital comprises share capital, retained profits and borrowing facilities. The Group’s short to medium-term strategy continues to be to strengthen its 
capital base in order to sustain the future development of the business and therefore the current policy is to reinvest profits rather than recommend 
the payment of dividends. The Group also focuses on the management and control of working capital in order to reduce net debt, whilst allowing for 
capital investment in assets for the future development of the business. The Group has also secured finance facilities that contain sufficient 
headroom to allow for business growth in the event that market volumes significantly increase or incremental turnover is obtained through organic 
growth or acquisition.

Ordinary share capital, share premium and merger reserve
Prior to the IPO, the Company performed a share split, with the consequence that ordinary share capital reduced from £1 par value to 1p par value 
per share. Also prior to the IPO, share premium was cancelled in order to convert into distributable reserves. A bonus issue of shares was granted to 
the current shareholders at the same time.
On 25 April 2017 the Company placed 76.25m ordinary 1p shares with an attached merger reserve of 159p per share (the total listing price being 
160p per share) on AIM.
The Company also issued 5m Ordinary 1p Shares, with an attached share premium of 159p per share total value (160p per share) to the 
shareholders of iForce Group for their interests in the business (note 6).
Own shares
Included in the total number of ordinary shares outstanding above are 1,690,000 (2016: Nil) Ordinary Shares held by the Group’s employee benefit 
trust. The Ordinary Shares held by the trustee of the Group’s employee benefit trust pursuant to the SIP are treated as Own shares in the 
Consolidated and Company’s Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS 32. 
Nature and purpose of reserves
i. Translation reserve – represents the gains and losses arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into Sterling. When a foreign 
operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to 
that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
ii. Own share reserve – This reserve arose when the Group issued equity share capital under its Share Incentive Plan (SIP) which is held in trust by 
the trustee of the Group’s benefit trust. If these shares are forfeited throughout the vesting period for leavers or other reasons, they will continue to 
be owned by the trust and continue to be presented within Own Share in the Group financial statements.
iii. Share option reserves – consist of provisions made during the financial year relating to Long-Term Incentive and Management Incentive Plans for 
future liabilities relating to management and employee share based incentive schemes payments, further details are disclosed in note 25. 
iv. Hedge reserve – the hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of hedging instruments used in 
cash flow hedges pending subsequent recognition of the hedged cash flows and was closed out during the process of agreeing a new senior 
facility with the agreement of the syndicate. The movement in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income was £1,546k (2016: £285k). 84

25. Share-based Payments
As at 30 November 2017, the Company operated the following share award plans:
• Long-Term Incentive Plan
• Management Incentive Plan
• Share Incentive Plan
There were no exercisable options under the above schemes as at 30 November 2017 (2016: nil).
Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
The LTIP was approved by the Board on 18 April 2017 enabling the Group to award options on shares to key employees following admission to the 
London Stock Exchange. Awards were granted during the year giving award holders the right to exercise nil-out options at the end of the three year 
period from the date of the award, dependent on;
• The level of growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the year ended 30 November 2017 of £56.8m
• Achievement of 10% compound growth in the total shareholder return (TSR) over the period from the date of admission to trading on the London 
Stock Exchange (25th April 2017) to the third anniversary of admission
The fair value of options granted during the period was determined on a Log-normal Monte-Carlo Stochastic model. Using an initial price, a 
simulation of a large number of share paths was undertaken that followed the geometric Brownian motion that calculated a valuation for each path, 
that was then averaged to obtain an overall valuation for two key outputs:
• The simulated share price at the vesting date
• The intrinsic value of the LTIP shares
IFRS 2 states that there is present obligation to settle in cash if:
• The choice of settlement in equity has no commercial substance
• The Company has a past practice or stated policy of settling in cash
• The entity generally settles in cash whenever the counterparty requests cash settlement
For the Group, none of the above apply and there is no assumed obligation to settle in cash, consequently the LTIP award will be treated as equity 
settled for this valuation. The LTIP award also gives rise to post-vesting restriction on the shares for a period of 12 months from the date of issue to 
participators or the fourth anniversary of the granting of the LTIP , whichever is the earliest.
Under IFRS 2 there is a requirement to consider post-vesting restrictions to be incorporated in calculating the fair value for the LTIP award; as shares in 
the Company are traded on the London Stock Exchange, the restriction would have a negligible effect on the price that a knowledgeable and willing 
market participant would pay for the shares and as such no adjustment to the fair value of the LTIP shares has been calculated. This valuation has been 
calculated and provided by an independent third party who have advised the Executive Board of the fair value and future LTIP obligations as follows:
Number of shares under option granted – 707,000
Fair Value as calculated per option – 94.9 pence
Total value of options – £670,943

Management incentive plan (MIP)
The MIP was approved by the Board on 25th April 2017. The Company entered into arrangements with the two participants Alex Laffey and Damien 
Harte, who subscribed for A1 Ordinary Shares in Greenwhitestar Acquisitions Limited, a subsidiary of the company at £0.65p per share and 25,000  
A2 Ordinary Shares at £2.00 per share (MIP Shares). Participants have the right to sell all of their MIP Shares to the Company at the end of the three 
year period from the date of the award. The Company also has a corresponding call right at the end of this period. The date on which this right is 
exercised is referred to as the Exercise Date.
The Company, at its discretion, may purchase the MIP Shares for cash or by issuing ordinary shares in the Company. Where participants receive 
ordinary shares in the Company, the MIP participants are restricted from selling 50% of their allotment for a 12 month period from the date of issue or 
the fourth anniversary of the MIP Share issue whichever is earliest. 85
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
25. Share-based Payments continued
Performance conditions
The value of the MIP Shares on the Exercise Date, in aggregate, will be 8% of the increase in the Company’s share price above a share price hurdle 
multiplied by the number of issued share capital at the date of Admission. The share price will be based on the 90 day average price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares.
The hurdle is set at a premium of 10% above the placing price of a share in the Company on Admission and the hurdle will increase on a compound 
basis by 10% per annum for the three years from the date the MIP Shares were issued. Based on the above, the hurdle at the date of Admission is 
equivalent to a market capitalisation of £762m provided no new share issues take place. If for example the market capitalisation on the Exercise Date 
was valued at £862m, the increase in shareholder value above the hurdle of £762m is £100m and it is this figure that is attributable to the 8% MIP 
value of management shares, i.e. £8m.
The fair value of MIP Shares valuations was determined on a Log-normal Monte-Carlo Stochastic model, using an initial price, a simulation of a large 
number of share paths was undertaken that followed the geometric Brownian motion which calculated a valuation for each path, that was then 
averaged to obtain an overall valuation using similar type of companies operating in the same sector as the Company as a benchmark group to 
evaluate the comparative market capitalisation performance condition.
This simulation was performed over a large number of share paths and the valuation provided three key outputs:
• The simulated share price at the Exercise Date
• The 90 day average share price at the Exercise Date
• The intrinsic value of the MIP Shares
The MIP scheme may be settled in cash or shares at the discretion of the company and IFRS 2 states that there is present obligation to settle in cash if;
• The choice of settlement in equity has no commercial substance
• The company has a past practice or stated policy of settling in cash
• The entity generally settles in cash whenever the counterparty requests cash settlement
For the Company, none of the above apply and there is no assumed obligation to settle in cash, consequently the MIP award will be treated as equity 
settled for this valuation and the plan also gives rise to post-vesting restriction on the shares for a period of 12 months from the date of issue to 
participants or the fourth anniversary of the granting of the MIP Shares, whichever is the earliest.
Under IFRS 2 there is a requirement to consider post-vesting restrictions to be incorporated in calculating the fair value for the MIP Shares; as shares 
in the Company are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange, the restriction would have a negligible effect on the price that a 
knowledgeable and willing market participant would pay for the shares and as such no adjustment to the fair value of the MIP Shares has been 
calculated. This valuation has been calculated and provided by an independent third party who has advised management of the fair value of future 
MIP obligations as follows;

Share incentive plan (SIP)
The SIP was approved by the Board on 25th April 2017. The SIP is an equity settled share incentive plan approved by HMRC. The purpose of the SIP 
is to be a free share issue to staff fully funded by funds from the outgoing parent shareholder. The SIP shares are held in trust by independent third 
party trustees of specified employees, but may be forfeited during a three year period that commenced from 30 June 2017 in certain circumstances.
The number of shares held in trust are 1,687,500 Ordinary £0.01p shares at a cost £1.60 per share with a market value of £2.7m. All of the shares 
were fully paid for by the outgoing parent shareholder. The employees who participated in the SIP are the Company’s Executive Directors and 
employees, including the employees of the Company’s subsidiaries, as at 30 June 2017.
The SIP also allows for the extension of the SIP to allow additional employees to participate at the Board’s discretion.

Eddie Stobart Logistics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1. Basis of Accounting
Eddie Stobart Logistics Plc is a public limited company incorporated in England. The results of the Company are included in the consolidated 
accounts of Eddie Stobart Logistics Plc which are available from Stretton Green Distribution Park, Langford Way, Appleton, Warrington, Cheshire 
WA4 4TQ, United Kingdom. These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its 
Group. The separate financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (“FRS 101) and the Companies Act 2006.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“ Adopted IFRSs”) but makes adjustments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006.
In April 2017, the Company listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and adopted International Reporting Standards (IFRS) for Group 
Reporting. The Company has made the transition from IFRS and adopted UK Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 101 Reduced Disclosure Standard 
as the basis for company reporting in these financial statements. There is no requirement to restate the Financial Statements for the adoption of 
FRS101 from IFRS for company reporting. The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
• Company cash flow statement and related notes
• Disclosure in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries
• Disclosures in respect of capital management 
• The effects of new but not effective IFRS’s
• Disclosure in respect of the compensation of key management personnel 
As the Consolidated Financial Statements of Eddie Stobart Logistics Plc include equivalent disclosures, the Company has taken exemptions under 
FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: 
• Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair value measurement
• Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial instrument disclosures
• Share based payments – IFRS 2 is being applied to equity instruments 
The accounts are presented in Sterling rounded to the nearest thousand.
 
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
2. Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies adopted by the Company are consistent with those used in the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements as set out on 
pages 50 to 57, except for the following items which are only relevant for the Company as a stand alone entity.
Judgements and key sources of estimation
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The principal judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial 
statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed below:
• IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’. In testing for impairment of investments in, and amounts due from, subsidiary undertakings, the Directors have 
made certain assumptions concerning the future development of its subsidiary businesses that are consistent with their annual budgets and 
forecasts into perpetuity. Should these assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then it is possible that 
investments in, or amounts due, from subsidiary under-takings included in the balance sheet could be impaired. 
• IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’. The Company has issued equity settled share-based payments to certain employees in exchange for services 
rendered by them. The fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is recognised as an employee expense 
over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, with a corresponding increase in equity. This valuation is 
based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually vest, based on related service and non-market vesting conditions that are 
expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related 
service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised and in any of the future periods affected.
Investments and amounts owed by Group undertakings
The Company’s investments in shares in Group companies and amounts owed by Group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents
In the Statement of Financial Position, cash includes cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts.

Ordinary share capital, share premium and merger reserve

per share. Also prior to the IPO, share premium was cancelled in order to convert into distributable reserves. A bonus issue of shares was granted to 
the current shareholders at the same time.
On 25 April 2017 the Company placed 76.25m ordinary 1p shares with an attached merger reserve of 159p per share (the total listing price being 
160p per share) on AIM.
The Company also issued 5m Ordinary 1p Shares, with an attached share premium of 159p per share total value (160p per share) to the 
shareholders of iForce Group for their interests in the business (note 6). 94

Included in the total number of ordinary shares outstanding above are 1,690,000 (2016: Nil) Ordinary Shares held by the Group’s employee benefit 
trust. The Ordinary Shares held by the trustee of the Group’s employee benefit trust pursuant to the SIP are treated as Own shares in the

continue to be presented within Own Share in the Group financial statements.
