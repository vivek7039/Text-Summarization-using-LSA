Chairman’s 
Statement
Results and strategic progress
Crawshaw Group has experienced a challenging 
year but, once the causes of the declining like-for-like 
sales were established, management made rapid 
changes that clearly resonated with customers. As 
a result, we have finished the year with some really 
encouraging sales and margin momentum. As noted 
in our Interim Results, during our period of rapid 
growth, the number of proposition changes we asked 
customers to embrace and a combination of the well 
documented external factors caused a significant 
drop in the trading momentum of the core business 
from the end of H1 and start of H2. The management 
team acted quickly and carefully to restore this 
momentum. This was achieved with a programme 
of broader and deeper promotions and giving back 
the store managers more flexibility to trade their local 
shop to suit their local customers. We are pleased with 
the recent improved trading performance and are 
very encouraged by the momentum that has been 
built up throughout H2, which was reflected in our 
Christmas T rading Update.
The level of sales performance in our like-for-like 
estate necessitated a reduction in the rate of new 
store openings, to both free up management time 
to recover sales in the legacy estate and to maintain 
the strength of the balance sheet. We opened 11 new 
stores in the year (9 in H1 and 2 in H2) and this takes 
the total organic growth so far to 17. In the period,  
one of our legacy market shops closed as part of a 
council town centre regeneration scheme resulting  
in an estate of 49 stores at 29 January 2017.
 
In the period under review, the Group delivered total 
sales of £44.2m, an increase of 19%. This converted to 
an Adjusted EBITDA of £1.3m (2016: £2.6m) as lower 
sales and subsequent margin investment temporarily 
reduced the EBITDA generation of the legacy business. 
The Group made a loss before tax of £1.4m (2016: loss 
of £0.3m).
Cash
The cash position of the business continues to be 
robust with £2.1m cash on hand at the year-end (2016: 
£4.9m) with the pace of new store rollout and levels of 
central resource all being balanced with maintaining a 
strong balance sheet. The reduction in cash is entirely 
growth plan driven with £2.9m of capital expenditure 
invested in new stores in the year. The cash generated 
from operations funded payment of the final dividend 
declared last year.
“The performance of the business has now 
been stabilised, having restored the level  
of sales and customer numbers”
Outlook
I have been very impressed by the way Noel and 
the management team have carefully but swiftly 
taken the appropriate corrective actions during this 
challenging period. For this reason, the performance 
of the business has now been stabilised, having 
restored the level of sales and customer numbers 
respectively. Coupled with the expected recovery in 
margin and the full benefit of the cost saving actions 
flowing through, the business has returned to positive 
cash generation.
Crawshaw has demonstrated its ability to manage a 
major change agenda in parallel with evaluating the 
ongoing potential of our store rollout programme. 
We therefore remain encouraged and confident in 
the scalability of the model, and with the business 
returning to a cash generative position, we look to 
continue with a disciplined opening programme.  
As noted in our Interim Results, of particular interest 
and significance is the strength of performance of  
our fresh meat factory shops. Whilst we remain 
completely committed to the high street, shopping 
centre and market location stores, the factory shop 
concept is proving to deliver significantly better 
financial returns with its higher sales, lower operating 
costs (no hot food-to-go offer) and lower fit out costs. 
The two new factory shops that opened in the year 
have further demonstrated the success of the concept 
which has helped shape our thoughts for the rollout 
strategy for the year ahead. And so our store rollout 
program will focus on this concept.
Since the end of the financial year, the business has 
continued to improve, with Group sales up 9% and 
LFL sales of -4.6% in the first ten weeks. We have also 
signed the lease on another factory shop unit which 
we expect to be trading by the end of May, and have 
a number of opportunities in the pipeline to open 
across the rest of this financial year.
The Board are committed to ensuring cash is available 
to fund the growth strategy and maintaining a strong 
balance sheet. In line with this, the Board has decided 
that no dividend payment will be made at this time

Officer’s Review
“Our managers and butchers continue to be 
the ambassadors of putting their customers 
at the heart of our local strategy”
Performance and operational review
Whilst we made considerable progress in the year 
with the store rollout programme by adding a further 
11 new stores to the estate, we have been very 
disappointed by the like-for-like sales performance as 
some of the price and range initiatives didn’t resonate 
with customers as we had expected. 
In preparing the core business to be ready for 
accelerated expansion and creating the store 
rollout blue print, we made a number of changes to 
standardise the new store concept on range, price 
point, how the stores were operated and how the 
stores looked. These principles worked well for our 
new stores, but when retrospectively introduced into 
our established stores, we learned it was too much 
change for our customers and colleagues. This was 
reflected in the shape of our sales performance during 
June and July at the end of H1.
As a result, we prioritised our focus in the second 
half of the year to listening to colleagues and 
customers, and the feedback from them was relatively 
straightforward. Our customers wanted to see some 
of the old fresh meat pack sizes, price points and 
offers that were previously on sale in their specific 
store. This feedback was positioned at the heart of 
our sales recovery programme and helped shape 
the refinements we set about achieving to provide 
our managers with the necessary ‘freedom within a 
framework’ plan to win back their local customers.
T o ensure that all areas of our business were 
completely focused on delivering the sales 
recovery programme effectively, it was important 
to temporarily pause the store rollout programme 
and provide full support to our store colleagues. 
During the implementation of our ‘freedom within 
a framework’ plan, we reviewed our head office 
organisation structure and removed a number of roles. 
The changes were implemented responsibly giving  
us the central support structure for the year ahead.
Having successfully landed our major change agenda, 
we now believe we have the right operational balance 
between the disciplined framework required as a 
platform for rollout with enough freedom for store 
managers to react to local customer requirements. 
This positive progress has also been reflected in the 
shape and momentum build of our sales performance 
in the lead up to and through the key festive trading 
period at the end of H2.
In summary, we have seen a direct correlation 
between the initiatives introduced in the summer 
and the timing of the steady and continuous 
improvement in like-for-like sales. As previously 
communicated, this improvement in both sales 
and customer number momentum has required 
a moderate level of margin investment. With the 
improvement continuing through the festive trading 
period, we were pleased to be cash generative again 
by the end of the year, in line with our expectations.
Group Revenue
For the 52 weeks to 29 January 2017, Group revenue 
increased by 19% from £37.1m to £44.2m. This growth 
was supported by contributions from our 11 new 
stores in the year. LFL sales were -7.3% for the full year, 
with H1 like-for-like sales being -4.4% and H2 like-for-
like sales being -10.1%. These numbers reflect the 
shape of the key challenging period we experienced 
during June and October 2016, and as outlined in  
this review.
Group sales in the first 10 weeks of the new financial 
year increased by +9% and like-for-like sales were 
-4.6% for the same period.
Strategic focus
We have continued to build on our strategic plan of 
‘providing safe, good quality fresh meat for the value 
conscious consumer’ , which has been reinforced 
through the customer proposition in the last 6 
months. The customer numbers and feedback 
confirm that we are back on track and will therefore 
continue with this journey and approach.
 
Fresh meat
Our managers and butchers continue to be the 
ambassadors of putting their customers at the heart of 
our local strategy, and this is reinforced with their local 
level freedom to delight their customers through the 
fresh meat offer. Our stores continue to develop local 
products specific to their community, provide local 
special offers, as demonstrated with our successful 
Christmas Hampers and the planned new BBQ packs 
for the warmer months ahead. We are maintaining 
the number and depth of price-led promotions which 
also rotate at the managers’ discretion. Furthermore, 
we have recently introduced a new store trial of a 
£4.99 value pack under the umbrella of ‘ once it’ s gone, 
it’ s gone’ concept, consisting of great value fresh meat 
packs with value cut-through in POS labelling. The 
customer’ s reaction to this ‘treasure-trove’ concept has 
been extremely positive.
With our production and distribution capability now 
set up to service up to c.100 stores, we continue to 
develop our award-winning quality homemade 
produce and broaden the range of burgers, sausages, 
meatballs, kebabs, grill sticks and mince in time for the 
spring/summer. In addition, with this new capability 
in mind, we are looking to leverage the spare capacity 
through expanding our wholesale operations. T o 
date, we have taken on the supply of a local 3-strong 
chain of local steakhouse restaurants and will consider 
the opportunities of similar scale relationships. This 
allows us to pick up business which better utilises 
the fixed assets we’ve already invested in without 
compromising our ability to serve our stores and 
customers.
Food-to-go
Within the food-to-go category, the same level 
of local customer focus continues to be applied 
by our managers and trained cooks. Our teams 
have reintroduced a number of store specific 
favourite dishes to the ‘Butcher’ s Kitchen’ menu and 
continuously test new dishes/recipes with input from 
their customers. This provides the perfect platform 
to showcase the quality of our fresh meat produce, 
presented to the customers freshly cooked and  
ready-to-go. Furthermore, we have successfully 
introduced the principles of our legendary multibuy 
offers from the fresh meat category to the food-
to-take-home freshly cooked joints category. This 
provides customers with a great choice of meal 
occasion, such as cooked whole chickens, chicken 
portions, pork loins, gammon joints and ham shanks. 
These are all cooked fresh daily in store using our 
in-house rotisserie and rationale ovens, and sold at 
unit prices, mix-and-match multibuys or catchweights, 
depending on customer requirement. Encouragingly, 
these initiatives have already contributed to an 
increase in customer numbers and sales.
In addition to these exciting fresh meat and  
food-to-go opportunities, which continue to 
anchor our value credentials, we have stepped 
up our marketing activity to maintain our current 
momentum in building customer frequency and 
loyalty.
Customer driven marketing incentives
T o build on the existing customer number 
momentum, we are investing in new ways to achieve 
customer acquisitions whilst working hard to maintain 
and lock-in existing customer loyalty. As a wider team, 
we have identified Facebook as the most successful 
route to get access to a new customer base and the 
VIP Club/Newsletter route to incentivise customers  
to keep coming back.
Social media
In addition to the Corporate Facebook Page, we have 
now introduced and trialled store-specific Facebook 
Pages in 11 stores (5 factory shops and 6 high street). 
All pages are administered by the local management, 
meaning the content is much more tailored, timely 
and relevant to the customer (when compared 
to a centrally managed approach). All stores have 
benefitted from their Facebook launch and customer 
numbers have increased, although it is worth noting 
the high level of success seen in the factory shops as 
more and more customers begin to build a visit to the 
destination factory shop into their routine. Crawshaw Group Plc
Annual Report           52 weeks  ended 29 January 201 7
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 05
Crawshaws VIP
As part of the Facebook launch, we have also 
introduced the ‘Crawshaws VIP Club’ into 4 stores 
(2 factory shops and 2 high street). This allows our 
managers to build up awareness on Facebook, then 
incentivise the customers into the store to sign up for 
the VIP Club to then benefit from a host of exclusive 
special offers and flash sales.
Newsletter
Once customers are signed up to the VIP Club, our 
managers then have the capability to communicate 
via email with a regular newsletter containing new 
products to the range, new special offers or even 
an invitation to take part in new schemes, such as 
‘recommend-a-friend’ .
We are very pleased with the results from the 
recent marketing initiatives and this acts as a very 
positive step-change in customer engagement 
and participation. The customer data capture also 
allows our managers to really target their local offers 
relevant to their local community.
People
Great quality meat products alone will not succeed 
in our industry without great people delivering great 
customer service and experience. And whilst it has 
been a challenging year for everyone in the business, 
the speed of our recovery and stability would not 
have been possible without their input, tremendous 
attitude and commitment. I continue to be very 
proud and impressed by their passion to deliver 
amazing value to our customers every day.
FY 2017 new store performance
We opened 11 new stores in the year of which 6 
were high street, 3 were in shopping centres and 2 
were factory shop locations. From a geographical 
perspective, 7 were in our traditional areas in the 
North and North West and 4 were in the Midlands, 
with all 11 stores opening on time and on budget.  
As would be expected as we have opened more 
stores, there is a wider spread of performance  
against our base case targets and expectations.  
We have a number of stores that have opened well 
and are trading in line with our expectations, equally  
we have a number of stores which are not trading 
 as strongly as anticipated, and encouragingly we 
have a number of stores which have traded well  
ahead of expectations from opening day. Based  
on the learnings and performance of our new  
stores, we remain very encouraged by the potential 
and opportunity of our store rollout programme.  
FY 2018 growth plan
As noted in the Interims, of particular interest and 
significance is the performance of our standalone 
fresh meat factory shops. Our 5 fresh meat factory 
shops sell predominantly fresh meat (no hot food-
to-go offer) and have higher sales, lower operating 
costs and lower fit out costs than our units on the 
high street and in shopping centres. They are also 
much simpler to operate and manage. Whilst our 
location and format strategy has always been one 
of operating a diverse portfolio across high streets, 
shopping centres and factory shop locations, having 
tested the predictability of the factory shop concept 
and fully appraised the opportunity, we believe it to 
be very logical and sensible that this should shape 
the rollout programme for 2017.
Sales recovery programme
1. A flexible commercial framework – 
 store managers
• Rebuilding some of the core decision making  
 processes at store level and empowering   
 store staff to respond to changes in local  
 customer needs. 
• Increased the number and depth of value-led  
 promotions (hero lines) for managers to   
 choose the promotions that resonate most  
 with their customers.
• Focus on delivering a great ‘butcher’s’   
 customer service.
• Continue to rebuild more local supplier   
 relationships. 
2. Fresh meat – sales momentum initiatives
• Local management input on price-point   
 requirements.
• Freedom on the range and merchandising  
 to satisfy local customer needs.
• Introduction of more weekly store specific  
 value-led promotions.
• Local management to balance the ‘bigger  
 packs, better value’ with ‘small packs, great  
 value’ specific to customer needs.
3. Food-to-go – sales momentum initiatives
• Flexible principles applied to the Butcher’s  
 Kitchen food-to-go menu.
• Reintroduce the ‘old favourites’ specific  
 to local customer needs.
• Introduction of more value-led promotions  
 (e.g. cooked chickens/portions).
• Price roll-back and flexibility for managers  
 to price menu items locally.
• Local supplier flexibility to maximise choice,  
 quality and value.
Customer driven marketing incentives
We will also maintain a disciplined approach to our 
growth strategy, which means it is imperative that 
the pace and timings of the store openings are 
managed correctly. Accordingly, we have signed the 
lease for our next factory shop which is scheduled to 
open in May, with a sufficient pipeline and capability 
to open a further 4 factory shops during FY 2018.
Outlook for 2018
The UK grocery market will remain competitive 
and, with industry-wide pressures emerging in 
commodities and labour costs, the UK consumer 
outlook will continue to be more challenging than 
we have seen in recent years. Whilst we would 
ordinarily expect these to have a modest impact on 
margin in the short term we believe that, with our 
cost management measures and margin additive 
initiatives, together with the expected cost reduction 
in our business rates, we are well placed to navigate 
through this challenging environment. Indeed, it has 
been very encouraging to see that we have already 
proven we are capable and well placed to meet 
multiple challenges simultaneously, whether they 
are internally or externally driven.
This year has started in line with our expectations 
as we continue to build on the momentum and 
improvements from the last 6 months. The recent 
journey has also provided everyone with significant 
experience and learnings that will be extremely 
important in the months and years ahead. Our  
clear value proposition, underpinned by our  
unique vertically integrated concept, remains  
highly differentiated and competitive which we 
believe will further strengthen our retail offering. 
Furthermore, with the performance of our 
standalone factory shops being a real highlight  
of the year, we are very excited at opening more  
of this format.

Revenue and gross profit
T otal revenue for the Group increased by 19% to £44.2m (2016: £37.1m) with the growth from 11 additional 
trading stores in the year being partially offset by the 7.3% decrease in sales experienced in our LFL stores.
Gross profit margins reduced to 43.5% (2016: 45.1%) reflecting a less favourable meat pricing environment and 
an increase in the number and depth of our promotional offers to win back customers. Both of these impacts 
moderated through H2 with the margins being achieved in Q4 being ahead of those achieved in Q3.
Presentation of results
T o present a clear view of performance of the Group in total and the costs directly driven by the growth strategy, 
we present an Underlying Operating (Loss)/Profit number and an Adjusted EBITDA number. The Underlying 
Operating (Loss)/Profit number adds back share based payment charges and exceptional costs to give a clear 
view of underlying Group performance. The Adjusted EBITDA number further excludes depreciation, amortisation 
and accelerated opening costs to give a clear view on the underlying trading performance of the Group – 
Adjusted EBITDA is our primary internal measure when assessing Group performance.
We define accelerated opening costs as the investments in people, processes and systems in the year to provide 
direct support for our accelerated opening programme. In the year, these costs amounted to £1.2m (2016: £1.6m) 
and are analysed by component of spend in the table below.

Loss before tax ‘PBT’ and earnings per share ‘EPS’
The Group delivered a loss before tax of £1.4m (2016: £0.3m loss) as a result of the deterioration in trading 
performance, immature new stores and the additional costs incurred to deliver the growth plan. The Loss Before 
T ax number includes an IFRS 2 shared based payment charge of £0.2m (2016: £0.4m). This translated to a negative 
EPS as expected at (1.535) pence per share (2016: negative 0.342 pence per share).
Operational overheads
Operational overheads are defined as the administrative expenses of the Group less accelerated opening costs, 
exceptional costs, impairment, depreciation and amortisation and share based payments as this gives a clearer 
reflection on the underlying operational costs performance of the Group. On this basis, the ratio of overhead costs 
as a percentage of sales has increased to 41% (2016: 38%). This reflects a dilution from new stores where initial cost 
ratios are higher as the stores trade through their sales maturity profile and the impact of lower LFL sales.
Cash flow
We have closed the year with £2.1m of cash on the balance sheet (2016: £4.9m) having invested £2.9m of CAPEX 
in opening 11 new stores. Maintaining the strength of the balance sheet continues to be a key focus for the Group 
with the appropriate decisions being taken on pace of rollout and investment in central resource.
Summary
It has been a year of considerable change and challenge as we have navigated through some unexpected 
external impacts in addition to experiencing some growing pains from significantly scaling up a small 
entrepreneurial business. We have now achieved a level of stability in the business which allows us to appraise 
and plan for the numerous growth opportunities available to the Group.

Our management team have extensive experience in 
sourcing quality meat products from tried and tested 
local and international suppliers at the lowest possible 
prices. Whilst we do buy longer term to ensure that we 
have a core range of products, we pride ourselves on 
identifying key lines in the spot market that offer value 
to our customers. 
We have our own distribution centres where we 
control additional processing and logistics as well as 
the production of our own award winning sausages, 
beef burgers, beef mince and grill sticks.
Our retail outlets are manned with skilled butchers 
who are happy to help customers with advice on 
choosing the right product, in the right quantities as 
well as how to cook it.
The Board is focussed on growing the business 
through identifying new profitable store locations 
and investing resources in a controlled expansion 
programme, whilst ensuring the core business 
continues to deliver quality products and excellent 
customer service at competitive prices.
• New store locations are regularly reviewed  
 for suitability to grow/replace our existing  
 retail estate.
• New products are researched, tested and  
 trialled frequently.
• Customer feedback is sought and reviewed  
 on an ongoing basis.
• Key price points from competitors are  
 monitored regularly.
• Our food safety management systems are  
 continually reviewed and updated to ensure  
 our procedures are in line with the highest  
 standards.  
As raw meat is a traded commodity, the business 
operates in an environment where input prices 
can fluctuate based on worldwide natural and 
economic factors such as a growing world 
population, climate change, exchange rates  
and changing dietary habits.
The Company’ s purchasing and sales strategy  
is designed to minimise these risks by ensuring  
(i) we sell a broad range of products and in 
particular, as we split into 2 complementary retail 
areas, we cover 2 distinct customer types rather 
than relying on one product, one customer and (ii) 
we use a broad range of tried and tested suppliers 
across the globe rather than relying on any specific 
supplier or region.
Strategy and  
Business Model
Freshly prepared roast 
chickens, gammon and 
pork joints, hot roast 
sandwiches, shop cooked 
curries and casseroles, 
chicken and chips as well 
as other traditional deli 
products.
Hot and cold cooked food 
We have a wide range of 
products sold either (i) loose 
in a serve over counter for 
the traditional experience 
or (ii) as multi buy packs on 
supermarket style multi 
deck counters which have 
all been cut and packaged 
in store. 
Traditional raw meat
Our mission: to use our expertise to source, 
prepare, produce and retail quality fresh meat 
products at a price and a service level that 
continues to delight our customers.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Group continues to 
be the operation of a chain of meat focused retail 
food stores. The Group operates from a head 
office and distribution centre in Rotherham, plus 
49 retail locations across Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, 
Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, the North West and 
the Midlands.
We protect our customers and our brand by 
sourcing quality products with full traceability. 
Further to this we invest continually to ensure 
our food safety management systems are 
implemented, delivered and audited at every 
location.
As the only independent retail butchers chain in 
England to have Primary Authority, we continue  
to work with the Environmental Health department  
at Wakefield Council. This gives each of our 
locations, our staff and our customers a level of 
consistency in food safety matters as we are all 
working to the same standards and interpretations 
of the regulations.
Crawshaws continue to recognise the importance 
of food safety and positive consistent progress 
has continued and our Hygiene Ratings. 71% of 
the business are on 5 stars (Very good) and 20% 
on 4 (Good). Our factories have also consistently 
maintained standards whilst increasing throughput 
to match the increases in sales.
There continues to be ongoing investment 
in training which has not only provided legal 
compliance but has equipped Managers with 
further knowledge and confidence to maintain 
food safety. Customer feedback also indicates 
consistent quality control and that they are happy 
that their needs are being met. 
The maintenance and continued development of 
the company Food Safety Management System 
has been fundamental in maintaining standards 
across the company. Whilst the Company will 
continue to face challenges, including changes in 
legislation, we are focused on maintaining food 
safety on a consistent basis. 
The focus on origin and traceability of products will 
continue to be managed as we recognise this as 
being essential if we are to meet the requirements 
of our customers and continue to supply safe and 
legal products.
Our product range is split into two  
distinct areas:

Risk Management
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group 
include the following:
• EU trade deals and exchange rates post BREXIT
 The Group sources approximately half of the meat 
volumes sold through the business from the EU. 
Any changes to the tariff free trade across current 
members of the EU will require us to review our 
sourcing model. All purchases of goods are made 
in sterling. Both short term volatility and long term 
re-basing of international currency markets will have 
an impact on raw material prices. The flexibility to 
source globally provides a level of mitigation to  
this risk.
• Raw material availability and prices
 The Group monitors raw material sources on a global 
basis and either contracts to buy a set volume of 
goods for a set price for delivering on a specific date 
or contracts to buy a set volume of goods at a set 
price over a short time period, typically from  
2 to 4 weeks.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
• Customer loss and competition
 There is an ongoing risk of customer loss from 
enhanced competition. The Group‘s strategy is 
to maintain customer loyalty through: 1) offering 
consistently high quality products at consistently 
low prices, 2) offering customers even greater 
value through a rolling cycle of deeply discounted 
promotional offers and; 3) delivering superior service 
and product expertise at all times. Competitor 
price points are reviewed regularly to make sure 
customers can rely on us to be significantly cheaper 
than our competitors.
• Food Safety
 Compliance with legislation is continually assessed 
with a rolling monthly internal Food Safety 
compliance audit in each store augmenting the 
annual Environmental Health Office inspections. 
Any performance exceptions are discussed as a 
matter of course at the Monthly Plc Board meeting.
• Environmental risks
 The Group places considerable emphasis upon 
environmental compliance in its business and not 
only seeks to ensure ongoing compliance with 
relevant legislation but also strives to ensure that 
environmental best practice is incorporated into its 
key processes.
• Major disruption/disaster
 Business continuity planning is reviewed regularly.
• The effect of legislation or other regulatory 
activities
 The Group monitors forthcoming and current 
legislation. 
• Shrinkage
 All retailers are exposed to customer and employee 
theft. The Group has a zero tolerance to theft and we 
continually review internal systems and controls. We 
maximise the use of CCTV surveillance in store and 
aim to prosecute where relevant.
Our 2017 Strategic Report from pages IFC to 9 has been

Financial instruments
The Company’s financial risk management objectives can be found in notes 1 9 and 20 to the financial statements.
Creditor payment policy
The Group agrees payment with its trade creditors and other suppliers on an individual contract basis at the time the goods and services are ordered rather than following 
a standard code. The policy is to abide by the agreed terms once satisfied that the goods or services have been provided in accordance with the contract terms and 
conditions. The Group’s average creditor payment period at 31 January 201 7 was 58 days (2016: 59 days).
Employee involvement
The Board recognises that the Group’s performance and success is directly related to our ability to attract, train and motivate high calibre employees. We place considerable  
value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed on matters affecting them as employees and on the various financial and economic 
factors affecting the performance of the Group. 13 Crawshaw Group Plc
Annual Report           52 weeks  ended 29 January 201 7
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Going concern
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out on page 09. For the purposes of their assessment of the preparation of the Group’s accounts  
on a going concern basis, the Directors have considered the current cash position and forecasts of future trading including working capital and investment requirements.
During the year the Group met its day-to-day general corporate and working capital requirements through existing cash resources. At 29 January 201 7 the Group had cash 
on hand of £2. 1 m (2016: £4.9m).
Overall, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks and successful execute the growth strategy. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should have sufficient cash resources to meet its requirements for at least  
the next 1 2 months. Accordingly, the adoption of the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements remains appropriate.
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Group’s auditor is unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is aware of that information. 
Auditor
A resolution to re-appoint KPMG LLP as auditors and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will be put to the members at the forthcoming  
Annual General Meeting.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect  
of the Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock 
Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
– state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and  
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 17 Crawshaw Group Plc

Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 29 January 201 7 and of the Group's loss for the period 
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the financial period for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
• Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and from reading the Strategic report and the Directors’ report:
• We have not identified material misstatements in those reports; and in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the financial statements
(forming part of the Financial Statements)
1. Accounting policies 
Crawshaw Group Plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and equity account the Group’s interest  
in associates and joint ventures. The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its group.
Both the parent company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial 
statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes  
that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The current financial period is a 52 week period to 29 January 201 7 . The prior year was also a 52 week period.
New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations
There have been no significant changes to accounting under IFRS which have affected the Group’s results. The Group has considered the following amendments to 
published standards that are effective for the first time for the 52 weeks ended 29 January 201 7 and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Group or they do  
not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements. These amendments are:
• Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’;
• Amendments to IFRS 1 1 ‘Joint arrangements’ on accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations;
• Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Plant, property and equipment’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’ on acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation;
• Amendments to IAS 27 ‘Consolidation and separate financial statements’ which allows entities to equity account for joint ventures and associates in their separate 
financial statements; and
• Annual improvements 201 2-2014.
There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that are effective for financial statements after this reporting period. These are:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was published in July 2014 and will be effective for the Group from the period beginning 1 February 2018. The standard is applicable to 
financial assets and financial liabilities, and covers the classification, measurement, impairment and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities together 
with a new hedge accounting model. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
• IFRS 1 5 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ will be effective or the Group from the period beginning 1 February 2018, replacing IAS 18 ‘Revenue,’ IAS 1 1 
‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard establishes a principles based approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of 
recognising revenue when a customer obtains control of a good or service and has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the goods or services. It 
applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards. It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts 
under the current accounting standards. Group believes that the adoption of IFRS 1 5 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was published in January 2016 and will be effective for the Group from the period beginning 1 February 201 9, replacing IAS 1 7 ‘Leases,’ subject to EU 
endorsement. The standard requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 1 2 months or less or the underlying asset is of low 
value. IFRS 16 represents a significant change in the accounting and reporting of leases and it will primarily change the balance sheet as well as impacting the income 
statement and lessee reporting as disclosed in note 22. The Group is in the process of quantifying the impact of the new standard. The new standard is likely to have an 
impact on the Group’s results and a material impact on the balance sheet, as the majority of arrangements that are currently accounted for as operating leases will come 
onto the Group’s balance sheet. However, it is not yet practicable to fully quantify the effect of IFRS 16 on these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Change in subsidiary ownership and loss of control
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain  
or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
Joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control. These joint arrangement are in turn classified as:
– Joint ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities; and
– Joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. 23 Crawshaw Group Plc
Annual Report           52 weeks  ended 29 January 201 7
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies continued 
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed  
to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50% of the voting power of another entity. 
Application of the equity method to associates and joint ventures
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment includes 
goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive 
income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence 
or joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition 
of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Joint operations
Where the Group is a party to a joint operation, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the joint operations assets and liabilities, as well as  
the Group’s share of the entity’s profit or loss and other comprehensive income, on a line-by-line basis.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.  
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategy and Business Model  
on page 08. In addition, notes 1 9 and 20 set out the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital and exposures to credit and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in note 20, the Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through cash generated from operations and borrowings. Current cash headroom 
totals £2. 1 m. 
In the year, the Group entered into a £4m, 5 year Revolving Credit Facility with RBS. The facility was undrawn at year end and is expected to remain undrawn through  
FY 2018. 
The Group’s forecasts and cash projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance as a result of the uncertain economic conditions, show 
that the Group should be able to operate within its cash reserves with the appropriate decisions being taken on the pace of new store rollout to ensure a sufficient working 
capital buffer is maintained to cover day to day cash requirements of the business.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
In applying policies consistent with IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party 
under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number 
of the Group’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number 
of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Group’s 
own shares, the amounts presented in this financial information for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable, or redeemable only at the Company’s option, and any dividends are discretionary. Dividends thereon 
are recognised as distributions within equity upon approval by the Group’s shareholders.
Preference share capital is classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders, or if dividend payments are not discretionary. 
Dividends thereon are recognised as interest expense in profit or loss as accrued.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified  
in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables.
T rade and other receivables are recognised at stated cost less impairment losses. It is the Company’s policy to review trade and other receivable balances for evidence  
of impairment at each reporting date. Any receivables which give significant cause for concern are written down to the best estimate of the recoverable amount.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand and cash-at-bank.
T rade and other payables are recognised at stated cost.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 24 Crawshaw Group Plc
Annual Report           52 weeks  ended 29 January 201 7
1. Accounting policies continued  
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.  
Residual values of property, plant and equipment is assumed to be nil. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Freehold property 5%- 10%
• Leasehold buildings in accordance with the lease term
• Leasehold improvements in accordance with the lease term
• Plant, equipment and vehicles 3- 1 5 years straight line basis
Intangible assets and goodwill
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of businesses. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 1 December 2006, goodwill represents the 
difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or 
which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. 
Any impairment is then recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period. The Company elected not to restate business combinations in 
Crawshaw Butchers Limited that took place prior to 1 February 2006. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 February 2006, goodwill is included at 1 February 2006 on the basis 
of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable save that only separable intangibles were recognised and 
goodwill was amortised.
Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill,  
from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
• Brand 20 years
Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication 
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and 
then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash 
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow  
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash 
flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate.
Trade and other receivables
T rade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value and thereafter at amortised cost less impairment charges.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies continued
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. Cost comprises purchase price  
and an allocation of production overheads. Net realisable value is estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion  
and selling expenses. 
Inventories are primarily goods for resale.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand and cash-at bank. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A provision is recognised for the 
amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result  
of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Revenue
Revenue is mainly derived from retail butcher activities, stated after trade discounts, VA T and any other sales taxes. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is the time of retail sale to the 
customer. Where the Group sells to distributors, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised where there are no further obligations on the Group and when the  
associated economic benefits are due to the Group and the turnover can be reliably measured.
Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. Lease incentives are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the associated lease. 
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities, interest receivable on funds invested and dividend income.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the income  
statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are expensed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Taxation
T ax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. T ax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates  
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect 
neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Crawshaw Group Plc

Bank loans, overdrafts and loan notes
Interest-bearing bank loans, overdrafts and loan notes are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable 
on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and 
expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. Operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Executive 
Officer to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. The Directors 
consider each location to be a separate operating segment. The Directors have applied the provisions within IFRS 8 for aggregation of operating segments with similar risks 
and markets, to have one reportable segment. The Group’s business operations are conducted exclusively in the UK so geographical segment reporting is not required.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial information in conformity with IFRS required management to make judgements, estimated and assumptions that affect the application  
of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The estimates associated with the assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the 
revision only affects that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date are:
• Share based payments (note 1 7)
• Deferred tax (note 1 3)
• Goodwill and intangible assets in business combinations (note 10)

There are no intangible assets within the Company. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. 
Acquired brand values were calculated using the royalty relief approach and are amortised over 20 years. The remaining amortisation period is 10 years and 2 months.
The amortisation and impairment charge is recognised in the following line items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income:
    2017 2016 
    £’000 £’000
Administrative expenses    60 136
Impairment testing
Goodwill arose on the Group’s original acquisition of Crawshaw Butchers Limited and on the subsequent acquisitions of East Yorkshire Beef Limited in June 2014 and 
Gabbotts Farm Limited in April 201 5. 
Each store is treated as a separate cash generating unit grouped together into ’relevant group of CGUs’ for the purposes of impairment testing.
The goodwill supported by the expected future cash flows of each relevant group of CGUs as at 31 January 201 7 is as follows:
    2017 2016 
    £’000 £’000
Crawshaw Butchers Limited    7,029 7,029
East Yorkshire Beef Limited    177 177
Gabbotts Farm Limited    3,384 3,384
The recoverable amount of Crawshaw Butchers Ltd, East Yorkshire Beef Limited and Gabbotts Farm Limited acquisition has been calculated with reference to their value in 
use. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and projections approved by management for the next 5 years and assuming 
an estimated long term annual growth rate of 2.0% for the subsequent 25 years (201 5: 2.0%).
The financial budgets and projections are based on past experience and actual operating results. The growth rates for the 5 year period are based on current performance 
of the existing store and product mix. The Directors believe that the long-term growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the UK economy, the 
principal geographic area in which Crawshaws operates.
The Directors estimate the discount rates using the post-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the  
cash-generating unit. In the current year the Directors estimate the applicable pre-tax rate to be 8.8% (2016: 1 3.3%).
The Directors modelled a range of different scenarios by applying sensitivities to both the cash flow assumptions and the discount rate. Based on the sensitivity analysis 
there is sufficient headroom between the value in use calculation and the carrying value of the CGU. Crawshaw Group Plc

Pension plans
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.

contribution scheme are as follows:
    2017 2016 
    £’000 £’000
Defined contribution scheme    — 2
Share Based Payments 
The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect  
of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of such equity settled share based payments is expensed 
on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting 
conditions (with a corresponding movement in equity).
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects  
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The fair value of the shares issued under the new Long T erm Incentive Plan were valued on a discounted cash flow basis in conjunction with a third party valuation specialist.
Share Options
Share options were granted post reverse acquisition on 14 April 2008 to key employees of the enlarged group, Crawshaw Group Plc. In line with the scheme rules, options 
for employees who leave the business lapse after six months.

Long Term Incentive Plan
Shares were granted under the Crawshaw Group Plc Long Term Incentive Plan on 24 April 201 5 which entitles employees to equity instruments in Crawshaw Butchers 
Limited. The shares are ’growth shares’ in a subsidiary, Crawshaw Butchers Ltd, but have value linked to the market capitalisation of Crawshaw Group Plc. Shareholders are 
entitled to a maximum pool of 10% of the growth in value of the market capitalisation of Crawshaw Group Plc over the hurdle rate, where the hurdle rate is set as a premium 
of 1 5% to market capitalisation immediately prior to the award of the shares.
Shareholders have the option to ‘put’ their Eligible Put Shares on the occurrence of the following events:
– The First and Second Put Dates: Shareholders can put 1/6th of their Shares from the first anniversary of the date of grant and a further 1/6th of their Shares from the 
second anniversary of the date of grant.
– The achievement of the Performance Conditions: Shareholders can put 1/3rd of their Shares once the market capitalisation of Crawshaw Butchers has increased by 50% 
since the date of grant. In addition, shareholders can put a further 1/3rd of their Shares once the market capitalisation of Crawshaw Butchers has increased by 100% since 
the date of grant.
– On a voluntary winding up or change of control of Crawshaw Group Plc.
The fair value of the awards is determined by using the Monte Carlo model and allowance has been made for the following assumptions: Expected exercise date, expected 
volatility of total shareholder return, expected future dividends and the risk free rate of interest. 100,000 simulations were used in the Monte Carlo model and set out below 
is a summary of the key data.
Date of Grant     24 April 201 5
Ave Share price in period prior to grant     53.1p
Volatility of TSR for the Company     60% pa
Dividend Yield     1% pa
Risk Free rate of Interest     1.75% pa
Exercise pattern  Expected exercise between 0 and 10 years
The expected Volatility is wholly based on the historic volatility simulated over differing time periods to the date of grant.
The share based payment charge will be adjusted each financial year to reflect expected and actual achievement of non-market based vesting conditions. The total 
expense recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is £21 7 ,000.

19. Financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and trade creditors. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of 
these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The Group has paid all bank facilities mitigating any risk in interest rate variability. 
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and receivables. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables. T rade receivables are included in the 
balance sheet net of a provision for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of current economic 
conditions.
At the balance sheet date, the Directors consider there to be no significant credit risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity  
of funding and flexibility through the use of cash and bank facilities. The cash generative nature of the business is forecast to continue and the bank facilities have been  
paid in full. The Directors are confident that there will continue to be sufficient headroom to cover liquidity risk.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the effect of netting agreements:
