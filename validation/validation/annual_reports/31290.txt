Chairman’s Report
When I wrote my update to accompany 
the 2016 Annual Report, Nostra Terra 
was still in the early stages of embedding 
its new strategy. The price of oil was 
consolidating and signs of recovery 
across the industry were in sight.
Twelve months later and the sector 
has rebounded strongly. Thanks to 
our efforts in 2016, Nostra Terra was 
well positioned to benefit greatly 
from this. The Company has since 
taken significant steps forward in 
realising its ambitions, delivering 
robust returns for shareholders. 
Our strategic focus switched in 2016 
to repositioning our portfolio of assets 
with the goal of growing stable oil 
production and reserves, which would 
be profitable at $30/bbl. In particular 
we sought to acquire leases, which were 
Held By Production (HBP). This ideally 
suited Nostra Terra because it meant we 
could control the pace of development 
of these assets, as conditions and our 
finances allowed.
In early 2017 we completed our 
second acquisition in the Permian Basin, 
Texas, and by April had increased the 
Company’s current proven reserves (1P) 
in the US to 522,000 barrels. As stated 
a year ago, these reported reserves 
were bankable and laid the foundation 
to enabling Nostra Terra to gain access 
to the working capital required to 
grow long term oil production.
To that end, Nostra Terra raised 
£500,000 in a placing in late April 2017 
and in September secured a hedging 
facility for future oil production with BP 
Energy Company. This was a significant 
leap forward for Nostra Terra and 
provided a ringing endorsement 
of the success of our new strategy. 
Perhaps more importantly it better 
positioned the Company to access 
non-dilutive working capital to 
fund future growth.
By the end of 2017 we were able to 
report we were in advanced discussions 
with a number of lenders. Eight days 
after the period ended, we finalised 
terms of a $5 million Senior Lending 
Facility with Washington Federal Bank, 
at an initial interest rate of 4.75% 
with an initial borrowing base of 
$1.2 million. 
Operationally, the introduction 
of new funds has meant a great 
deal to the business and has already 
yielded tangible results. In October 
we completed our third acquisition in 
the Permian Basin and by the middle 
of November started drilling the first 
new well on this lease, the Twin Well. 
We were subsequently able to put the 
Twin Well into production, a significant 
contributor to Nostra Terra becoming 
cash flow positive at the plc level, 
another major milestone for 
the Company.
In other areas, we have continued 
to work hard.
With respect to our investment in 
Magnolia Petroleum, we identified 
an opportunity where we believed our 
involvement would add significant value 
both to that company and to Nostra 
Terra. In response to the requisition 
for a General Meeting to seek change 
to Magnolia’s board, Magnolia’s existing 
directors chose to complete a highly 
dilutive deal, which we believe added 
precious little in terms of value to that 
company and was unfortunate for 
Magnolia’s shareholders. We exited 
our position at a profit. 
In Egypt we increased our stake 
in the East Ghazalat concession to 
50%, having acquired Echo Energy’s 
(AIM:ECHO) 25% stake for a $500,000 
consideration payable only upon certain 
approvals and production hurdles. For 
minimal outlay we will increase Nostra 
Terra’s assets to just over 1 million 
barrels of 2P Reserves.
We have continued to engage 
positively with various stakeholders in 
Egypt, and remain highly enthusiastic 
about the potential, but our first task 
has to be to resolve the legacy dispute 
with North Petroleum (“North”), the 
operator, which governs East Ghazalat, 
and the case has now been referred 
to international arbitration. 
In summary, I believe the future 
looks very bright for Nostra Terra. 
We have delivered on our promise 
to build secure, long-term, profitable 
production. We are now cash flow 
positive at the plc level and have 
access to significant working capital, 
fundamental attributes that are rarely 
found in companies on AIM or of our 
size. Now that we have put in place such 
a solid foundation our intention is to 
build on this through further acquisitions 
and organic growth. I would like to 
thank our shareholders for their 
continued support and look forward 
to reporting more progress in future.

Chief Executive Officer’s Report
Our primary goal in 2017 was 
to become cash flow positive at the 
plc level. It took us two months longer 
than I had hoped, but we hit this target 
in February 2018. This is perhaps our 
most significant achievement to date 
and positions Nostra Terra for exciting 
growth ahead, as we seek to introduce 
larger assets to the Company with 
much more potential upside. 
Revenues for the year were £1,128,000 
an increase of 300% from 2016. Loss for 
the year was £1,044,000. In April 2017 
the Company raised £500,000 through 
an equity placing at 2 pence per share. 
Included in this were 1 for 1 warrants, 
exercisable within 12 months at 3 pence 
per share. Nearly all of the warrants 
were exercised by April 2018, raising an 
additional £738,000 for the Company.
Moving forward we will certainly 
seek to build on this success, through 
further drilling across our existing 
portfolio of assets. However, now that 
we are in a much more secure position 
financially, with a stronger balance 
sheet, we can also afford to explore 
a more ambitious acquisition plan. 
If successful this change in approach 
could significantly increase Nostra Terra’s 
growth trajectory.
My vision has always been to build 
a much larger company, built on solid 
fundamentals. The first phase of this 
plan is now complete and I am excited 
about the next phase ahead. 
United States
Pine Mills, Texas
Having secured our initial stake (80% 
working interest) in the Pine Mills oil 
field in late 2016, our operations team 
made an immediate impact. By the turn 
of the year we were able to report two 
consecutive months of profitable oil 
production at Pine Mills and have 
sustained that record every month 
since. Furthermore, Pine Mills has 
provided us with such stable and 
consistent excess cash flow that it 
has become the cornerstone of our 
turnaround strategy.
This very much confirms our 
original basis for acquiring Pine Mills 
and the subsequent strategic efforts 
we expended in the first half of 2017 to 
secure 100% of the asset. Subsequently, 
we were able to include all revenues 
generated at Pine Mills in 2017 in our 
reported figures. 
Due to the stable production at 
Pine Mills and the performance of our 
operational team, in September 2017 
we secured a hedging facility with BP 
Energy Company. This was a significant 
achievement for a company of Nostra 
Terra’s size and marked a turning 
point for the Company.
To secure the hedging facility we 
underwent a vigorous due diligence 
process. We were able to demonstrate 
an established track record of consistent 
production and the viability of our 
long-term model consolidating efforts 
made in the first half of 2017.
Permian Basin, Texas
Having secured the hedging facility, 
we were confident we would be able 
to obtain a new Senior Lending Facility. 
Initial discussions with a number of 
banks went well and this gave us 
confidence to press ahead with the 
third acquisition in the Permian Basin, 
where we would drill the Twin Well. 
This acquisition, in late October 2017, 
marked another step change in 
our delivery.
Prior to the acquisition, the 
neighbouring operator inadvertently 
drilled a well into the lease, which 
produced 350 barrels of oil in less 
than three days. Because of this 
error the neighbouring operator 
had to plug and abandon its well 
and was required to provide us 
with the well data.
It has since produced at a strong 
rate above 50bopd. From permitting 
to getting paid took less than 
four months.
We now have approximately 22 drill 
ready locations across our existing 
Permian Basin assets. Assuming 
we are able to continue growing 
production here, it is clear there is 
potential to increase significantly 
underlying value. 
We retain interest and receive 
revenues from additional assets 
located in Oklahoma, Colorado and 
Wyoming. These are not substantial 
and are considered non-core assets.
Egypt
While we’ve made positive inroads in 
the country with the Government and 
local contact, unfortunately we have 
not been able to find a solution to the 
legacy issues with the Concession’s 
operator, North Petroleum (“North”), 
and the case has now been referred 
to international arbitration. 
We have been proactive in 
suggesting solutions to the issues 
raised, and sought positive resolutions. 
Nevertheless, Nostra Terra will now 
defend its position rigorously.
Senior Lending Facility
At the beginning of 2017 we 
secured a new $5 million Senior Lending 
Facility. The initial borrowing base was 
$1.2 million at a 4.75% interest rate. 
The facility will be reviewed at least 
twice a year, meaning the borrowing 
base can increase or decrease based 
on changes in production, reserves, 
cash flow and commodity prices. 
With the progress we have made 
increasing production at Pine Mills, 
across our Permian Basin assets, 
and the considerable improvement 
in the oil price, Nostra Terra is well 
positioned to accelerate its growth. 
Outlook
With oil sector strength and 
Nostra Terra cash flow positive at 
the plc level, this is a most exciting 
time to be involved in the business. 
We already have a number of potential 
catalysts to rerate the business in our 
asset portfolio and are extremely 
well positioned to raise our sights 
in terms of new acquisitions. We 
are an attractive company to work 
with for potential targets and the 
Washington Federal Senior Lending 
Facility provides us with a great deal 
of balance sheet support.
I would like to finish by thanking our 
shareholders for their support and I look 
forward to providing more updates as 
we continue to grow the Company.

Strategic Report
The directors now present their 
Strategic Report with the financial 
statements of Nostra Terra Oil and Gas 
Company plc (“the Company”) and its 
subsidiaries (collectively “the Group”) 
for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Principal activity
The Group’s principal activity is the 
exploitation of hydrocarbon resources 
focusing at present in the USA 
and Egypt.
Review of business, future 
developments, trading outlook 
and future strategy
The results for the year and financial 
position of the Company and the Group 
are shown in the financial statements 
on pages 16 to 25, and are noted in 
the Chairman’s Report on page 3 and 
the Chief Executive Officer’s Report 
on page 4.
Key performance indicators
At this stage in the Company’s 
development, the directors regularly 
monitor key performance indicators 
associated with managing liquid 
resources, namely: cash flows and 
bank balances; general administrative 
expenses, which are tightly controlled; 
and the level of production. The 
directors also monitor the change 
in net production which in 2017 
increased to 30,703 BOE (USA only) 
as noted on page 1. Increase in 
production primarily reflect the 
acquisition of the Pine Mills asset 
in East Texas.
Key risks and uncertainties The key 
risk in exploration and production 
is the technical risk of not finding 
hydrocarbons when an exploration well 
is drilled. While the US mid-continent 
is a proven hydrocarbon region 
and is seeing resurgence through the 
application of new drilling and well 
completion technologies, there are 
environmental and economic risks, 
as there are in any hydrocarbon region. 
Further information relating to risk can 
be found at note 21 to these accounts.

Events after the reporting period
Refer to note 27 for details.
Publication of accounts on Company website
The Company publishes financial statements on its website. 
The directors are responsible for the website’s maintenance 
and integrity, and their responsibility also extends to the 
financial statements contained therein.
Indemnity of officers
The Group may purchase and maintain, for any director or 
officer, insurance against any liability. The Group maintains 
appropriate insurance cover against legal action bought 
against its directors and officers.
Financial instruments
The Group does not have formal policies on interest 
rate risk or foreign currency risk. The Group is exposed 
to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are 
denominated in a currency other than pounds sterling (£). 
The Group maintains a natural hedge that minimises its 
foreign exchange exposure by matching foreign currency 
income with foreign currency costs. For the time being, the 
Group does not consider it necessary to enter into foreign 
exchange contracts to manage its foreign currency risk, 
given the nature of its business.
Listing
The Company’s ordinary shares have traded on London’s 
Alternative Investment Market since 20 July 2007. Strand 
Hanson Limited was the Company’s nominated advisor 
and broker. Capital Limited is the Company’s co-broker.
The closing mid-market price at 31 December 2017 
was 4.35p (2016: 1.97p).
Going concern
The directors believe that, based on the forecasts and 
projections they have prepared, the resources available 
will be sufficient for the Company and its subsidiaries to 
continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future 
when taking into account proceeds generated from 
production, as described more fully in note 1 of 
the accounts.
The directors have concluded that this combination 
of circumstances should they not materialise represents 
uncertainty upon the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. Nevertheless after making enquiries, and 
considering the uncertainties described above, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and accounts. Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Directors’ Report continued
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and 
the Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the 
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in the European Union. 
The financial statements are required by law to give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the 
Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business; and
• follow IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and to 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement as to disclosure of information 
to auditors
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as defined by Section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006) of which the Group’s auditors are unaware, and 
each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 485 of the Companies Act 2006, 
a resolution that Jeffreys Henry LLP be reappointed as auditors 
of the Company will be put to the Annual General Meeting.

Corporate Governance Report
31 December 2017
The board has sought to comply with a number of the 
provisions of the Code in so far as it considers them to be 
appropriate for a company of their size and nature. They 
make no statement of compliance with the Code overall 
and do not ‘explain’ in detail any aspect of the Code with 
which they do not comply.’
The directors recognise the importance of sound corporate 
governance, commensurate with the Group’s size and 
shareholders’ interests. As the Group grows, policies and 
procedures that reflect the FRC’s UK Corporate Governance 
Code will be developed. So far as is practicable and 
appropriate, the directors will take steps to comply with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code.
In light of recent changes to the AIM Rules for Companies 
the Board of Directors is currently reviewing which 
corporate governance code to adopt as required from 
28 September 2018.
The Board of Directors
The board comprises two executive directors and two 
non-executive directors. It meets at least four times a year, 
as issues arise which require board attention. The board 
has a formal schedule of matters specially referred to it for 
decision. The directors are responsible for:
• management structure and appointments;
• consideration of strategy and policy;
• approval of major capital investments and transactions; and
• significant financing matters.
The board has Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees, the roles and responsibilities of which are 
discussed below.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Ewen Ainsworth 
as Chairman, and John Stafford. Both have considerable 
and relevant financial experience.
The Audit Committee has terms of reference agreed by the 
board and meets at least twice a year. The committee 
provides an opportunity for reporting by the Company’s 
auditors, and is responsible for:
• monitoring, in discussion with the auditors, the 
integrity of the financial statements and announcements 
of the Company;
• reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls 
and risk management systems; and
• reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s 
independence, and the objectivity and effectiveness of 
the audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK 
and other professional and regulatory requirements.
The Audit Committee is also responsible for making 
recommendations to the board to be put to shareholders 
for their approval in general meeting in relation to the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of the external 
auditors and to approve the external auditors’ remuneration 
and terms of engagement. Other responsibilities include 
considering annually whether there is a need for an 
internal audit function and making a recommendation 
to the board, and reviewing arrangements by which the 
Group’s staff will be able to raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other 
matters related to the Group.
Remuneration and Nomination Committees
The Remuneration and Nomination Committees, which 
meet at least twice a year, consist of Ewen Ainsworth 
as Chairman and John Stafford. Based on the terms of 
reference approved by the board, the Remuneration 
Committee is responsible for:
• determining and agreeing with the board the framework 
or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chairman and other members it is designated 
to consider;
• setting the remuneration for all executive directors, 
the Chairman and the Company Secretary;
• recommending and monitoring the level and structure 
of remuneration for senior management;
• determining targets for any performance-related pay 
schemes operated by the Group;
• determining the policy and scope of pension 
arrangements for each executive director; and
• ensuring that contractual terms on termination 
and any payments made are fair to the individual 
and the Company.
The Remuneration Committee determines the terms 
and conditions of service of executive directors. This includes

Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are very important 
and are given a priority. The Company maintains a website, 
www.ntog.co.uk, to inter alia improve information flow to 
shareholders and potential investors. It contains inter alia 
information about the Company’s activities, and annual 
and interim reports. Shareholders are welcome to make 
enquiries on any matters relating to the business and to 
their shareholdings. The Company encourages shareholders 
to attend the Annual Meeting, at which they will be given 
the opportunity to put questions to the chairman and other 
members of the board.
Internal financial control
The board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the 
Company’s system of internal controls and for reviewing their 
effectiveness. They are designed to safeguard the 
Company’s assets and to ensure the reliability of the financial 
information for both internal use and external publication. 
The controls that include inter alia financial, operational 
and compliance matters and management are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis.
A system of internal control can provide only reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities 
will be detected or that risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives is eliminated. The board has considered the need 
for an internal audit function but because of the size and 
nature of its operations does not consider it necessary at 
this time. Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the members of Nostra Terra Oil & Gas Company Plc
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Nostra Terra 
Oil & Gas Company Plc (the ‘parent company’) and its 
subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 December 
2017 which comprise the consolidated income statement, 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and Company statements of financial 
position, the consolidated and Company statements of cash 
flows, the consolidated and Company statements of 
changes in equity and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter 
described in Basis of qualified opinion paragraph below: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the 
year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, and; 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for qualified opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. The scope of our work was limited as a result 
of the following matter. As disclosed in Note 14 the ongoing 
dispute in relation to the operation of the Group’s 50 per cent 
interest in the East Ghazalat production license, held 
indirectly through Independent Resources (Egypt) Ltd 
(“IRE”), in which the Company acquired full ownership in 
the year. The ongoing dispute between North Petroleum 
International S.A (“North”), the operator of East Ghazalat, 
and IRE with regards to cash calls raised against IRE, which 
have been rebutted by IRE. This issue is currently being 
arbitrated. Due to the breakdown in relations North refuses 
to furnish financial information to allow a proper 
determination of licence costs and an audit of licence 
revenues to be complete. As a consequence of the lack of 
access to primary accounting information we have been 
unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in 
relation to the Group and Company financial statements 
concerning:
• the carrying value of £Nil of the Group’s investment 
in the subsidiary as at 31 December 2017
• the Group’s share of profit or loss attributable to the 
Group’s underlying interest in the East Ghazalat licence 
for the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017
The lack of primary accounting information has led to IRE 
being excluded from the consolidated financial statements.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which 
has not been modified in respect of this matter, we have 
considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 1 
to the financial statements concerning the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. The Group incurred a net 
loss of £1,044,000 during the year ended 31 December 2017 
and, at that date, had net current liabilities of £1,571,000 
with net liabilities of £226,000. These conditions, along 
with the other matters explained in note 1 to the financial 
statements indicate the existence of a material uncertainty 
which may cast significant doubt over the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do 
not include the adjustments that would result if the Group 
was unable to continue as a going concern. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; 
the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Please note, the key audit matters do not include reference 
to the exclusion if IRE from the consolidated accounts as 
discussed in the basis for qualified opinion paragraphs. Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Key audit matters continued
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Carrying value of producing oil and gas assets –
The Group holds multiple leases over producing oil 
and gas assets (wells) which are recorded as both tangible 
and intangible assets. Carrying values at the year end are:
Intangibles: £1,043k (2016: £1,036k)
Tangibles: £265k (2016: £202k)
We have understood and assessed the methodology used 
in the capitalisation of these assets.
A review of the producing wells was undertaken with a view 
of identifying any indication of impairment. This entailed 
comparing oil reserves and net present values from the 
independent reserves report produced by Booth Reeves 
to the asset carrying values, and a detailed review 
of producing wells. 
Our application of materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £105,000 (2016: £100,000). £58,000 (2016: £55,000).
How we determined it Average of:
10% of profit before tax;
1% of gross assets.
Average of:
10% of profit before tax;
1.5% of gross assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
We believe that profit before tax and gross 
assets are the primary measure used by the 
shareholders in assessing the performance 
of the Group, and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark
We believe that profit before tax and gross 
assets are the primary measure used by the 
shareholders in assessing the performance 
of the Company and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. 
The range of materiality allocated across components was between £44,000 and £8,500. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £2,900 
(2016: £2,750) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
An overview of the scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgments, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in 
all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there 
was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which they operate.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of 3 reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses 
and holding companies.
We performed audits of the complete financial information of Nostra Terra Oil & Gas Company Plc, New Horizons Energy LLC, 
Buccaneer Operating LLC, Churchill Operating LLC, Goldhawk Oil & Gas LLC and Independent Resources (Egypt) Ltd, which 
were individually financially significant and accounted for 100% of the Group’s revenue and 100% of the Group’s absolute 
profit before tax (i.e. the sum of the numerical values without regard to whether they were profits or losses for the relevant 
reporting units).  Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. 
The other information comprises the information included 
in the annual report, other than the financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, except 
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we 
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. If we identify such material 
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we 
are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the 
directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the 
Group and parent company and its environment obtained 
in the course of the audit, we have not identified material 
misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities 
statement on page 8, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such 
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of this report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017
GENERAL INFORMATION
Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc (Nostra Terra) is a company incorporated in England and Wales and quoted on the 
AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office is disclosed on the company information 
page of this annual report. The principal activity of the Group is described in the directors’ report.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Group is a going concern. When assessing the 
foreseeable future, the directors have looked at a period of 12 months from the date of approval of this report.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position 
are set out in the Chief Executive Officer’s report and Directors report. In addition, note 21 to the financial statements includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; and its exposures 
to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, show that the 
Group should be able to operate within the level of its current cash resources. Bases on trading to date and the acquisition 
of wells which are actively producing, the directors are confident that the Company is a going concern for at least 12 months 
from the date of sign off of these accounts. In addition, the Group has obtained a US$5m credit facility with Washington 
Federal bank post year end where US$1.2m is available immediately.
Accordingly, the directors are confident that the Group and Company will continue to remain a going concern for the 
foreseeable future. If the bank facilities were not renewed, or were not prepared to lend, and the recovery plan were not 
to be achieved, then the Group would need to seek alternative Financing including further fundraising in order to be able 
to support the Group as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group and the Company are unable to 
continue as a going concern.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC 
interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention.
New and amended standards adopted by the Company
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 
1 January 2016 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Company. Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material 
effect on the financial statements of the Group .
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another 
entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements 
present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions 
and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the 
statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised 
at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases. Notes to the Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Subsidiaries
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed 
at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value 
of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group .
Associates
An associate undertaking (“associate”) is an enterprise over whose financial and operating policies the Group has the power 
to exercise significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the Group . The equity method of 
accounting for associates is adopted in the Group financial statements, such that they include the Group’s share of operating 
profit or loss, exceptional items, interest, taxation and net assets of associates (“the equity method”).
In applying the equity method, account is taken of the Group’s share of accumulated retained earnings and movements 
in reserves from the effective date on which an enterprise becomes an associate and up to the effective date of disposal. 
The share of associated retained earnings and reserves is generally determined from the associate’s latest interim or final 
financial statements. Where the Group’s share of losses of an associate exceeds the carrying amount of the associate, the 
associate is carried at nil. Additional losses are only recognised to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations or 
made payments outside the course of ordinary business on behalf of the associate.
Joint venture
Investment in entities which constitute a joint venture in accordance with the definition in International Accounting Standard 
no. 28 Investments in Associates are accounted for using the equity method, with the Group’s share of profits or losses being 
adjusted against the original cost of the investment on an annual basis.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable 
assets of the acquired subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included 
in ‘intangible assets’. Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the 
carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those 
cash generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination 
in which the goodwill arose. The Group allocates goodwill to each business segment in each country in which it operates.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for 
impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which 
there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered 
impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at 
a revalued amount in which case the reversal of impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase. Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
29
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Property, plant and equipment
Tangible non-current assets are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when 
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged 
to the income statement during the financial year in which they are incurred. Depreciation is provided at the following 
annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life:
Plant and machinery – over 7 years
The assets’ residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement of 
financial position date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s 
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable value.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised 
within other losses or gains in the income statement. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in other 
reserves are transferred to retained earnings.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment value.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in relation to the proceeds by the prospects 
which the Company has a working interest in. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and 
after eliminating sales within the Group . Revenue is recognised when the oil and gas produced is despatched and received 
by the customers.
Functional currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the functional currency), which is mainly United States Dollars (US$). The financial statements 
are presented in Pounds Sterling (£), which is the Group’s presentation currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the presentational currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates 
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised 
in the income statement.
(iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that 
have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(b)  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not 
a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case 
income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of 
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity. 
When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are 
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Notes to the Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based 
on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differed from net profit as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The entity's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the statement of 
financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Operating leases
Rental leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the 
income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial 
difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or 
delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in 
the income statement over the year of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, 
cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through 
profit or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs, except as described below. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
A financial instrument is recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets are derecognised if the Group’s contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the 
Group transfers the financial assets to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards of the 
asset. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits 
itself to purchase or sell the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Group’s obligations specified in the contract 
expire or are discharged or cancelled. Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
31
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Fair values
The carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables 
of the Group at the balance sheet date approximated their fair values, due to the relatively short-term nature of these 
financial instruments.
The Company provides financial guarantees to licensed banks for credit facilities extended to a subsidiary company. The fair 
value of such financial guarantees is not expected to be significantly different as the probability of the subsidiary company 
defaulting on the credit lines is remote.
Share-based compensation
The fair value of the employee and supplier services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an 
expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting year is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). 
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each 
statement of financial position date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. 
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and 
share premium when the options are exercised.
The fair value of share-based payments recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is measured by use of the 
Black Scholes model, which takes into account conditions attached to the vesting and exercise of the equity instruments. 
The expected life used in the model is adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The share price volatility percentage factor used in the calculation is 
based on management’s best estimate of future share price behaviour and is selected based on past experience, future 
expectations and benchmarks against peer companies in the industry.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, 
from the proceeds.
Oil and gas assets
The Group applies the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas assets and has adopted IFRS 6 Exploration 
for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
Exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) assets
Under the successful efforts method of accounting, all licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs are initially 
capitalised in well, field or specific exploration cost centres as appropriate, pending determination. Expenditure incurred 
during the various exploration and appraisal phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established 
or the determination process has not been completed.
Pre-licence costs
Costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area are expensed directly to the income statement 
as they are incurred.
Exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) costs
Costs of E&E are initially capitalised as E&E assets. Payments to acquire the legal right to explore, together with the directly 
related costs of technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploratory drilling and testing are capitalised as intangible 
E&E assets.
Tangible assets used in E&E activities (such as the Group’s drilling rigs, seismic equipment and other property, plant and 
equipment used by the Company’s exploration function) are classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to the 
extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that consumption 
is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset. Such intangible costs include directly attributable overheads, including 
the depreciation of property, plant and equipment utilised in E&E activities, together with the cost of other materials consumed 
during the exploration and evaluation phases.
E&E costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities.
Treatment of E&E assets at conclusion of appraisal activities
Intangible E&E assets relating to each exploration licence/prospect are carried forward until the existence (or otherwise) 
of commercial reserves has been determined, subject to certain limitations including review for indications of impairment. 
If commercial reserves are discovered the carrying value, after any impairment loss of the relevant E&E assets, is then reclassified 
as development and production assets. If, however, commercial reserves are not found, the capitalised costs are charged to 
expense after conclusion of appraisal activities. Notes to the Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Development and production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing 
the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in 
finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets as outlined above.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly 
attributable overheads and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Depletion, amortisation and impairment of oil and gas assets
All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, 
which is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the 
period plus the production in the period, on a field-by-field basis. Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise 
the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs to access the related commercial 
reserves. Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with prospectively.
Where there has been a change in economic conditions that indicates a possible impairment in an oil and gas asset, the 
recoverability of the net book value relating to that field is assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future 
cash flows based on management’s expectations of future oil and gas prices and future costs. Any impairment identified 
is charged to the income statement as additional depletion and amortisation. Where conditions giving rise to impairment 
subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any 
depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
Decommission liability 
Where a material liability for the removal of production facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life 
of the assets exist, a provision for decommissioning liability is recognised. The amount recognised is the present value 
of estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. An intangible asset 
of an amount equivalent to the provision is recognised and depreciated on a unit production basis. Changes in estimates 
are recognised prospectively, with corresponding adjustments to the provision and the associated intangible asset. Period 
changes in the present value arising from discounting are included in depletion, depreciation and amortisation cost in cost 
of sales.
Commercial reserves
Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, 
natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree 
of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical 
experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
(a) Impairment of investments
Costs of investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on value 
in use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates for each cash generating unit.
(b) Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is 
determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
(c) Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs
E&E assets are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable 
value. This assessment involves judgment as to (i) the likely future commerciality of the asset and when such commerciality 
should be determined, and (ii) future revenues and costs pertaining to the asset in question, and the discount rate to be 
applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value.
(d) Share-based payments
Note 1 sets out the Group’s accounting policy on share-based payments, specifically in relation to the share options and 
warrants that the Company has granted. The key assumptions underlying the fair value of such share-based payments are 
discussed in note 24. The fair value amounts used by the Group have been derived by external consultants using standard 
recognised valuation techniques. Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
In the opinion of the directors, the Group has one class of business, being the exploitation of hydrocarbon resources.
The Group’s primary reporting format is determined by geographical segment according to the location of the 
hydrocarbon assets. The Group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8 in the year are as follows:
United Kingdom being the head office.
US mid-continent properties at year end included the following:
(i)  Texas: 100% working interest in the Pine Mills Oilfield, 50-75% working interest in the Permian Basin, and other 
non-operated working interest
(ii) Colorado: 16.25% working interest in the Verde Prospect Unit
(iii) Wyoming: 100% working interest in the White Buffalo Prospect
The chief operating decision maker’s internal report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is based on the location of the

At 31 December 2017 the Group had estimated excess management expenses to carry forward of £8,587,508 (2016: £5,231,130). 
The deferred tax asset at 19% (2016: 19%) on these tax losses of £1,631,626 (2016: £993,915) has not been recognised due 
to the uncertainty of recovery.
8. LOSS OF PARENT COMPANY
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the parent company is not presented 
as part of these financial statements. The parent company’s loss for the financial year was £852,000 (2016: £4,265,000).
9. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is 
adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group had two classes of dilutive potential ordinary 
shares, being those share options granted to employees and suppliers where the exercise price is less than the average market 
price of the Group’s ordinary shares during the year, and warrants granted to directors and one former adviser.
Details of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below:

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that the intangible assets may be impaired, by 
considering the net present value of discounted cash flow forecasts. If an indication exists an impairment review is carried 
out by reference to available engineering information. At the year end, the directors are of the opinion that an impairment 
of £1,680,000 (2016: £1,842,000) should be provided.
Amortisation, impairment charges and any profit or loss on disposal of the capitalised intangible costs is included within

In the opinion of the directors, the aggregate value of the Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings is not less 
than the amount included in the statement of financial position.
Historically loans to participating interests are reported as in increase in the Company’s investment in joint venture, but 
have been provided for. As the Group acquired 100% shareholding in the joint venture this balance has been transferred 
to loan to subs.
The details of the subsidiaries are as set out below:
Shareholding
Country of
incorporation Nature of business
New Horizon Energy 1 LLC (“NHE”) 100% USA Oil and gas exploration in USA
Goldhawk Oil & Gas, LLC (“Goldhawk”) 100% USA Company dissolved in 2017
Buccaneer Operating, LLC (“Buccaneer”) 100% USA Oil and gas exploration in USA
Churchill Operating, LLC (“Churchill”) 100% USA Company dissolved in 2017
Independent Resources (Egypt) (“IRE”) 100% UK Oil and gas exploration in Egypt
Please refer to note 14 for further narrative on IRE. Due to lack of primary financial information the subsidiary has not been 
included in the consolidation. Full ownership was established in the year, leading to a the investments and loans in the joint 
venture to be reclassed to investments and loans to subsidiaries. At a Company level these balances had been fully impaired. Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The Group has acquired the remaining 50% interest in Independent Resources (Egypt) Limited (IRE), a company incorporated 
in England & Wales, whose purpose is to invest in the oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Arab Republic 
of Egypt, from Echo Energy Plc. As the company was fully owned at the year end the balance of the investment in the joint 
venture was transferred to investment in subsidiaries. The consideration for the remaining 50% interest is $100,000 with 
2 tranches of contingent payments of $200,000 made if the East Ghazalat concession produces 800 and 1,000 BOPD for a 
fixed timeframe. Each payment can be satisfied in cash or in new ordinary shares in the Company of 0.1p at the Company’s 
discretion. No provision has been included for contingent consideration as, based on the information available at the time 
of the purchase, the Company did not expect the milestones to be met.
In October 2015 the Company acquired a 50 per cent. working interest in the East Ghazalat production licence located in the 
Western Desert, Egypt from TransGlobe Energy Corporation through the acquisition of the entire share capital of Trans Globe 
(GOS) Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of TransGlobe Energy Corporation (“TransGlobe”). In December 2015, the name of 
the acquired company was changed to Sahara Resources (GOS) Inc.
The total consideration for the transaction was $3.5 million of which $2.5 million has been deferred as a vendor loan repayable 
by the Joint Venture on 30 September 2017. The loan note accrues interest at 10 per cent annum payable semi- annually. 
Nostra Terra and Independent Resources plc were joint and severally liable for the repayment of the loan note.
The final loan note principal and semi-annual interest payable to Trans Globe thereon remain subject to final determination 
in accordance with completion working capital adjustment provisions in the sale and purchase agreement.
At 31 December 2015 the loan note principal has been recorded based on Trans Globe’s initial assessment of working 
capital at completion and interest on this estimated loan note principal has been accrued up to 31 December 2015.
The US dollar denominated loan liability all to TransGlobe has been retranslated at prevailing year-end exchange rates. 
As a non-monetary long-term asset, the consideration for acquiring the share capital of Trans Globe GOS Inc. has been 
recorded at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of completion of the acquisition but has not been retranslated at 
the prevailing year-end exchange rate.
TransGlobe accepted an early settlement of the loan note with a final settlement of $200,000, which has released TransGlobe 
of any potential warrant or indemnity claims, in exchange for forgoing the outstanding loan balance of $2,300,000 and any 
accrued interest since acquisition of the company.
In January 2016 the Joint Venture was served with notice of default in relation to cash calls raised by North Petroleum 
International S.A. (“North Petroleum”) the operator of East Ghazalat.
The Joint Venture has rebutted the claims from North Petroleum but the current breakdown in relations has meant that 
operator North Petroleum has been unwilling to furnish financial information to allow a proper determination of licence 
costs and an audit of licence revenues to be completed. Notes to the Financial Statements continued

14. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE continued
In light of this lack of access to primary accounting records the results of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2016 
and 31 December 2017 reflect the investment in Sahara Resources GOS Inc. at historical cost and the loan note consideration 
payable to Trans Globe and the accrued costs of completing the related acquisition but do not consolidate any share of 
profits or losses attributable to Sahara Resources GOS Inc. underlying interests in the East Ghazalat licence for the period 
since 1 July 2015, the effective date of the transaction. The investment is reported at estimated recoverable amount at the 
Company level.

21. RISK AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, capital 
risk and credit risk. The Group’s activities also expose it to non-financial risks: market risk, legal risk and environment risk. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on unpredictability and seeks to minimise the potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance. The board, on a regular basis, reviews key risks and, where appropriate, 
actions are taken to mitigate the key risks identified.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost 
of capital.
Market risk
The Group also faces risks in conducting operations in US mid-continent, which include but are not limited to:
• Fluctuations in the global economy could disrupt the Group’s ability to operate its business in the US mid-continent 
and could discourage foreign and local investment and spending, which could adversely affect its production.
Environmental risks
The Group faces environmental risks in conducting operations in the US mid-continent which include but are not limited to:
• If the Group is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, it could be exposed to additional costs, 
which might hinder the Group’s ability to operate its business.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables. The Group’s credit risk is 
primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for 
doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss which, based on previous 
experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Foreign currency risk
The Group does not have formal policies on interest rate risk or foreign currency risk.
The Group reports its results in Pounds Sterling. A significant share of the exploration and development costs and the 
local operating costs are in United States Dollars. Any change in the relative exchange rates between Pounds Sterling 
and United States Dollars could positively or negatively affect the Group’s results.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency 
other than Pounds Sterling. The Group maintains a natural hedge that minimises the foreign exchange exposure by 
matching foreign currency income with foreign currency costs.
The Group does not consider it necessary to enter into foreign exchange contracts in managing its foreign exchange risk resulting 
from cash flows from transactions denominated in foreign currency, given the nature of the business for the time being.
The foreign exchange rate affecting the Group is as follows:

Volatility of crude oil prices
A material part of the Group’s revenue will be derived from the sale of oil that it expects to produce. A substantial or extended 
decline in prices for crude oil and refined products could adversely affect the Group’s revenues, cash flows, profitability 
and ability to finance its planned capital expenditure. West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) oil prices ranged from $33.97 to 
$60.46 in 2017 and $29.41 to $54.47 in 2016.
Liquidity risk
The Group expects to fund its exploration and development programme, as well as its administrative and operating expenses 
throughout 2018, principally using existing working capital and expected proceeds from the sale of future crude oil production. 
The Group had a bank balance of approximately £102,000 at 31 December 2017.

Options and warrants issued during the year:
On 7 February 2017, 750,000 warrants were issued to a J Stafford, exercisable at 2.55p per share. The warrants vest in 
two tranches, the first will vest on 7 February 2018 contingent on the share price being above 50% of the exercise price, 
and the second on 7 February 2019 contingent on the share price being above 100% of the exercise price. 
On 19 April 2017 25,000,000 warrants were issued as part of a placement of shares. The warrants are exercisable at 3p per 
share and vest immediately. The warrants expire on 19 April 2018.
On 21 July 2017, 8,000,000 options were issued to the Group’s directors, which vest if the share price exceeds 3p for 10 consecutive 
days within 12 months of the option issue, and will expire 5 years following the date the vesting conditions are met. The options 
are differentiated by 3 different exercise prices, with 2,666,666 exercisable at 3p per share, 4.5p per share and 6p per share. 
The estimated fair value of the warrants issued during the year was calculated by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model. Expected volatility was stated at 73.1% based on the movement in share price in the last year. The directors consider 
this is more appropriate due to a significant share price drop in 2008 which is attributable to a one-off event where work 
stopped during the opening of a well in Ukraine. The assumptions used in the calculation were as follows:
