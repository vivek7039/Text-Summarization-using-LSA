“Our ﬁrst full year as a listed company has been one of progress as we have worked hard to position 
the Group for future growth. It is disappointing that reduced client activity impacted revenue 
performance for much of the year, but I am pleased that the strength of our platform, team and service 
proposition has continued to attract new, high quality clients and our existing clients are putting more 
money to work with us. We have continued to make excellent headway with our ﬁve strategic initiatives 
in 2017 and signed the biggest institutional transaction in our history, our partnership with ANZ Bank. 
Clearly regulatory change is likely to have some impact on the business, but we believe we are well 
positioned to beneﬁt from market share gains in the medium to long term, with our ability to adapt 
our leading proprietary technology and focus on client service and regulatory compliance supported 
by our ﬁnancial strength.”

CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Highlights Highlights
6 7 Whilst I am pleased to present the Group’s results in our first 
full year since listing on the London Stock Exchange, there 
is no doubt that the past year has been challenging and 
disappointing with net operating income down 5% and 
underlying profit before tax down 22%. The year-on-year fall  
in  net operating income was primarily driven by more 
challenging market conditions with sustained periods of 
significantly lower market volatility, providing fewer trading 
opportunities for our clients.
The more significant fall in underlying profit before tax of 
22% was a function of the lower level of net operating income 
combined with our continued investment in the strategic 
growth initiatives, which will drive the medium to long-term 
growth of the Group. We have made strong progress on each of 
the strategic initiatives, greater detail of which is included later 
in the annual report.
Although the financial performance is disappointing, the 
underlying fundamentals within the business have continued to 
improve with a 5% increase in active clients and client money at 
record levels.
The results for the year have been somewhat overshadowed by 
the proposals from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
and other European regulators as they reform the way that 
contracts for difference (CFDs) and spread betting products are 
offered. The Group welcomes strong regulation and is working 
with regulators throughout the consultation periods, to achieve 
their objectives. It is likely that once finalised, these changes will 
impact the profitability of the Group in the short term, although 
in the medium to long term we believe that the Group will 
benefit from these changes as smaller operators leave the 
industry and we grow market share.
Governance and the Board
Prior to the listing in February 2016, we made a number of 
changes to the Board, strengthening it in a number of key areas. 
This is the first full year that the Board has been in place and 
following a formal evaluation process the Board has agreed 
that it has operated effectively throughout the year. More detail 
is included in the Nomination Committee report.
Manjit Wolstenholme will be stepping down from the Board 
at our Annual General Meeting on 27 July 2017. I would like 
to thank Manjit for her valuable contribution as we prepared 
for our listing and during our first year as a public company, 
and wish her every success for the future. We have commenced 
a thorough search for a successor.
Our people
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all of our staff for 
their hard work once again. Their effort and commitment has 
helped to ensure that we successfully managed the market 
volatility around the EU referendum as well as other significant 
market events during the year. The quality of our staff gives me 
the confidence to know that we will successfully deal with the 
regulatory changes, Brexit and other events that will impact the 
operations of the Group in the coming years. We have a 
considerable talent base in our London head office and intend 
to maintain the UK as our global headquarters. Continuing 
investment in our key talent will be an absolute priority for the 
Board in the coming year.
Dividends
CMC Markets continues to be a highly cash generative 
business. Whilst the Group’s policy is to pay dividends of 50% 
of underlying profit after tax, given the Group’s strong cash 
position, the Board has decided to maintain the full year total 
ordinary dividend in line with the prior year.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 5.95 pence per 
share, which represents a total ordinary dividend of 8.93 pence 
per share.
Outlook
2018 will be an important year for the Group as the regulatory 
changes are finalised and the way the Group will best serve the 
needs of our clients within that environment becomes clear. 
With our award winning technology, focus on client service and 
strong balance sheet, we believe that as the industry adjusts to 
these changes we will be in a position to emerge as a stronger 
business, delivering future growth and shareholder value.

Chairman’s statement
CMC Markets plc Chairman’s statement
8 9 Peter Cruddas collaborates on product development plans.
I founded CMC Markets in 1989 and over the intervening years 
the business has grown and has dealt with many periods of 
significant change; in many cases we have pioneered the change. 
This has included embracing the internet and new technologies 
including mobile and adapting to regulatory change. I love being 
at the helm of the business and I plan to steer us through any 
proposed regulatory changes ahead. That is what I have done 
successfully for 27 years and I will continue to do going forward. 
Financial performance and KPIs
Over the year, global markets were less volatile than historically, 
particularly in our major asset class, indices, and despite 
short-term volatility around the EU referendum and US 
presidential election, this ultimately led to fewer trading 
opportunities for our clients. Against this backdrop of low levels 
of market volatility, particularly in the first half, clients traded 
less than the prior year with net operating income being 5% 
lower than the prior year at £160.8 million. Operating expenses 
before exceptional costs increased by 6% to £105.8 million, due 
to increased investment in marketing and higher staff costs.
Profit before tax was £48.5 million, a 9% decrease on the prior 
year, driven by the reduced net operating income and the low 
level of variable cost within the business. However, with this 
operational leverage we anticipate that when revenues increase 
there will be a low incremental increase in cost, and therefore 
believe that our strong client metrics are a good foundation for 
future earnings growth. Own funds generated from operating 
activities were £47.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2017 
and the Group continues to have a strong regulatory total 
capital ratio of 31.5% as at 31 March 2017.
Although the Group’s policy is to pay 50% of profit after tax 
as dividends, given the Group’s strong cash generation and 
liquidity position, the Board has recommended to maintain 
last year’s total ordinary dividend and pay a final dividend 
of 5.95 pence per share despite the lower earnings.
Active clients have increased by 5% for the Group to 60,082; 
however a 6% reduction in the number of trades and a 3% 
decrease in the value of those trades contributed to a fall in 
overall revenue per active client (RPC) of 11% to £2,517. 
Although lower than the prior year, RPC remains amongst the 
highest in the industry and is a reflection of the quality of our 
client base. RPC is presented net of retail and Institutional client 
rebates, which were £9.9 million for the year, a decrease of 6% 
from the prior year.
2017 has generally been a good year for overall client 
acquisition for the CFD and spread betting businesses, with 
new clients increasing by 13% compared to the prior year. 
Our stockbroking business has seen client acquisition 
increase by 20%.
Regional review
The UK continues to be Group’s largest market; net revenue
1
 
fell by 3% although the value of trades increased by 6%. The 
value of trades saw an increase in lower margin institutional 
business offset by a large decrease in indices business.
In Europe net revenue fell by 7% marginally higher than the 
reduction in the value of trades, whilst in APAC & Canada net 
revenue decreased by 11%, again slightly higher than the 
value of trades.
2017 has been a busy and eventful year for CMC Markets, as 
we completed our first full year as a public company. We have 
made strong progress on our five strategic initiatives outlined 
for our investors during the listing process, including signing 
of a partnership with ANZ, launching new products (binaries 
and Knock-Outs) and continuing to develop our award winning 
Next Generation platform. 
Our financial performance has been lower than last year driven 
by lower client activity resulting from an unusual lack of market 
volatility for large parts of the year. However, active client 
numbers and client assets have continued to increase. I am 
therefore confident that we have the right foundations in place 
for the business moving forwards.
The big industry event of the year, which was outside our 
control, was the decision of a number of European regulators  
to announce changes or commence consultations around client 
appropriateness, minimum retail margins, risk warning 
amendments, client incentive schemes and marketing of 
leveraged products. 
Our primary focus has been on the consultations within our 
core markets, in particular the UK and Germany where the 
consultation period took place from December 2016 through  
to March 2017, and we have made thorough and detailed 
responses. These consultations were initiated as a result of 
low-quality providers applying low levels of regulatory 
compliance, questionable sales practices and irresponsible 
behaviour, primarily from overseas jurisdictions. CMC Markets 
has always had a strong focus on compliance and service and  
I am confident that by working with regulators, in the long term 
the Group and the industry will emerge in a stronger position.
The recent German regulatory consultation has resulted in the 
regulator maintaining its initial position which requires the 
implementation of negative balance protection for retail clients 
by 10 August 2017, whereby clients cannot lose more than 
their account balance. The flexibility of our Next Generation 
platform means that we are able to quickly adapt the platform’s 
functionality to meet these new requirements. We await 
communication of the outcome of the UK consultation.
The other significant event for CMC Markets during the year, 
which was specific to the Group, was being chosen by the 
Australia and New Zealand Bank (“ANZ Bank”) to service their 
stockbroking business, where our technology was one of the 
main catalysts for winning the transaction. The agreement 
means we will transfer and service over 250,000 ANZ Bank 
annual active stockbroking clients from September 2018. CMC 
Markets is already the largest non-bank retail stockbroker in 
Australia and this transaction will propel us to the number two 
position in Australia overall with a 23% market share based on 
ASX trading statistics.
This transaction is expected to be highly profitable for both 
CMC Markets and ANZ Bank once we have fully integrated the 
software and migrated their clients onto our platform which is 
expected to commence in September 2018. Combined with our 
existing business we will have in excess of 300,000 annually 
active stockbroking retail clients, a number of intermediaries 
and total client assets in excess of A$53 billion. Naturally for a 
deal of this magnitude, although revenue streams will not begin 
for over a year, a project is underway to ensure that the 
transaction is a success. We are developing additional 
stockbroking platform functionality, and increasing the property 
and hardware capacity needed to support the anticipated rise in 
trading activity and staffing required to service the client base.
CMC Markets targets experienced clients through a more 
feature rich trading platform and excellent client service. 
Our award-winning, proprietary Next Generation platform 
was specifically built to attract more experienced clients and, 
more importantly, to retain them. We aim to have a long 
relationship with our clients and this has been achieved as 
illustrated through the fact that approximately 32% of our 
active clients have been with us for over three years which  
is significantly higher than the industry average. 
In addition to our Next Generation platform, we employ 
experienced sales trading teams that are available to speak 
to clients any time and keep them updated on market 
movements. We also target experienced stockbroking clients 
through our Pro platform in Australia. Overall globally we 
won 34 awards for service, platform and technology during 
the year.

Strategic progress
Despite the regulatory uncertainty, we continue to focus on our 
clear strategy to grow the business in the future around five 
strategic initiatives, and underpinning each of these is our 
continuing focus on client service, innovation and technology. 
When looking solely at financial performance, it has been a 
mixed year for the initiatives, but we are continuing to make 
progress across each of them, and will continue to refine them 
as the regulatory outlook becomes clear.
In our established markets, the lacklustre market activity has 
been the main driver of lower revenue by reducing the number 
of trading opportunities for existing and returning business. In 
addition, our increasing marketing spend has also not had the 
expected impact on new accounts, with cost per acquisition flat 
on the prior year. 
Regarding new markets and developing regions, our Poland 
office has shown good growth since its launch in October 2015, 
but in size it remains immaterial to the Group at present with  
a contribution of 1% of net revenue. Despite regulatory change 
in France, another year of growth has been achieved. We have 
also incorporated an education entity in China in readiness to 
open an office in Shanghai in the first few months of the new 
financial year.
From a digital perspective we have focussed on our mobile 
marketing capabilities, whilst also continuing to improve 
websites and the client journey.
Our institutional business, where we offer white and grey label 
and API
1
 connectivity to banks and brokers worldwide, 
continues to grow and CMC Markets had 154 active 
institutional relationships during the year, an increase of 43% 
against the prior year. This growth in clients contributed to a 
38% increase in net revenue to £22.7 million.
Throughout the year we have continued to make improvements 
and enhance our award winning Next Generation technology. 
Innovation is core to the Group and during the year we 
successfully launched our full binary offering, the ‘Knock-Out’ 
product in Germany and continued to improve our API
1
 offering 
to institutional clients. In the coming months the platform will 
be upgraded to HTML5 which will help to provide additional 
flexibility in the future, as well as maintain our leading position 
in technology against our peers.
Having returned as the Group’s full time CEO in 2013, the hard 
work in developing our technology, platform and premium client 
strategy is giving us a clear advantage. Our technology 
innovation is hugely valuable and important to our clients and 
our business. It is key to our future growth and scalability and 
we continue to invest in technology as a platform for our 
success. Owning and developing the key components of our 
platform software means we are able to innovate rapidly, driving 
our business forward and responding to the needs of our clients 
and our regulators.
In the last year or so I have visited our offices in Australia, 
New Zealand, Singapore, Germany, Austria, Dubai (major 
partner) and there continue to be many opportunities around 
the world for us as a business. 
I would like to thank our staff for their continued hard work and 
dedication throughout the year. We have very talented people 
across all areas of the Group and their commitment is key to our 
future success.
I would also like to thank our clients for their continued support. 
We strive to provide the best levels of service and a great 
trading experience to our clients, and during the year I have met 
many of our clients from across the globe. The feedback we get 
is invaluable and vital to our ongoing success, ensuring we meet 
or exceed our clients’ needs. 
I believe that becoming a public company in 2016 was the right 
decision for the business, as there is no doubt that being listed 
provides us with additional opportunities. Some of the 
institutions and clients we are speaking to would only work with 
us if we were a public company.
It has been a transitional year and I am looking forward to our 
future. Over the coming year the regulatory uncertainty will 
reduce and we can continue to move forward. These are 
exciting times for the Group as we progress our diversification 
across different continents, products and technology. For now 
the sector is shrouded in uncertainty around regulatory change, 
but for CMC Markets development and innovation continue as 
they have done for 27 years and I firmly believe that the Group 
will be a long term beneficiary of the expected improvements in 
the industry in the future.

Business review
Our business
CMC Markets is a leading global provider of online and mobile 
trading, servicing both retail and institutional clients. The 
company enables clients to trade over 10,000 financial 
instruments including indices, commodities, FX and equities 
through its multi award-winning Next Generation trading 
platform, supported by sophisticated charting, competitive 
pricing and automated execution.
Clients can trade the markets via contracts for difference 
(CFDs), financial spread bets (UK and Ireland only) and binaries. 
The Group also offers a stockbroking service in Australia.
Revenues are generated through a combination of transactional 
spreads, financing income, commissions and trading income 
arising from clients’ trading activities. Our risk management 
strategy is based on highly-automated flow management, 
dynamically hedging net client exposures and risk. The level of 
revenue is predominantly influenced by the number of clients 
actively trading and the value of those trades.

CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Strategic report Spread bet
The Group’s spread betting product is offered exclusively in the 
UK and Ireland as profits from spread betting are currently free 
from capital gains tax and stamp duty in these jurisdictions. 
Spread betting provides similar economic benefits to those 
experienced when investing in an underlying asset, but without 
the costs and limitations associated with physical ownership. 
With a spread bet a client bets a specific stake size per point 
movement of an instrument, rather than trading a specific 
number of shares or units. Our spread betting instruments 
allow a client to take long or short positions. As spread betting 
is a leveraged product, losses can exceed deposits. 
Example 
If a client feels that the price of a particular instrument is likely 
to fall, they can place a sell bet or ‘go short’ . Conversely, if they 
believed that the price will go up, they can place a buy bet, or ‘go 
long’ . If the market moved in the direction they predicted, they 
make a profit. If the market moves in the opposite direction to 
what they predicted, they make a loss. 
When you spread bet, you buy or sell an amount per point 
movement, such as £5 per point, which is known as your ‘stake’ . 
For every point the instrument’s price moves in your favour, you 
gain a multiple of your stake. For every point the price moves 
against you, you lose a multiple of your stake.
CFD
A CFD is a cash-settled investment based on currencies, 
commodities, treasuries, indices and shares, providing economic 
benefits similar to an investment in an underlying asset without 
certain costs and limitations associated with physical ownership. 
A CFD is a leveraged product which has the potential to magnify 
profits as well as losses. In the UK, CFD trades currently do not 
incur stamp duty tax charges, in contrast to trades in traditional 
financial investments, such as equity securities. Our clients can 
trade in fractions of units per CFD, and we charge commission 
on CFD trades for equity shares while there is a spread charge 
for all other asset classes. Our CFD instruments allow a client to 
take long or short positions. As a CFD is a leveraged product, the 
Group requires varying levels of margin to be posted in respect 
of the full value of a client’s position. Margins vary depending 
on a client’s position and the type of instrument in which the 
client invests.
Example 
If a client believes that the price of a particular instrument 
is likely to fall, they could place a sell trade or ‘go short’ . 
Conversely, if they think the price will rise, they could place a buy 
trade or ’go long’ . If the market moved in the direction they 
predicted, they would make a profit. If the market moved in the 
opposite direction, they would make a loss. When you trade 
CFDs, you buy or sell a number of units. For every point the 
price of the instrument moves in your favour, you gain based on 
the number of units you have bought or sold. For every point the 
price moves against you, you make a loss.

Stockbroking (Australia only)
CMC Markets offers Australian clients the opportunity to trade Australian shares on the ASX and SSX. Clients can choose from a wide 
variety of investment instruments, including shares, managed funds, warrants and ETFs. The Group offers two stockbroking platforms: 
the Standard platform, which provides everyday self-directed investors with advanced tools and research; and the Pro platform, which 
gives frequent traders integrated access to institutional-like trading tools and professional charting.
Binaries and Countdowns
Countdowns is a limited risk product that enables clients to 
place trades over a range of short-term timeframes. The client 
decides the timeframe starting from time of trade as opposed 
to selecting a pre-determined expiry time. Countdowns has 
been rolled out internationally to the majority of markets where 
the Group has an office and has proven popular with both new 
and existing clients.
The Group also offers binaries in the majority of its 
international markets. With binaries, the client’s risk and 
potential profit are determined at the point of trade entry. 
Clients are offered the opportunity to place a trade depending 
on whether they believe a particular market’s price will be 
above or below a certain level at a specific time in the future. If 
their trade is “in the money” at the end of the specified 
timeframe, they will be credited with the amount agreed at the 
point of trade entry; if they are “out of the money” they will 
forfeit their stake. Clients also have the opportunity to close a 
binary trade prior to the time of expiry as the odds of the 
instrument being above or below a pre-determined level 
change when the price in the underlying market changes. The 
Group offers four types of binaries: Ladder, One T ouch, Up/
Down and Range across 22 instruments including certain 
indices, commodities and FX pairs.
*  Binary prices are always quoted between 0 & 100. If the price is closer to 100 then we are pricing the event as more likely to occur, while if the price is closer to 0 
then we are pricing the event as less likely to occur.
  If you believe the binary event will not occur you can sell the binary. In the example above you would sell the binary at 18.5 and if the event does not happen your 
profit is equal to (18.5 – 0) x £5  £92.50. If the event did occur then your loss is equal to (18.5 – 100) x £5  -£407.50.
**  Binary positions may be closed partially or fully prior to the binary expiry except for during the ‘Pre-Close’ period which may be different for each product and expiry.

* If the Countdowns price finishes equal with the settlement price at the end of the expiry, the trade will end in a draw and a percentage of your stake is returned. The 
percentage of your stake returned will differ depending on the product traded and expiry.
 If you believe the settlement price will finish below the Countdowns price at the end of the expiry then you can choose to place a ‘Below’ trade. If the price finished below at 
expiry then you would receive a payout of £36 ((£20 x 80%) + £20 initial stake). If it finished above then your loss would be limited to your stake size of £20.

Our strategic objectives
 
Increase the client base in established markets
pportunity Progress Priorities for 2017/18
The established markets of the UK, 
Australia and Germany generate a 
significant part of the Group’s 
revenue, and given the size of the 
markets, they also offer the greatest 
absolute growth opportunities. This 
means that we continue to focus on 
developing brand and product 
awareness with the aim of becoming 
the choice provider to new clients in 
these regions and offer the premium 
proposition required to attract 
clients from competitors.

in the UK
• Maintained number one market 
position in Germany
• Number one provider to high 
value clients in Australia
• Develop platform further to

business
 
Expand into new markets and grow developing regions
pportunity Progress Priorities for 2017/18
New regions and developing regions 
offer an opportunity for revenue 
growth with marginal additional cost 
given the scalability of the business. 
Markets where CMC currently 
operate but have a small market 
share have received a focus on 
expansion opportunities, and new 
regions where CMC has no presence 
but the potential client base exists 
are regularly reviewed and offices are 
being considered where appropriate.

Polish office in its first full year
• Continuing improvements  
in the performance of the  
French office
• China education entity 
incorporated
• Open Shanghai office during 
the first half of 2017/18

CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Strategic report Technology and operational excellence
T echnology and operations have always been key to the success of CMC Markets and this has won the business recognition 
as the leader in our industry for innovation and service. Our aim is to provide our clients with the ability to take ownership 
of their personal financial investments. Our platform has been built to provide complete control and flexibility. 
Progress
We have continued to invest in infrastructure and technology to ensure the platform has the capacity to cope with increased 
demand as the business grows, including capital expenditure of £3.5m on new data storage hardware and software. 
Protection from cyber-attacks continues to be a key area for the Group with a continual focus on protection for the business, our 
clients and platform. 
Our investment in technology and operational processes allows us to expand with ease in the future, providing scalability, 
combined with exceptional dependability and speed, while driving down marginal costs as active clients and trading volumes grow.
Trading risk management
Part of CMC Markets’ success is our global trading risk management capability, dealing with high volumes of sophisticated 
multi-asset retail flow benefiting from a significant proportion of natural aggregation. Our strong capital and liquidity 
balances allow us to retain an element of net client portfolio risk, transferring the remaining risk through hedging to our 
external counterparties. This delivers a highly automated transactional based risk management strategy, allowing the 
business to deliver consistent and sustainable returns irrespective of underlying client performance and driving long term 
client engagement. 
Risk appetite is controlled via strong governance and real time controls and oversight, within tightly defined risk parameters 
approved by the Board.
Progress
Continuing enhancements to our trading tools during the year have further improved our highly automated transactional 
based risk management strategy. The annual trends of lower revenue variability and a lower percentage of loss days have 
continued. 
The risk management framework ensures net exposures are managed within asset class level notional based limits. The risk 
limits along with our regulatory requirement, broker margins and FX net open position levels are all computed and displayed 
real-time in the dealer dashboards.

Financial strength
We aim to maintain our secure capital and liquidity structure, ensuring that it is appropriate for the future growth and 
success of the business. This includes a long-term level of capital to withstand the demands of financial fluctuations in the 
markets and access to a healthy level of surplus liquid resources in line with the size of our business and the growth 
opportunities which exist.
Progress
The Group monitors its capital position on a real time basis. The Group’s capital position has increased compared with the 
prior year. (See Financial Review, page 45). The Group’s total available liquidity position has improved again during the year 
(see Financial Review, page 47) and the available credit facility demonstrates the robust liquidity profile of the Group. The 
facility provides additional capacity to support the Group’s strategy of maintaining excess liquidity to fund both growth and 
client trading peaks.

CMC Markets is committed to recruiting, developing, retaining and motivating exceptional people who are talented, 
innovative and focussed on delivering excellence.
The Group operates and encourages a collaborative environment, through knowledge sharing and ideas generation with 
a focus on quality and delivery.

CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report CMC Markets plc CMC Markets has a responsibility to maximise shareholder returns, and this is 
aligned with striving to provide clients with the best service and platform, 
safety of deposits and best execution. Whilst doing this the Group also takes 
account of the needs of key stakeholder groups, including our employees, our 
suppliers and our local communities. This is achieved not only through the 
company having financial strength but also through investing in our employees 
and wider social practices.
Our people
572

 (2016: 576) people work for the Group globally and the Group is 
committed to providing a safe, challenging, progressive and innovative place 
to work. The quality of our staff is essential to the success of the Group. 
We offer competitive employment packages, including a flexible benefit 
scheme to enable the Group to attract and retain the best available talent. 
In addition to the senior management and critical talent equity incentives, 
since listing, all UK employees are now offered the on-going opportunity 
to contribute to an HMRC eligible Share Incentive Plan and during the 
latest financial year, similar equity or cash-equivalent schemes have been 
rolled out globally.
There is regular communication to staff at all levels through multiple channels 
including town halls, global e-mails and publications on the intranet. These 
communications raise awareness of the latest developments and factors 
affecting the Group. In addition, senior management encourage dialogue with 
employees through an open door policy. 
Diversity
As a Group, we are committed to having a diverse workforce, and believe that 
diversity brings valuable experience and skills to the business, boosting the 
productivity of our employees. The Group provides a number of 
apprenticeship and graduate positions that offer individuals the opportunity 
to obtain new skills, as well as develop existing skillsets. The Group also 
provides learning and development opportunities for all employees, both 
on-the-job and through more formal training methods, including the senior 
management team, in order to build critical capabilities across the Group 
by specifically developing our high-potential talent and driving business 
performance. We acknowledge that the diversity of the Group can be 
improved, particularly with respect to female representation at leadership 
level, and the Board monitors this on an on-going basis. 
Another example of CMC Markets championing diversity is our partnership 
with Leonard Cheshire Disability (LCD) and their Change 100 programme. 
A graduate student with a disability will be matched with opportunities within 
the business and they will be given a London living wage for three months 
work experience. This commitment clearly demonstrates the value CMC 
Markets place in young talent and especially those young people who have to 
overcome difficulties each and every day. The LCD Change 100 team provide 
support to CMC Markets and the candidate throughout the three months.

religions, cultures, and physical abilities. CMC Markets seeks to establish a culture that values meritocracy, openness, fairness

is always to recruit the best from the broadest applicant pool. All candidates have the right to expect that they will be respected and 
valued for the contribution that they bring to the Group.
We are committed to giving full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons as well as providing continuing 
employment to existing employees who become disabled during their employment where practicable. Where existing employees 
become disabled, whether temporarily or permanently, we adapt the working environment and where possible offer flexible 
working, training and graduated back-to-work plans in conjunction with occupational health to ensure the retention of employees.
Human rights
CMC Markets conducts business in an ethical manner and adheres to policies which support recognised human rights principles. 
The Group slavery and human trafficking statement can be found on the Group website (www.cmcmarkets.com/group).
Health and safety

maintaining a safe and healthy working environment. Health and safety audits and risk assessments are carried out regularly.
Clients
Clients are critical to the success of the business and we strive to deliver a high quality and efficient service to all of them. Client 
service is central to our strategy and is described in more depth in the Business Review on page 14.
The Group fully segregates all retail client funds whether required by regulation or not. All funds are held separately in designated 
accounts to ensure that in the event of company default, client funds are safe and can be quickly returned to clients. 
CFD’s and spread bets are leveraged products and losses can exceed initial deposits. In order to help protect clients from suffering 
excessive losses, most client positions are automatically liquidated once margin has been reduced to agreed levels. Within the

mode, allowing clients to effectively manage their risk. 
We also offer our clients a range of education opportunities through weekly and monthly webinars and seminars, as well as our 
Trader Development programme which offers a wide range of in-platform, on-demand education and tailored market commentary.
We acknowledge that our products are not suitable for everyone so we follow strict guidelines when marketing our products, 
ensuring that our marketing material is fair, clear and not misleading. When clients open accounts we assess whether the 
product is appropriate for them by asking a number of key questions, covering trading experience, income and savings.

Scope 1 and 2 global emissions in accordance with the Environmental Reporting Guidelines as issued by the Department for 
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra).
The running of our two UK data centres accounts for the majority of the Group’s electricity usage, and we continue to look for 
opportunities to improve their efficiency and performance and the infrastructure within them. Building on the work done in prior 
years, including moving the primary site to a new state-of-the-art facility outside of London during 2015 and installing cold aisle 
containment in our secondary data centre, we have continued to make considerable investment in our IT infrastructure over the 
past year. The purchase of new storage infrastructure for £3.5 million has reduced the footprint of this hardware by more than 75% 
and the expected power usage by half. All decommissioned equipment is recycled or disposed of in a secure and environmentally 
sound manner. 
We are also mindful of and have consideration for the environmental impact of each of our global offices and have a clear 
preference for energy efficient rated office buildings. In this respect our UK head office is situated in a BREEAM (Building  
Research Establishments Environmental Assessment Method) rated building whose management team continually strives 
to increase sustainability.
We have well-established waste management initiatives in place to effectively manage and reduce waste, which have been 
implemented across the organisation. We recycle all paper, cardboard waste, aluminium cans and plastics and also operate 
a managed print solution to help control paper usage. We use a registered waste disposal contractor for their strict compliance 
with relevant waste legislation.
Basis of preparation
Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in alignment with records used for the production of the consolidated financial 
statements for the relevant accounting period. We have used emission factors from Defra’s Greenhouse Gas conversion factors 
for Company Reporting 2016 and have determined the Scope 2 electricity impacts for non-UK electricity from the International 
Energy Agency (IEA). All emissions required under the Companies Act 2006 are included except where stated and include 
Scope 1 (direct emissions from gas consumption) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased electricity) emissions, but 
exclude Scope 3 (other emissions from business travel and waste) emissions. Global diesel usage for backup generators at one 
office location has been excluded from the report given that it is not material to our carbon emissions. The figures include 
emissions from all global offices.

Financial review
Summary income statement 
Summary 
Net operating income for the year reduced by £8.6 million (5%) to £160.8 million, primarily driven by subdued markets during the 
year presenting fewer trading opportunities for our clients. Second half performance was higher than in the first half, assisted by 
growing active client numbers and improved trading opportunities for our clients, including the November US presidential election 
and January’s inauguration. 
Active client numbers have risen by 2,753 (5%) to 60,082, mainly as a result of higher marketing spend during the year driving 
retail client acquisition, as well as the expansion of the institutional offering. However, revenue per active client fell by £311 (11%) 
to £2,517 due to a fall in the value of client trades, which was £55 billion (3%) lower than prior year at £2,016 billion. Our major 
asset class indices, was the driver of this decrease with the value of client trades down £244 billion (18%) to £1,124 billion. Equity 
indices were generally trading within narrow bands during the period, resulting in clients having more limited trading opportunities. 
The value of client trades in other asset classes grew during the period, offsetting much of the decrease.
T otal costs decreased by £6.8 million (6%) to £112.3 million. Excluding exceptional costs of £12.1 million in the prior year, total 
costs increased by £5.3 million (5%). The underlying increase was driven by higher personnel costs, caused by the annualised cost 
increase associated with investment in personnel during the prior year, increased marketing activity, and higher share based 
payments. These increases were partially mitigated by lower performance related pay.
EBITDA and underlying EBITDA decreased by £5.2 million (9%) and £14.2 million (20%) respectively to £55.0 million.
Underlying profit before tax decreased by £13.9 million (22%) to £48.5 million, as a result of the £8.6 million decrease in net 
operating income and £5.3 million increase in underlying total costs explained above, and as a result our underlying profit before 
tax margin decreased by 6.7% to 30.1%. 
Statutory profit before tax decreased by £4.9 million (9%) to £48.5 million and profit before tax margin
1
 decreased by 1.4% from 
31.5% to 30.1%. 
It is anticipated that regulatory change is likely to take place in two of our three established markets during the next financial year, 
although this has had no impact on client activity in the current period.

Stockbroking
The Australian stockbroking business has again significantly improved on the prior year’s performance, with revenue up  
49% at £7.8 million (2016: £5.2 million), aided by a lower central bank rate, continued supportive market conditions and the 
benefit of a strengthening Australian dollar. Positive performance was also evidenced through both strong client acquisition 
(20% increase in new clients
1
 year-on-year) and improved cross-sell delivered from fundamental improvements in on-boarding 
and digital marketing. In particular, the latest release of our award winning
2
 HTML 5 ‘Pro Platform’ helped contribute to a 43% 
improvement in volumes. 
In addition to the numerous intermediary and broader wholesale deals executed in the year, the business signed a major 
stockbroking partnership with ANZ Bank to service the entire ANZ Share Investing (“ANZSI”) client base. CMC will provide 
these clients with leading technology, customer service and execution via an ANZ-branded stockbroking platform with revenue 
being shared between CMC and ANZ Bank from September 2018 onwards when clients are migrated. CMC are developing 
additional stockbroking platform functionality and will be investing in property and IT infrastructure in order to support the 
rise in trading activity.
Interest income
The low interest rate environment remained largely the same as the prior year and interest income remained stable at £1.7 million 
(2016: £1.8 million). The majority of the Group’s interest income is mainly earned through our segregated client deposits in our 
Australia, New Zealand and stockbroking subsidiaries.
Other income
All other income in the prior year of £3.1 million relates to a litigation settlement and given its one-off nature, the Group classed the 
income as exceptional.
Expenses
T otal operating costs before exceptional items increased £5.6 million (6%) to £105.8 million, driven by higher salary costs, share 
based payment charges, sales and marketing expenditure and IT costs, offset by lower performance related pay.
Exceptional costs of £12.1 million in the prior year relate to the London Stock Exchange listing in February 2016.

UK
The value of client trades in the UK was 6% ahead of the prior year at £793 billion (2016: £746 billion), driven by the institutional 
business which rose by 76% to £224 billion (2016: £127 billion) following strong growth across all delivery channels, most 
noticeably API. However the value of client trades in the retail business was down 8% at £569 billion (2016: £619 billion) through 
reduced trading opportunities. The annual Investment Trends study
1
 highlighted an increase in primary market share for CMC 
Markets to 8%, although active clients were broadly flat for the year at 17,142 (2016: 17,268). Revenue per active client was 3% 
lower than the prior year at £3,558 (2016: £3,652).
Europe
Europe comprises offices in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. The value of client trades in Europe 
was 6% lower than the prior year at £632 billion (2016: £672 billion). While active clients were 4% higher at 22,503 (2016: 
21,714), revenue per active client was 10% lower than the prior year at £2,012 (2016: £2,234) due to lower client trading and an 
increase in active clients in the latter part of the year. A market leading position was maintained in Germany with a 16% share of 
primary accounts according to the Investment Trends survey
2
 published in June 2016. There was also a strong performance from 
France with the value of client trades up 26% from the prior year and active clients up 10% over the same period. The Poland office 
continues to grow with results ahead of expectation.
APAC & Canada
Our APAC & Canada business services clients from our Sydney, Auckland, Singapore and T oronto offices along with other regions 
where we have no physical presence. The value of client trades was 10% lower at £591 billion (2016: £653 billion). Despite the 
decrease in overall trading activity, active client numbers were up 11% at 20,437 (2016: 18,347).
CMC increased its primary market share and doubled its net promoter score to remain the number two FX provider in Australia as 
well as maintaining the position of number one CFD provider for high value clients
3
. In addition, the Group retained the number 
one position as CFD provider to high value clients in Singapore
3
. This demonstrates success in the Group’s strategy  
goal to acquire and support a high value client base. These independent reports also showed that CMC Markets had the  
highest prompted brand awareness in the Australian market, demonstrating that the brand profile is continuing to build strength in 
the region.

Non-current assets 
The Group is committed to maintaining its Next Generation trading platform and these costs are expensed as incurred. The 
majority of intangible assets relate to the net book value of software licences rather than net capitalised internal development 
costs. Expenditure on the trading platform goes hand-in-hand with the hardware required to support trading activity and this has 
been the main driver of the increase in property, plant and equipment over the period.
Current assets 
Trade and other receivables relate mainly to client receivables from stockbroking positions yet to settle, prepayments, amounts 
due from our segregated client accounts on the next working day and other client debtors. The year-on-year rise is as a result of 
higher stockbroking positions yet to settle. Amount due from brokers relates to cash held at brokers either for initial margin or to 
reduce interest payable on the Group’s overall hedge position. Cash and cash equivalents have decreased during the course of the 
year with a proportion being deposited with brokers to fund growing margin requirements. Financial investments relate to the 
FCA BIPRU12 requirement to hold eligible assets against potential liquidity stress.
Current liabilities 
Trade and other payables consist mainly of accruals and deferred income, amounts due on stockbroking trades yet to settle, and 
amounts due to clients in relation to title transfer funds. 
Non-current liabilities 
Trade and other payables relate mainly to the deferred unwinding of lease incentives on our London property and the increase in 
borrowings is due to a new lease agreement associated with IT equipment purchases.
Staff costs
Staff costs increased £3.3 million (7%) to £49.4 million, largely caused by a rise in wages and salaries of £5.4 million (15%) 
due to the annualised impact of investment in personnel in the prior year, and higher share based payments which increased 
by £3.3 million. These increases were offset by a decrease of £5.3 million (60%) in performance related pay and decrease of 
£0.1 million in contract staff costs.

Contract staff costs 1.7 1.8

Sales and marketing costs
Sales and marketing costs increased £3.5 million (19%) to £21.8 million during the year as the Group continued to invest in its 
brand profile and growing the client base through higher expenditure across digital channels. Brand activity included the continuing 
sponsorship of both the Land Rover BAR America’s Cup sailing team and the New South Wales Waratahs rugby team in Australia.
Aside from the brand spend, the main increases in expenditure were seen in our established markets of the UK, Germany 
and Australia. 
Other expenses
IT costs increased £2.7 million (21%) to £15.4 million, due to additional expenditure in new services, including the cyber security 
area, increased market data costs and inflationary pressures caused mainly by Sterling depreciation.
Other costs decreased by £4.1 million (34%) to £7.9 million, with the main contributors being lower bad debt expenses due to more 
benign market conditions, lower irrecoverable sales tax and the effect of favourable balance sheet revaluation.
Taxation
The effective tax rate for the year was 19% (2016: 20%). The majority of the Group’s profits are taxed in the UK, which had a 
corporation tax rate of 20% (2016: 20%). The Group benefited from higher utilisation of Australian corporation tax credits in the 
year, and in the prior year the effective tax rate was impacted by disallowable exceptional costs associated with the listing.
Proﬁt after tax for the year
The decrease in profit after tax for the year of £3.3 million (8%) to £39.2 million (2016: £42.5 million) was due to both lower net 
operating income and higher underlying operating costs, explained earlier in the financial review.
Dividend
Dividends of £23.9 million were paid during the year (2016: £24.9 million), £15.4 million relating to a final dividend for the prior 
year paid in September 2016, with a £8.5 million interim dividend paid in December 2016 in relation to the current year 
performance. The Group remains committed to a dividend policy of paying 50% of underlying post-tax profit as dividends, however 
has proposed maintaining the year ended 31 March 2016 ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017.

was £317.5 million at 31 March 2017 (2016: £230.7 million). Client money is held by the Group in trust for its retail clients and is 
not included in total available liquidity.
Client funds represent the capacity for our clients to trade and offer an underlying indication to the health of our client base. 
Client money governance
The Group segregates all money held by it on behalf of retail clients in accordance with applicable client money regulations in 
countries in which it operates. The majority of client money requirements fall under the CASS rules of the FCA. All segregated 
client funds are held in dedicated client money bank accounts with major banks that meet strict internal criteria and are held 
separately from the Group’s own money.
The Group has comprehensive client money processes and procedures in place to ensure client money is identified and protected 
at the earliest possible point after receipt as well as governance structures which ensure such activities are effective in protecting 
client money. The Group’s governance structure is explained further on pages 56 to 66.
Regulatory capital resources
For the year under review, CMC Markets was supervised on a consolidated basis by the FCA. The Group maintained a significant 
capital surplus over the regulatory requirement at all times.
The Group’s total capital resources increased due to the rise in retained earnings relating to audited 2017 profits and lower 
intangible assets on the balance sheet. 
At 31 March 2017 the Group had a total capital ratio of 30.2% (31 March 2016 31.2%). The following table summarises the 
Group’s capital adequacy position at the year end. The Group’s approach to capital management is described in note 29 to the 
financial statements.

Liquidity
The Group has access to the following sources of liquidity that make up total available liquidity:
• Own funds. The primary source of liquidity for the Group. It represents the funds that the business has generated historically, 
including any unrealised gains / losses on open hedging positions. All cash held on behalf of segregated clients is excluded. Own 
funds consists mainly of cash and cash equivalents and also includes investments in UK government securities which are held 
to meet the Group’s liquid asset buffer (LAB – as set by the FCA). These UK government securities are BIPRU 12.7 eligible 
securities and are available to meet liabilities which fall due in periods of stress.
• Title Transfer Funds (TTFs). This represents funds received from professional clients and eligible counterparties (as defined in 
the FCA Handbook) that are held under a Title Transfer Collateral Agreement (TTCA); a means by which a professional client 
or eligible counterparty may agree that full ownership of such funds is unconditionally transferred to the Group. The Group 
considers these funds as an ancillary source of liquidity and places no reliance on its stability.
• Available committed facility. (Off balance sheet liquidity). The Group has access to a facility of up to £40.0 million  
(2016: £40.0 million) in order to fund any potential fluctuations in margins required to be posted at brokers to support the 
risk management strategy. The maximum amount of the facility available at any one time is dependent upon the initial margin 
requirements at brokers and margin received from clients. The facility consists of a one-year term facility of £20.0 million and 
a three-year term facility of £20.0 million, both of which will be renewed during June 2017. There was no drawdown on the 
facility at 31 March 2017 (2016: £nil).
The Group’s use of total available liquidity resources consist of:
• Blocked cash. Amounts held to meet the requirements of local market regulators and amounts held at overseas subsidiaries in 
excess of local segregated client requirements to meet potential future client requirements.

CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Strategic report Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group’s business activities naturally expose it to strategic, 
financial and operational risks inherent in the nature of the 
business it undertakes and the financial, market and regulatory 
environments in which it operates. The Group recognises the 
importance of understanding and managing these risks and that 
it cannot place a cap or limit on all of the risks to which the 
Group is exposed. However, effective risk management ensures 
that risks are managed to an acceptable level.
The Board, through its Group Risk Committee, is ultimately 
responsible for the implementation of an appropriate risk 
strategy, which has been achieved using an integrated 
Risk Management Framework. The main areas covered  
by the Risk Management Framework are:
• identification, evaluation and monitoring of the principal 
risks to which the Group is exposed;
• setting the Risk Appetite of the Board in order to achieve 
its strategic objectives; and
• establishment and maintenance of governance, policies, 
systems and controls to ensure the Group is operating 
within the stated Risk Appetite.
The Board has put in place a governance structure which 
is appropriate for the operations of an online retail financial 
services group and is aligned to the delivery of the Group’s 
strategic objectives. The structure is regularly reviewed and 
monitored and any changes are subject to Board approval. 
Furthermore, management regularly considers updates  
to the processes and procedures to embed good corporate 
governance throughout CMC Markets. 
As part of the Group Risk Management Framework, the 
business is subject to independent assurance by internal audit 
(third line of defence). The use of independent compliance 
monitoring, risk reviews (second line of defence) and risk and 
control self-assessments (first line of defence) provide 
additional support to the integrated assurance programme and 
ensure that the Group is effectively identifying, managing and 
reporting its risks.
The Group continues to make enhancements to its Risk 
Framework and governance to provide a more structured 
approach to identifying and managing the risks to which  
it is exposed. 
The Board has undertaken a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group. T op and emerging risks are considered 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity and how they are managed 
or mitigated (Code C.2.1). These are outlined below and details 
of financial risks and their management are set out in note 29 to 
the financial statements.
T op and emerging risks during the year, which form either 
a subset of one or multiple principal risks, and continue  
to be at the forefront of the Group discussions are:
• UK and Germany regulatory change: there have been 
significant developments in this area during the financial 
year which could materially affect the Group’s profitability, 
in particular consultation papers issued by the UK’s FCA 
and Germany’s BaFin, with the outcome of the latter 
recently communicated. The change in regulatory 
sentiment has been regularly discussed at Board, Board 
Committee and Executive Committees throughout the 
year and is actively monitored.
• UK’s exit from the European Union (rexit): the potential 
impact of Brexit is being closely monitored and 
contingencies discussed and planned which would mitigate 
regulatory change and strategic/business model risk of 
operating in the European Union.
Further information on the structure and workings of Board 
and Management committees is included in the Corporate 
Governance report on page 58.

Financial risks Credit and 
counterparty 
risk
The risk of a client, 
custodian or counterparty 
failing to fulfil contractual 
obligations, including 
settlement, resulting 
in financial loss for the 
Group. Specifically:
Client credit risk:
Financial losses may be 
incurred in cases where 
the adverse price move 
exceeds the margin that 
a client holds to maintain 
their position, followed 
by the client defaulting 
against their contractual 
obligations to pay 
the deficit.
Counterparty credit risk:
A financial institution 
failing to meet or 
defaulting on their 
obligations in accordance 
with agreed terms.
Client credit risk:
The Group’s management of client credit risk is significantly 
aided by automatic liquidation functionality where margin 
levels are continuously reviewed. If they fall below pre 
agreed levels, the positions held on the account will 
automatically be closed out.
Other platform functionality mitigates risk further:
• Tiered margin requires clients to hold more collateral 
against bigger or higher risk positions.
• Mobile phone access allowing clients to manage their 
portfolios on the move.
• Guaranteed Stop Loss Orders allow clients to remove 
their chance of debt from their position(s). 
However, after mitigations, there is a residual risk that the 
Group could incur losses relating to clients moving into debit 
balances if there is a market gap.
Counterparty credit risk:
Risk management is carried out by a central Liquidity 
Risk Management (LRM) team under the Counterparty 
Concentration Risk Policy, approved by the Board of 
Directors. 
Mitigation is achieved by:
• Monitoring concentration levels to counterparties 
and reporting these internally/externally on a monthly/
quarterly basis.
• Monitoring the credit ratings and Credit Default Swap 
(CDS) spreads of counterparties and reporting 
internally on a weekly basis. 
• Further information is available in note 29 to the 
financial statements.
Financial 
reporting risk
The risk that financial, 
statutory or regulatory 
reports are submitted late, 
incomplete or are 
inaccurate.
• Robust process of checking and oversight in place 
to ensure accuracy.
• Knowledgeable and experienced staff undertake 
and overview the relevant processes. 
Insurance risk The risk that an insurance 
claim by the Group is 
declined (in full or in part) 
or there is insufficient 
insurance coverage.
• Reputable broker deals with insurance and ensures 
cover is placed with financially secure insurers.
• Comprehensive levels of cover maintained.
• Rigorous claim management procedures are in 
place with the broker.
• The Board’s appetite for uninsured risk is low and  
as a result the Group has put in place established 
comprehensive levels of Insurance cover.
Category Risk Description Management and mitigation
Business and 
strategic risks
Regulatory 
change
The risk that changes to the 
regulatory framework the 
Group operates in impacts 
the Group performance. 
Such changes could result in 
the Group’s product 
offering becoming less 
profitable, more difficult 
to offer to clients or an 
outright ban on the product 
offering in one or more of 
the countries where the 
Group operates.
• Active dialogue with regulators and industry bodies.
• Monitoring of market and regulator sentiment towards 
the product offering.
• Monitoring by and advice from Compliance department 
on impact of actual and possible regulatory change.
• A business model and proprietary technology that 
is responsive to changes in regulatory requirements.
Acquisitions 
and disposals

acquisitions, disposals 
or other partnership 
arrangements made by the 
Group do not achieve the 
stated strategic objectives 
or that they give rise to on-
going or previously 
unidentified liabilities.
• Robust Corporate Governance structure including 
strong challenge from independent Non-Executive 
Directors.
• Vigorous and independent due diligence process.
• Align and manage the businesses to Group strategy 
as soon as possible after acquisition.
Strategic / 
business 
model risk
The risk of an adverse 
impact resulting from the 
Group’s strategic decision-
making as well as failure to 
exploit strengths or take 
opportunities. It is a risk 
which may cause damage 
or loss, financial or 
otherwise to the Group as 
a whole.
• Strong governance framework established including 
three independent Non-Executive Directors and the 
Chairman sitting on the Board.
• Robust governance, challenge and oversight from 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
• Managing the Group in line with the agreed strategy, 
policies and risk appetite.
• Group Risk is involved in the annual budgeting process.
Reputational 
risk
The risk of damage to the 
Group’s brand or standing 
with shareholders, 
regulators, existing and 
potential clients, the 
industry and the public 
at large.
• The Group is conservative in its approach to 
reputational risk and operates robust controls to ensure 
significant risks to its brand and standing are 
appropriately mitigated. Examples include:
 – Proactive engagement with the Group’s regulators 
and active participation with trade and industry 
bodies.
 – Positive development of media relations with strictly 
controlled media contact.

risks
Business 
change risk
The risk that business 
change projects are 
ineffective, fail to deliver 
stated objectives, or result 
in resources being 
stretched to the detriment 
of business as usual 
activities. Notable 
business change risks for 
the Group are platform 
upgrades and the 
implementation of the 
ANZ Bank stockbroking 
partnership.
• Governance process in place for all business change 
programmes with Executive and Board oversight 
and scrutiny.
• Key users engaged in development and testing of 
all key change programmes.
• Significant post-implementation support, monitoring 
and review procedures in place for all change 
programmes.
• Strategic benefits and delivery of change agenda 
communicated to employees.
Business 
continuity & 
disaster 
recovery risk
The risk that a physical 
business continuity event 
or system failure results 
in a reduced ability or 
inability to perform core 
business activities or 
processes.
• Business continuity oversight provided by Operational 
Risk Function.
• Use of external specialist premises to enhance 
resilience in the event of a disaster recovery or business 
continuity requirement.
• Periodic testing of business continuity processes and 
disaster recovery.
• Prompt response to significant systems failures or 
interruptions.
Financial 
crime risk
Financial crime covers 
a number of unlawful 
activities including fraud 
(first and third party), 
theft, scams, confidence 
tricks, tax evasion, bribery, 
embezzlement, identity 
theft, money laundering, 
forgery, counterfeiting and 
acts of terrorism.
• Adoption of the risk based approach to financial crime, 
including undertaking formal and regular risk 
assessments across global operations.
• Global reporting procedures and surveillance processes 
in place using local compliance and legal expertise.
• Regular and on-going training and awareness 
programme in place for staff at all levels and in 
all jurisdictions.

framework for escalation of issues.
Information 
and data 
security risk

access to or external 
disclosure of client or 
company information, 
including those caused 
by “cyber attacks” .
• Dedicated Information Security & Data Protection 
resource/expertise within the Group.
• T echnical and procedural controls implemented to 
minimise the occurrence of information security and 
data protection breaches.
• Access to information only provided on a “need to 
know” and “least privilege” basis consistent with the 
user’s role and requires appropriate authorisation.
• Key data loss prevention initiatives and regular system 
access reviews implemented across the business. 
Category Risk Description Management and mitigation
Financial risks 
(continued)
Liquidity risk The risk that there is 
insufficient available 
liquidity to meet the 
liabilities of the Group 
as they fall due.
Risk management is carried out by a central Liquidity Risk 
Management (LRM) team under policies approved by the 
Board and in-line with the FCA’s ILAS regime. The Group 
utilises a combination of liquidity forecasting and stress 
testing to identify any potential liquidity risk both during 
normal and stressed conditions. The forecasting and 
stress testing fully incorporates the impact of all liquidity 
regulations in force in each jurisdiction and other 
impediments to the free movement of liquidity around  
the Group.
Risk is mitigated by:
• The provision of timely daily, weekly and monthly 
liquidity reporting and real-time broker margin 
requirements to enable strong management and control 
of liquidity resources. 
• A committed bank facility of up to £40 million  
(page 46) to meet short-term liquidity obligations to 
broker counterparties in the event that the Group does 
not have sufficient access to its own cash. 
• A formal Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is in place 
that is designed to aid senior management to assess and 
prioritise actions in a liquidity stress scenario.
For more information see note 29 to the financial statements.
Market risk Market risk is defined as 
the risk that the value of 
our residual portfolio will 
decrease due to changes 
in market risk factors. The 
three standard market risk 
factors are price moves, 
interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates.
Trading risk management monitors and manages the 
exposures it inherits from clients on a real time basis 
and in accordance with Board approved appetite.
CMC Markets predominantly acts as a market maker in 
linear, highly liquid financial instruments in which it can 
easily neutralise all market risk exposure through its prime 
broker (PB) arrangements. This significantly reduces the 
Group’s revenue sensitivity to individual asset classes and 
instruments.
Financial risk management runs stress scenarios on the 
residual portfolio, comprising a number of single and 
combined, company specific and market-wide events in 
order to assess potential financial and capital adequacy 
impacts to ensure the Group can withstand severe moves 
in the risk drivers it is exposed to.

 – Retaining key individuals;
 – Developing personnel capabilities;
 – Optimising continuous professional development;
 – Achieving a reputation as a good employer with 
an equitable remuneration policy.

Board effectiveness
The balance of skills, experience and independence of the Board 
and individual Directors was reviewed as part of the annual 
effectiveness process. All Directors received computer based 
training in 2016 on relevant financial service matters with 
emphasis on the Company’s responsibilities with regard to 
regulation and compliance, as well as attending a seminar on the 
Approved Persons regime. 
A formal evaluation of the effectiveness and structure of 
the Board and Board Committees was conducted in the 
autumn of 2016 in accordance with principle B6 of the Code.  
As Chairman of the Board and of the Nomination Committee 
I will oversee that the actions arising from the evaluation 
process are completed. It is intended that an independent, 
externally facilitated evaluation of the Board will be 
conducted in 2017. 
Shareholder engagement
As Chairman, I am responsible for the effective communication 
between shareholders and the Company and for ensuring the 
Board understand the views of major shareholders. 
I look forward to listening to the views of our shareholders at 
the Company’s 2017 AGM. Board Directors regularly meet 
with a cross section of the Company’s shareholders to ensure 
an ongoing dialogue is maintained and report to the Board on 
the feedback received from shareholders. I will also always 
make myself available to meet any of our shareholders who wish 
to discuss matters regarding the Company. 
A monthly investor relations report is distributed to the Board 
and considered at each Board meeting. The Group is also 
assessing the appointment of an independent shareholder 
engagement company to ensure the views of shareholders 
are clearly and effectively communicated to the Board.

Governance report
Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholders, 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present your 2017 
Group Corporate Governance report. The Board continues 
to recognise that an effective governance framework is 
fundamental in ensuring that the Group remains profitable 
and all Directors are committed to achieving high standards 
of corporate governance.
As the Group enters its second year as a listed company it 
has applied the principles and is compliant with all provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). 
Board composition
The knowledge, skills and experience of the Board Directors has 
been key to the management of the Company as it grows as a 
listed business. A short biography of all Directors can be found 
on pages 59 to 61. 
After completing a formal performance evaluation of the 
individual Board Directors, and in adherence to section B  
of the Code, I can confirm that the Board is deemed to be 
effective. During the evaluation, and on an ongoing basis, 
the training needs of the Directors are considered and each 
Director continues to develop their understanding and 
knowledge of the industry and regulatory developments.
Following a review of my performance as Chairman (led by 
Manjit Wolstenholme, as Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director, and involving Malcolm McCaig and James Richards 
in their capacity as Independent Non-Executive Directors) 
the Board has asked me to remain as Group Chairman 
notwithstanding my service since December 2007, in order 
to maintain continuity throughout this period of regulatory 
uncertainty. However, succession planning for the role of  
Chair of the Board is and will continue to be a priority in the 
coming year.

CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Governance report Governance report A formal effectiveness review was conducted during the period 
and, as stated previously, an externally hosted Board evaluation 
is planned in 2017 where the performance of the Board and 
each Director, including the Chairman, will be evaluated.
Board evaluation 
Each Director and Board Committee member completed 
questionnaires tailored to the role and responsibilities of 
the Board and its Board committees. The responses to the 
questionnaires and associated comments were collated 
and reported on an anonymous basis to a meeting of the 
Nomination Committee in which the Executive Directors 
were in attendance. 
Following discussion and debate by the Nomination Committee 
and Board, appropriate actions to address the areas which 
could be improved upon to increase Board effectiveness 
were agreed. 
Election of Directors
The 2017 AGM will be held on 27 July 2017, at 133 
Houndsditch, London EC3A 7BX. 
Following recommendations from the Nomination Committee 
and review by the Chairman, the Board considers that all 
Directors continue to be effective, remain committed to their 
roles and have sufficient time available to perform their duties. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
and provision B.7.1 of the Code, all Directors will be subject 
to annual re-election. Accordingly, all Directors with the 
exception of Manjit Wolstenholme will seek re-election at the 
Company’s 2017 AGM which will be set out in the Notice of 
AGM along with a short biography for each Director subject 
to re-election. 
Independence of Non-Executive Directors and time 
commitment 
Each of the Non-Executive Directors is considered to be 
independent. Each Director is aware of the need to allocate 
sufficient time to the Company in order to fulfil their 
responsibilities and is notified of all scheduled Board and Board 
Committee meetings. 
Directors’ induction
A formal procedure for Director Induction and ongoing training 
is in place. As part of a new Director’s application for approval 
from the FCA, a skills gap analysis and ‘learning and 
development plan’ must be submitted to the FCA. The skills 
assessment is used by the Company to tailor induction meetings 
and training requirements for all new Directors. One-on-one 
meetings are organised between the Director and the 
management team in relevant areas of the business to allow an 
incoming Director to familiarise themselves with the 
management team, their respective roles and responsibilities 
and gain an understanding and awareness of the industry 
in which the firm operates. These meetings also allow a forum 
for new Directors to discuss the business strategy and model, 
risk management, governance and controls and the 
requirements of the regulatory framework. These meetings 
and training arrangements form a key part of the learning 
and development plan.
Conﬂicts of interest
The Board has a formal process for the Directors to disclose any 
conflicts of interest. The Board members are asked to disclose 
any conflicts of interest at each scheduled Board meeting and 
is required to attest to any changes in their conflicts register 
annually. Each Director is aware of their responsibility to avoid 
conflicts of interest and to disclose any conflict or potential 
conflict of interest to the Board. 
Board support
Each Director has access to the Company Secretary for his 
advice and services. The Company Secretary ensures that 
meeting papers are delivered to Directors in a timely manner 
to allow for conducive and effective Board and Board 
Committee meetings. 
As stated in each of the Board Committees’ T erms of 
Reference and the Company’s Articles of Association the 
Directors may take independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for reviewing and 
approving the Annual Report and Financial Statements (Code 
C.1.1) and it has considered and endorsed the arrangements 
enabling it to confirm that the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and that it provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. With the assistance 
of the Group Audit Committee, the Board ensured that 
sufficient time and resources were available to encompass the 
disclosure requirements that the Group is subject to and that 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements met all relevant 
disclosure requirements.
The Board believes in the governance principles of being open, 
transparent and compliant with the principles and provisions of 
the Code. Following review by the Group Audit Committee, the 
Board considered and agreed that the Annual Report contained 
the necessary information for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, strategy and overall business model. 
Activities of the Board
The Board has a comprehensive meeting planner for the next 12 months that ensures all matters for Board consideration are 
presented and considered in a timely manner. Key areas of focus during this financial period were:
• proposed regulatory change and potential business impact; 
• strategic opportunities, annual budget, strategic review and three year plan;
• the development and launch of new products; 
• risk management and risk appetite;
• partnership with Australia and New Zealand Bank; and
• challenge and approval of ICAAP and ILAA
Meetings of the Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman has held a number of meetings with the independent Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
present in accordance with provision A.4.2 of the Code. The Senior Independent Director and other independent Non-Executive 
Directors met to appraise the Chairman’s performance since listing and sought input from the Executive Directors prior to doing so.

Priorities for ﬁnancial year 2017/18
During the year, the Committee conducted a review of its effectiveness and it was agreed that the Committee was highly effective 
and that the quality of information and auditor review provided was of a high standard. The Committee’s focus will continue to be 
to ensure that all relevant accounting practices and disclosures are adhered to and that controls around these obligations are 
successfully embedded with a strong culture of disclosure and transparency.
There will be continued focus on internal systems of control and particular focus will be paid to the results of upcoming internal 
audits on MiFID II, Corporate Governance Framework, ICAAP , and the dealing desk.
The impact and implementation of any required process changes and controls associated with the introduction of IFRS9 ‘Financial 
Instruments: classification and measurement’ and IFRS15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ will be reviewed.
• General Data Protection Regulation Regime (“GDPR”);
• Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (“ICAAP”) ;
• Markets in Financial Instruments Derivative (“MiFID II”) preparedness (Internal Audit on MiFID II execution and embedding to 
follow); and
• Senior Manager Certification Regime (“SMCR”)
External auditor
The Committee considers the reappointment of the external auditor annually and such consideration includes review of the 
independence of the external auditor and assessment of the auditor’s performance. As part of this review, the Committee agreed to 
recommend to the Board the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Group’s external auditor and a resolution to 
this effect will be put before the shareholders at the 2017 AGM. The current auditor has been in place for eight years and a tender 
process is envisaged for 2019. This would comply with the current Code provision and with the CMA Order in the event that the 
Order applies to the Company at that time.
The Committee, in line with Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) guidance, continues to review the qualification, expertise, 
resources, effectiveness and independence of the external auditor. Also in line with FRC guidance, the Committee reviews the 
appointment of staff from the external auditor to positions within the Group and meets with the External Audit Partner at least 
annually without executive management present. 
Audit fees
The Group’s audit and other services fees are disclosed in note 9 of the financial statements. Other services fees include the 
controls opinion relating to the Group’s processes and controls over client money segregation and compliance with The Capital 
Requirements (country-by-country reporting) Regulations 2015. 
Non-audit fees
The Group has a number of relationships with independent advisory and assurance firms which provide alternatives to using 
PricewaterhouseCoopers. However, the Group has engaged with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for a number of non-audit  
services during the year. For each engagement the auditor’s independence has been considered by both the Group and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to ensure auditor independence would not be compromised. Non-audit related fees provided  
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are disclosed in note 9 of the financial statements. 
During the financial year, having considered the new Ethical Standard issued by the FRC regarding the requirement for 
safeguarding independence of the external auditor, two main actions were taken. Firstly, a revised policy for the appointment 
of external auditors to provide non-audit services was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee. As a result non-audit 
services supplied by the external auditor must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the Audit Committee; those with a de 
minimis fee level are pre-approved by the Committee and authority to approve this expenditure is delegated to management. 
Secondly, tax services were tendered to other professional services firms and from February 2017 Deloitte LLP became the 
Group’s lead tax advisor.
Main activities during the ﬁnancial year
Agendas for scheduled Committee meetings are based on a pre-agreed annual meeting planner to ensure that the Committee 
fulfils its responsibilities in line with its T erms of Reference and regulatory obligations. 
At each meeting the Committee: 
• receives a report from the CFO & Head of Risk on the year to date financial performance of the Group;
• receives an update on current and planned internal audits and any internal audit issues arising; and
• receives an update on significant accounting judgements, including the recoverability of Deferred tax assets.
June 2016
• reviewed the year-end audit report presented by the Group’s auditor and discussed the audit with the lead audit partner. In 
line with the Committee terms of reference the Committee met with the Group Auditor without management or the Executive 
Directors present;

Dear Shareholders,
As Chairman of the Group Risk Committee (the “Committee”), I am pleased to present the Group Risk Committee Report. 
The Committee assists the Board by providing oversight of the risk appetite and risk management framework of the Group. 
The Committee reviews, challenges and recommends, if it sees fit, the Group’s key processes and procedures such as its Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (“ICAAP”) and Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment (“ILAA”) and takes an active role in 
advising the Board on the Group’s risk strategy. A key priority for the Committee is to ensure that a robust risk culture continues to 
be embedded across the business. 
The Committee received two “deep dive” presentations in the year on the Group’s financial and liquidity risk management 
procedures including discussions of the ICAAP and ILAA process and on Cyber Risk. Both sessions provided valuable insights into 
key areas of risk and the Committee will commission further “deep dives” in 2017/18.
The Committee actively monitors and discusses the latest risk and regulatory developments affecting the Group. The Committee 
regularly considers reports from management on the Group’s preparations for the Brexit. In December 2016, the Committee held 
an ad-hoc meeting dedicated to discussing the implications of the FCA’s consultation paper on “Enhancing conduct of business rules 
for firms providing contracts for difference products to clients” (“FCA CP 16/40”) and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority in 
Germany (“BaFin”)’s consultation on “General Administrative Act pursuant to section 4b (1) of the German Securities Trading Act 
(Wertpapierhandelsgesetz – WpHG) regarding contracts for difference” , the outcome of which was reported to the Board.
Further information on the activities of the Committee and its priorities for the year ahead is provided in the following report.

Priorities for ﬁnancial year 2017/2018

with the quality of information provided being of a high standard. Areas for improvement included length of meetings and 
scheduling of certain agenda items in the year to ensure adequate time for challenge and debate, which has been enacted. This has 
been taken into consideration while planning meetings for the coming year and the Committee will continue to improve on its 
performance.
Key priorities for the year ahead remain focussed on continued development and embedding of risk culture and framework across 
the business. The Committee will continue to take an active role in advising the Board on risk matters, particularly in relation to the 
current regulatory environment. The deep dive programme will continue to ensure the Committee has an in-depth understanding 
of the key risks affecting the Group. 
Statement of risk management and internal controls
The Group has continued to invest in risk management and internal controls following its listing in February 2016 and much 
progress has been made in improving and embedding the risk management framework. 
Following an annual review undertaken in September 2016, the Committee was satisfied that the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems were effective in 2016 and work continues to improve risk management and internal controls.

• annual review of Committee T erms of Reference
•  succession and development of Directors and senior management
Following ongoing discussions between the Chairman of the Board (and therefore also the Nomination Committee) and the CEO it 
was agreed that the structure of the Senior Executive T eam and more specifically the roles of the two Executive Directors should 
be reviewed, the objective being to provide better support to the CEO in the day-to-day operational management of the Company, 
to provide greater space for the CEO to focus on the core strategic growth initiatives and provide greater support for the APAC 
region, which is anticipated to grow significantly in the coming years with the implementation of the important and material partner 
agreement with ANZ Bank to manage their Stockbroking operation and the growth potential in Asia and more specifically China.
It was agreed by the Committee, and subsequently approved by the Board, that Grant Foley would in addition to his existing 
responsibilities, be appointed to the newly created Chief Operating and Financial Officer role, responsible for all financial, risk, 
legal, compliance, operations and IT production functions across the Group.
It was further agreed that David Fineberg would become responsible for the “demand side” of the business in addition to his 
current role of Director of Trading. This newly created role of Group Commercial Director incorporates the sales, marketing 
and distribution activities across the Group and brings together the key activities and capabilities which drive the revenue side 
of the business.
These are significant changes in terms of roles and responsibilities for both of the Executive Directors, which the Board fully 
endorses and believes will give greater support to the CEO and strengthen the management process across the Company.
Board and Board Committee evaluation
The Committee oversaw a formal Board and Board Committee evaluation and discussed the results and the action plan for 
the coming year with the full Board present. It was agreed that good progress continued to be made on the foundations laid 
in preparation for the Group’s listing in February 2016 and that the Board as a whole operated effectively with open debate 
and constructive challenge. Areas for improvement for the Board included the need to further evolve and mature, particularly 
in the context of being a company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange; in particular, further embedding the 
processes required of a listed company, Board ownership and involvement in setting strategy (following the development of the 
five-year strategic plan prior to listing), and building the interaction and relationships of Board members following the creation  
of a relatively newly-formed Board prior to the Group’s listing.
Each of the Board Committees were evaluated and it was concluded that both the Group Audit and Risk Committees were highly 
effective with excellent Executive support and very robust and high quality information provided in a timely manner for each 
Committee, which enabled constructive and open debate. Whilst deemed “fit for purpose” , it was concluded that both the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees could be more effective with a number of areas of improvement identified, including 
clarity on the requirements of both Committees in the premium listed environment, the quality and timeliness of information 
provided to the Committee and ensuring robust processes which enable all the requirements of the Committees to be fulfilled 
through the annual cycle.
Succession planning
The Committee takes an active role in the succession planning of Board members. During the year, succession plans for the 
Executive Directors and senior management were reviewed. The Committee received and considered internal reports prepared by 
the Group Head of Reward and the CEO alongside external analysis conducted by Kiddy & Partners LLP . The Committee also 
extended succession planning to potential candidates to senior management and other key roles to ensure that the talent pipeline 
was adequately maintained. 
The Committee regularly considers diversity, including those of gender, in its succession planning and works closely with the 
Remuneration Committee with regard to issues such as gender pay gap. It has been acknowledged that the number of women 
in senior roles is an area the Company can improve upon.
Diversity statement
The Board is committed to a Board and senior management team comprising individuals from different backgrounds with diverse 
and relevant skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives. The Committee carefully considers the benefits of diversity, including 
gender diversity, whilst ensuring that our obligation to shareholders to recruit the best individual for the role based on merit is 
fulfilled. The Board’s Diversity Policy can be found on the CMC Markets plc Group website and gender diversity statistics are 
presented on page 30.
Priorities for the ﬁnancial year 2017/18
The Committee will continue to focus on key themes such as diversity and succession planning and is committed to ensuring  
that further improvements to Board and Board Committee effectiveness are made following the evaluation carried out  
this year. An externally facilitated board evaluation will be conducted in the coming year in accordance with provision B 6.1  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). In addition, the Board will compete a thorough search for a successor  
to Manjit Wolstenhome.

Priorities for the ﬁnancial year 2017/18
The Remuneration Committee will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the Executive Director and senior management

Committee along with performance related pay and relevant remuneration policies that fall under the remit of the Committee.  
It is also planned for an employee salary benchmarking exercise to be conducted in 2018 and the results of this exercise will be

Directors’ remuneration report
Compliance statement
This Remuneration Report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) in 
accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. 
The Committee adopts the principles of good governance as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code and complies 
with the UKLA Listing Code.
The following parts of the Annual Report on Remuneration are audited: the single total figure of remuneration for Directors, 
including annual incentive outcomes for the financial year ending 31 March 2017, scheme interests awarded during the year, 
and total pension entitlements; payments to past Directors and payments for loss of office; and, Directors’ shareholdings and 
share interests. 
CMC Markets are proud to support the NSW Waratahs – one of Australia’s most iconic rugby teams.

Company’s risk appetite. The targets and the level of achievement against them are described 
on page 87. The profit target was not achieved. However, the Group has made significant 
progress in its first year as a listed company, with a number of significant milestones being 
delivered to which the CFO & Head of Risk (CFO) and Director of Trading have made major 
contributions (further details of these and the two individuals’ specific contributions are 
described on page 88). After careful consideration, the Committee has therefore decided that, 
based on these exceptional individual strategic achievements, bonuses of 10% of salary should 
be paid to the CFO and Director of Trading respectively. No bonus will be paid to the CEO in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2017.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2017/18
Changes in role and base salary adjustments of the two Executive Directors
The CEO, in conjunction with the Nomination Committee, has taken the opportunity to 
review the executive management structure of the business and, in particular, the roles and 
responsibilities of both the CFO and Director of Trading to ensure greater cohesion, synergies 
and productivity between the global teams. These individuals will be taking on significant 
additional responsibilities, which are described on page 92. T o reflect the new roles, job titles 
will be changed to Chief Operating and Financial Officer and Group Commercial Director, 
respectively. One-off base salary adjustments have also been made as described later in 
this report.
L TIP Awards in 2017/18
The CMC Markets Management Equity Plan 2015 provides for the award of shares and/or 
options of up to 125% of salary in normal circumstances and 200% in exceptional circumstances. 
Given the limited retentive value of the current in-flight awards to the two Executive Directors 
and to assist with aligning their longer terms interests with those of shareholders, the 
Remuneration Committee has determined that it would be appropriate to make an exceptional 
one off award of 200% salary to both the CFO and Director of Trading in 2017. 
For 2017, the Committee will use the same three metrics as for awards in 2016: earnings per 
share (EPS) growth will account for 60%, relative total shareholder return (TSR) 30% and Net 
Promoter Score (NPS) 10% of the award.
In relation to the EPS target, the Committee will ensure once the final FCA proposals are known 
that a sufficiently stretching range has been set by taking account of a number of internal and 
external reference points. The target range will be disclosed in next year’s annual report.
I hope you find the reports helpful in understanding the challenges facing the Group in 
endeavouring to strike the right balance with remuneration in an uncertain regulatory 
environment and one of likely changing remuneration practices.
James Richards 
Remuneration Committee Chairman  
7 June 2017
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present shareholders with our remuneration report 
which, in accordance with legislation comprises two separate parts: the Annual Report on 
Remuneration setting out the implementation of remuneration policy and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy.
The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out payments made to Directors during the last year 
and how the Committee intends the Directors’ Remuneration Policy to apply in the year ending 
31 March 2018. This report is subject to an advisory vote at the Company’s 2017 AGM on 27 
July 2017.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy describes our forward-looking policy and remains the 
same as that which was approved by a binding vote at the Company 7 September 2016 Annual 
General Meeting. 
As I said in my Annual Statement last year, remuneration practice is very different in the listed 
company’s environment. As part of the transition from being privately owned to a listed company, 
the Group has adapted its remuneration arrangements to a more structured framework and 
longer-term reward horizon for our Directors and employees. At the same time, so as to retain 
them, our remuneration policy needs to continue to retain and motivate the key personnel who 
are critical in helping drive and grow the business, and align their interests with the longer-term 
interests of all our shareholders. 
Group performance in the year ended 31 March 2017
The financial and operating performance for the year ended 31 March 2017 is set out in the 
Strategic Report. During the year, strong progress has been made on growth initiatives, focusing 
on client service, innovation and technology. We have also signed the largest partnership deal 
in the Group’s history, namely the ANZ Bank stockbroking deal in Australia. However, the full 
financial benefit of these achievements will lie in future accounting periods and, largely due 
to reduced client activity, the Group has had a lower financial performance than last year. 
The financial and operating performance for the year ended 31 March 2017 is set out on pages 
38 to 47 in the Strategic Report. Decisions on remuneration outcomes have been made in this 
performance context.
The regulatory context in the year ended  March 
The lower than expected financial performance has been compounded by the consequences on 
the Group’s share price of the regulatory backdrop which the CEO refers to in his report. It is 
against this uncertainty and the consequential short to medium-term challenges this presents, 
that we have to strike the right balance between retaining key personnel and continuing to align 
them with the longer-term interests of shareholders. 
Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2016/17
Details of the remuneration policy and the amount paid during the year ended 31 March 2017 
are respectively given in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Annual incentive awards for the year were predominantly based on pre-incentive underlying 
Group profit before tax as well as the Committee’s assessment of individual performance (based 
on the achievement of non-financial/strategic objectives), behaviour and compliance with the 
84 85
CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Governance report Governance report The following section sets out the remuneration arrangements and outcomes for the year ended 31 March 2017, and how the

 Benefits: taxable value of benefits received in the year by Executive Directors comprise private health insurance and, in addition for the CEO, dental insurance.

 Annual incentives: for the year ending 31 March 2017: exceptional incentive award: the total earned in respect of performance during the relevant financial year. 
3
 Long term incentives: for the year ended 31 March 2016, based on the market value of the Pre-IPO Retention Award calculated with reference to the share price 
at Listing of £2.40 and has been restated to now include the final dividend on unvested awards calculated by reference to the share price at listing. 50% of this 
Award vested in February 2017; the remainder will vest in February 2018 subject to continued employment and malus and clawback provisions. The first LTIP 
awards made in November 2016 will not vest until 2019 so there is no LTI figure to show for the year ending 31 March 2017.

 Share Incentive Plan: employees, including the Executive Directors, are entitled to participate in the SIP throughout the year; it allows employees and Directors 
to receive one matching share for every partnership share purchased under the SIP up to the limits defined by HMRC. In 2016/17, 1,748 matching shares were 
allocated to Grant Foley and 1,813 matching shares to David Fineberg, and calculated by reference to the share price on 31 March 2017. In 2015/16,  
a one-off award of free shares was granted to employees (including Grant Foley and David Fineberg) with a market value of £3,600. The free and matching  
shares will be forfeited if within three years from the date of grant, the individual leaves employment in certain circumstances. Peter Cruddas does not currently 
participate in the plan.
5
 Pension: during the year ended 31 March 2017, Grant Foley and David Fineberg received a Company pension contribution of 10% of salary. Peter Cruddas opted out 
of the plan and no compensation was provided. None of the Executive Directors have a prospective right to a final salary pension by reference to years of service.
Annual incentive plan for the year ended 31 March 2017
During the year ended 31 March 2017, Executive Directors participated in the annual incentive plan with a maximum opportunity 
of up to 120% of salary for the CEO and up to 100% of salary for the CFO and the Director of Trading.
Annual incentive awards were predominantly based on pre-incentive underlying Group profit before tax, subject to the 
Committee’s assessment that the outcome is achieved within the risk appetite of the Company. Final determination of actual 
awards was also subject to the Committee’s assessment of individual performance (based on the achievement of non-financial/
strategic objectives), and behaviour and compliance with the Company’s risk appetite. 
For the year ended 31 March 2017, threshold performance for pre-incentive underlying Group profit before tax was £70.4 million, 
target performance was £75.7 million and the stretch requirement was £81.8 million. Actual performance was £52.4 million. 
Whilst 2016/17 has been a challenging year in pure financial performance terms, in many other respects the Group has made 
significant progress in its first year as a listed company, with a number of significant milestones being delivered.
During the year, the Group has:
• Signed the largest partnership deal in CMC’s history, allowing CMC after a transition time to service over 250,000 ANZ Bank 
retail stockbroking clients under the ANZSI brand, making CMC the second largest stockbroker in Australia; 
• Successfully introduced a number of new products;
• Introduced new API connectivity to facilitate the development of the CFD institutional model.
The CFO and Director of Trading have made major contributions to the above strategic achievements and the Committee has 
judged that these achievements, in addition to performance against stretching individual non-financial objectives set at the start 
of the financial year described below, represent exceptional individual performance.

It is the Board’s policy to allow Executive Directors to take up external Non-Executive positions, subject to the prior approval of the 
Board. Any fee earned in relation to outside appointments is retained by the Executive Director. No Executive Director held any 
external appointments during the year ended 31 March 2017, with the exception of Peter Cruddas who held one Non–Executive 
position during the year. He received no fee in respect of this appointment.

The individual strategic objectives set at the start of the year for Grant Foley included ensuring a successful transition to 
listed company status, including constructive shareholder engagement, management of Group costs, ensuring effective risk 
and compliance functions, ongoing refinement of the Group’s strategy, and fostering a client-focused culture throughout 
the organisation. 
Objectives for David Fineberg included implementing Knock-outs into the risk framework, trading revenue against budget, 
effective operational management of direct reporting functions, ongoing refinement of the Group’s strategy, and fostering 
a client-focused culture throughout the organisation.
The approved Remuneration Policy provides the Committee with the discretion that in the event of there being no annual incentive 
payment as a result of the company’s financial performance not attaining the primary profit metric, a payment of up to 20% of base 
salary can be made if there has been exceptional individual performance.
In judging that the personal strategic performance for these two individuals was exceptional, the Committee also considered 
the following:
• In the case of Grant Foley: major contributions to 1) the delivery of the ANZ Bank stockbroking deal; and 2) the preparation 
and response of the business following the FCA and other regulatory announcements
• In the case of David Fineberg: major contributions to 1) the continued expansion of the APAC hub with China joining the 
framework; and, 2) adapting the risk engine to cater for new products 
As a result, the Remuneration Committee has approved individual bonus payments of 10% of the annual salary to the CFO and 
Director of Trading respectively. 
No bonus will be paid to the CEO in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017.
Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
Initial LTIP awards to the CFO and Director of Trading were made in November 2016 and amounted to a face value of 125% 
of salary.

Dilution
The Company’s share schemes are funded through a combination of shares purchased in the market and new-issue shares, as 
appropriate. The Company monitors the number of shares issued under these schemes, compared to the relevant dilution limits set 
by the Investment Association in respect of all share plans (10% in any rolling 10-year period) and executive share plans (5% in any 
rolling 10-year period). No shares have been issued since Listing except for awards under the HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan.
Share ownership and share interests
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors and other senior executives to encourage substantial long-term 
share ownership. Executive Directors are expected to build and hold shares of at least 200% of salary and to retain at least 50% 
of shares vesting (net of tax) until the guideline is achieved.

Total shareholder return (TSR) performance and CEO single ﬁgure
The below chart compares the total shareholder return (TSR) of the Company against the FTSE 250 Index based on £100 invested 
at listing (5 February 2016). The FTSE 250 index was originally selected as a relevant comparator as it included companies of a 
similar size and complexity to CMC Markets and the Company was a constituent of the Index. Although CMC Markets is no longer 
a constituent of this index, it has been retained for comparison purposes for consistency with last year’s report.

Implementation of remuneration policy for year ending 31 March 2018
Salary
In light of the regulatory consultations, lower levels of market volatility and the large white label partners deal in Australia with ANZ 
Bank, the CEO, in conjunction with the Board, has taken the opportunity to review the executive management structure of the 
business and, in particular, the roles and responsibilities of both the CFO and Director of Trading to ensure greater cohesion, 
synergies and productivity between the global teams.
The result of this review is that, with effect from 1 June 2017, in addition to current responsibilities, the CFO, will assume the role of 
Chief Operating and Financial Officer, leading all the corporate functions at Group level including Finance, Operations, IT 
Production, Legal, Compliance, Facilities and HR – as well as leading and managing key projects.
In a similar vein, the Director of Trading, with effect from 1 June 2017, will assume the role of Group Commercial Director with 
responsibility for sales and revenue functions globally beyond Trading, including Marketing and Business Intelligence, Distribution as 
well as the Stockbroking business. This role will have full accountability over all revenue generation at Group level, and will allow the 
drive for automation, customer acquisition, retention, reactivation, service and profitability to be under one leader.
As a result of these changes in responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the base salaries of the two incumbents 
and has implemented the following adjustments with effect from 1 June 2017:
Name New Role Previous salary Adjusted salary Percentage change
Grant Foley
Chief Operating and  
Financial Officer £276,000 £310,000 12.3%
David Fineberg Group Commercial Director £246,000 £295,000 19.9%
The Committee intends that these increases will be a one-off adjustment to reflect the changes in responsibilities of these 
individuals and that any future increases will generally be in line with those awarded to the wider employee population.
The salary of the CEO will increase by 3% in line with the annual salary increase budget with effect from 1 June 2017.
Name Role Previous salary Adjusted salary Percentage change
Peter Cruddas CEO £410,000 £422,300 3.0%
Pension
Executive Directors will continue to receive a pension contribution of 10% of salary, or cash in lieu of pension (net of employer 
costs), with the exception of the CEO who does not currently participate in the scheme.
Annual incentive
The annual incentive for the year ending 31 March 2018 will operate in line with the Remuneration Policy. The Company operates 
an incentive pool approach. The incentive pool is based on Group profit and is subject to the Committee’s assessment that the 
profit outcome has been achieved within the agreed risk appetite of the Company. Allocations are based on an assessment of 
individual performance, with due regard to the achievement of non-financial objectives, the individual’s contribution and behaviour, 
and compliance with the Company’s risk appetite. Annual incentives for the year ending 31 March 2018 will be up to 120% of 
salary for the CEO and up to 100% of salary for other Executive Directors. 
Shareholders will recognise that the Company operates in a very competitive market and the Board considers specific incentive 
performance objectives and targets to be commercially sensitive on a forward-looking basis. In next year’s Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, we will provide a full retrospective rationale of why bonuses were paid to ensure that shareholders can clearly identify the 
close link between pay and performance. 
Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
The CMC Markets Management Equity Plan 2009 provides for the award of shares and/or options of up to 125% of salary in 
normal circumstances and 200% in exceptional circumstances.

CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Governance report Governance report The Remuneration Committee
The Committee met six times during the year under review. Attendance by individual Committee members at meetings is detailed 
below.
Name Member throughout 2016/17 Attended (Eligible)
James Richards Yes 6(6)
Simon Waugh Yes 6(6)
Manjit Wolstenholme Yes 6(6)
Malcolm McCaig Yes 6(6)
During the year, the Committee sought internal support from the CEO and the CFO & Head of Risk, who attended Committee 
meetings by invitation from the Chairman. Advice was sought on specific questions raised by the Committee and on matters 
relating to the performance and remuneration of senior managers. No Director was present for any discussions that related 
directly to their own remuneration. The Company Secretary, Jonathan Bradshaw or his deputy attends each meeting as Secretary 
to the Committee.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
In undertaking its responsibilities, the Committee seeks independent external advice as necessary. Following a competitive tender 
process during 2015, the Committee appointed Mercer LLC (‘Mercer’) as the advisors to the Committee. Following a further 
review in January 2017, Willis T owers Watson were appointed as advisors to the Committee. Both Mercer and Willis T owers 
Watson are voluntary signatories to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, which assures clients of independence 
and objectivity. Details of the Code can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. During the year, Mercer provided 
independent advice on various matters including the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the 2016 LTIP award and the 2016 AGM. 
Willis T owers Watson provided independent advice on a range of remuneration matters including current market practice, 
benchmarking of executive pay and incentive design. They provide no other services to the Company. The fees paid to Mercer in 
respect of work carried out for the Committee for the year under review totalled £45,660. The fees paid to Willis T owers Watson 
in respect of work carried out for the Committee for the year under review totalled £12,519. The Committee is comfortable that 
the advice it has received has been objective and independent.

Given the limited retentive value of the current in-flight awards to the two Executive Directors and to assist with aligning their 
longer terms interests with those of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has determined that it would be appropriate to 
make an exceptional one-off award of up to 200% salary to both the Chief Operating and Financial Officer and Group Commercial 
Director during the year ended 31 March 2018.
For 2017, the Committee will use the same three metrics as for awards in 2016: absolute EPS growth will account for 60%, relative 
TSR 30% and NPS 10% of the award.
In relation to the absolute EPS target, Threshold and Stretch performance levels had not been determined at the date of this 
report. The Committee will calibrate the range to be appropriately stretching based on available information at the date of grant, 
taking account of a number of internal and external reference points. However, as highlighted earlier in this report, the outcome 
of the FCA review and its impact of our future performance expectations will not be known until later this year. The Committee 
therefore intends to review the target calibration once the impact of the FCA review is known and, if required, will adjust the range 
so that the condition will reflect on a commensurate basis a position which is neither materially more nor materially 
less challenging than the original performance targets when set. The original and adjusted target ranges will be disclosed in next 
year’s annual report.
The table below sets out the performance conditions applicable to these awards:

CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Governance report Governance report Group’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The below Policy T able summarises the key components of remuneration for the Executive Directors: 
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary
T o reflect the market value of 
the role and individual’s 
experience, responsibility and 
contribution
The policy is for base salary to be 
competitive. In making this 
assessment the Committee looks 
particularly at sector peers and 
other FTSE 250 (excluding 
Investment Trusts) companies. 
Salaries are reviewed on an annual 
basis, with any increase normally 
taking effect from 1 April.
The Committee reviews base 
salaries with reference to:
 - the individual’s role, 
responsibilities, and 
experience;
 - business performance and the 
external economic 
environment;
 - salary levels for similar roles at 
relevant comparators;
 - salary increases across the 
Group payable in cash
Base salary will not 
exceed the highest in 
the comparator group. 
Base salary increases 
are applied in line with the 
outcome of the review. 
It is anticipated that salary 
increases will generally be 
in line with those awarded 
to the wider employee 
population.
Increases may be above 
this level if there is an 
increase in scale, scope, 
market comparability 
or responsibilities of  
the role. 
Where increases are 
awarded in excess of the 
wider employee 
population, the 
Committee will provide 
an explanation in the 
relevant year’s 
Remuneration Report.
Business performance is 
considered in any 
adjustment to base salary.
Pension 
T o provide competitive 
retirement benefits
Executive Directors participate in a 
defined contribution pension 
scheme or may receive a cash 
allowance in lieu.
Up to 15% of salary. Not applicable.
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’)
T o encourage broad employee 
share ownership
In line with HMRC rules. Executive 
Directors are entitled to 
participate in the SIP on the same 
terms as other employees. 
In line with HMRC 
permitted limits. 
Not applicable.
enefits
T o provide market  
competitive benefits.
Benefits include life insurance, 
permanent health insurance, 
private medical insurance, dental 
insurance, health screening / 
assessment , critical Illness, 
interest free season ticket loans, 
gym membership, eye tests, cycle 
to work, childcare vouchers, dining 
card, travel insurance, club 
membership, and car allowance. 
Where appropriate, other benefits 
may be offered including, but not 
limited to, allowances for 
relocation and other expatriate 
benefits to perform his or her role.
Benefits may vary by role 
and individual 
circumstances and are 
reviewed periodically 
to ensure they remain 
competitive.
The maximum value of 
the benefits is unlikely 
to exceed 10% of salary.

Policy report
This section of the report sets out our Remuneration Policy for Executive and Non-Executive Directors, approved by shareholders 
at our September 2016 AGM and applying from that date. Note that there have been no changes of substance to the Policy that 
was approved last year. However, we have made minor adjustments to the text below for reading clarity (e.g. to remove references 
to implementation in specific financial years). A copy of the originally approved text is available in the 2016 annual report on our 
website (www.cmcmarkets.com).
Our Remuneration Policy is designed to ensure remuneration supports achievement of the Group’s goals, and provides effective 
incentives for exceptional Company and individual performance. The Committee regularly reviews the remuneration structure 
in place to ensure it remains aligned with our business strategy, reinforces our success, and aligns reward with the creation of 
shareholder value ensuring that there is an appropriate balance between fixed and performance-related pay. A high proportion of 
executive remuneration is linked to performance targets including the Group’s performance and the executives’ personal 
contribution. A considerable part of the reward package is linked to share price performance and is to be delivered in shares that 
have to be partially retained until minimum shareholding requirements have been met in accordance with shareholding guidelines. 
The Remuneration Policy also complies with relevant financial services regulation, with all incentives subject to remaining within 
the risk appetite of the Company.

2015 Management Equity 
Plan (‘LTIP’)
T o reinforce delivery of 
sustained long-term success, 
and align the interests of 
participants with those of 
shareholders.
LTIP awards may be granted 
annually by the Remuneration 
Committee to Executive Directors. 
Awards may consist of 
performance shares (nil cost 
options or conditional rights to 
receive shares) or market value 
options or a combination of the 
two. 
LTIP awards normally vest after 
three years. The Committee may 
extend the LTIP time horizon by 
introducing a holding period of up 
to two years, or by extending the 
vesting period e.g. if regulations 
require.
The number of performance shares 
and / or options vesting is 
dependent on the degree to which 
performance conditions attached 
to the LTIP award have been met 
over the performance period. 
Dividend equivalents may accrue 
on performance shares and be paid 
on those shares which vest.
The award levels and performance 
conditions are reviewed in advance 
of grant to ensure they are 
appropriate.
Awards under the LTIP are 
non-pensionable and are subject to 
malus and clawback provisions for 
a seven year period from grant in 
the event of a material financial 
misstatement, gross misconduct, 
calculation error, failure of risk 
management, or in any other 
circumstance the Committee 
considers appropriate.
Award which is a mix of 
shares and options that 
will have an economic 
value no higher than an 
award of 125% of salary 
in performance shares in 
normal circumstances 
and up to 200% of salary 
in exceptional 
circumstances.
Vesting for threshold 
performance is up to 
25% of maximum.
Awards vest subject to 
Company performance and 
continued employment.
The Committee has 
flexibility to adjust the 
performance measures and 
weightings in advance of 
each future cycle to ensure 
they continue to support 
delivery of the Company 
strategy. Over the term of 
this policy, performance 
will be predominantly 
dependent on financial, 
and/or share price-related 
measures. 
The Committee has 
flexibility to adjust 
downwards the formulaic 
outcome based on its 
assessment of underlying 
performance, and results 
being achieved within the 
Company’s risk appetite, 
over the performance 
period.
Notes to the policy table
In addition to the elements of remuneration detailed in the policy table, any historical awards or commitments described in this 
report which were made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy detailed 
in this report will be honoured. 
In particular, Pre-IPO Retention Awards were granted to Executive Directors, senior management and other key employees to 
retain and motivate key talent through listing and beyond. Awards for Executive Directors vest 50% on the first and second 
anniversaries of listing (5 February 2017 and 5 February 2018), subject to continued employment. Malus and clawback provisions 
also apply.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Annual Incentive
T o reinforce and reward 
delivery of annual strategic 
business priorities.
Performance is measured on an 
annual basis for each financial year.
Performance conditions and 
targets are reviewed prior to the 
start of the year to ensure they are 
appropriate, stretching and 
reinforce the business strategy. 
At the end of the year the 
Committee determines the extent 
to which these were achieved. 
Incentive awards are discretionary.
Awards are paid in cash. The 
Committee may defer up to 50% of 
any incentive in shares for up to 
three years, or longer if regulations 
require. 
Dividend equivalents may accrue 
on deferred share awards and be 
paid on those shares which vest.
Awards under the annual incentive 
are non-pensionable. Unpaid/
unvested awards are subject to 
malus and paid/vested awards are 
subject to clawback for a three year 
period from award in the event of a 
material financial misstatement, 
gross misconduct, calculation error, 
failure of risk management, or in 
any other circumstance the 
Committee considers appropriate.
Awards may be up to 
120% of salary.
Payout for threshold 
performance is up to 
25% of maximum; 
payment for 
performance ‘in line with 
expectations’ is up to 
70% of maximum. 
In the event that there is 
no annual incentive as a 
result of Group financial 
performance, the 
Committee has 
discretion to award a 
bonus of up to 20% of 
salary for exceptional 
individual performance.
Performance is assessed 
against Group and 
individual performance. 
A pool is determined by 
reference to the actual 
level of profit achievement 
compared to performance 
targets and is capped. 
Once the pool is defined, it 
is allocated to individuals 
based on their individual 
objectives and behaviour.
Measures selected and 
their respective weightings 
may vary from year to year 
depending on strategic 
priorities.
The Committee may adjust 
the incentive outcome to 
ensure alignment of pay 
with the underlying 
performance of the 
business over the financial 
year. Factors the 
Committee considers 
include whether outcomes 
were achieved within the 
Company’s risk appetite.

Performance measurement selection
The Company's incentive plans are designed to incentivise the achievement of demanding financial and business-related objectives, 
using a balance of absolute and relative performance measures selected to support the Group’s key strategic priorities. 
The annual incentive uses a balance between Group and individual, and financial and non-financial performance targets. Group 
profit targets relating to the annual incentive plan are set in relation to the Company’s annual budget, which is reviewed and 
approved by the Board prior to the start of each financial year. In addition, individual performance will be assessed based on the 
achievement of non-financial/strategic objectives, the individual’s contribution and behaviour, and compliance with the Company’s 
risk appetite. Performance objectives and targets are reviewed annually to ensure ongoing alignment with the Company's strategy 
for the year ahead and to ensure that they remain stretching yet achievable. The annual incentive is discretionary and the 
Committee considers wider factors in its deliberations at the end of the year, for example the quality of earnings. In determining 
individual awards, the Committee is not required to award the Group incentive pool (i.e. the sum of the incentive awards may be 
less than the Group incentive pool).
The LTIP is designed to align the interests of our participants with the longer-term interests of the Company’s shareholders by 
rewarding them for delivering sustained increases in shareholder value, within the Group’s risk appetite. LTIP performance 
measures selected reinforce the Group’s strategy over the medium- to long-term, and provide a balance of internal and external 
perspectives, and between absolute and relative performance. The Committee has selected EPS as the primary measure as this is a 
well-accepted measure of bottom-line financial performance and is well-aligned with shareholder interests. Inclusion of TSR 
provides direct alignment with shareholder interests, and achievement of strategic objectives reinforces delivery of the Company’s 
strategy over the medium- to long-term. Performance measures and targets are reviewed by the Committee ahead of each grant to 
ensure they are appropriately stretching and achievable over the performance period. 
Remuneration policy for other employees
CMC Markets' approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group. All employees are eligible to participate in the 
annual incentive, with targets appropriate to their organisational level and business area. Key senior managers are also eligible for 
LTIP awards to further support long term alignment with shareholder interests. LTIP performance conditions are consistent for 
these employees, while award opportunities may vary by organisational level or business area.
Risk considerations
The Remuneration Policy is also designed to promote sound and effective risk management. The Remuneration Committee reviews 
and approves the remuneration policy for all employees, including for Material Risk T akers and senior Risk and Compliance 
employees, to help ensure pay arrangements encourage appropriate behaviour and compliance with the Company’s risk appetite. 
For example, all employees receive a salary which reflects their market value, responsibilities and experience. An individual may 
only receive an annual incentive award if he/she operates within the risk appetite of the Company, and has demonstrated 
appropriate behaviour. Key senior managers are eligible for consideration of LTIP awards, with any vesting based on performance 
over at least three years. The Committee has flexibility to adjust the formulaic outcome if the Company’s recorded performance is 
not a genuine reflection of underlying business performance or if results were not achieved within the Company’s risk appetite. 
Annual incentive awards are subject to malus and clawback for all LTIP participants in various circumstances, including a failure of 
risk management. The CFO & Head of Risk is closely involved in the remuneration process to ensure that both remuneration policy 
and outcomes reinforce compliance with the Company’s risk appetite, including reporting independently to the Committee at least 
annually on compliance with the risk appetite, on any notable risk events, and on the behaviour of the Material Risk T akers.
Incentive plan discretions
The Committee will operate the Company's incentive plans according to their respective rules and the Policy set out above, and in 
accordance with relevant financial services regulations, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant. The 2016 LTIP Rules 
were approved by shareholders at our September 2016 AGM.
In line with common market practice, the Committee retains discretion as to the operation and administration of these incentive 
plans, including:
• who participates;
• the timing of grant and/or payment;
• the size of an award and/or payment (within the plan limits approved by shareholders);
• the manner in which awards are settled;
• the choice of (and adjustment of) performance measures and targets in accordance with the Remuneration Policy set out 
above and the rules of each plan;

Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the case of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of all the existing components of 
remuneration.
The salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to their role and responsibilities, experience and skills, relevant 
market data, internal relativities and their current salaries. New appointees will be eligible to receive a pension contribution or 
allowance and benefits and participate in the Company’s HMRC approved all-employee Share Incentive Plan, in line with the 
remuneration policy detailed above. 
The annual incentive described in the policy table will normally apply to new appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-
rated to reflect the period served. Individual objectives will be tailored to the individual’s role. New appointees are eligible for 
awards under the LTIP , which will normally be on the same terms as other Executive Directors, as described in the policy table.
Our experienced global team of market analysts and strategists regularly appear in the media.
102 103
CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Governance report Governance report In determining appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant 
factors (including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited) to ensure that the 
remuneration arrangements are appropriate and in the interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Committee may 
consider it appropriate to grant an award under a structure not included in the policy, for example to ‘buy out’ incentive 
arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, and may exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.2 R if 
necessary to secure the right candidate. In doing so, the Committee will ensure the value of any buyout will not exceed the expected 
value of awards forgone using a Black-Scholes or equivalent valuation method and, where applicable, take into account progress 
against any performance conditions attached to those awards and an assessment of the likelihood of those conditions being met. 
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Remuneration Committee will be consistent with 
the policy for external appointees detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion 
to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements. 
In the case of hiring or appointing a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will follow the policy as set out in the table on 
page 101.

Exit payment policy
The Company considers termination payments on a case-by-case basis, taking into account relevant contractual terms, the 
circumstances of the termination and any applicable duty to mitigate. In such an event, the remuneration commitments in respect 
of Executive Directors’ contracts could amount to salary, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period, together with 
payment in lieu of any accrued but untaken holiday leave, if applicable.
If such circumstances were to arise, the Executive Director concerned would have no claim against the Company for damages  
or any other remedy in respect of the termination. The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment 
made to a departing Executive Director and would honour previous commitments as appropriate, considering each case on  
an individual basis.

The table below summarises how the awards under the annual incentive and LTIP are typically treated in different leaver scenarios 
and on a change of control. The Committee retains discretion on determining ‘good leaver’ status, but it typically defines a ‘good 
leaver’ in circumstances such as retirement with agreement of the Board, ill health, injury or disability, death, statutory redundancy, 
or part of the business in which the individual is employed or engaged ceases to be a member of the Group. Final treatment is 
subject to the Committee’s discretion.

Annual incentive is paid only to the extent that any 
performance conditions have been satisfied and is 
pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year worked

at the Committee’s discretion)

In certain circumstances, the Committee may determine that any deferred share awards under the annual incentive and both unvested and any deferred awards under 
the LTIP will not vest on a change of control and instead be replaced by an equivalent grant of a new award, as determined by the Committee, in the new company.
Upon exit or change of control, SIP awards will be treated in line with the approved plan rules.
If employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement (under statute or 
otherwise) to additional amounts, which would need to be met. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle other 
amounts reasonably due to the Executive Director, for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in 
connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement (as provided for 
below) and, in which case, the individual is required to seek independent legal advice.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors including 
(but not limited to) settlement, confidentiality, restrictive covenants and/or consultancy arrangements. These will be used sparingly 
and only entered into where the Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group
In making remuneration decisions, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of employees across the 
Group. In particular, the Committee considers the range of base pay increases across the Company as a factor in determining the 
base salary increases for Executive Directors. The Committee does not consult with employees on the Executive Director 
remuneration policy nor does it use any remuneration comparison measurements. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee is committed to an on-going dialogue on Directors’ remuneration. It is the Remuneration Committee’s intention to 
consult with major shareholders prior to any major changes to its remuneration policy

All Directors will seek election at the 2017 AGM on 27 July 2017 with the exception of Manjit Wolstenholme who will be stepping 
down. Following recommendation by the Nomination Committee, a Director may be appointed to the Board by the Board of 
Directors and will then be put forward at the following AGM for election by the shareholders. The Company’s Articles of 
Association, available on the CMC Markets plc Group website, detail the appointment and removal process for Directors.
Directors interests can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 90 and other directorships are disclosed on pages 
59 to 61.
The Directors of the company who were in office during the year and up to the date of signing the financial statements were:
Simon Waugh Chairman
Manjit Wolstenholme Senior Independent Director
Peter Cruddas Chief Executive Officer
David Fineberg Group Commercial Director 
(previously Group Director of Trading)
Grant Foley Chief Operating and Financial Officer 
(previously Chief Financial Officer & Head 
of Risk)
Malcolm McCaig Non–Executive Director
James Richards Non–Executive Director
Directors’ indemnities
As permitted by the Articles of Association, the Directors have the benefit of an indemnity which is a qualifying third party 
indemnity provision as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. The indemnity was in force throughout the last financial 
year and is currently in force. 
The Company also maintains appropriate insurance to cover Directors’ and Officers’ liability which is assessed annually and 
approved by the Board. No amount was paid under the Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance during the year. 
Strategic report
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Group to prepare a Strategic report, which commences at the start of this Annual Report 
and Financial Statements up to page 165. The Strategic report includes information on the Group’s operations and business model, 
review of the business throughout the year, anticipated future developments, key performance indicators and principal risks and 
uncertainties. The use of financial instruments is included in the report and further covered under note 18 to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 145. The Group’s vision is to be the market leader in global online retail multi-asset trading. Its 
strategic objective is to provide superior shareholder returns through the consistent and sustainable delivery of growth in revenue 
and improvement to operating margins through operational excellence including product innovation, technology and service. The 
strategic objectives to achieve this are also set out in the Strategic report.
Dividends
On 7 June 2017, the Board recommended a final dividend of 5.95 pence per Ordinary Share in respect of the full financial year 
ended 31 March 2017, subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM. Further information on dividends is shown in note 12  
of the financial statements and is incorporated into this report by reference.
Share capital
The Company’s share capital comprises Ordinary Shares of 25 pence each and Deferred Shares of 25 pence each. At 31 March 
2017 there were 288,103,959 Ordinary and 2,478,086 Deferred Shares in issue.
Further information about share capital can be found in note 24 of the financial statements. 
Ordinary Shares
The holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company. All Ordinary Shares in issue in the 
Company rank equally and carry the same voting rights and the same rights to receive dividends and other distributions declared  
or paid by the Company.
Directors’ report
The Corporate Governance Report can be found on pages 56 to 113 and, together with this report of which it forms part, fulfils the 
requirements of the Corporate Governance Statement for the purpose of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (“DTR”).
Going concern
Having given due consideration to the nature of the Group’s business, the Directors consider that the Company and the Group are 
going concerns and the financial statements are prepared on that basis. This treatment reflects the reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future and the consideration of the various risks set out 
on pages 48 to 55 and financial risks described in note 29 to the financial statements.
Viability statement 
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the Financial Reporting Council’s UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), the Directors 
have considered the Group’s current financial position and future prospects and have a reasonable expectation that the Group will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of the assessment.
In reaching this conclusion, both the prospects and viability considerations have been assessed:
Prospects
• the Group’s current financial position as outlined in the Strategic report (pages 38 to 47).
• the Group’s business model: despite imminent regulatory change in a number of jurisdictions, the core of the current strategy 
remains in place and continues to demonstrate delivery of sufficient cash generation to support operations. 
• assessment of prospects and assumptions: conservative expectations of future business prospects through delivery of the 
Group strategy (see pages 24 to 25) as presented to the Board through the budget process. The annual budget process 
consists of a detailed bottom up process with a 12 month outlook which involves input from all relevant functional and regional 
heads. The process includes collection of resource assumptions required to deliver the Group strategy and associated revenue 
impacts with consideration of key risks. This is used in conjunction with external assumptions such as a region-by-region review 
of the regulatory environment and incorporation of any anticipated regulatory changes into revenue modelling, market 
volatility, interest rates and industry growth which materially impact the business. The budget is used to set targets across the 
Group. The budgeting process also covers liquidity and capital planning and in addition to the granular budget a three year 
outlook is prepared using assumptions on industry growth, the effects of regulatory change, revenue growth from strategic 
initiatives and cost growth required to support initiatives. The budget was reviewed and approved by the Board in March 
2017.
• ongoing review and monitoring of risks: these have been identified in the Group’s risk appetite statement, outlined in the 
Group’s principal risks and uncertainties (pages 48 to 55) and monitored monthly at the Risk Management Committee, with 
review and challenge from the Group Risk Committee.
Viability
• scenario stress testing: available liquidity and capital adequacy are central to understanding the Group’s viability and therefore 
stress scenarios, such as adverse market conditions and adverse regulatory change are therefore considered in the Group’s 
Individual Capital Adequacy Assessment Process and Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment documents, which are shared 
with the FCA on request. The results of the stress testing showed that due to the robustness of the business, the Group would 
be able to withstand scenarios, including combined scenarios, over the financial planning period by taking management actions 
that have been identified within the scenario stress tests.
The Directors have considered that three years is an appropriate period over which to provide a viability statement as this is the 
longest period over which the Board review the success of strategic opportunities and this timeline is also aligned with the period 
over which internal stress testing occurs. The Directors have no reason to believe that the Group will not be viable over a longer 
period. But given the uncertainty involved, in particular the outcome of regulatory consultation papers outstanding, they believe 
this period presents the readers of the Annual Report with a reasonable degree of confidence.
In addition to considering the above, the Group also monitors performance against pre-defined budget expectations and risk 
indicators, along with strategic progress updates, which provide early warning to the Board, allowing management action to be 
taken where required including the assessment of new opportunities.

Share capital and Directors’ powers
The powers of the Directors, including in relation to the issue or buy back of the Company’s shares, are set out in the Companies 
Act 2006 and the Company’s Constitution. The Directors were granted authority to issue and allot shares and to buy back shares 
at the 2016 AGM.
Shareholders will be asked to renew these authorities in line with the latest institutional shareholder guidelines at the 2017 AGM.
The Company did not repurchase any of the issued Ordinary Shares during the year and up to the date of this report.
Controlling Shareholder Disclosure
The Company entered into a Relationship Agreement with Peter and Fiona Cruddas (“the Controlling Shareholders”) on 26 
January 2016, the terms of which came into force on listing the Company to trade on the main market of the London Stock 
Exchange. The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the Company is capable at all times of carrying on 
its business independent of the Controlling Shareholders and their associates, that transactions and relationships with the 
Controlling Shareholders and their associates are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms (subject to the rules on related 
party transactions in the Listing Rules) and to ensure the Controlling Shareholders do not take any action that would prevent the 
Company from complying with, or circumvent, the Listing Rules. The Relationship Agreement will stay in effect until the earlier of: 
(i) the Controlling Shareholders ceasing to own in aggregate an interest in at least 10% or more of the Shares in the Company (or an 
interest which carries 10% or more of the aggregate voting rights in the Company from time to time) or (ii) the Shares ceasing to be 
listed on the premium listing segment of the Official List and admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for 
listed securities.
Significant contracts and change of control
The Company has a large number of contractual arrangements which it believes are essential to the business of the Company. 
These can be split into three main categories, which are a committed bank facility, prime broker arrangements, and market data and 
technology contracts. A change of control of the Company may cause the committed bank facility to terminate should the 
controlling shareholders holding reduce to below 51%.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic 
report, Directors’ report and the Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. As a listed 
company within the European Union, the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted 
by the EU. The Directors have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• in respect of the Group Financial Statements, provide 
additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and 
performance;
• state that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
Financial Statements; 
• in respect of the Parent Company Financial Statements, 
state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Financial Statements; and prepare the 
Financial Statements on a going concern basis, unless they 
consider that to be inappropriate
The Directors confirm that the Financial Statements comply 
with the above requirements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group Financial 
Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibilities statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the Financial Statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
results of the Company and the Group; and
• the Strategic Report contained in this Annual Report 
includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy
The Annual Report was approved by the Board on 7 June 2017.

and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the Group’s

prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union;

What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
• the consolidated and parent company statements of 
financial position as at 31 March 2017;
• the consolidated income statement and the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the year then 
ended;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of 
changes in equity for the year then ended;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of cash 
flows for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere  
in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial 
statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union, and applicable law and, as regards the 
parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of CMC Markets plc
Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality • Overall Group materiality: £2.4 million which represents 5% of profit before tax.
Scope • The Group consists of a UK holding Company with a number of subsidiary entities and branches 
containing the operating businesses of both the UK and overseas territories. The accounting records 
for both the UK and the overseas businesses are primarily maintained and controlled by the UK 
finance team in London. 
• We determined the appropriate work to perform based on the consolidated balances of the Group. 
As a result, the majority of the audit work was performed by the Group audit team in London, with 
certain, specified audit procedures carried out by overseas PwC engagement teams where necessary. 
• Accounts comprising 91% of consolidated net operating income, 85% of consolidated operating profit 
and 86% of consolidated profit before tax fell within the scope of our audit procedures. Balances 
within the scope of our audit contributed 86% of Group total assets. 
Areas of focus • Risk of fraud in revenue recognition, specifically in relation to super user access to systems.
• Recoverability of deferred tax assets.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and 
effort, are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We 
have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these 
specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole. Any comments we make on the results 
of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a 
complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition, specifically in relation 
to super user access to systems
The Group has continued to face profit pressures this year as market 
volatility remained subdued, with a consequent negative impact 
on trading performance. We have concluded  that the greatest risk 
of fraud in revenue recognition arises from super user access to 
systems. Individuals with such access could have the opportunity 
and incentive to commit fraud, including through inappropriate 
manipulation of revenue recognition.
T o address the risk of inappropriate access to systems which 
generate CMC Markets plc’s financial records we first identified the 
key systems which contribute to the recognition of revenue in the 
CMC Markets plc financial statements. 
For each of these systems, we evaluated the design of, and tested the 
operation of, the IT general controls in place.
Where control exceptions were identified, we tested data integrity 
reconciliations between downstream systems and upstream systems. 
These reconciliations mitigate the risk that super user access to 
systems could result in inappropriate or fraudulent recognition  
of revenue. 
No material exceptions were noted in our testing of data integrity 
reconciliations. 
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
The recognition of deferred tax assets is complex and often 
subjective.  There are substantial tax losses in relation to the  
Group’s Australia business carried forward and not yet utilised;  
these give rise to a material deferred tax asset. The extent of 
recognition of this asset depends on a judgement surrounding 
forecast profitability. The judgement is subjective, particularly given 
the downturn in performance in the year and the planned changes  
to the Australia business.
T o address the risk associated with the recoverability of deferred 
tax assets we identified key assumptions made by management in 
relation to the future taxable profits to be earned in the Australia 
business and the period over which these profits could be 
reasonably foreseen. 
We evaluated these assumptions by:
• assessing the growth rate used to forecast revenue and costs, 
comparing it to historic growth rates and considering the impact 
of the planned changes to the Australia business;
• considering the period over which profits are deemed to be 
reasonably foreseeable and comparing this period to other 
forecasting periods used by the Group; 
• considering whether current Australian tax legislation could 
impact the degree to which losses could be recognised in  
the future.
We also agreed the tax rate used to calculate the deferred tax asset 
to the substantively enacted rate, and checked the mathematical 
accuracy of the deferred tax calculation.
As a result of these procedures, we concluded that the basis on 
which the tax losses have been recognised is appropriate, although 
conservative.

116 117 How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole. In scoping our audit work we took into 
account the geographic structure of the Group, the location of 
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
the Group operates. 
CMC Markets plc is an online retail financial services business 
that provides its clients with online and mobile financial spread 
betting (UK and Ireland only) and contract for difference (CFD) 
trading platforms. CMC Markets plc is a global company with 
significant operations in the UK, Europe and Asia Pacific. The 
Group also has a stockbroking offering in Australia.
The Group consists of a UK holding Company with a number of 
subsidiary entities and branches containing the operating 
businesses of both the UK and overseas territories. The 
accounting records for both the UK and overseas businesses 
are primarily maintained and controlled by the UK finance team 
in London. We determined the appropriate work to perform 
based on the consolidation schedules of the Group setting out 
balances and accounts which aggregate to the Group totals , 
the areas of focus as noted above, known or historical 
accounting issues and the need to include some unpredictability 
in our audit procedures.
As a result of our scoping, we concluded that two UK legal 
entities (CMC Markets plc and CMC Markets UK plc) were 
material components and therefore we have performed a full 
scope audit of these entities. In addition, the Group audit team in 
London performed certain substantive testing that covered all 
spread betting and CFD revenue accounts. As a result, the 
majority of the audit work was performed by the Group audit 
team in London. Certain specified audit procedures were carried 
out by PwC Australia over deferred tax, trade receivable and 
trade payable balances relating to the CMC Australian 
subsidiaries.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group 
materiality
£2.4 million (2016: £2.7 million)
How we 
determined it
5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
We have used profit before tax as the 
materiality benchmark as it is an 
important profit metric which takes 
account of all aspects of trading 
performance of the Group. 
Component 
materiality
For each component in our audit scope, 
we allocated a materiality that is less 
than our overall Group materiality. The 
range of materiality allocated across 
components was between £2 million and 
£2.3 million.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
£121,000 (2016: 133,000) as well as misstatements below 
that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ 
statement, set out on page 108, in relation to going concern. We 
have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if 
we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in 
relation to the directors’ statement about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material 
to add or to draw to your attention. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. The going concern 
basis presumes that the Group and parent company have 
adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the 
date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit 
we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are 
not a guarantee as to the Group’s and parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance with 
applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 opinions
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements of the Group; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group and parent company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading. 
We have no exceptions 
to report.
• the statement given by the directors on page 65, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a 
whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
members to assess the Group’s and parent company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and parent company 
acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
• the section of the Annual Report on page 69, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw 
attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 48 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of 
the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing 
material to add or  
to draw attention to.
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated.
We have nothing 
material to add or  
to draw attention to.
• the directors’ explanation on page 108 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing 
material to add or  
to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering 
whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing 
to report having performed our review.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the 
Group, the parent company and their environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we are required to report if we have 
identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report. We have nothing to report in this respect.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
• the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement set out on pages 48 to 55 with respect to 
internal control and risk management systems and about 
share capital structures is consistent with the financial 
statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements; and
• the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement set out on pages 56 to 113 with respect to the 
company’s corporate governance code and practices and 
about its administrative, management and supervisory 
bodies complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook 
of the Financial Conduct Authority.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the 
Group, the parent company and their environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we are required to report if we have 
identified any material misstatements in the information 
referred to above in the Corporate Governance Statement. 
We have nothing to report in this respect.

Responsibilities for the ﬁnancial statements  
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 113, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on  
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the parent company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We 
obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements of the 
Group and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required by 
applicable legal requirements.

from contracts with customers’ at the same time. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, but intends to adopt 
the standard no later than the accounting year beginning 1 April 2019, subject to endorsement by the EU.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements incorporate the financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities 
over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of  
the entity. 
CMC Markets plc became the ultimate holding company of the Group under a Group reorganisation in 2006. The pooling of 
interests method of accounting was applied to the Group reorganisation as it fell outside the scope of IFRS 3: Business 
Combinations. The Directors adopted the pooling of interests as they believed it best reflected the true nature of the Group. 
All other business combinations have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.
Under the purchase method of accounting, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are 
measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The results of 
subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial information of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into 
line with those adopted by the Group.
All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on 
consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred.
Signiﬁcant accounting judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain significant accounting judgements. 
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The only area 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial 
statements is:
Deferred taxes
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
2.  Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
Total Revenue
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received from the provision of online financial services in the ordinary 
course of the Group’s activities, net of client rebates. Revenue is shown net of value added tax after eliminating sales within the 
Group. Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group 
and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The Group generates revenue principally from flow management, commissions, spreads and financing income associated with 
acting as a market maker to its clients to trade contracts for difference (CFD) and financial spread betting.
Revenue represents profits and losses, including commissions, spreads and financing income, from client trading activity and the 
transactions undertaken to hedge these revenue flows. Gains and losses arising on the valuation of open positions to fair market 
value are recognised in revenue, as well as the gains and losses realised on positions which have closed. Revenue from the 
provision of financial information and stockbroking services to third parties is recognised at the later of the rendering of the service 
or the point at which the revenue can be reliably measured.
Interest Income
T otal revenue also includes interest earned on the Group’s own funds, clients’ funds and broker trading deposits net of interest 
payable to clients and brokers. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the 
interest rate applicable.
Introducing partner commissions and betting levies 
Commissions payable to introducing partners, and spread betting levies are charged to the income statement when the 
associated revenue is recognised and is disclosed as a deduction from total revenue in deriving net operating income. Betting 
levy is payable on net gains generated from clients on spread betting and the Countdowns product. This levy is payable on net 
gains generated from clients on these products.
Other income
Items of income that are material by size and/or nature and are non-business related are classified as other income on the face 
of the consolidated income statement.
Segmental reporting
The Group’s segmental information is disclosed in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker (CODM), who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
the performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the CMC Markets plc Board. Operating segments that do not 
meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 are aggregated. The segments are subject to annual review and the 
comparatives restated to reflect any reclassifications within the segmental reporting.
Share-based payment
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at 
date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payment is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, 
the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-
based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the retained earnings.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Cash-settled share based payments are measured at expected value at vesting date at least once per year, along with the 
likelihood of meeting non-market based vesting conditions and the number of shares that are expected to vest. The cost is 
recognised in the income statement with a corresponding accrual.
Retirement beneﬁt costs
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions to a third party 
pension provider and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Contributions are recognised as staff 
expenses in profit or loss in the years during which related employee services are fulfilled.
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for its Directors and employees. The assets of the schemes are held 
separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
Operating Leases
Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
The rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are included within deferred income and 
amortised to the income statement so as to spread the benefit on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Where a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Group’s foreseeable business requirements, provision is made for the 
expected future net cost of the property taking account of the duration of the lease and any recovery of cost achievable 
through subletting.
CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements Financial statements
128 129 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are events or transactions that fall outside the ordinary activities of the Group and which by virtue of their 
size or incidence have been disclosed in order to improve a reader’s understanding of the financial statements.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and movements in deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from 
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial information and the corresponding tax basis 
used in the computation of taxable profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences may be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither the tax profit nor the 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the 
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in currencies, other than the functional currency, are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on 
the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the 
income statement for the year, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in 
fair value are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates applicable to the relevant year. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. 
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expense in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. 
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s interest in the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is 
included within ‘intangible assets’ at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement and is 
not subsequently reversed. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributed amount of goodwill, which has not been subject to 
impairment, is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for purposes of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-
generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination, identified 
according to business segment.
Computer software (purchased and developed)
Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset at cost when acquired. Costs associated with maintaining computer 
software are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs directly attributable to internally developed software are recognised as 
an intangible asset only if all of the following conditions are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified;
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;
• the development costs of the asset can be measured reliably;
• sufficient resources are available to complete the development; and
• it is the Group’s intention to complete the asset and use or sell it.
Where the above conditions are not met, costs are expensed as incurred. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised include 
software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Costs which have been recognised  
as an asset are amortised on a straight line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life.
Trademarks and trading licences
Trademarks and trading licences that are separately acquired are capitalised at cost and those acquired from a business 
combination are capitalised at the fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortisation is charged to the income statement  
on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Client relationships
The fair value attributable to client relationships acquired through a business combination is included as an intangible asset  
and amortised over the estimated useful life on a straight line basis. The fair value of client relationships is calculated at the date  
of acquisition on the basis of the expected future cash flows to be generated from that asset. Separate values are not attributed  
to internally generated client relationships.
Following initial recognition, Computer software, Trademarks and trading licences and Client relationships are carried at cost or 
initial fair value less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is provided on all intangible asset at rates calculated to write-off the 
cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, of each asset on a straight-line basis over 
its expected useful life as follows:
Item Amortisation Policy
Computer software (purchased or developed) 3 years or life of licence
Trademarks and trading licences 10 – 20 years
Client relationships 14 years
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. 
CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements Financial statements
130 131 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use. Depreciation is provided on all PPE at rates calculated to write-off the cost, less estimated residual value based 
on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:
Item Depreciation Policy
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 5 years
Computer hardware 5 years
Leasehold improvements 15 years
The useful lives and residual values of the assets are assessed annually and may be adjusted depending on a number of factors. 
In reassessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken 
into account. Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and 
projected disposal values. Consideration is also given to the extent of current profits and losses on the disposal of similar assets.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment of assets
Assets subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value-in-use. Net realisable value is the estimated amount 
at which an asset can be disposed of, less any direct selling costs. Value-in-use is the estimated discounted future cash flows 
generated from the asset’s continued use, including those from its ultimate disposal. For the purpose of assessing value in use, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
T o the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount. 
For assets other than goodwill, where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to 
the lower of its original carrying amount and the revised estimate of its recoverable amount.
Financial assets
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on a trade date basis where the purchase or sale of an asset is 
under a contract whose terms require delivery of the asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned. Financial 
assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and 
the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting 
year. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are recognised initially at cost, being the fair value of the 
consideration together with any associated issue costs. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ (note 18), ‘amounts due from brokers’ and ‘cash and 
cash equivalents’ (note 20) in the statement of financial position.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivatives financial instruments, comprising Index, Commodities, Foreign Exchange and Treasury futures and forward foreign 
exchange contracts are classified as ‘fair value through profit or loss’ under IAS39, unless designated as hedges. Derivatives not 
designated as hedges are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in fair value of such 
derivatives and gains or losses on their settlement are recognised in the income statement.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well 
as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an on-going basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 
Held for trading
Derivatives classified as held for trading are included in this category. The Group uses derivative financial instruments in order to 
hedge derivative exposures arising from open client positions, which are classified as held for trading. All derivatives held for 
trading are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with gains or losses recognised in revenue in the income 
statement.
Held as hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Where a foreign currency derivative financial instrument is a formally designated hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, 
foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the financial instrument are recognised in net investment hedging reserve via 
other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective. The Group assesses the effectiveness of its net investment 
hedges based on fair value changes of its net assets and the fair value changes of the relevant financial instrument. The gain or loss 
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in operating costs in the income statement. Accumulated gains and 
losses recorded in net investment hedging reserve are recognised in operating costs in the income statement on disposal of the 
foreign operation.
Economic hedges (Held as hedges of monetary assets and liabilities, financial commitments or forecast transactions)
These are derivatives held to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on monetary assets and liabilities, financial commitments or 
forecast transactions. Where a derivative financial instrument is used as an economic hedge of the foreign exchange exposure 
of a recognised monetary asset or liability, financial commitment or forecast transaction, but does not meet the criteria to qualify 
for hedge accounting under IAS39, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss resulting from changes in fair value of 
the hedging instrument is recognised in operating costs in the income statement.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. For trade receivables relating to financial information 
and stockbroking services, significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or 
financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised 
in the income statement within other operating costs. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the 
allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other 
operating costs in the income statement.
Amounts due from brokers
All derivatives used as hedges held for trading are margin-traded. Amounts due from brokers represent funds placed with 
hedging counterparties, a proportion of which is posted to meet broker margin requirements. Assets or liabilities resulting from 
profits or losses on open positions are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise current account balances, bank deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments 
with initial maturity dates of less than three months.

Notes to the consolidated and parent company ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2017 
1.  General information 
Corporate information
CMC Markets plc (the Company) is a company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 
2006. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the CMC Markets plc and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) 
are set out in note 3.
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The Group’s financial statements are presented in Sterling 
(GBP) which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency. Foreign operations are included in accordance 
with the policies set out in note 2.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (“IFRS”), IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRS IC”) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, 
except in the case of “Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss” and “Available for sale financial assets” . The 
financial information is rounded to the nearest thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
The Group principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in note 2 below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented. The financial statements presented are at and for the years 
ending 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016. Financial annual years are referred to as 2017, and 2016 in the financial statements.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
Application of new and revised accounting standards
The accounting policies adopted by the group are consistent with those of the previous financial year. There were no new or 
amended standards or interpretations that resulted in a change in accounting policy.
New accounting standards in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of the financial statements, the following new Standards and Interpretations relevant to the Group 
were in issue but not yet effective and have not been applied to the financial statements:
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments: classification and measurement’ , will replace IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and 
measurement. ’  IFRS 9 has three measurement categories: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss and fair value 
through other comprehensive income. All equity instruments are measured at fair value. A debt instrument is measured at 
amortised cost only if the entity is holding it to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and 
interest. For liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. These include amortised-cost accounting for 
most financial liabilities, with bifurcation of embedded derivatives.  
 
The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due 
to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement. The full impact of 
IFRS 9 is being assessed by the management, the group intends to adopt the standard no later than the accounting year 
beginning 1 April 2018.
• IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting 
useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash 
flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good 
or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces 
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The full impact of IFRS 15 is being assessed 
by the management, the group intends to adopt the standard no later than the accounting year beginning 1 April 2018.
CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements Financial statements
126 127 Client money
The Group holds money on behalf of clients in accordance with the Client Asset (CASS) rules of the FCA and other financial 
markets regulators in the countries in which the Group operates. Client monies are classified as either client money or cash and 
cash equivalents in accordance with the relevant regulatory agency’s requirements. The amounts held on behalf of clients at the 
balance sheet date are stated in notes 20 and 21. Segregated client funds comprise individual client funds held in segregated 
client money accounts. Segregated client money accounts hold statutory trust status restricting the Group’s ability to control the 
monies and accordingly such amounts and are not recognised on the Group’s statement of financial position.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowings
The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. The leases where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership are classified as finance leases. These leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of fair value 
and present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. 
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in Borrowings. The interest element is charged to the 
income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of liability 
for each period and is presented within finance costs. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are 
depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
All loans and borrowings other than finance leases are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration 
received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement 
when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Provisions
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount that is recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event where it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions 
are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and 
are discounted to present value where the effect is material. The increase in the provision due to the unwind of the discount to 
present value over time is recognised as an interest expense.
Share capital
Ordinary and deferred shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Own shares held in trusts
Shares held in trust by the Company for the purposes of employee share schemes are classified as a deduction from 
shareholders’ equity and are recognised at cost. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Employee beneﬁt trusts
Assets held in employee benefit trusts are recognised as assets of the Group, until these vest unconditionally to identified 
employees. A full provision is made in respect of assets held by the trust as there is an obligation to distribute these assets to 
the beneficiaries of the employee benefit trust.
The employee benefit trusts own equity shares in the Company. These investments in the Company’s own shares (‘treasury 
shares’) are held at cost and are included as a deduction from equity attributable to the Company’s equity owners until such 
time as the shares are cancelled or transferred. Where such shares are subsequently transferred, any consideration received, net 
of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects are included in equity attributable to 
the Company’s equity owners.
3.  Segmental reporting
The Group’s principal business is online retail financial services and provides its clients with the ability to trade contracts for 
difference (CFD) and financial spread betting on a range of underlying shares, indices, foreign currencies, commodities and 
treasuries. The Group also makes these services available to institutional partners through white label and introducing broker 
arrangements. The Group’s CFDs are traded worldwide; spread betting only in UK and Ireland and the Group provides 
stockbroking services only in Australia. The Group’s core business is generally managed on a geographical basis and for 
management purposes, the Group is organised into three segments: 
• UK and Ireland (UK & IE);
• Europe;
• Australia, New Zealand and Singapore (APAC) and Canada;
Revenues and costs are allocated to the segments that originated the transaction. Costs generated centrally are allocated to 
segments on an equitable basis, mainly based on revenue, headcount or active client levels.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to the equity owners of the Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during each year excluding those held in employee share trusts which are treated as 
cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding those held in employee share 
trusts, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential weighted average ordinary shares, which consists of share 
options granted to employees during the year ended 31 March 2017.

The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and suitable taxable profits 
will be available in the future against which the reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted. The recoverability of the 
Group’s deferred tax asset in respect of carry forward losses is based on an assessment of the future levels of taxable profit 
expected to arise that can be offset against these losses. The Group’s expectations as to the level of future taxable profits take 
into account the Group’s long term financial and strategic plans and anticipated future tax adjusting items. In making this 
assessment account is taken of business plans including the Board-approved Group budget. Key budget assumptions are 
discussed in the Directors’ viability statement.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit 
through future taxable profits is probable. As on 31 March 2017 the Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 
£16,781,000 (Year ended 31 March 2016: £15,690,000) in respect of losses amounting to £56,454,000 (Year ended 31 March 
2016: £52,301,000). In respect of these losses, £55,258,000 relates to the Group’s Australian subsidiaries and there are no time 
limits on their utilisation. £1,196,000 of the losses relates to the Group’s Information Internet Limited subsidiary and there are 
no time limits on their utilisation. There has been an increase in the unrecognised losses due to the impact of foreign exchange 
on the balance of the unrecognised losses.
CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements Financial statements
142 143 The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of £4,596,000 (Year ended 31 March 2016: £3,968,000) in respect of losses of 
£15,319,000 (Year ended 31 March 2016: £13,229,000) in the Group’s Australian subsidiaries as at 31 March 2017. The Group

The change in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20 per cent to 19 per cent, effective from 1 April 2017, passed into

144 145 Held for hedging
The Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as either economic or net investment hedges. 
Economic hedges are held for the purpose of mitigating currency risk relating to transactional currency flows arising from 
earnings in foreign currencies but do not meet the criteria for designation as hedges. During the year ended 31 March 2017, 
£1,103,000 of gains net of revaluation gains or losses relating to economic hedges were recognised in the income statement  
(Year ended 31 March 2016, losses: £267,000). 
The Group has designated a number of foreign exchange derivative contracts as hedges of the net investment in the Group’s 
foreign operations. At 31 March 2017, £8,639,000 (31 March 2016: £5,689,000) of fair value losses were recorded in net 
investment hedging reserve within other reserves. At 31 March 2017, £8,386,000 (31 March 2016: £3,972,000) of fair value 
gains were recorded in translation reserve within other reserves. All changes in the fair value were treated as being effective 
under IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and Eligible Hedged Items.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s derivative positions are reported gross on the statement of financial position, as required by IAS32 where there are 
no offset rights in place. There are no further netting arrangements or collateral posted which would impact the settlement of 
these balances.

During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group liquidated two of its Austrian subsidiaries; as a result an amount of £159,000 
was recycled to the income statement.
Net investment hedging reserve
Overseas net investments are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts. Gains and losses on instruments used to hedge 
these overseas net investments are shown in the net investment hedging reserve. These instruments hedge balance sheet 
translation risk, which is the risk of changes in reserves due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. All changes in the fair 
value of these hedging instruments were treated as being effective under IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and Eligible Hedged Items.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose following a corporate restructure in 2005 when a new holding company, CMC Markets plc, was 
created to bring all CMC companies into the same corporate structure. The merger reserve represents the difference between 
the nominal value of the holding company’s share capital and that of the acquired companies.

Fair value estimation
The Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are derivative financial instruments and financial investments in 
UK Government securities. The table below categorises those financial instruments measured at fair value based on the 
following fair value measurement hierarchy:

152 153 29.  Financial risk management
The Group’s day-to-day business activities naturally expose it to strategic, financial (including credit, market and liquidity) and 
operational risks. The Board accepts that it cannot place a cap or limit on all of the risks to which the Group is exposed. 
However, effective risk management ensures that risks are managed to an acceptable level. The Board is ultimately responsible 
for the implementation of an appropriate risk strategy, defining and communicating the Group’s risk appetite, the establishment 
and maintenance of effective systems and controls, and continued monitoring of the adherence to Group policies. The Group 
has adopted a standard risk process, through a five step approach to risk management: Risk Identification; Risk Assessment; Risk 
Management; Risk Reporting and Risk Monitoring. The approach to managing risk within the business is governed by the Board 
approved Risk Appetite Statement and Risk Management Framework.
The Board sets the strategy and the policies for managing these risks and delegates the monitoring and management of these 
risks to various committees including Group Risk Committee and Risk Management Committee.
The Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) review document is prepared under the requirements set 
out in the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) Rulebook in accordance with CRD IV
1
. A key purpose of an ICAAP is to inform 
a firm’s board of the ongoing assessment of the firm’s risks; how the firm intends to mitigate those risks, and how much current 
and future capital is necessary. This is achieved by considering potential stresses as well as mitigating factors.
Financial risks arising from financial instruments are categorised into market, credit and liquidity risks which, together with how 
the Group categorises and manages these risks, are described below.
Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk that the value of our residual portfolio will decrease due to the change in market risk factors. 
The three standard market risk factors are price moves, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Market price risk
This is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices other than due to 
currency or interest rate risk.
Mitigation of market risk
The Group benefits from a number of factors which also reduce the volatility of its revenue and protect it from market shocks 
as follows:
• Natural mitigation of concentration
The Group acts as a market maker in over 10,000 asset instruments, specifically equities, equity indices, commodities, treasuries 
and foreign exchange. Due to the high level of notional turnover there is a high level of internal crossing and natural hedging 
across instruments and asset classes to mitigate significant single instrument concentration risk within the portfolio.
• Natural aggregation
In the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group traded with over 60,000 clients. This large international client base has a diverse 
range of trading strategies resulting in the Group enjoying a high degree of natural hedging between clients. This ‘portfolio 
effect’ leads to a significant reduction in the Group’s net market risk exposure.
• Ease of hedging
The Group predominantly acts as a market maker in linear, highly liquid financial instruments in which it can easily neutralise 
market risk exposure through its prime broker (PB) arrangements. In order to avoid over-reliance on one arrangement the Group 
has six PB relationships. For instruments where there is no equivalent underlying market (e.g. Countdowns) the Group controls 
its risk through setting low position/exposure limits. This is further augmented by dealer monitoring and intervention, which can 
take the form of restricting the size offered or, if deemed necessary, restricting the clients’ ability to take a position in an 
instrument. 
1 
The Capital Requirements Directive (2013/36/EU) (CRD) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (575/2013) (CRR), called ‘CRD IV’
Market risk limits
Market risk positions are managed in accordance with the Group’s Risk Appetite Statement and Group Risk Management 
Framework to ensure that the Group has sufficient capital resources to support the calculated Market Risk Capital Requirement 
as well as staying within the Risk Appetite. The Group manages this component under notional position limits that are set on an 
instrument and asset class level with overarching capital based limits.
Client exposures can vary significantly over a short period of time and are highly dependent on underlying market conditions. 
The Group’s Own funds requirement (OFR) is calculated as per the CRR. It has increased against the prior year but remains well 
within the Board-approved risk appetite.

Market price risk – stress testing
Group Financial Risk conducts market price risk stress testing on a daily basis. The stress testing approach is tailored according 
to the asset class and the client behaviours seen to ensure the most suitable stress testing model is used. For example longer / 
shorter holding periods, intraday movements or end of day positions, historic volatility or Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) / 
Expected T ail Loss (ETL). It should be noted that the Group not only runs likely and probable scenarios but also extreme case stress 
scenarios on a daily basis, where the stress factors simulate almost black swan type events to ensure capital adequacy is 
maintained.
None of the stress tests run through the year implied any significant risk to the capital adequacy nor ongoing profitability of 
the Group.
Non trading book interest-rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from either less interest being earned or more being paid on interest bearing assets and liabilities due to 
a change in the relevant floating rate.
Interest rate risk is felt by the Group through a limited number of channels: income on segregated client and own funds; debits 
on client balances that are over a pre-defined threshold; changes to the value of fixed rate UK government securities held.
The sensitivity analysis performed is based on a reasonable and possible move in the floating rate by 0.5% upwards and 0.25% 
downwards. This is in line with the movement used for the year ended 31 March 2016.
This is summarised in the below table, and reflects the Group’s view that in the current economic environment, interest rate 
volatility is unlikely to have a significant impact on the profits of the Group. 
Changes in interest rate variables result in a decrease / increase in the fair value of fixed rate financial assets classified as 
available for sale. This has no material impact on the Group’s equity.

Non trading book foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the Group’s results are impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates.
CMC is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the form of transaction and translation exposure. 
Transaction exposure is from holdings of cash and other current assets and liabilities in a currency other than the base currency of 
the entity. This risk is hedged each month by the Liquidity Risk Management team according to a policy based on a cap and floor 
model, with gains/losses recognised in the income statement. Any foreign exchange transaction exposures are hedged in 
accordance with Group Foreign Exchange Hedging Policy. Given the effectiveness of the hedging program (income statement 
impact in year ended 31 March 2017: Gain of £1,103,000, Year ended 31 March 2016: Loss of £267,000), no sensitivity analysis 
has been performed. These ‘fair value hedges’ are derivative financial instruments and are reported as described in note 2.
Translation exposure occurs when the net assets of an entity are denominated in a foreign currency other than GBP , when the 
consolidated statement of financial position is prepared. The Group hedges this exposure by using FX forwards. These ‘Net 
Investment Hedges’ are derivative financial instruments and are reported as described in note 2. The unhedged portion does not 
pose a significant risk to the capital adequacy or to the ongoing profitability of the Group.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction will cause the Group financial loss by failing to fulfil a contractual 
obligation. Below are the channels of credit risk the Group is exposed through:
• Credit institution (CI);
• Client.
Credit institution credit risk
The Group has relationships with a number of counterparties that provide prime brokerage and/or banking services (e.g. cash 
accounts, foreign exchange trading, credit facilities, custodian services etc.). All these market counterparties can be described as 
CIs as defined by Article 4 ‘Definitions’ in the CRR (‘credit institution’ is defined as an undertaking the business of which is to take 
deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credits for its own account).
CI credit risk can therefore be defined as the risk that a CI will default on their contractual obligation to the Group resulting in 
a loss to the Group.
The above could be felt in two ways:
• For CIs used as a bank and those as a broker, the Group does not receive the funds the CI holds on the Group’s account
• For the CIs used as broker, the default causes the need to re-hedge at a different broker at a different price. 
Mitigation of CI credit risk
T o mitigate or avoid a credit loss:
• The Group maintains, where practical, a range of relationships to reduce over-reliance on a single CI – as detailed in the Group 
Counterparty Concentration Risk Policy
• The Group monitors the credit worthiness of the credit institution and reviews counterparties at least annually – as detailed 
in the Group Hedge Counterparty Selection Policy 
Contractual losses can be reduced by the ‘close-out netting’ conditions in the ISDA and broker agreements. If a specified event 
of default occurs, all transactions or all of a given type are terminated and netted (i.e. set off against each other) at market value 
or, if otherwise specified in the contract or if it is not possible to obtain a market value, at an amount equal to the loss suffered 
by the non-defaulting party in replacing the relevant contract.
Liquidity Risk Management monitor the credit quality of all CIs, by tracking the credit ratings issued by Moody’s, Standard & 
Poor’s and Fitch rating agencies and the CDS (Credit Default Swap) spreads determined in the CDS market. Credit ratings, rating 
outlooks and CDS spreads are reported to senior management on a weekly basis with any changes highlighted. 
All CIs that the Group transacts with are of investment grade quality; however no quantitative credit rating limits are set by the 
Group that CIs must exceed because the choice of suitable CIs is finite and therefore setting minimum rating limits could lead to 
the possibility that no CIs are able to meet them. As an alternative, the Group reviews negative rating action and large CDS spread 
widening to CIs on a case-by-case basis. Negative rating action on CIs rated below A3/A-/A- (by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch 
respectively) would be escalated directly to the Chief Financial Officer & Head of Risk in the first instance to decide if any 
management actions were required. Possible actions by the Group to reduce exposure to CIs depend on the nature of the 
relationship and the practical availability of substitute CIs. Possible actions include the withdrawal of cash balances from a CI on 
a daily basis, switching a proportion of hedge trading to another prime broker CI or ceasing all commercial activity with the CI.
The tables below present CMC Markets’ exposure to credit institutions based on their long-term credit rating.

Client credit risk
The Group operates a real-time mark-to-market leveraged trading facility where clients are required to lodge collateral against 
positions, with any profits and losses generated by the client credited and debited automatically to their account. As with any 
leveraged product offering, there is the potential for a client to lose more than the collateral lodged.
Client counterparty risk captures the risk associated with a client defaulting on their obligations due to the Group. As the Group 
does not offer most of its retail clients credit terms and has a robust liquidation process, client counterparty credit risk will in 
general only arise when markets and instruments gap and the movement in the value of a clients leveraged portfolio exceeds the 
value of equity that the client has held at the Group leaving the client account in deficit.
CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements Financial statements
156 157 Mitigation of client credit risk
• Liquidation process
This is the automated process of closing a client’s open position if the total equity is not enough to cover a predefined percentage of 
required margin for the portfolio held.
The Group has a fully automated liquidation process on the Next Generation platform and a semi-automated liquidation order 
management process on Marketmaker. These processes ensure a consistent and timely approach to the processing of liquidation 
orders and ultimately aim to minimise client credit risk exposure through protecting the client from becoming a debtor.
Pre-emptive processes are also in place where a client’s free equity (total equity less total margin requirement) becomes 
negative* . At this point the client is requested to deposit additional funds and is restricted from increasing their position.
• Tiered margin
Tiered margin was implemented in September 2013 on the Next Generation platform. It enables the Group to set higher margin 
rates (therefore requiring a client to lodge more collateral) against positions that are deemed to be more risky due to risk profile, 
which could be due to size relative to the underlying’s turnover, the Group’s risk appetite or volatility of the instrument.
• Position limits
Position limits can be implemented on an instrument and client level on the Next Generation platform. The instrument level 
enables the Group to control the total exposure the Group acquires in a single instrument. At a client level this ensures that the 
client can only reach a pre-defined size in any one instrument. 
Client Credit Risk Stress Testing
None of the stress tests run through the year implied any significant risk to the capital adequacy or to the ongoing profitability of 
the Group.
Client debt history
For the year ended 31 March 2017, new debt arising was £2,594,000 (Year ended 31 March 2016: £5,240,000). This constituted 
1.4% of total revenue (Year ended 31 March 2016: 2.8%). 
The Group establishes specific provisions against debts due from clients where the Group determines that it is probable that it 
will be unable to collect all amounts owed in accordance with contractual terms of the clients agreement. Net debt provided for 
in the year ended 31 March 2017 amounted to £883,000 (Year ended 31 March 2016: £2,384,000), the provision representing 
0.5% of total revenue (Year ended 31 March 2016: 1.3%). Bad debt written off during the year ended 31 March 2017 was 
£1,382,000 or 0.7% of revenue (Year ended 31 March 2016: £4,279,000; 2.3% of revenue).

Debt ageing analysis
The Group works efficiently to minimise the effects of client debts on the Company’s profit and loss. Client debts are managed 
very early in their life cycle in order to minimise the likelihood of them becoming doubtful debts or of being written off. There 
are no debts past due which have not been impaired. The following table sets out aging of debts that are past due and the

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that there is insufficient available liquidity to meet the obligations of the Group as they fall due.
Liquidity is managed centrally for the Group by the Liquidity Risk Management team.  The Group utilises a combination of 
liquidity forecasting and stress testing (formally documented in the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment (‘ILAA’)) to ensure 
that it retains access to sufficient liquid resources in both normal and stressed conditions to meets its liabilities as they fall due. 
Liquidity forecasting fully incorporates the impact of liquidity regulations in force in each jurisdiction and other impediments  
to the free movement of liquidity around the Group, including its own protocols on minimum liquidity to be retained by  
overseas entities.  
Stress testing is undertaken on a quarterly basis upon a range of individual and combined, firm specific and market wide, short 
and medium term scenarios that represent plausible but severe stress events to ensure the Group has appropriate sources of 
liquidity in place to meet such events. 
Due to the risk management strategy adopted and the changeable scale of the client trading book, the largest and most variable 
consumer of liquidity is PBs margin requirements. The collateral calls are met in cash from own funds but to ensure liquidity is 
available for extreme spikes the Group has a committed bank facility of £40.0 million to meet short term liquidity obligations to PBs 
in the event that it does not have sufficient access to own cash and leave a sufficient liquidity buffer to cope with a stress event.
The Group does not engage in maturity transformation as part of its underlying business and therefore maturity mismatch of 
assets and liabilities does not represent a liquidity risk to the Group.

Capital management
The Group’s objectives for managing capital are as follows:
• to comply with the capital requirements set by the financial market regulators to which the Group is subject;
• to ensure that all Group entities are able to operate as going concerns and satisfy any minimum externally imposed capital 
requirements; and
• to ensure that the Group maintains a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
The capital resources of the Group consists of equity, being share capital reduced by own shares held in trust, share premium, 
other reserves and retained earnings, which at 31 March 2017 totalled £195,773,000 (31 March 2016: £176,327,000).
The Group is supervised on a consolidated basis by the FCA.
The Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), prepared under the requirements of the FCA and the 
Capital Requirements Directive, is an on-going assessment of CMC Markets’ risks and risk mitigation strategies, to ensure that 
adequate capital is maintained against risks that the Group wishes to take to achieve its business objectives.
The outcome of the ICAAP is presented as an Internal Capital Assessment document covering the Group. It is reviewed and 
approved by the Board on an annual basis.
Further information on the Group’s management of regulatory capital is provided in the ‘Pillar 3 Disclosure’ report, which is 
available on the CMC Markets plc website (www.cmcmarkets.com/group). The Group’s country-by-country reporting disclosure 
is also available in the same location on the website.
30.  Share-based payment
The Company operates both equity and cash settled share options schemes for certain employees including Directors.
Current awards have been granted under the terms of the Management Equity Plan 2015 (‘2015 MEP’), the UK Share Incentive 
Plan (‘UK SIP’) and the International Share Incentive Plan (‘Australian SIP’). Equity settled schemes are offered to certain 
employees, including Executive Directors in the UK and Australia and automatically vest on vest date subject to conditions 
described below for each scheme. Cash settled schemes are offered to certain employees outside of the UK and Australia. 
Equity schemes for UK employees are settled net of employee taxes due.
Income statement charge for share-based payments
The total charge costs relating to these schemes for the year ended 31 March 2017 was £4,408,000 (Year ended 31 March 
2016: £6,486,000) where prior year charges include exceptional costs detailed in Note 6.
For the year ended 31 March 2017 the charge relating to equity-settled share-based payments was £3,107,000 (Year ended 31 
March 2016: £5,254,000) and the charge relating to cash-settled share-based payments was £1,301,000 (Year ended 31 March 
2016: £1,232,000).
No shares were gifted to employees during the year (Year ended 31 March 2016: nil).

160 161 Current Schemes
2015 MEP
Share options granted under the 2015 MEP have been in the form of ‘non-market performance’ or a combination of ‘non-
market performance’ and ‘market performance’ awards. The Remuneration Committee approves any awards made under the 
2015 MEP . Current schemes are:
• Executive Retention Scheme: awards to certain Executive Directors which were granted at listing and in November 2016. 
The only vesting condition of the shares granted at listing is that the Executive Directors remain employed by the Group. 
The options have dividend equivalence where additional shares will be awarded in place of dividends on vesting. Equity 
settled awards made in November 2016 are a combination of ‘market performance’ and ‘non-market performance’ awards. 
The awards are based on three performance conditions: T otal Shareholder Return (TSR), diluted earnings per share and 
customer satisfaction measures and in addition the employee must remain employed by the Group.
• Long T erm Incentive Plan: awards to senior management and critical staff, excluding Executive Directors, which were granted at 
listing and in November 2016. The only vesting condition of the awards made at listing is that the employees remain employed 
by the Group. The options have dividend equivalence where additional shares will be awarded in place of dividends on vesting. 
Equity settled awards made in November 2016 are a combination of ‘market performance’ and ‘non-market performance’ 
awards. The awards are based on three performance conditions: T otal Shareholder Return (TSR), diluted earnings per share and 
customer satisfaction measuresand in addition the employee must remain employed by the Group. 
• The fair value of awards made under the TSR criteria for both the schemes above was calculated using an options pricing 
model and was 29.2p per option. The significant inputs into the model were share price at grant date of 192.5p, volatility of 
39%, and an expected option life of three years.

CMC Markets plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements Financial statements
164 165 CMC Markets began trading in 1989 as a foreign exchange 
broker, led by founder Peter Cruddas. In 1996, the Group 
launched the world’s first online retail forex trading platform, 
offering its clients the opportunity to take advantage of markets 
previously only accessible to institutional traders.
CMC Markets has since become a global leader in online 
trading. There have been a number of significant milestones for 
the Group over the past 28 years, as it has expanded into new 
markets around the world and continues to promote innovation 
and new trading technology.
In 2000, CMC Markets expanded its business to become  
a CFD broker. A year later, the Group launched an online 
financial spread betting service, becoming the first spread 
betting company to release the daily Rolling Cash
®
 Bet. The 
ground-breaking daily Rolling Cash
®
 concept was to become  
an industry benchmark. In 2002, CMC Markets opened its first 
overseas office in Sydney, launching into the Australian market 
as an online CFD and forex provider. By 2007, the Group had 
expanded its global footprint with offices in New Zealand, 
Germany, Canada, Singapore and Sweden. Further global 
growth followed over the next few years, with offices opened 
across Europe – and most recently in Poland, in 2015. The 
Group continued to grow its product offering during the year, 
following the launch of its fixed-odds Countdowns product  
in 2015.
Group history
The Company successfully listed on the London Stock Exchange 
in February 2016. In April 2016 CMC Markets successfully 
introduced binary trading. Later in the year it unveiled Knock-
Outs in Germany and Austria, as CMC Markets became the first 
CFD provider to offer the product in Germany, reinforcing its 
position as a global leader in innovation.
Further cementing its place as one of the industry leaders, the 
Group were awarded a number of important accolades during 
the year. In the 2016 Investment Trends UK Leveraged Trading 
Report, which measures customer satisfaction, CMC Markets 
ranked first across 17 service categories among CFD traders. 
The Group achieved the highest rating for overall satisfaction, 
mobile trading, platform features and charting in all three 
product segments of spread betting, CFD trading and FX. 
Additional notable recognition came as the company won 
Financial Services Provider of the Year for the fourth successive 
year, an award voted for by the readers of Shares magazine.
The Group also received Best CFD Broker for its burgeoning 
institutional offering, in line with one of its core strategic 
objectives, following on from its new CFD API technology which 
was unveiled earlier in the year.
