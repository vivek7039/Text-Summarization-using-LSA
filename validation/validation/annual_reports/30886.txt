  Find out more about us at www.arrowglobalir.net We succeed together
Taking ownership and ensuring a positive 
outcome for both our customers and our 
business. We do this by being collaborative 
and supporting each other, wherever 
we work or reside.
In October 2017, we committed to 
‘Building Better Financial Futures’ for 
our stakeholders, when we formally 
launched the Group’s purpose and 
values in every country, and across 
all businesses.
The Group has grown quickly 
and has been successful, steadily 
increasing our profit and delivered 
great returns for our shareholders. 
While we must continue to deliver 
against our targets and budgets, 
how we do this and the behaviours 
we adopt in doing so, are equally 
important. We are convinced that 
for any business to be successful, 
and to sustain this success, it has 
to embrace a higher purpose and 
have common values, whatever 
the local cultural nuances, local 
regulations and laws. 
Our purpose is ‘Building Better 
Financial Futures’ and is an important 
step to building a ‘One Arrow’ 
culture that we believe is critical 
to our continued success. 
Building better financial futures 
is inspirational and aspirational. 
It inspires, because it takes our 
outward focus to a new level; not 
just emphasising the importance 
of ‘doing the right thing’ for our 
customers or clients, but ensuring 
we understand their needs by 
putting every one of us in our 
customers’ shoes. 
It is aspirational, as it will drive us 
to continually do better. Everyone 
in the Group has a role to play and 
the more we use the purpose as 
our guiding principle, the more 
we will make a difference for 
our stakeholders.
Underpinning this is a set of common 
values; our framework for how we 
all agree to behave and treat each 
other – as individuals and as a 
business. The values were shaped 
by colleagues in each country, 
through workshops and meetings. 
Alongside the values, we introduced 
a Group employee recognition 
scheme to all companies in the 
Group. This gives everyone in the 
Group the opportunity to recognise 
those colleagues who are living the 
values in their day-to-day roles, 
going above and beyond what is 
required, and demonstrating how 
they are helping to build better 
financial futures.
Our purpose should
guide all that we do. The
Group’s values should become the 
behaviours and actions we will live 
by. Our actions will become stories. 
And it is the stories that will make us 
who we are.
We see many examples of our 
colleagues in all countries embracing 
our purpose and values and truly 
acting as One Arrow, and it is this 
that will inspire us all to a new level 
of excellence.

Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FURTHER GROWTH & 
CONSISTENT DELIVERY
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
 “Arrow Global’s stated mission is 
to ‘Build Better Financial Futures’ 
and I believe that the strides the 
Company has made this year put 
it in a stronger position to do 
this than ever before.”
Another strong year of growth and delivery 
I am pleased to be able to present another strong set 
of financial results during a year which saw the Company 
continue to register significant growth and add another 
market to our geographical footprint. 
We have continued to diversify our earnings, with further 
growth in our high quality, capital light income from our 
asset management business, which grew revenues by 53.5%. 
We are a more diversified Group than ever before, growing 
the geographical and asset class mix of our debt purchase 
business by investing 36.7% of our capital in the UK, 24.7% 
in Portugal, 18.9% in Italy and 19.7% in Benelux. During the 
year, we completed the acquisitions of Zenith in Italy and 
Mars Capital in the UK and Ireland, significantly enhancing 
our European capabilities. 
Profit after tax increased by 51.7% to £39.9 million giving 
an increase in basic earnings per share of 51.0% to 22.8p. 
Financially, we have again delivered against our guidance, 
with underlying basic earnings per share increasing 24.1% 
to 32.4p and underlying return on equity increasing by 
3.8 percentage points to 32.9%.  05
Strategic report
www.arrowglobalir.net
This strong performance enables us to propose a final 2017 
dividend of 8.1p, bringing the full year dividend to 11.3p 
(2016: 9.1p) which is at the top of our payout range. Once 
again, balance sheet strength and management is key to the 
business’ success and earlier in the year we undertook a highly 
successful refinancing, securing a material reduction in our 
cost of funding with our weighted average cost of debt falling 
below 4.0% at the same time as extending duration.
The evolution of our model
Our strategy of building top three positions in our chosen 
European markets has remained on track throughout 2017. 
The servicing capabilities we have continued to build, 
underpinned by the strong relationships we have with 
institutional investors, has meant our asset management 
division has been the fastest growing part of the Group. 
The highly cash generative nature of this business has 
further improved the quality of the Company’s earnings 
stream. We have a clear plan in place to continue to grow 
this business as we identify further high value niches within 
our large markets where Arrow’s superior technology, data 
and relationships provide us with a competitive advantage. 
Group governance
The Group operates in a number of countries with strong 
local management teams that have responsibility for 
their operations. This structure has been enhanced by the 
appointment of Dave Sutherland as Group chief operating 
officer, who the country management teams now report 
to. The appointment of our new Group chief risk officer, 
Clodagh Gunnigle, earlier in the year has also brought 
greater structure and diligence to our risk and governance 
procedures, with Group wide risk and compliance teams all 
reporting to her . This revised structure has allowed management 
at the Group level to focus on strategy, origination and capital 
allocation. Overseen by our Group chief executive officer 
and Group chief financial officer, I believe that this is the 
most efficient structure for the Group’s governance and 
consider the company very well positioned to perform 
optimally at the operational level. 
The Board
The Arrow board is a strong group of highly experienced 
individuals who all bring valuable experience and skills 
to bear in Arrow’s thinking and strategy. Last year, we 
announced that we had appointed Paul Cooper as our new 
Group chief financial officer. His strong financial services 
experience and track record of driving operational change 
through large companies, means he is a great addition to the 
team. Our previous Group chief financial officer, Rob Memmott, 
left us at the end of February 2018, and I would like to thank 
Rob on behalf of the Board for his dedication and the important 
role he has played in successfully growing the Company. Our 
Group chief executive officer, Lee Rochford, continues to 
deliver effectively on the Group’s strategic objectives. Lee leads 
a strong Executive team comprising a mix of established 
members and new hires. Their energy, commitment and 
focus on key strategic deliverables have had a marked 
impact on our results.
One Arrow – fostering a culture that underpins our values
Arrow’s mission statement is to ‘Build Better Financial Futures’ 
for our customers across all the markets in which we operate. 
In order to continue to build and improve on this goal, 
throughout the course of the year we launched each of our 
four Group values: ‘We succeed together’, ‘We’re trusted 
and valued’, ‘We’re brave and creative’ and ‘We do the right 
thing’. In order to embed these into our Company DNA and 
Group-wide approach to our operations, the management 
team embarked on a series of roadshows around all countries 
in the Group to present their vision for the business and get 
feedback from employees. I am pleased to say that feedback 
to this initiative from across the Group has been overwhelmingly 
positive, and it is a great source of pride for us that our 
employees are so committed to a positive working culture 
focused on excellent customer experience and outcomes.
Looking forward
I am pleased that Arrow has registered another year of 
strong growth and that so much has been achieved to 
integrate the business more fully, ensuring we are well 
positioned to continue to deliver the consistent financial 
performance we have registered since IPO. 
We are well positioned for 2018: the market opportunity 
for the business remains compelling and I believe we 
have the strategy, management team and employee base 
to continue to deliver on market expectations. 
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow board members, 
the senior leadership team and all colleagues for their hard 
work and commitment in 2017, and our shareholders for 
their ongoing support as we continue to evolve Arrow’s 
differentiated business model. I look ahead with a great deal 
of confidence for the business. The opportunities for Arrow 
are significant and I believe we have the right skill set at all 
levels of the Company to capitalise on them and continue 
to deliver growth and value.

OUR CORE BUSINESS MODEL
1.  Debt purchase 
We buy debt at a discount to face value and use our data, analytics, 
and collections expertise to provide our customers with flexible 
payment plans, resulting in collections significantly above cost 
of acquisition.
2. Specialist asset management 
We advise on, manage and collect debt portfolios, generating fee 
income from clients. Often, we will co-invest alongside clients, 
ensuring our interests are fully aligned. Our model consists of both 
primary servicing (where we service the debt directly for clients) and 
master servicing (where we provide oversight on behalf of our clients 
to ensure their portfolio is placed with the best primary servicer 
to deliver their investment targets).

DATA ANALYTICS 
We have a unique data tool that allows us to match debt 
portfolios efficiently. This has been compiled since the 
Company’s inception in 2005 and consists of over 35 million 
records. The richness of the data assets we hold informs 
our investment decisions and collections strategy, 
allowing us to accurately value potential portfolios and 
optimise servicing. Crucially, it also positions us well to 
provide the best treatment for our customers as we are 
able to understand their financial position and needs.
SPECIALIST PARTNERS 
We have over 110 client relationships. Having started as a 
capital investor ourselves, we are unique in how we approach 
relationships with third-party credit investors. As a preferred 
partner of institutional investors, we assist with valuation, 
co-invest alongside them (if the portfolio’s characteristics 
align with our targets) and manage the acquired assets as 
part of an ongoing asset management agreement focused 
on achieving required returns. As we are a logical buyer of 
these familiar portfolios once the assets investor decides 
to exit, we will often purchase the tails of these, providing 
our balance sheet with predictable, cash-generative assets.

Strategic Report
DELIVERING VALUE
Our customers 
We understand that debt is a 
prominent issue and aim to work 
with customers to help them improve 
their financial situation. We work 
with credit charities and other 
organisations that provide free 
impartial services to ensure our 
customers get the best advice 
available. By using our industry-
leading data and customer 
segmentation systems, we are 
able to better understand our 
customers and their financial 
situations, enabling us to interact 
with them on an individual basis. 
Our ultimate aim is to help 
customers rehabilitate their 
finances, improve their credit file 
and gain access to more affordable 
mainstream credit services 
currently unavailable to them.
Our clients
We have exceptionally strong 
relationships with financial 
institutions and institutional 
investors. This means we are able 
to assist financial institutions to 
deleverage by acquiring portfolios 
from them (our debt purchase 
business), and are strongly 
positioned to help our investment 
partners value and service their 
own portfolio acquisitions (our 
asset management business). 
This means we make many of our 
portfolio investments off market 
– either in a bilateral trade with an 
institution, or the purchase of an 
asset tail from an exiting credit 
investor on our servicing platform 
– helping us to mitigate pricing 
pressure and giving us greater 
visibility on returns.
Our colleagues
Our people provide the essential 
talent and energy to fulfil our 
purpose and goals. We rely on 
them to consistently ‘do the right 
thing’ in order to drive great 
customer service and deliver 
excellent customer outcomes.  
Our employees share in the 
Company’s success through our 
share options/purchase schemes, 
while remuneration across the 
Company is linked to a mixture of 
Group performance and personal 
success against our One Arrow 
values scorecards. This means 
their financial futures are aligned 
to ours and those of our 
other stakeholders.
Our communities
We believe in working with the 
communities where we operate, 
ensuring that we do all we can to 
have a positive influence through 
supporting local charities and 
initiatives. We have a clear strategy 
to support charities that focus on 
financial education and financial 
support and, more generally, we 
work closely with Citizens Advice 
(CA), as well as a range of debt 
charities, including StepChange, 
Payplan and Christians 
Against Poverty. 
Our shareholders
We believe that if we fulfil our 
obligations to our customers, 
clients, colleagues and communities, 
our shareholders are the ultimate 
beneficiaries. We aim to deliver 
strong returns to our shareholders, 
targeting return on equity in the 
mid-twenties percentage and 
EPS growth in the high-teens 
percentage over the medium 
term. This consistency is further 
underpinned by good balance 
sheet management that prioritises 
stable, long-term funding.

BUSINESS MODEL CONTINUED
PUTTING OUR CUSTOMERS FIRST
Continual improvements in the customer journey 
We work with our customers, leading debt charities, 
industry bodies and third-party research agencies to help 
us understand our customers’ needs. We aim to establish 
long-term affordable repayment plans, which help our 
customers rehabilitate their credit listing and gain access 
to more affordable mainstream financial products.
Through our data models, we are able to build 
consolidated customer profiles that reflect customers’ 
current circumstances and invest in leading customer service 
platforms to ensure that all our customers receive optimised 
service. In the UK, our collections colleagues are rewarded 
based on the customer outcomes they achieve, rather than 
the amount they collect.
In 2016, we launched our UK digital customer portal and saw 
an immediate increase in online payments of over 60%. The 
flexibility this system provides has continued to prove 
popular with customers, making it easy for them to engage 
with us and stay in control of their payments. 
We are continuing to focus on enhancing the fully 
integrated UK customer service platform and introducing 
the same approach across the Group. This gives us greater 
flexibility to work across multiple asset classes, performing 
and non-performing loans, allowing us to develop a true 
single customer view and assist in making more informed 
collections decisions. Every collections colleague receives 
specialist training in handling vulnerable customers and all 
collection staff regularly undertake refresher courses.
CUSTOMERS CLIENTS
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
We have built a strong track record of underwriting 
discipline, ensuring we acquire portfolios in line with our 
target returns and risk management framework. Cumulatively, 
we have collected 103% of our pre-purchase underwriting 
forecast, and have a track record of outperformance.
ORIGINATION EXPERTISE
Our focus on customer outcomes and strong track record 
means that we are a preferred purchaser from financial 
institutions. We will either purchase portfolios – often 
bilateral trades with the vendor – or, for larger acquisitions, 
will purchase via a consortium structure alongside our 
institutional investor fund partners. Our strong relationships 
with large institutions means we perform the majority 
(over 70% in 2017) of our portfolio acquisitions off market, 
rather than as part of an auction process; this offers increased 
contractual stability. Our servicing business also provides 
purchasing opportunities as credit investors utilising our 
servicing platforms look to recycle their capital.
How we acquire loan portfolios and servicing 
assets – strong client relationships
• Partner with third-party funds to acquire large portfolios 
– can then service the assets
• Majority of portfolio purchases made off market – 
trusted buyer
• Able to purchase assets from own servicing platforms 
– prior knowledge enhances performance
• Focus on customer service and positive outcomes 
makes Arrow a preferred buyer from credit originators
• Strength of asset management platform means Arrow is 
the first choice portfolio manager for many institutional 
investors clients

FINANCIAL EXCELLENCE 
The combination of our debt purchase and asset management businesses provides 
good flexibility between a high-return, capital intensive operation and an asset-light 
cash-generative operation. A balanced, long-duration capital structure, with low 
weighted average cost of debt (3.9%), provides a robust financial position.
Arrow’s business model is highly differentiated 
• Arrow is a sophisticated investor and asset manager, 
not a bulk buyer of loans
• Approach driven by strong client relationships
• Co-investment structure aligns with client interests 
for servicing
• Majority of portfolio purchases transacted off-market, 
avoiding auction pressure
• Taking incremental steps towards discretionary asset 
management model
• Aim to be a top three player in chosen markets; do not 
target geographic growth for its own sake 12

SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY
Arrow is a well positioned credit management services provider 
when considering wider market trends of deleveraging ﬁ nancial 
institutions and increasing consumer debt
WELL POSITIONED BUSINESS
Our debt purchase and asset management 
businesses are both well positioned to 
capitalise on prevailing market trends
Debt purchase
• Set up to help banks deleverage by 
purchasing their loan portfolios 
• Customer-focused model and well 
regulated business activities attractive 
to vendor banks
• Logical purchaser of asset tails from own 
platform as credit fund clients look to 
realise investments
• Strong balance sheet able to fund 
future growth
Asset management
• Strong institutional investor 
relationships make Arrow a preferred 
servicing partner
• Italian market knowledge and expertise 
significantly enhanced by 
Zenith acquisition
• Mars Capital acquisition has provided 
further secured servicing capability in 
the UK and new opportunities in the

• Increased capabilities will facilitate

Our market share 0.5%
PwC estimates that European banks currently hold €2.3 trillion 
of non-performing loans and non-core assets on their balance 
sheets. In order for the European banking system to fully 
recover from the 2008 financial crisis, and for the banks to 
start lending efficiently again, the majority of these assets 
will need to be divested over time. 
This divestment programme is beginning to be accelerated 
by strong European Central Bank action, to encourage banks 
to recognise and provide for NPLs much faster than they 
previously have done. We are already seeing the effect this is 
having on the NPL market, with total portfolio sales in 2017 
expected to conclude nearly €30 billion ahead of 2016. 
Across Arrow Global’s six geographies, we see approximately 
€60 billion of NPL sales a year, and only purchase just over 
£200.0 million.
Generally, the favoured method of divestment is by selling 
large pools of non-core and non-performing assets. With 
Arrow Global’s strong client relationships allowing us to partner 
with large institutional investors, co-invest alongside them 
and then service the entire asset on our servicing platform. 
There continue to be exciting long-term opportunities for us 
to grow both our debt purchase and asset 
management businesses. 
We operate across an increasing and diversified range of 
geographies and asset classes, affording us a degree of 
protection from the economic cycle of any one market or 
business segment. Our strong position in each country 
provides greater opportunities for the Group to evaluate 
transactions, enabling us to deploy increasing levels of 
capital, whilst maintaining investment discipline.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
“ It has been another excellent 
year of growth and ﬁ nancial 
performance.”
2017 review
2017 has been another exciting year for the business. We 
have expanded our European footprint and client offering 
further across attractive markets where the Group targets 
leadership positions. When viewed alongside our diversified 
investment portfolio and expanding asset management 
business, it has been another excellent year of growth and 
financial performance.
Strong financial performance
Total revenue grew 35.2% to £319.0 million (2016: £235.9 million), 
driven by core collections 19.7% higher at £342.2 million 
(2016: £286.0 million). Profit after tax increased by 51.7% to 
£39.9 million (2016: £26.3 million). Adjusted EBITDA increased 
10.2% to £230.6 million (2016: £209.2 million). We continue to 
see an increase in the contribution from the capital-light asset 
management business, with revenues increasing by 53.5% year 
on year; our aim is to continue to grow this business over the 
medium-term, both organically and via acquisitions.
Strong performance across the business enabled us to deliver a 
significant increase in underlying profit after tax, up 24.1% to 
£56.6 million (2016: £45.6 million), and underlying return on 
equity (ROE) now stands at 32.9% (2016: 29.1%).
Basic EPS increased by 51.0% to 22.8p (2016: 15.1p) with underlying 
basic EPS increasing by 24.1% to 32.4p (2016: 26.1p). The business 
has a track record of strong cash generation and this 
enables us to deliver excellent returns to shareholders, 
while simultaneously investing for future growth. As a result, 
the full-year dividend, including the proposed final dividend 
of 8.1p, will increase to 11.3p, representing an increase of 24.2% 
and a 35.0% payout ratio – the top of our guided range.
Debt purchasing - strong portfolio investment
2017 was another strong year for investment. We acquired a 
record number of loan portfolios and loan notes with a face value 
of £2.4 billion for a purchase price of £223.9 million. Of the 
purchase price invested, 40.7% related to secured accounts. 
Additionally, over 70% of portfolio purchases were off-market 
– a record for the Group – largely driven by our unique 
model of purchasing the tails of asset portfolios already 
being serviced on our platforms. 
Our investment portfolios across the Group continue to be 
well diversified by both geography and asset class, providing 
us with good resilience against adverse conditions in any 
country or market.
Our specialist asset management business, focusing on the 
servicing of loan portfolios for our clients, continues to be 
an important growth area for the Group, with revenues from 
this business growing strongly in 2017.
A TRANSFORMA TIONAL YEAR 17
Strategic report
www.arrowglobalir.net
Asset management – continued revenue growth
When moving into new markets, we have a strong track 
record of acquiring leading servicing businesses. By working 
to retain skilled management teams, we are able to acquire 
earnings-accretive operations and gather deep data and 
insight – allowing us to deploy more of our own capital at 
strong returns in that market in the future. We expect to 
repeat this model with our acquisition of Mars Capital. This 
provided us with a strategic entry into Ireland – a new market 
for the Group, offering a €59 billion NPL opportunity – and 
significantly enhanced our servicing capabilities for mortgages 
in the UK. The acquisition is already delivering value and we 
closed our first deal on the new platform in December. As part 
of the acquisition, we also announced a strategic partnership 
with Oaktree, a leading global asset manager with over 
USD$100 billion under management. 
The strategic partnership with a tier one institutional investor 
and the two Italian acquisitions we have announced, represent 
another important step in the evolution of our asset management 
business as we move closer towards our ambition of managing 
discretionary funds on behalf of our clients.
Our aspirations for the asset management business continue 
to be high, and we are aiming to continue to grow significantly 
the business’ contribution to Group revenues. 
The Italian opportunity 
Italy is a core strategic market for us. The large size of its 
NPL market, with over €300 billion of NPLs on bank balance 
sheets and extended asset tails, provides significant long-term 
opportunities. Its specific characteristics mean that we have 
entered the country with diligence and discipline. The team 
took two years to analyse the market before deciding that 
Zenith, the master servicing business we purchased in 2017, 
was the right entry point. This acquisition has exceeded our 
expectations in all respects: AUM has grown by over 70% 
and the deep insight it has given us into the Italian market’s 
characteristics has allowed us to invest our own capital 
ahead of forecasts, and at excellent returns. Importantly, all 
investments were originated in off-market deals from the 
Zenith platform and are, therefore, assets on which we have 
excellent performance visibility.
Having made a successful start, and established strong 
foundations, we believe that now is the right time to expand 
the business. Market activity is high, as regulatory pressure 
to deal with Italian bank balance sheets has started to take 
effect and asset sales rose from €34.0 billion in 2016 to a 
projected €64.0 billion in 2017. The market potential remains 
considerable and we are seeing strong demand from Arrow’s 
clients in the alternative asset space for us to deploy the 
same capability in Italy that we have successfully offered 
them elsewhere, offering our cross-asset class special 
servicing capabilities in high level niches we understand well, 
and where we are prepared to invest our own money. This 
targeted approach is key to our success; we will not attempt 
to cover the entire Italian market, but only the parts where 
we can develop an edge and generate solid returns.
In other markets, we have built the leading servicing platform 
for both ourselves and third-party investors through a 
combination of acquisitions and organic build. We believe 
that this strategy will serve us well in Italy too given our 
long-term commitment to the market.
Our track record demonstrates that we are able to achieve 
the following:
• identify the right management teams, which fit with 
Arrow’s culture and bring local expertise;
• buy platforms at attractive prices in off-market deals, 
where value accretes to our shareholders; and
• grow acquired platforms swiftly after acquisition by tapping 
into Arrow’s broad origination footprint across a wide range 
of financial institutions and alternative asset manager clients.
The two new bolt-on acquisitions of Parr Credit – a specialist 
servicer for sophisticated financial investors that has diversified 
into small ticket utilities and telecoms servicing – and Europa 
Investimenti – an expert investor in non-performing corporate 
and SME business – are consistent with this approach. In 
addition, investment will be required in order to build out 
our credit platform offering for clients. Expanding asset class 
offerings (notably secured), systems, governance and risk 
infrastructure and adding management depth will involve a 
two-year programme of investment. This will contribute to 
our ability to grow our investment portfolio conservatively, with 
continued underwriting discipline, and to our stated ambition 
to grow asset management revenues materially by the end 
of 2018 and beyond.
Strengthened funding
During the year, we took the opportunity to strengthen and 
secure our long-term funding. In March, the Group issued 
€400 million senior secured floating rate notes due 2025, 
at a coupon of E+2.875%. 
This has meant that the Group’s weighted average cost of 
debt has been significantly reduced to 3.9% (2016: 4.9%) 
and the weighted average maturity of the Group’s debt at 
31 December 2017 was 6.1 years (2016: 5.8 years) with no 
facility maturing before March 2022. This positions us well to 
continue to run the balance sheet efficiently and capitalise 
on opportunities presented by market conditions.
We continue to be open to further opportunities to reduce 
our weighted average cost of debt and extend its duration.
Investing for growth - One Arrow
While the runway for growth provided by our significant 
market opportunity remains substantial, our strategy centres 
on controlled growth of our balance sheet, allowing us to 
maintain underwriting discipline and returns within our 
balanced capital structure.
The combination of our origination strengths, client relationships 
and servicing platforms means that we are well positioned to 
take advantage of the potential to grow capital-light asset 
management revenues. To achieve this in a safe, disciplined 
and sustainable way, we took the decision earlier in the year 
to invest further in our core capabilities.
This will see us strengthening governance and Group capabilities, 
using our knowledge and expertise from certain geographies 
in order to improve efficiency across the board. Areas of focus 
will be in our core centres of excellence: Origination, Data & 
Analytics, Portfolio Management, Risk Management and 
Change & IT Functions. In addition, we are increasing investment 
in our servicing and operating platforms across the Group to 
improve customer journeys through enhanced digital capabilities, 
which in turn, will produce improvements in our productivity.
We have outlined an investment and restructuring programme 
totalling £22.0 million across 2017 and 2018. On completion 
we will have more scalable, resilient platforms, optimised to 
support future growth. 18
STRATEGIC REPORT
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Our people
We have continued to grow welcoming new colleagues 
during the year. At the Group executive level, our Group 
chief financial officer, Rob Memmott, decided to step down 
following nearly seven years of excellent service. I would like 
to thank Rob for his huge contribution to the growth of the 
Company, and wish him the very best for the future. We 
announced in October last year that Paul Cooper would be 
joining us as Group chief financial officer in January 2018, 
and I look forward to working closely with Paul as we continue 
to steer the business along a strong growth trajectory in the 
coming years. The way in which the business develops and 
operates will be key to its success and we welcomed Clodagh 
Gunnigle as our new Group chief risk officer earlier in the year. 
Clodagh has significant experience driving risk strategy at 
large financial companies and will play a pivotal role in ensuring 
that Arrow continues to grow prudently. Most recently, we 
announced the appointment of Dave Sutherland as our 
new Group chief operating officer. His experience will add 
considerably to our management expertise at a time when 
we are continuing to grow our operations and ensure we 
maintain and strengthen our leading management capabilities. 
Following these appointments at the Group executive level, 
we streamlined the management structure. The country 
heads now report directly into Dave Sutherland, which will 
ensure that we share best practice and drive operational 
excellence across the business. 
As ever, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the 
wider Arrow Global team for all their hard work this year. 
Good culture is such an important part of any organisation, 
and I am proud to see the ongoing commitment from all my 
colleagues to Arrow’s commitment to ‘Building Better 
Financial Futures’ for all of our stakeholders. I’m excited 
about what we can all achieve together in the coming year, 
as we continue to place our values at the heart of 
the business.
Outlook
I continue to be optimistic about the potential for the business 
in a growing market. Focus on the health of financial institutions’ 
balance sheets continues to increase. Indeed, this year saw 
the European Central Bank being particularly vocal on the 
issue, suggesting banks must provision for non-performing 
loans much faster than they currently do. Combined with the 
European Banking Authority’s focus on reducing the stock of 
NPLs, this is likely to lead to increased volumes of asset sales 
across Europe, generating opportunities for Arrow to purchase 
and manage more portfolios, feeding both our debt purchase 
and asset management businesses.
Consensus regarding forecasts for UK and European GDP 
growth remains positive, but we remain well positioned to 
capitalise on any market opportunities presented by a turn 
in the economic cycle. This is supported by our resilient 
back book of paying customers and the ensuing front book 
opportunities that would arise from a portfolio pricing 
perspective in a downward cycle. As previously guided, 
we do not expect Brexit to impact our ability to operate and 
purchase portfolios in Europe, since we are individually 
licensed in all of our jurisdictions and are not reliant on the 
UK’s continuing membership of the EU.
We believe that regulatory oversight will continue to evolve in 
European markets and view this as favourable for businesses 
such as Arrow that have scale, strong funding structures and 
a focus on the right customer outcomes. We constantly evaluate 
and evolve risk and compliance activities across the entire Group, 
regardless of geography, and, wherever possible, share 
best practice. 
Increasingly, our clients look for respected partners which comply 
with regulatory requirements and have strong reputations for 
dealing fairly with customers. At Arrow Global, we are committed 
to achieving the right outcomes for our customers and I believe 
we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the 
opportunities this presents.
We remain neutral on pricing in each of our markets. While 
competition is evident across all jurisdictions, our model of 
purchasing the majority of our portfolio acquisitions off-market 
provides us with a degree of protection. The fact that we 
purchase only around half a per cent on an annual basis of all 
NPLs sold across the markets in which we operate means that 
we can be highly selective, only acquiring portfolios where we 
are confident we can achieve our required returns. Our 
diversification across geographies and asset classes on 
portfolios where our data and analytics can provide us with 
an advantage gives me great confidence about our 
future performance.
We remain relatively well insulated against the potential for 
interest rate rises when viewed alongside our strengthened 
funding position and reduced weighted average cost of debt 
fixed over a long duration. Moreover , over 60% of our unsecured 
customers do not have a mortgage, the asset most geared 
towards interest rate hikes, meaning we would not expect to 
see a material increase in payment breakage rates should interest 
rates rise. Furthermore, over two thirds of our balance sheet is 
hedged against rate rises.
In the coming year, we will remain focused on the strategic 
advantages afforded by our unique business model. We will:
• purchase specialist portfolios where we have a 
data advantage;
• maintain our strong relationships with primary lenders 
and our institutional investor clients to continue to buy 
off-market as a preferred purchaser;
• target acquisitions that provide a strategic fit; 
• continue to scale up our presence in geographies that 
fit our investment criteria; and 
• focus on our partner relationships with institutional 
investors to continue to expand our asset 
management business.
We therefore remain confident in our ability to deliver on 
our targets of achieving a medium-term underlying ROE 
percentage in the mid-twenties, high teen EPS growth 
and a progressive dividend policy.

LIVING OUR VALUES
Louise takes back control
Louise works in the public sector. 
Her circumstances improved, and 
she was earning more money each 
month. Previously, she had run 
up debts with different providers 
and she had taken the decision 
to appoint a debt management 
company to work on her behalf. 
This can be a useful way of dealing 
with creditors, but the debt 
management company charged 
a monthly fee and Louise realised 
the substantial amount she had 
paid in fees over many years.
With her improved situation, Louise 
decided to take control of her 
finances and called Arrow Global 
directly to discuss her current and 
future repayments.
Our agent took time to discuss 
Louise’s income and expenditure 
and it was identified that Louise 
could afford to increase her 
repayments from £52 per month 
to £100 per month. This would 
significantly reduce the time it 
would take Louise repay her debt.
After further discussion, Louise 
wanted to retain some flexibility 
on her disposable income in case 
of emergencies, so Louise agreed 
to increase her repayments to 
£80 per month. A further review 
was scheduled for six months, 
as Louise felt her circumstances 
may improve again. 
In this case, our agent was helpful 
throughout the call, appropriately 
signposting the free money advice 
services that are available, but after 
it was apparent Louise wanted to 
take control of her repayments to 
us, we supported her to ensure we 
found the most appropriate outcome 
for Louise’s circumstances. 20
STRATEGIC REPORT
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
 “The business has produced another 
good set of numbers, delivering 
strong returns and with a robust 
capital structure.”
STRONG RETURNS FOR 2017
I am pleased to present another good set of results for 2017. 
They demonstrate strong returns together with high growth, 
underpinned by operational and financial excellence across 
the business contributing to sustainable, profitable growth 
and enhanced shareholder value.
Important note:
Both IFRS and cash metrics are important to understand the key 
drivers of the business. The reconciliations and commentary on 
the following pages have been prepared to aid this understanding, 
which helps to support the commentary of the financial review 
for the year. 
Profit after tax increased
Profit after tax for the Group for 2017 has risen by 51.7% to £39 . 9 million 
(2016: £26.3 million). The growth in earnings has been driven by 
increased revenues from both our debt purchase business and 
our asset management business. Collections performance has 
been strong (ahead of our ERC forecast) across the Group. 
Our capital-light asset management revenues have increased by 
£24.8 million from £46.3 million to £71.1 million driven by the Zenith 
acquisition completed in April 2017 and a full-year effect of the 
Vesting acquisition completed in May 2016. Capital-light asset 
management revenue is now 22% of Group revenues, and 
we aim to increase this further in 2018.
The 2017 profit after tax of £39.9 million (2016: £26.3 million) 
includes £2.4 million of acquisition costs and £27 .4 million associated 
with restructuring the Group’s long-term financing. The saving 
in interest costs as a result of the refinancing will be beneficial 
to the Group’s income statement in future years. The refinancing 
extended the maturity of our facilities at a lower finance cost, 
ensuring the financial position is sufficiently well structured to 
support and fund the continued growth plans of the Group.
In October 2017 , we completed the sale of our 15% economic interest 
in MCS Groupe. The disposal generated a pre-tax gain of £14.7 million 
and proceeds of £18.1 million. The proceeds will be reinvested in 
the Mars Capital acquisition and the One Arrow programme.
Strong returns and increased dividend delivered
The underlying return on equity (ROE) for the Group in 2017 
is 32.9%, up from 29.1% last year, and well above our target 
of ‘mid-20s underlying ROE’. This metric is a key driver of 
shareholder value. 
Basic EPS for 2017 is 22.8p compared to 15.1p in 2016, with the 
increase largely due to the growth in revenue. Underlying basic 
EPS has increased 24.1% to 32.4p (2016: 26.1p). The Group has 
established a progressive dividend policy. The strong cash 
result for the year, supported by the continued growth in the 
asset management business, enables good returns to be made  21
www.arrowglobalir.net
Strategic report
to our shareholders whilst allowing for future investment 
and growth. As such, the full-year dividend, including the 
proposed final dividend of 8.1p for 2017 will increase to 11.3p, 
up 24.2%, and represents a 35% payout of underlying 
profit after tax.
Strong portfolio purchases 
Our purchased loan portfolio asset base and loan notes 
increased by 18.3% to £951.5 million (2016: £804.1 million), 
which helps to support the future flow of collections and 
revenue streams. 
This was driven by another excellent year of organic portfolio 
purchases of £223.9 million, a slight increase from 2016’s 
£223.0 million. The face value of debt portfolios acquired in 
the year was £2,450 million, with an average purchase price 
of 9.1p per £1. For the year to 31 December 2017, the 120-month 
expected gross money multiple for this vintage is 1.8 times 
(2016: 1.9 times) from the date of purchase. This is slightly 
below our 2.0 times target and the 2016 comparative given 
the proportion of secured portfolios and portfolios acquired 
from our asset management platforms, which we regard as 
lower risk within the vintage. Of the purchase price invested, 
40.7% related to secured portfolios and 33.8% was acquired 
from our asset management business. There was a good 
balance of investment by geography, including a healthy 
level of investment in Italy.
In the year, the Group acquired debt portfolios significantly 
in excess of the required replacement rate (the amount of 
annual investment required to keep the ERC constant). 
This higher level of acquired portfolios will increase future 
collections. This is reflected in the increased value of the 
ERC (84 months) from £1,339.1 million to £1,516.9 million, 
an increase of 13.3%. In addition, in the year we decided to 
allocate an additional £18.0 million of capital to legal 
collection costs, in order to enhance the value of the 
back book. This has increased collections and our ERC. 
As described on page 24, it is the collections performance 
and size of the ERC which drives income recognised on 
loan portfolios.
All portfolios continue to be monitored carefully and, where 
appropriate, adjusted for in the ERC forecast based upon our 
detailed modelling. Although it has increased in total, the 
ERC has been adjusted down to account for any areas of 
underperformance.
Core collections increased
Core collections increased to £342.2 million (2016: £286.0 million), 
reflecting the increase in our portfolio asset base. Collections 
were ahead of our ERC forecast and reflect the impact of 
collection strategy initiatives, such as litigation, the digital 
customer portal and the increased use of data sources. 
Collections on UK books, in particular, have performed 
strongly in the year . Collections on our Portuguese portfolios 
have improved in the second half of 2017. In the period we 
acquired our first portfolios in Italy; to date these portfolios 
have collected in line with our underwriting forecast.
As at 31 December 2017, we have cumulatively collected 103% 
of our original underwriting forecast (2016: 103%) excluding 
foreign exchange impacts, reflecting the success of our data 
driven approach to underwriting. 
Alternative performance measures
The Group believes that the use of alternative performance measures (‘APMs’) for profitability, earnings per share and cash 
metrics, provide valuable information to the readers of the financial statements. They can provide a more comparable basis for 
assessing the Group’s performance between financial periods, by adjusting for items that by virtue of their size, nature or 
incidence are not necessarily representative of the ongoing performance of the business. APMs also reflect key operating 
targets and are used to monitor performance by the Board. However, any APM’s in this document are not a substitute for, but 
complement reported measures, and readers should also consider the reported measures.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Revenues and EBITDA increased
Total revenue for the year was £319.0 million, an increase 
of 35.2% from the 2016 comparative of £235.9 million. 
£58.3 million of the increase came from purchased loan 
portfolios and loan notes and £24.8 million was from asset 
management services. The latter was due to a full period of 
results for Vesting and the acquisition of Zenith in April 2017. 
The increase in collections drove an increase in Adjusted 
EBITDA of 10.2% to £230.6 million (2016: £209.2 million). 
The reconciliation for the year of net operating cash flow to 
the cash result, including a reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA, 
is provided on page 137. Adjusted EBITDA is a key driver of 
the cash result and allows us to monitor the operating 
performance of the Group.
Total income from asset management in 2017 was 22.3% 
(2016: 19.6%) of total revenue, and we expect this to 
continue to grow in 2018.
As noted above, we increased our spend on litigation 
collections strategies in the period by £18 million; this has 
increased our ERC, but also our cost ratios in the period 
(in combination with a larger asset management business, 
which has higher costs to collect). Reflecting this and 
the enlarged business, collection costs increased by 
68.6% to £118.5 million (2016: £70.3 million). 
Underlying performance
Profit after tax for the year increased to £39.9 million from 
£26.3 million in 2016, largely due to the growth in revenue. 
The contribution from our minority interest in MCS 
Groupe reduced from £2.4 million to £1.6 million as a result 
of divestment of the business in October 2017. This resulted 
in a gain on disposal of £14.7 million.
Profit before tax was adjusted by items totalling £19.7 million 
which arose from; the refinancing of both the €400 million 
floating rate note and the Group’s RCF, costing £27.4 million, 
‘One Arrow’ costs of £4.7 million and £2.4 million from corporate 
acquisitions that completed in the year. These costs were 
partially offset by the gain on disposal of the Group’s associate, 
MCS. Costs of the ‘One Arrow’ programme were split broadly 
evenly between the Netherlands, in respect of the office 
consolidation, and in the UK, where the cost covered 
reorganising a number of aspects of the business. All of 
these items are adjusted from reported profit to give an 
underlying profit, as the items are considered, due to their size 
and nature, to be outside of the normal operating activities 
of the Group. These items had a tax impact of £3.1 million. 
The tax charge for 2017 represents an effective tax rate of 
21.1% (2016: 16.1%) on profit before tax. The effective tax rate 
has increased due to higher expenses not deductible for tax 
purposes, a higher level of taxable incoming from overseas 
countries with higher tax rates and a chargeable gain. 
The effective tax rate on underlying profit was 19.5% 
(2016: 16.2%). 
Net assets, funding and net debt
Net assets increased £27.9 million during the period, mostly 
reflecting the retained profit for the period of £39.9 million, 
foreign currency translation of £2.4 million and share-based 
payment movements of £3.3 million, offset by the final 2016 
approved dividend and 2017 interim dividend paid totalling 
£16.8 million. 
Net debt increased by £132.4 million to £948.4 million 
(2016: £816.0 million), driven by the acquisitions of Zenith and 
Mars Capital, organic portfolio purchases, and foreign exchange. 
The Group is committed to maintaining its strong financial 
profile and aims to maintain the ratio of secured net debt 
to adjusted EBITDA between 3.5x-4.0x, achieving 3.9x in both 
2017 and 2016. Similarly, cash interest cover was 5.9x, comfortably 
ahead of target at greater than 4.0x and ahead of 2016’s 5.2x. 
The ratio of net debt to 84-month ERC (LTV) was 62.5% as at 
31 December 2017 (2016: 60.8%), which is significantly below 
our financial covenant of 75%. The secured loan to value ratio, 
which cannot exceed 65.0%, is 59.7% (2016: 57.0%).
In February 2017, Moody’s upgraded the Group’s credit rating 
and Notes rating to Ba3 from B1. In addition, the Group increased 
its RCF by £35 million to £215 million, adding a fifth bank.
On 30 March 2017, the Group issued €400 million senior 
secured floating rate notes due 2025, at a coupon of 
E+2.875% (the ‘2025 Notes’). 
The proceeds of the 2025 Notes were used to redeem 
the existing 2021 Notes, pay the early redemption and 
transaction costs and repay drawings under our RCF. 
The early redemption of the 2021 Notes resulted in finance 
costs of £27.4 million, of which £17.6 million related to the 
cash call premium and cancellation of interest rate hedging 
linked to the 2021 Notes, with the remaining £9.8 million 
due to a non-cash write-off of related transaction fees. 
In January 2018, the Group increased the RCF by £40 million 
to £255 million and extended that facility to 2023, meaning 
that the Group has cash and RCF headroom of £136.5 million, 
and an average debt maturity of 6.2 years with no debt 
maturing before January 2023. To maintain headroom the 
Group has entered into a €60 million bridge facility which 
expires on 15 May 2018.
Summary
The financial performance of the Group for 2017 was strong. 
We have continued to grow our asset management business, 
broadened and deepened our geographical footprint and 
reduced our cost of capital with an extended 
funding maturity.
We have invested in the Group via the One Arrow programme, 
which will see stronger governance, improved centres of 
excellence and increased efficiency and productivity across 
the Group’s operating platforms.

LIVING OUR VALUES
Jennifer and the impact of 
illness and bereavement
Jennifer is retired and suffering 
from a long-term illness, recently 
being hospitalised. The shock of 
the unexpected death of her 
grandson added to her distress 
and meant she was unable to keep 
up with her finances.
When Jennifer was discharged 
from the hospital, she was keen 
to resume her repayments to us. 
Her only income is her pension 
and pension credits, and after 
payment of priority bills and 
other outgoings, she has a 
modest surplus each fortnight. 
Her outstanding debt with Arrow 
is a few hundred pounds and she 
was keen to repay this as quickly 
as possible. 
While we will discuss with 
customers the option to consider 
higher repayments where they 
can, as this will often substantially 
reduce the time it takes to repay 
their outstanding debt, in this 
instance our agent cautioned 
against not overstretching herself. 
After further discussion, it was 
agreed that a lower repayment than 
Jennifer initially suggested would 
be taken over five months, but with 
the provision to review if this 
caused her any problems. 
In this instance, this is a great 
example of how a customer often 
tries to repay their debt as soon 
as possible; and where we need 
to help them strike a balance of 
reducing their debt, whilst not 
causing additional hardship. 
Supporting our customers to 
take control of their finances 
is important but equally 
understanding our customers 
full background and 
taking time to 
understand their circumstances 
can help us assist them in 
achieving the best outcome 
for them. 
BUILDING BETTER FINANCIAL FUTURES 
FOR OUR CUSTOMERS 24
STRATEGIC REPORT
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Introduction
We provide two reconciliations between reported IFRS profit 
and cash measures. The first looks at the movement in our 
purchased loan portfolios and loan notes compared to the 
movements in the ERC - the gross cash value of the portfolio 
before it is discounted to present value for inclusion in the 
reported results. The second reconciles the reported profit 
for the period to the cash result. For completeness we also 
separate out other adjusting items. A number of the terms 
referred to in this section are defined in the glossary on 
pages 138 to 140.
Our core competence is using data to identify, manage 
and collect non-performing purchased loan portfolios. 
We use this competence to drive two key revenue streams: 
debt purchase, where we acquire the portfolio; and asset 
management, where we manage the portfolio, but do not 
take capital risk. 
The way in which the business recognises revenue on each 
of these business streams differs substantially.
Debt purchase
For the debt purchase part of the business, we acquire portfolios 
and turn these into regular , predictable and long-term cash flows; 
this involves high volumes of low value collections from customers. 
We use analytical models to estimate cash flows we expect 
at an individual account level. The output of these account level 
forecasts is aggregated to a portfolio and then into the 
Group’s total ERC. 
The price paid for the portfolio, collections experience 
and our ERC drive portfolio income. 
When we purchase loan portfolios and loan notes, we recognise 
them in the statement of financial position at the purchase 
price in accordance with IFRS. In terms of the equivalent cash 
measure, we add the portfolio ERC to the Group ERC at the point 
of purchase. We quote both 84-month and 120-month ERC 
forecasts as key performance measures for the business.
The ERC forecast to 84 months or 120 months from date of 
purchase divided by the purchase price is the gross money 
multiple (GMM) that we expect to achieve from that investment. 
The GMM is an important measure to understand the gross 
cash return on our investment. The GMM, therefore, is a 
measure of portfolio asset quality and is one of the metrics 
we evaluate when we appraise a portfolio. In 2017 , we purchased 
portfolios and loan notes for £223.9 million, which with an 
84-month GMM of 1.6 times added £352.0 million to ERC and 
a 120-month GMM of 1.8 times added £390.2 million to ERC. 
We are required to calculate the effective interest rate (EIR). 
This is the discount rate which would allow the estimated 
future cash flows to be discounted to the day one purchase 
price of the portfolio. This rate is used to calculate the amount 
of revenue we recognise each period. The EIR is fixed shortly 
after the point of purchase. The EIR is used to allocate the 
collections received between a repayment of our original 
purchase price; this is accounted for as a reduction in the 
loan balance (amortisation) and the balance of the collection 
as interest income (which is accounted for as revenue from 
purchased loan portfolios). This is akin to the way in which a 
mortgage would pay down.
The ERC extends beyond 15 years; however, we only include 
84 months of cash flow in assessing our purchased loan 
portfolio and loan note assets. As we progress through 
the months of each year, we roll forward the ERC forecast, 
meaning we always have 84 months of expected cash 
flow from our portfolios recognised on the statement 
of financial position.
Due to the nature of our business, actual collections on 
portfolios and loan notes will not perform exactly as initially 
forecast and, each half year, we review performance against 
collections experience and update the ERC forecast where 
appropriate. This updated cash flow forecast, discounted at 
the fixed discount rate (EIR) is the period-end carrying value 
of the purchased-loan portfolios. This movement of the 
purchased-loan portfolios is reflected in income from loan 
portfolios in the income statement. The size of the portfolio 
asset, associated ERC and cash collections in the year are 
therefore all key drivers to the result we report.
As we collect on our portfolios, the statement of financial 
position value, ERC and income we receive decreases over 
time. Based upon our target returns that we expect to invest 
at, we are able to calculate a replacement rate, or maintenance 
capex, being the amount we need to invest to replace the 
reducing portfolios and to keep the Group’s total portfolio 
value constant. During a period, if we invest higher than the 
replacement rate at target returns, the revenue from debt 
purchase grows. The replacement rate is a key driver to the 
cash result the business generates. 
Asset management
As part of our strategy to diversify the business, the Group 
has also strengthened its capabilities in servicing and asset 
management to complement the strength it has in debt 
purchase. Asset management revenue is driven by commissions 
received, largely based on collections, plus fee income. 
Asset management revenue does not require significant 
capital investment and therefore the development of this 
business is important to improving both the IFRS and cash 
result for the business.

2   Collections made in the year are deducted from both the IFRS carrying value of purchased loan portfolios and ERC.
3   Income on purchased loan portfolios is calculated with reference to the EIR of the portfolio. This income is recognised after taking account of new portfolios, collections, 
updated ERC forecasts, disposals and any FX impacts. See 6 for more detail on total revenue.
4   The ERC roll forward and reforecast reflects management’s updated estimation of future collections. It takes account of updated information on specific portfolios and the latest 
exchange rate and rolls forward the 84-month forecast collection period.
5   Under IFRS, the carrying value of purchased loan portfolios includes 84 months of discounted cash flows; however, we expect to see cash flows beyond this period of time and 
report a 120-month ERC also, as is customary for the industry.

6  Total revenue is largely derived from income from purchased loan portfolios (as explained in 3) plus income from asset management being commission on collections for third 
parties and fee income received. The non-cash items add back loan portfolio amortisation to get to core collections. Amortisation reflects a reduction in the statement of 
financial position carrying value of the purchase loan portfolios arising from collections which are not allocated to revenue. Amortisation plus income from purchase loan 
portfolios equates to core collections.
7   Includes non-cash items including depreciation and amortisation, share-based payment charges and FX.
8   Non-cash amortisation of fees and interest.
9  The cash result is viewed on an underlying basis which excludes certain items; see APM table on page 21. These items have been excluded to provide a more comparable basis for 
assessing the Group’s performance between financial periods. Details of the adjusting items are provided in the Group chief financial officer’s review on page 21.
10  The sum of these balances is the adjusted EBITDA for the business of £230.6 million, which is a key driver to the cash result. This measure allows us to monitor the operating 
performance of the Group. See the additional information provided on page 137 for a detailed reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA.
11  Replacement rate is the level of purchased loan portfolio and loan note purchases, at our target portfolio returns, required during 2018 to maintain the 2017 average 84-month ERC. 26

Strategic report
Ireland
The acquisition of Mars Capital completed in December 2017. 
It is a leading UK and Irish credit servicing company and provides 
servicing for residential, buy-to-let and SME commercial mortgages. 
The acquisition strengthens Arrow Global’s asset 
management capabilities and reinforces its leading position in 
the UK, but also provides strategic entry into Ireland, a new 
market for the Group offering significant debt purchasing and 
servicing potential.
In addition, we also announced the establishment of a strategic 
partnership in the UK and Ireland with Oaktree Capital 
Management, L.P. (‘Oaktree’), a leading global asset manager 
with around USD$100 billion under management. The strategic 
partnership with Oaktree provides significant portfolio 
investment and asset management opportunities going 
forward in the UK and Ireland, strengthening Arrow Global’s 
highly visible earnings stream.
Market overview and outlook
Ireland is a large NPL market at €59 billion, and as such offers 
significant deal flow. 
Ireland has a growing economy, falling unemployment and 
recovering house prices, and Irish banks have improved their 
capital positions and have high propensity to sell NPLs. In 
the last five years we have seen around €63 billion of sales to 
Arrow Global’s stable of institutional investor relationships, 
which gives us confidence in the future potential for 
the market.
Market overview 
The UK has one of the most mature debt purchase and 
collection markets in Europe, characterised by a relatively 
high propensity of financial institutions to sell non-performing 
debt. This is driven by a large and well-established consumer 
finance sector that continues to grow due to healthy volumes of 
new lending. 
The UK debt purchasing and servicing landscape remained 
competitive in 2017. To remain successful, Arrow Global 
relies on its deep client relationships, disciplined approach to 
underwriting and data analytics, operational excellence and 
scale. Reputation and track record are both critical 
considerations for financial institutions considering an 
outright sale of a portfolio or the choice of a 
servicing partner. 
Outlook 
We expect to see a continued supply of debt sale volumes 
across unsecured and secured markets, but with strong 
competition for assets in 2018. Unsecured consumer lending 
grew at near double-digit rates in 2017 and the secured retail 
debt sale market has grown significantly in recent years. The 
secured asset class in particular is forecast to remain strong 
and, with the acquisition of Mars Capital, Arrow Global is now 
well placed to benefit from this.
While the competitive environment will remain challenging, 
we have a healthy pipeline entering into 2018 including a 
number of investments already contracted.  30

Key 2017 highlights
• Whitestar won the servicing for the €271 million secured 
loans in the Évora securitisation, the first public 
securitisation of NPLs in Portugal
• Maintained our market-leading asset management 
position having acquired six additional NPL 
portfolios with a face value of €612 million
•  €63.1 million of purchased loan portfolios and 
loan notes acquired
• Strong collections throughout the year aided 
by improving economy
Market overview 
The European Banking Authority estimates that as at Q2 2017, NPLs in 
Portugal totalled €35 billion, from around €41 billion the previous year. 
This does not account for other non-performing assets (NPAs) inside banks’ 
balance sheets and others sitting in real estate funds, nor for 
restructured loans.
The Portuguese banking sector has stabilised in 2017, mainly because of the 
extension of the maturity of loans granted to the Resolution Fund, capital 
increases by some of the main banks and completion of the sale of Novo 
Banco. However, the banking system remains threatened by low profitability 
and weak asset quality (NPL ratio of 17.5% according to the EBA estimate), 
particularly concentrated in the corporate sector.
The central bank expects economic activity in Portugal to continue to 
expand, at a pace close to that projected for the Euro area. Gross domestic 
product (GDP) is estimated to grow by 2.6% in 2017, 2.3% in 2018 and 
1.9% in 2019. 
Outlook 
In line with other European markets, the Bank of Portugal is maintaining 
pressure on banks to reduce the volume of NPLs and non-core assets, as 
agreed with the Single Supervisory Mechanism, especially given the need to 
access international financial markets to meet regulatory requirements. 
However, in 2017, NPL sales were somewhat slower than the prior year. 
2018 should bring more debt portfolio sales as the banks continue the 
deleveraging process.  31

for a non-Dutch bank 
• Centralisation of Dutch offices to Amersfoort 
will finalise in Q2 2018
Market overview 
While non-performing and performing loans sales historically have been 
less common in Benelux than in other geographies, this is increasing, and 
the Group is well placed to acquire these due to our long-standing 
banking relationships and the Vesting platform. 
In 2016, sales of non-performing loans in The Netherlands reached 
€9.5 billion mainly from Commercial Real Estate and secured retail 
portfolios. As at Q3 2017, sales were less at €3.2 billion, and while 
secured retail sales again feature, we also saw the emergence of 
Corporate and Small and Medium Size Enterprise (SME) loans being sold. 
Financial services dominate non-performing loans, but telecoms, utilities 
and consumer loans are also being sold in the Dutch market. 
The financial services industry and utilities dominates the Belgian debt 
sale market. However, with other industries, such as telecoms and health 
services becoming interested in this opportunity, we expect an increase 
of debt sale projects. 
Outlook 
As with most European markets, the pressure on structural reform from 
both government and regulators is increasing and Dutch banks will need 
to deleverage. 
We expect compliance requirements for those who participate in the 
market to increase. In the UK, we have seen panel sizes reduce as a result 
of this. This provides an opportunity for well run and highly compliant 
businesses such as Arrow Global to take advantage of this as the NPL 
market continues to accelerate from its current take-off phase.

Key 2017 highlights 
• Significant growth year -on-year in AUM, up €10.7 billion 
to €25.6 billion for the year ending 2017
• Positive annual review with Standard & Poor’s that 
resulted in an upgrade to Zenith´ s Master Servicing

• Enhanced operational capabilities in order to 
accompany strong in-year growth

       M a r k e t o v e r v i e w 
Italy is Europe’s largest NPL market and its extended asset tails provide 
significant long-term opportunities. In 2017, the Italian banking sector 
was very dynamic and characterised by the efforts of many banks to 
actively address the NPL issues. Such issues were represented by high 
volumes of non performing exposures (NPE) still sitting on the banks’ 
balance sheets and the difficulty to find the right measures to properly 
manage the NPE life-cycle in line with the guidelines of the regulator.
Outlook 
Although the market was active in 2017, the banks still retain a large 
volume of NPLs that need to be resolved, €300 billion as of 30 June 2017 
vs. €324 billion as of the end of 2016. Many Italian banks are still addressing 
the ECB guidelines; however, pro-forma figures as of 31 December 2017 are 
equal to €250 billion (including the NPL disposal of Unicredit (€17.7 billion 
- Project Fino) and Banca Popolare di Vicenza/Veneto Banca (€16.8 billion), 
which were not deconsolidated in the 30 June 2017 figures).
To remain successful, Zenith relies on its deep client relationships, 
tailor -made service and strong market positioning. Reputation and track 
record are both critical considerations for financial institutions and 
investment funds when choosing a servicing partner.     Read more online

We thrive on positivity , ﬂ exibility and challenge. 
We share ideas and have courage to lead – we are 
not afraid to do things diﬀ erently. We use our 
insight to lead change and innovation.
LIVING OUR VALUES
James and Leanne are 
having a baby
James and Leanne are expecting 
their first baby. He works full time 
and Leanne works part time. They 
have an outstanding debt that 
Capquest is collecting and which 
they have been making monthly 
repayments towards. 
A missed payment is often an indicator 
of changed circumstances. Our 
team contacted James who revealed 
that in anticipation of the baby’s 
arrival, they have started to discuss 
what money they would need to put 
aside for baby essentials. We also 
learned that the couple had moved 
into bigger rented accommodation. 
Life changes such as this are not 
uncommon, and so understanding 
how it impacts on longer -term 
finances is important. Our agent 
took time to discuss in detail the 
new monthly income and expenditure 
that would apply and identified 
there were now no longer other 
outstanding creditors. While some 
of their priority bills had increased 
slightly, and they needed to 
consider additional outgoings 
related to the baby, they still had an 
increase in disposable income.
James was keen to get things back 
on track, cover the missed payment 
and establish a new regular direct debit. 
Given the improved circumstances, 
the benefit of increasing the monthly 
repayment and reducing the balance 
more quickly was considered. James 
agreed, and a higher monthly 
repayment was set, meaning the 
balance will now be repaid within 
14 months.
This a is an interesting example 
of how everyday developments 
can change our customers’ 
circumstances. Our agents
handle hundreds of similar 
calls every day and in them, 
supporting our customers to build 
better financial futures is our 
priority. Taking time to understand 
their position can help us assist 
them in achieving the best 
outcome for them giving them 
control and comfort on what they 
can afford to repay.  34

SUPPORTING OUR
COMMUNITIES
“ The Arrow Global Community 
Champions help support our 
local communities and provide 
social and sporting opportunities 
to our colleagues.”
Supporting debt charities 
We support the activities of a number of debt charities. 
We have a place on the Citizens Advice Advisory Group and are 
responsible for developing its new Debt Management Service, 
with end-to-end free advice and debt management plans. 
We make significant FairShare contributions to both 
StepChange and Payplan.
Helping our local communities 
We had a very successful 2017. The Arrow Global Community 
Champions help support our local communities and provide 
social and sporting opportunities to our colleagues. One of 
the key aims this year was to provide increased awareness 
and charity donation initiatives across all of our UK sites. 
This included International Women’s Day, Stress Awareness 
Month, Mental Health Awareness Week, National Walking 
Month with free pedometers, Jeans for Genes Day and 
Breast Awareness Month with pink ribbons. 
Some of the main charity donations are summarised below:
• Arrow Global donated £15,000 to the We Love 
Manchester Emergency Fund;
• Arrow Global colleagues collected £2,555 for 
Children in Need; and
• Arrow Global colleagues collected £1,008 for 
Macmillan Coffee Morning.
In Glasgow, we supported our chosen charity, Brightest Star, 
through dress down days and summer events. In doing so 
we raised £3,060. We also hosted a DKMS donor event and 
registered 43 employees on the stem cell donor database and, 
in Farnborough, we have raised £5,435 supporting national 
charities like Save the Children, Children in Need 
and Macmillan. 
We also support colleagues’ contributions to the community 
by matching funds raised by them for our chosen charities 
and we encourage our staff to volunteer and assist local 
community organisations, both in and out of Company time.
Financial education
According to Money Advice Service research, just four in 
ten young people in the UK say they have received financial 
education designed to teach children how to handle their 
finances confidently. This is despite 90% who had received 
financial education lessons saying they found them 
very useful.
OUR PEOPLE 35
www.arrowglobalir.net
Strategic report
We continue to see this gap in education manifest itself 
through the challenges our customers face on a daily basis, 
and so, our role in financial capability education is critical to 
help address this imbalance for future generations.
Arrow Global has established a strong partnership with the 
Young Enterprise charity which stretches back to 2014. Initially, 
we sponsored a local Manchester secondary school, Oakwood 
Academy, supporting it in attaining national accreditation as 
a ‘Centre of Excellence’ for the provision of financial education 
to its students. In 2016, we expanded our reach to more 
young people in our local Manchester community through 
the delivery of financial education. This was achieved through 
the ‘Money Matters’ workshop, designed to educate and 
inspire young people to take ownership of their finances.
This year, we have built upon the successes of the provision 
of financial education in local schools in the Manchester area 
by supporting young people in the local communities in our 
Farnborough and Glasgow office locations as well. There are 
workshops taking place in Farnborough, Glasgow and Manchester 
so that by February 2018, over 80 colleagues will have been 
involved in delivering financial education workshops. Arrow 
Global colleagues delivering financial capability workshops 
are a very rewarding experience for pupils, teachers and 
Arrow Global volunteers alike.
In Benelux, Vesting Finance is a sponsor of Stichting LEF, a 
foundation that strives to reduce debt problems in society 
by increasing financial awareness amongst young people. 
Similar to the ‘Money Matters’ workshop in the UK, LEF has 
developed a ‘Money Management’ programme for young 
people and invites volunteers to teach skills in local schools. 
Vesting Finance also participates in the Finance Run, an 
annual running event where colleagues run 5 or 10 kilometres 
to raise money for Stichting LEF. 
In Portugal, Whitestar sponsors a Mozambican school, 
Ilocone, providing financial support to ensure the effective 
delivery of education programmes to children aged between 
three and six years old. The company also started a market 
analysis in order to implement a financial literacy programme 
for children starting in 2018. In addition, Whitestar sponsored 
various initiatives for people with special needs.
Volunteering and mentoring with City Year
City Year seeks to address the important issues of academic 
underachievement of children from deprived backgrounds 
and the risk of ‘no experience, no job’ for young people 
entering the employment market.
Arrow Global began its relationship with City Year in 2015 
as a founding partner to the City Year’s launch in the Greater 
Manchester area, and are a member of the charity’s Manchester 
Advisory Council. The relationship has gone from strength 
to strength, and 2017 was a fantastic year with all areas of our 
participation with the charity growing. We now have 11 
volunteers involved in the Bridge Building programme, 
whereby one volunteer from Arrow Global mentors a City 
Year volunteer for six months. We also designed and 
delivered a Money Management workshop which focused on 
educating the City Year volunteers about personal financial 
management. This was exceptionally well received and is 
paving the way for further workshops being developed. 
As with previous years, we shall continue our role in playing 
host to the Interview Skills Day. On Friday 19th May 2017, 
Arrow Global colleagues hosted an Interview Skills Day for 
City Year volunteer mentors at the Arrow Global offices.

INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT
Regulatory and industry engagement 
During the year, Arrow Global has actively contributed to 
a wide range of initiatives across the collections and debt 
advice sectors.
In 2017, we held a number of important industry positions:
• After an extended three-year presidency of the Credit 
Services Association (CSA) we retained a board seat for 
Public and European Affairs, promoting better relationships 
with the FCA and government, the debt advice sector and 
other stakeholders, to ensure they are made aware of the 
processes and high standards of Arrow Global and the rest 
of the membership of the CSA.
• First Chair, then a continuing member of the Steering 
Committee on Reciprocity (SCOR), which governs the 
rules for credit data sharing in the UK, bringing about 
important new rules and safeguards for the use of credit 
data by debt buyers.
• The vice presidency of the Federation of European National 
Collection Associations (FENCA). Consistent FENCA 
lobbying resulted in significant changes to the final 
wording of the forthcoming EU General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR), and we now hold the FENCA portfolio 
of developing Codes of Conduct for GDPR as it relates to 
collections, and then for pan-European collections as a 
whole. The Code for GDPR is currently in development, 
and will be in place by May 2018 when GDPR comes into 
force. This Code will help provide a level playing field for 
the European consumer and clarity on the GDPR regulation 
for our industry, and may forestall further regulation from 
Brussels which could adversely affect Arrow Global and 
our customers.
• Through FENCA, we have also contributed to consultations 
on the NPL secondary market, and attended meetings 
with high-ranking officials across DG Just and DG FISMA.
• We hold a board position on the influential and newly 
incorporated Money Advice Liaison Group, and a trusteeship 
of the FairLife Charity , promoting fair treatment of the consumer 
across financial services.
• In 2016, we represented the credit industry on a subcommittee 
of the MOJ Civil Procedure Rule Committee responsible 
for drafting the pre-action protocol for debt claims 
(known as PAP). This engagement resulted in significant 
improvements to the final outcome, including usage of the 
standard financial statement, and the dropping of the 
requirement to send an original agreement to every 
customer before legal action is commenced. The PAP 
came into effect in October 2017, and has been well 
adopted by the sector.
SUSTAINABILITY
We actively contribute to a wide range of initiatives across the collections and 
debt advice sectors, to help Build Better Financial Futures for our customers
“ Helping a customer who is 
struggling with their debt makes 
all the hard work worthwhile.”  37
www.arrowglobalir.net
Strategic report
• In addition to our various CSR initiatives at Group and 
country level, specialising in financial education and data 
philanthropy, we have supported a number of debt 
charities during the year, including assisting Citizens 
Advice to implement its Debt Management Service trial. 
We were also delighted to help Christians Against Poverty 
(CAP) toward its successful matched funding target, and 
made FairShare contributions to CAP, StepChange 
and Payplan.
We have continued to actively engage at numerous trade 
body events and conferences during 2017, and we chaired and 
presented regularly at non-performing loan and industry 
events and conferences throughout the year. We have a 
constructive and open relationship with the FCA, and have 
contributed to recent projects on due diligence for debt 
purchase, common misconceptions in CONC, CCA retained 
provisions and remediation, and the ongoing authorisation 
of fee-charging debt management firms. We also contributed 
to the Money Advice Service Debt Advice Operational Group, 
considering the future funding of debt advice, resulting in 
Peter Wyman’s recent report, and contributing a well-regarded 
case study indicating the benefits of free financial advice to 
our customers. 
We remain fully committed to raising standards, promoting 
fairer practices in the collection of debt by government and 
other sectors we are active in, lobbying for a really effective 
successor to The Money Advice Service, and supporting 
better financial futures for children and those adults who, as 
shown by our Debt Britain report, are so often in need of our 
help and support.
Following on from the success of our Debt Britain report in 
2016, later in the year we will be publishing new findings based 
on the latest OBR figures and our own customer research.
Supporting human rights
All the Group’s current activities are carried out in developed 
countries that have strong legislation governing human 
rights, and Arrow Global complies with applicable legislation 
in every country where it operates.
Sustainability – caring for the environment
Due to the nature of its business activities, the Group’s 
environmental impact is considered minimal. An 
environmental policy is in place to increase employee 
awareness of environmental issues and complies with 
all relevant regulatory requirements.
With the acquisitions made in the last two years, the Group 
now has a truly European structure. This has inevitably seen an 
increase in international travel, but to reduce the impact of 
this and other travel on our carbon footprint, we actively 
encourage colleagues to increase the use of video and 
telephone conferencing facilities.
In the UK, we offer colleagues a cycle to work scheme and, 
at appropriate sites, we have car shares and group transport 
schemes in place.
Key areas of the policy addressing the business’ 
environmental impact are as follows:
• minimising paper usage and the purchase of recycled 
paper and packaging where possible;
• energy efficient office products;
• recycling office waste; 
• increased use of video and conference calls and Skype 
for business facilities; and
• only booking travel for essential business reasons.

84 2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified 
by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.  We summarise below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2016), in 
decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address 
those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures.  These matters were addressed, 
and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Carrying value of purchased 
loan portfolios and loan

Refer to page 54 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 100 
(accounting policy) and page 
109 (financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation:
The Group’s estimate of the future 
cash collections from the loan 
portfolios and the loan notes is the 
key variable in determining the 
Effective Interest Rate (‘EIR’) of loan 
portfolios, any subsequent revenue 
adjustments and the fair value of 
loan notes. Given the nature of the 
Group’s debt portfolios and loan 
notes, the estimation of the future 
cash collections requires significant 
judgement. 
The Group uses cash flow 
forecasting models to calculate an 
initial estimate of future collections. 
The assumptions used in the 
models include the value, probability 
and timing of expected future cash 
flows for each type of asset class 
within a portfolio or at a portfolio 
level. These estimates are subject 
to ongoing review by the Group to 
assess reasonableness, comparing 
actual performance against previous 
forecasts. 
Estimates of future cash flows are 
impacted by the Group’s approach 
to managing the portfolios (e.g. 
changes in collection policies or use 
of specialist collectors). Where the
Directors believe changes in the 
approach to managing the portfolios 
may lead to changes in these 
estimates, these are factored into 
the Group’s future cash collection 
forecasts.
Due to the level of subjectivity 
inherent in the assumptions used in 
the cash flow forecasting models 
this is a key judgement area for our 
audit.
Our procedures included:
— Control observation: We assessed the design and 
operating effectiveness of controls over data used in the 
cash flow forecasting models, including monitoring of 
debt servicer collections, reconciliations of cash 
collections per the system to supporting documentation, 
and general IT controls over the collection systems 
driving the estimated future cash flows; 
— Control design: We assessed the design and 
implementation of approval controls such as the portfolio 
review committee that covers the outputs of the models, 
and manual adjustments, to obtain evidence that these 
have been authorised by appropriate personnel; 
— Our sector experience: We assessed the modelled cash 
flows by portfolio to identify those portfolios where more 
judgement has been exercised (for example due to 
changes in approach by the Directors to managing the 
portfolios) and/or we consider greater risk existed (for 
example due to under/over-performance against historic 
forecasts). We also inspected the code used in the 
primary statistical cash flow model to consider, in 
conjunction with our testing on the forecast cash flows, 
whether there is risk of model error. Taking into account 
these risk factors, on a sample basis we critically 
assessed the cash flow forecasts and any manual 
adjustments made by the Group with reference to actual 
historic collections performance and our understanding 
of the Group and industry through benchmarked 
performance and methodology analysis; and
— Historical comparisons: On a sample basis, we critically 
assessed the assumptions in the cash flow forecasts 
including the impact of the use of collection strategies 
(such as litigation) and any manual adjustments made by 
the Group with reference to our understanding of the 
current and past performance of the Group’s portfolios, 
including recent cash collections.
Our results
— We found the resulting carrying value of purchased loan 
portfolios and loan notes to be acceptable (2016: 
acceptable).
Fair value of net assets 
acquired as part of business

(£7.8 million) 
Refer to page 54 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 97 
(accounting policy) and page 
131 (financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation:
During the year ended 31 December 
2017, the Group acquired Zenith 
Services S.p.A and its subsidiary in 
Italy and five Mars Capital entities in 
the UK and Ireland, with the assets 
and liabilities purchased being 
accounted for at fair value at the 
date of acquisition.
Our procedures included:
— Our sector experience:  We challenged the 
completeness of the acquired net assets and associated 
assumptions with reference to our business 
understanding of the acquired entities and testing of the 
Directors’ assessments. We challenged the 
assumptions, including value, probability and timing of 
cash flows, made in calculating the fair value assigned to 
the acquired intangibles with reference to the business 
plan, existing customer contracts and actual performance 
achieved.

Key audit matter The risk Our response
Fair value of net assets  
acquired as part of business 
combinations (cont.)
Forecast-based valuation (cont.):
The Group prepared the acquisition 
balance sheets based on estimates of 
the fair value of assets and liabilities 
acquired. In particular, the Group
prepared discounted cash flow models 
to arrive at its estimates of the acquired 
intangible assets including customer 
relationships. This required it to exercise 
judgement in determining the expected 
cash flows from the assets and the 
discount rates to be applied.
Our procedures included (cont.):
— Benchmarking assumptions: We assessed 
whether the discount rate used in 
calculating the fair value of the customer 
relationship intangible reflected market 
conditions based on our knowledge of the 
industry and country of acquisition.
— Sensitivity analysis: We performed 
sensitivity analysis on the Group’s key 
assumptions, being the forecast cash flows 
and discount rate applied to help us assess 
their reasonableness and identify areas of 
potential additional focus;
— Assessing transparency: We assessed the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures about 
the degree of estimation involved in arriving 
at the fair value.
Our results
— We found the fair value of the acquired net 
assets to be acceptable. 
Recoverability of parent 
company’s investment in 
subsidiaries and intra-group 
debtor balance due from Group 
entities
(£395.9 million; 2016: £388.3m)
Refer to page 97 (accounting 
policy) and page 116 (financial 
disclosures).
Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the parent 
company’s investments in subsidiaries 
and intra-group debtor balance due from 
group entities represents 100% (2016: 
100%) of the company’s total assets.  
Their recoverability is not at high risk of 
significant misstatement or subject to 
significant judgement.  However, due to 
their materiality in the context of the 
parent company financial statements, 
this is considered to be the area that had 
the greatest effect on our overall parent 
company audit.
Our procedures included: 
— Tests of detail: We compared the carrying 
amount of the investments, representing 
100% (2016: 100%) of the total investment 
balance; with the relevant subsidiaries’ draft 
balance sheets to identify whether their net 
assets, being an approximation of their 
minimum recoverable amount, were in 
excess of their carrying amount and 
assessing whether those subsidiaries have 
historically been profit-making.
— Tests of detail: We assessed 100% of 
group debtors to identify, with reference to 
the relevant debtors’ draft balance sheets, 
whether they have a positive net asset value 
and therefore coverage of the debt owed, as 
well as assessing whether those debtor 
companies have historically been profit-
making.
— Assessing subsidiary audits: We assessed 
the work we performed on those 
subsidiaries and their profits and net assets 
and considered the results of that work.  
— Our sector experience: For the 
investments where the carrying amount 
exceeded the net asset value, we compared 
the carrying amount of the investment with 
the expected value of the business based 
on the expected cash flows of the 
underlying subsidiaries.
Our results :
— We found the Group’s assessment of the 
recoverability of the parent company’s
investment in subsidiaries and intra-group 
debtor balance to be acceptable (2016: 
acceptable).

3. Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a 
whole was set at £2.8 million (2016: £1.9 million), 
determined with reference to a benchmark of Group 
profit before taxation normalised to exclude £27.3 
million expense in relation to the Group’s bond 
refinance and £14.7 million gain on disposal of 
associate set out on pages 104 and 116 respectively, 
in order to reduce volatility in the benchmark. The 
group team performed procedures on the items 
excluded from normalised group profit before tax. 
The materiality represents 4.4% (2016:3.5%) of the 
Group’s reported profit before taxation as normalised.
Materiality for the parent company financial 
statements as a whole was set at £1.4m (2016: 
£1m), determined with reference to a benchmark of 
company total assets, of which it represents 0.4% 
(2016: 0.3%). 
We report to the audit committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 
£140,000 (2016: £95,000), in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
How we scoped our audit:
Audits for group reporting purposes were performed on 
all six (2016: four) reporting components, which were:
— Group holding company;
— UK operating and non-operating subsidiaries;
— The Portuguese operating and non-operating 
subsidiaries;
— The Benelux operating and non-operating 
subsidiaries which include entities in Netherlands 
and Belgium;
— The Italian operating and non-operating entities 
which include Zenith Services S.p.A; and
— The Mars Capital operating and non-operating 
entities in the UK and Ireland. 
The components scoped in for Group reporting purposes 
accounted for 100% of Group revenue, 100% of Group 
profit before tax and 100% of Group total assets (2016: 
100%).
The audit of the Portuguese, Benelux and Italian 
components was performed by component audit 
teams in Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy. The 
audit of the Group holding company, UK operating and 
non-operating subsidiaries, the acquired Mars Capital 
subsidiaries and consolidation was performed by the 
Group audit team.
The Group audit team instructed the component auditors as to 
the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks 
detailed above and the information to be reported back. The 
Group audit team approved the component materiality range of 
between £1.4 million and £2.2 million (2016: £1.0 million), 
having regard to the size and risk profile of the components.
The Group audit team managed and co-ordinated the 
component auditors in the following ways:
During the audit the Group audit team held regular telephone 
calls and face-to-face discussions with the component audit 
teams to challenge audit risks and audit strategy. Through the 
calls and meetings, the findings and observations reported to 
the Group audit team were discussed in more detail and any 
further work required by the Group audit team was then 
performed by the component auditors.
In addition, the Group audit team participated in the audit close 
out meetings of the component teams to ensure all material 
issues affecting the Group were identified and communicated 
back to Arrow Global Group Plc. We challenged and reviewed 
audit approaches to revenue and cash collections. 
87 4. We have nothing to report on going concern   
We are required to report to you if:
— we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to the directors’ statement in note 3 to the 
financial statements on the use of the going concern 
basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt over the Group and 
Company’s use of that basis for a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements; or  
— if the related statement under the Listing Rules set out 
on page 79 is materially inconsistent with our audit 
knowledge.  
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5. We have nothing to report on the other information 
in the Annual Report 
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements.  Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated 
below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether, based on our financial 
statements audit work, the information therein is materially 
misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our audit knowledge.  Based solely on that work we have 
not identified material misstatements in the other 
information.
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information:  
— we have not identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report and the directors’ report;  
— in our opinion the information given in those reports 
for the financial year is consistent with the financial 
statements; and  
— in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
Directors’ remuneration report  
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability  
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or 
draw attention to in relation to:  
— the directors’ confirmation in the statement of 
viability on page 43 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;
— the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks 
and explaining how they are being managed and 
mitigated; and  
— the directors’ explanation in the statement of viability 
of how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why 
they considered that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the 
statement of viability. We have nothing to report in this 
respect.  
Corporate governance disclosures  
We are required to report to you if:    
— we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit and the directors’ statement that 
they consider that the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or  
— the section of the annual report describing the work 
of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee; or  
We are required to report to you if the Corporate 
Governance Statement  does not properly disclose a 
departure from the eleven provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing 
Rules for our review.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
88 Based solely on our work on the other information 
described above:  
— in our opinion, the Corporate Governance Statement 
has been prepared in accordance with relevant rules  of 
the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority. 
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on 
which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:  
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or  
— the parent Company financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or  
— certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or  
— we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.  
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7. Respective responsibilities  
Directors’ responsibilities  
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 
83, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the 
financial statements including being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and 
parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.  
Auditor’s responsibilities  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other 
irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion 
in an auditor’s report.  Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can 
arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial 
statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
Irregularities – ability to detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could 
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the 
financial statements from our sector experience, through 
discussion with the directors and other management (as 
required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the 
Group’s regulatory correspondence.
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly 
affect the financial statements including financial reporting 
(including related company legislation) and taxation 
legislation.  We considered the extent of compliance with 
those laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the 
related financial statements items. 
In addition we considered the impact of laws and 
regulations and certain aspects of company legislation 
recognising the financial and regulated nature of the 
Group’s activities.  With the exception of any known or 
possible non-compliance, and as required by auditing 
standards, our work in respect of these was limited to 
enquiry of the directors and other management and 
inspection of regulatory correspondence. We considered 
the effect of any known or possible non-compliance in 
these areas as part of our procedures on the related 
financial statements items.  
We communicated identified laws and regulations 
throughout our team and remained alert to any indications 
of non-compliance throughout the audit. 
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-
detection of non-compliance with relevant laws and 
regulations, as these may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override 
of internal controls. 
The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

CONSOLIDATED & PARENT COMPANY STATEMENT 
OF CASH FLOWS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 94
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1. General information
Arrow Global Group PLC is a company incorporated in England and 
Wales and is the ultimate parent company of the Group. The 
address of the registered office is presented on the inside back 
cover. The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling 
and rounded to the nearest thousand.
The Company’s subsidiaries, both direct and indirect, at this date 
are listed in note 24.
The Group’s principal activity is to identify, acquire and manage 
secured and unsecured defaulted loan portfolios from financial 
institutions, such as banks and credit card companies, as well as 
retail chains, student loans, motor credit, telecommunication firms 
and utility companies.
The Group’s and the Company’s financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted for use in the EU, and therefore comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IFRS Regulation. The accounting policies have 
been applied consistently in the current and prior periods.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate 
income statement and related notes of the Company have not 
been presented in this annual report and accounts.
2. Accounting standards
New standards
The following new standards and interpretations are mandatory for 
the year beginning 1 January 2017:
• Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 7);
• Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 
(Amendments to IAS 12); and
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle – various 
standards (Amendments to IFRS 12).
During 2017, these new standards and interpretations had an 
insignificant effect on the consolidated financial statements of 
the Group, apart from including changes in liabilities arising from 
financing activities, including both cash and non-cash changes, 
as a result of amendments to IAS 7.
Standards issued but not yet effective
A number of new standards are effective for annual periods 
beginning after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted; 
however, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended 
standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
The following standards are expected to have a significant 
impact on the Group’s financial statements in the period of 
initial application:
a. Estimated impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15
The Group is required to adopt IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers from 1 January 2018. The Group 
has assessed the estimated impact that the initial application of IFRS 9 
(see b.) and IFRS 15 (see c.) will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
b. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 is effective from 1 January 2018 and the Group has adopted 
it from that date. As a result, there is no impact arising from this 
standard on the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The standard is the new standard for recognising and measuring 
financial assets and liabilities. It replaces the existing standard IAS 
39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, and 
covers three main areas:
• classification and measurement;
• impairment; and
• hedging.
The Group is not obliged to restate comparatives on the initial 
adoption of IFRS 9. Differences in the carrying amounts of financial 
assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 
will generally be recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at 
1 January 2018. This assessment is preliminary because not all 
transition work has been finalised, therefore the actual impact 
may change because:
• assumptions and judgements are subject to change until 
finalisation of the financial statements for the year ending 
31 December 2018;
• the Group is still refining its models and methodology for 
expected credit loss calculation (‘ECL’) calculation; and
• the governance and implementation of internal controls 
required for implementation are in the process of refinement 
and finalisation.
The following is a summary of some of the more significant items 
that are likely to be important in understanding the impact of the 
implementation of IFRS 9 on the Group:
i. Classification and measurement
The Standard introduces new requirements to determine the 
measurement basis of financial assets and liabilities.
IFRS 9 includes three principal classification categories for financial 
assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income and fair value through the profit or loss. 
It eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, 
loans and receivables and available for sale.
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both 
of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair value 
through profit or loss:
• it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold 
assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
• its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.

2. Accounting standards continued
Standards issued but not yet effective continued
b. IFRS 9 Financial instruments continued
i. Classification and measurement continued
A financial asset is measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income only if it meets both of the following 
conditions and is not designated as at fair value through profit 
or loss:
• it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved 
by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial 
assets; and
• its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or 
fair value through other comprehensive income as described 
above are measured at fair value through the profit or loss. A 
financial asset is classified into one of these categories on initial 
recognition. The Group’s business model(s) are required to be 
assessed based on the way the business is managed and 
information is provided to management. 
IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS 39 for the 
classification of financial liabilities. 
For the Group, the impact of this standard is largely in relation to 
purchased loan portfolios and loan notes, involving the cash flow 
characteristics of assets and the business models under which they 
are managed. Accordingly, the basis of measurement for the Group’s 
portfolios and loan notes may change. It is not expected that there 
will be a transition effect on cash and cash equivalents or trade and 
other receivables and other current and non-current receivables. 
The Group has considered the business model objective for each 
category of financial assets, for the Group this is largely the Group’s 
portfolios and loan notes, requiring a designation, by portfolio. For 
the vast majority of assets, the objective is to hold the asset to 
collect the contractual cash flows. The Group has also made an 
assessment of the cash flow characteristics of its financial assets 
to conclude if these are solely payment of principal and interest, in 
order to assess whether the assets can be recognised at amortised 
cost or fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9. 
As a result of these assessments it has been concluded there will 
not be a material change to the classification and measurement of 
the Group’s financial assets, and the vast majority will continue to 
be accounted for as at amortised cost. There will be a small number 
of purchased loan portfolios and loan notes with an estimated 
carrying value of approximately £60 million that may be reclassified 
to being accounted for as at fair value through profit or loss as a 
result of the Group’s assessment of the cash flow characteristics.
ii. Impairment
IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss impairment model of IAS 39 with a 
forward-looking expected credit loss (‘ECL’) model. This has the 
effect of recognising impairment of purchased loan portfolio and 
loan notes earlier than at present. The estimation of ECL’s requires 
considerable judgement since they should include an assessment 
of forward-looking economic assumptions which are determined 
on a probability-weighted basis based on reasonable and supportable 
forecasts. The Group will leverage off its existing cash flow models 
to inform these ECLs.
The key concepts for IFRS 9 in relation to impairment provisioning 
include the following categories:
• no significant increase in credit risk since origination (‘Performing’); or
• a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since origination 
(‘Underperforming’); or
• credit impaired such that losses are incurred (‘Credit impaired’); or
• the asset is considered purchased or originated credit impaired 
on initial recognition (‘POCI’). 
Due to the characteristics of the Group’s purchased loan portfolios 
they will all be classified as POCI as the assets are considered 
purchased originated credit impaired. ECL is not recognised on 
initial recognition. Instead, lifetime ECL is incorporated into the 
calculation of effective interest rate. Any changes in lifetime ECL 
after initial recognition are recognised in profit or loss. ECL 
calculation for POCI assets is always based on an ECL over the 
expected life of the asset.
IFRS 9 requires an unbiased and probability weighted estimate of 
credit losses by evaluation of a range of possible outcomes that 
incorporates forecasts of future economic conditions. Measurement 
of ECLs at each reporting period should reflect reasonable and 
supportable information at the reporting date about past events, 
current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. 
In determining ECLs, the Group has considered three economic 
scenarios, including assumptions on unemployment, GDP and 
CPI, and weighted these according to their likely occurrence. 
The scenarios include a central scenario, based on the current 
economic environment, an upside scenario and a downside 
scenario. The estimation and application of this forward-looking 
information will require significant judgement and be subject to 
appropriate internal governance and scrutiny.
Based on 31 December 2017 data and current implementation status, 
we estimate that the adoption of IFRS 9 will lead to a reduction in 
shareholders’ equity of approximately £17 million before tax (£14 million 
after tax) relating to a reduction in expected cash flows on the purchased 
loan portfolios and loan notes, as a result of the application of the 
probability weighted, economic scenarios being incorporated in 
the lifetime ECL. This results in a reduction of this amount in 
purchased loan portfolios shown in the statement of financial 
position and an increase in deferred tax assets of £3 million. This 
impact is driven by the impairment requirements of IFRS 9. We 
continue to refine and monitor certain aspects of our impairment 
process which may change the actual impact on adoption.
iii. Hedge Accounting
IFRS 9 also incorporates new hedge accounting rules that intend to 
align hedge accounting with risk management practices. IFRS 9 
includes an accounting policy choice to defer the adoption of IFRS 
9 hedge accounting and to continue with IAS 39 hedge accounting. 
The Group has decided to exercise this accounting policy choice. 96

2. Accounting standards continued
Standards issued but not yet effective continued
c. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 is effective from 1 January 2018 and the Group has adopted 
it from that date. As a result, there is no impact arising from this 
standard on the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining 
whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces 
existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, 
IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer 
Loyalty Programmes.
The standard introduces a five-step approach to recognising revenue:
1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract(s)
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate transaction price to performance obligations
5.  Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies each 
performance obligation
The Group’s asset management revenue is within the scope of IFRS 
15. The Group recognises asset management revenue on portfolios 
managed for third parties. The key contract obligations include 
debt collection servicing and master servicing. The nature of the 
compensation for debt collection services and subsequent revenue 
recognised is contingency collection fees, which are received 
either as a fixed fee, or as a percentage of collections or a 
percentage of the outstanding portfolio asset value. The nature of 
the compensation for master servicing is an agreed upon fee for 
the provision of various services that are available on demand.
The Group has considered the revenue recognition policies in the 
context of the requirements of IFRS 15. As a result of the assessment, 
it has been concluded there will not be a material change resulting 
from the implementation of IFRS 15. The following is a summary of 
some of the more significant considerations that are important in 
understanding the impact of the implementation of IFRS 15 on the Group:
i. Asset management revenue - debt collection servicing
Under IFRS 15, revenue will be recognised over time with the 
relevant measure of progress against performance obligations 
being time, due to these services being on demand for when 
customers require them. Based on the Group’s assessment and 
analysis carried out to date, current revenue recognition policies 
are consistent with this approach. Therefore, the Group does not 
expect the application of IFRS 15 to result in significant differences 
in the revenue recognition for these services.
ii. Asset management revenue - master servicing
Under IFRS 15, revenue will be recognised over time with the relevant 
measure of progress against performance obligations being time, 
due to these services being on demand for when customers require 
them. Based on the Group’s assessment, current revenue recognition 
policies are consistent with this approach. Therefore, the Group 
does not expect the application of IFRS 15 to result in significant 
differences in the revenue recognition for these services.
iii. Transition
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect 
method, with the effect of initially applying this standard 
recognised at the date of initial application (i.e. 1 January 2018). 
As a result, the Group will not apply the requirements of IFRS 15 
to the comparative period presented.
d. Other standards
The following new and revised standards and interpretations have 
been issued but are not yet endorsed or effective for these 
financial statements and have not been early adopted:
• IFRS 16 Leases
• IFRS 2 (amendments) Classification and measurement of 
share-based payment transactions
• IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) Sale or contribution of assets 
between an investor and its associate or joint venture
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated 
financial statements resulting from the new and revised standards 
and interpretations. So far, the Group does not expect any 
signi f ic a n t im p a c t .    
In relation to leases, IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet 
lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a 
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying 
asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make 
lease payments.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2019.
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential 
impact on its consolidated financial statements but has not yet 
completed its detailed assessment.
So far, the most significant impact identified is that the Group will 
recognise new assets and liabilities for its operating leases of 
office buildings.  97

3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS adopted by the European Union and the Group financial 
statements also comply with EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention other than the fair value of derivative 
contracts and certain loan notes and the amortised cost value of 
portfolio assets.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December 2017 and 
comparative period. Control is achieved where the Company is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with its investee entity and has the ability to affect these returns 
through its power over the investee entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year 
are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition 
or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to 
bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the 
Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Also see the accounting policy ‘shares held in an employee 
benefit trust’ (EBT).
Going concern
The directors have undertaken a thorough review of forecast cash 
flow models and scenarios for a period in excess of 12 months from 
the date of approval of these accounts. Following this review, and 
in the light of current cash availability, economic conditions and 
information available about future risks and uncertainties, they 
have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial 
statements on a going concern basis.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions 
for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) (Business Combinations) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of 
deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to 
employee benefit arrangements that are recognised and measured 
in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee 
Benefits) respectively.
IFRS 3 allows a measurement period of up to one year after 
acquisition to reflect any new information obtained about facts 
and circumstances that were made available to the Group at the 
acquisition date.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on a business combination is measured as the 
excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of 
the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity 
over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, 
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the 
business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment on an annual 
basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that it might be impaired e.g. financial performance of the 
respective acquired entity/CGU is significantly below expectations. 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation 
of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. 
Calculation of the value in use requires an estimate of the amount 
and timing of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU, 
which are discounted by an appropriate discount rate to calculate 
a present value of the future cash flows. The discount rate applied 
is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital with an adjustment 
to reflect the specific risk characteristics of the CGU. 
This calculation inherently involves a number of judgments in that 
cash flow forecasts are prepared for periods that are beyond the 
normal requirement of management reporting, and the appropriate 
discount rate relevant to the CGU is an estimate.
Sensitivities have been considered in note 14.
On a business combination. the portfolio investments are remeasured 
to fair value using an appropriate discount rate at the date of acquisition, 
calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the goodwill attributable to that 
subsidiary is included when calculating the profit or loss 
on disposal.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant 
influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 
between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, or 
can demonstrate significant influence, or evidence through a 
number of aspects such as representation on the board of directors, 
participation in policy making and decisions, material transactions 
between the entity and investee, interchange of managerial personnel 
or provision of essential technical information. Associates are 
accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised 
at cost. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s 
share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of 
the associate from the date that significant influence commences 
until the date that it ceases.
Revenue recognition and effective interest rate method (EIR) 
Income from purchased loan portfolios
Income from purchased loan portfolios represents the yield from 
acquired portfolio investments. Purchased loan portfolios are 
financial instruments that are accounted for under IAS 39 and 
recognised at fair value at the purchase date that equals the price 
paid. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
EIR method. 98
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition and effective interest rate method (EIR) 
Income from purchased loan portfolios continued
The EIR method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of 
a purchased loan portfolio and of allocating interest income over 
the expected life of the portfolio. The EIR is the rate that exactly 
discounts 84 months of estimated future cash receipts of the 
purchased portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial 
recognition (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset).
Upward revaluations (‘write-ups’) are increases to carrying values, 
discounted at the EIR rate, of the acquired debt portfolios as a result 
of reassessments to their estimated future cash flows and are 
recognised in the income from purchased loan portfolios line 
within revenue. Any subsequent reversals to write-ups are also 
recorded in this line. If these reversals (‘write-downs’) exceed any 
previously recognised cumulative write-ups (i.e. a write-down 
reduces the portfolio carrying amount below its initial purchase 
price) then impairment is recognised as a separate line in the 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Unallocated cash is held as a liability in the statement of financial 
position until it is reconciled. Unallocated cash is held as liability 
until all reasonable steps have been taken to show that it has been 
extinguished, only being released to the consolidated statement 
of profit or loss and other comprehensive income at this point.
Where the Group acquires purchased loan portfolios via forward 
flow agreements, being contracted multiple future purchases, 
there is no difference in accounting treatment from that 
described above.
Recognition of loan notes as portfolios
When the Group purchases loan notes in entities that in turn have 
legal ownership of underlying loan portfolios, the Group has assessed 
the substance of the loan notes under the criteria set out in IAS 39 
to determine whether to account for the underlying portfolio loan 
assets or to recognise an investment in the loan note asset in the 
entity that has issued the loan notes.
The decision is based on whether the circumstances meet the 
requirements of IAS 39, paragraph 19, which deems that the Group 
would recognise its proportionate share of the asset on balance 
sheet as portfolio loan assets, where the following criteria are met:
• the loan note issuing entity has no obligation to pay amounts to 
the Group unless it collects equivalent amounts from the 
original asset;
• the loan note issuing entity is prohibited by the terms of the 
transfer contract from selling or pledging the original asset 
other than as security to the Group for the obligation to pay 
them cash flows; and
• the loan note issuing entity has an obligation to remit any cash 
flows it collects on behalf of the Group without material delay.
Essentially where the risks and rewards of the loan portfolio assets 
sit with the Group rather than the issuer of the loan notes, it is 
appropriate for the entity issuing the loan notes to derecognise 
the underlying asset, and the Group to recognise their 
proportionate share.
If these criteria are met, the Group recognises its appropriate 
share of the underlying loan portfolios and if criteria are not met, 
then the Group recognises an investment in the loan notes.
Impairment of purchased loan portfolios and loan notes
The portfolios are reviewed for indications of impairment at the 
statement of financial position date, such as variances to historical 
cash curves, in accordance with IAS 39. This is considered on a 
portfolio basis. Where portfolios exhibit objective evidence of 
impairment, an adjustment, being the difference between the 
current carrying value and the net present value of future 
estimated cash flows, is recorded to the carrying value of the 
portfolio. Objective evidence of impairment is considered to be 
where the carrying value is less than the original purchase price 
less revenue recognised.
Revenue on assets under management
The Group receives asset management revenue on portfolios 
managed for third parties in the UK, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, the 
Netherlands and Belgium. In accordance with IAS 18, the Company 
recognises revenue on its managed services contracts when the 
right to receive such revenue is reasonably assured and can be measured 
reliably. The nature of the revenue is contingency collection fees, 
which are received either as a fixed fee, or as a percentage of 
collections or the outstanding portfolio asset value calculated at 
the contractually agreed period, which is usually monthly. The 
Group also receives master servicing fees which are recognised 
over time on measure of progress against performance obligations 
as the services are on demand when customers require them.
Interest income from secured loan notes
The Group has entered into lending arrangements with third parties 
to provide capital to purchase non-performing consumer debt 
portfolios (see note 17). Interest income is recognised throughout 
the year using the EIR, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged 
as the employees provide services to the Group.
The Group has, for the period covered by these financial statements, 
made contributions to defined contribution plans to provide 
pension benefits for employees upon retirement.
A number of employees of Vesting Finance were entitled to pension 
benefits that the company had insured through a contract with 
an insurance company. The arrangement met the definition of a 
defined benefit plan and the insurance policy represented qualifying 
plan assets of the scheme. In the current year, Vesting Finance agreed 
a compensation plan for employees for the change of their defined 
benefit pension scheme into a defined contribution scheme. 
Accordingly, a settlement has been processed and there is no plan 
liability at 31 December 2017 (note 25).
The Group’s net obligation in respect of the defined benefit plan 
was calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting 
that amount and deducting the fair value of plan assets from the 
insurance policy. 99

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Retirement benefit costs continued
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation was performed 
at acquisition and then annually by a qualified actuary. When the 
calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised 
asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits in the 
form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future 
contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of future 
economic benefits, consideration is given to the applicable 
minimum funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which 
comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets 
(excluding interest) and the effect of the ceiling (if any, excluding 
interest), are recognised immediately through other comprehensive 
income. The Group determines the net interest expense on the net 
defined liability for the period by applying the discount rate used 
to measure the defined benefit obligation at acquisition or the 
beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability 
during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. 
Net interest expense and other expenses related to the defined 
benefit pension plan are recognised in profit or loss.
When the benefits of the plan are changed or when the plan is 
curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past 
service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately 
in the statement of comprehensive income. The Group recognises 
gains and losses in the settlement of a defined benefit plan when 
the settlement occurs.
Foreign currency translation
The individual financial statements of each Group company are 
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the 
consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position 
of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is 
the functional currency of the Company and the presentation 
currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, 
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each statement of 
financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the year in 
which they arise except for exchange differences on transactions 
entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks.
For the purpose of presenting the consolidated financial statements, 
the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the statement of 
financial position date. Income and expense items are translated at 
the average exchange rates for the year, unless exchange rates 
fluctuate significantly during that year, in which case the exchange 
rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences 
arising, if any, are recognised in the other comprehensive income.
Leases
Assets leased are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownerships to the 
lessee but not necessarily legal title. The leased asset is initially 
measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with 
the accounting policy applicable to that asset. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases.
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned 
between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding 
liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the 
lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in 
which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. 
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
Current taxation, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is 
based on the taxable profit for the year and is provided at amounts 
expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting 
date. Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. Current taxation is charged or credited 
in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in 
which case the corporation taxation is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
provided, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary 
differences at each reporting date.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit. 100

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
Deferred tax continued
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the years in which the temporary timing 
differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting 
date. The carrying amount of deferred taxation assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred taxation is 
charged or credited in the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited to equity, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt 
with in equity.
Share-based payment transactions 
Share-based payments transactions in which the Group receives 
goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments 
are accounted for as equity settled share-based payments.
The grant date fair value of the share-based payment granted 
to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employee 
becomes unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of 
the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the 
related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected 
to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an 
expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the 
related service and non-market performance conditions at the 
vesting date. For share-based payments with non-vesting conditions, 
the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured 
to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences 
between expected and actual outcomes. Where the Company 
grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries, 
the costs are recharged to the subsidiary in line with the 
requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’.
Shares held in an employee benefit trust (EBT)
Transactions of the Company sponsored EBT are treated as being 
those of the Company and are therefore, reflected in these 
financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles
Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, as discussed 
below, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation 
of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the 
straight-line method on the following basis:
Furniture five years
Computer equipment three years
Leasehold improvements five years
Software licences  shorter of contractual life 
and useful economic life
IT platform useful economic life
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation 
method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item 
of property, plant and equipment and other intangibles is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Acquired licences, such as software licences, are capitalised at cost 
and amortised over the shorter of contractual life and useful 
economic life.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Purchased loan portfolios and secured loan notes measured 
at amortised cost
The Group’s purchased loan portfolios and secured loan notes 
are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market. Under IAS 39, such assets 
are classified as ‘loans and receivables’ and are measured at 
amortised cost using the EIR method less any impairment.
Purchased loan portfolios are acquired at a deep discount and as a 
result the estimated future cash flows reflect the likely credit losses 
within each portfolio. The portfolio investments are initially recorded 
at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
The portfolio asset is analysed as current in the statement of 
financial position as part of the Group’s normal operating cycle.
As part of the Group’s litigation strategy to recover customer 
balances, the Group incurs legal costs. Where these are considered 
recoverable these are included within the estimated forecasts of 
future cash flows within the purchased loan portfolios balance.
Loan notes measured at fair value
The Group’s loan notes measured at fair value are non-derivative 
financial assets. The loan notes are designated at fair value through 
profit or loss, as they are managed on a fair value basis.
The loan notes are initially recorded at their fair value, being their 
acquisition price, and are subsequently measured at fair value using 
a discounted cash flow model. 101
Financial statements
www.arrowglobalir.net
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Fair value measurements
The fair value of financial instruments is determined in accordance 
with IFRS 13 and IAS 39 in the manner described in note 27.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it 
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a 
transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the 
Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the 
financial asset.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the 
carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated 
to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the 
consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any 
new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had 
been recognised in the OCI is recognised in the statement of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Any interest in 
transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is 
created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate 
asset or liability.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions 
are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the consideration 
required to settle that obligation at the date of the consolidated 
statement of financial position and are discounted to present value 
where the effect is material.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial 
liabilities, such as loan notes, or as equity in accordance with the 
substance of the contractual arrangement and in conjunction with 
the application of IFRS.
Financial liabilities are held at amortised cost using the EIR method. 
The EIR is calculated by estimating the cash flows arising from the 
contractual terms of the instrument over its expected life. Transaction 
costs are included within the EIR and deducted from the initial 
carrying value of the debt instrument.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest 
rate swaps and forward currency contracts, to manage the interest 
rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s underlying business 
operations. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
All derivative financial instruments are assessed against the hedge 
accounting criteria set out in IAS 39. The majority of the Group’s 
derivatives are cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions and meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 
39. Derivatives are initially recognised at the fair value on the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at each reporting date at their fair value. Where 
derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in 
their fair value are recognised immediately within the profit or loss. 
For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and where 
the hedge accounting criteria are met, the effective portion of 
changes in the fair value is recognised in other comprehensive 
income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss as part of finance costs. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are recognised in profit or loss 
when the income or expense on the hedged item is recognised 
in profit or loss.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting when:
• it is evident from testing that a derivative is not, or has ceased 
to be, highly effective as a hedge; or
• the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised; or,
• the underlying hedged item matures or is sold or repaired.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue 
proceeds net of any transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
stated subsequently at amortised cost; any difference between 
proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income over the expected life of the borrowings using the EIR. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise demand deposits and other 
short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
change in value. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised 
cost in the statement of financial position.
Legal transaction fees
Legal transaction fees associated with the purchase of portfolios 
are allocated to the purchase price of the portfolio and included 
within the EIR applied against the asset value.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses relate to administration and costs associated 
with collection activities. All operating costs are accounted for on 
an accruals basis.
Other reserves
Other reserves include the own share reserve, the translation 
reserve and the merger reserve. These reserves are further 
explained in the consolidated statement of changes in equity 
on page 92. 102

4. Critical accounting judgments and estimates
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which 
the estimate is revised.
a. Fair value of net assets acquired as part of business combinations
The Group capitalises goodwill on the acquisition of entities as discussed in the significant accounting policies. Goodwill is the excess of the 
consideration paid over the fair value of its net assets, therefore the fair value of assets acquired directly impacts the amount of goodwill recognised on 
acquisition. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgment, particularly for those financial 
assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired loan portfolios and customer intangibles where valuations reflect 
estimates and timing of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to the post-acquisition performance 
of the acquired entities. Further detail on the valuation of acquired loan portfolios is given in section b. below.
b. Carrying value and EIR of purchased loan portfolios and loan notes
The carrying value of purchased loan portfolios is £900.8 million and loan notes is £50.7 million at 31 December 2017. These carrying values are based 
on 84-month cash flow forecasts that are prepared for each portfolio. These forecasts are generated using statistical models incorporating a number 
of factors, including predictions of probability to pay, which is informed by customer and account level data, credit agency data and our historical 
experience with accounts which have similar key attributes. A further key model input is previous payments made by a customer. Additionally, 
estimates are made of the movement of accounts from non-paying to paying, and vice-versa, either through breakdown of the account or settlement/
pay down of the balances due. In relation to non-paying accounts, assumptions will be made as to which operational strategy is the most appropriate 
to move the account to paying status, this may include placing these accounts into litigation. Operational factors, that may impact future estimated 
cash flows, are also considered such as improved collections processes and systems.
Management also review the model on a portfolio basis to take into account external factors, which have impacted historical, or will impact future 
performance and where necessary portfolios are calibrated to take into account these known factors. The assumptions and estimates made are 
specific to the particular characteristics of each portfolio.
The ERCs created from the ERC forecasting models, are regularly benchmarked at a portfolio level against actuals, this informs the decision as to 
whether a write-up or write-down may be required.
An impairment is only recognised if the ‘write-downs’ exceed any previously recognised cumulative write-ups and revenue recognised.
The estimated future cash flows generated by the above process are the key estimate/judgment in these financial statements. Flexing the expected 
future gross cash flows by +1/-1% would impact the closing carrying value of the purchased loan portfolios as at 31 December 2017 by +/- £8,845,000 
(2016: +/- £7,044,000). Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by +3/-3% would impact the closing carrying value of the purchased loan portfolios 
as at 31 December 2017 by +/- £26,534,000 (2016: +/- £21,131,000).

6. Segmental reporting
The Group represents a single reportable segment. The Group head office is in the UK, with subsidiaries also based in wider Europe.
Management has concluded that discrete financial information is not available because no measure of segment profit or loss by service line is supplied 
to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker does not have sufficient information to assess performance and make 
resource allocation decisions by product and, due to the nature of the Group’s activities, considers geography to be inappropriate.

Tax charge for the year consists of:
Current tax charge:
UK and foreign corporation tax based on profit after tax 8,947 7,055
Adjustment in respect of prior years (825) (2,871)
Total current tax charge 8,122 4,184
Deferred tax charge:
Origination and reversal of temporary differences 2,806 1,234
Adjustment in respect of prior years 102 441
Movement in deferred tax previously not recognised (572) (469)
Differences in tax rates 186 (329)
Total tax charge 10,644 5,061
In the current year, the tax charge is inflated by an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes largely due to current year subsidiary 
acquisition costs, a higher level of taxable income from overseas countries with higher tax rates and a chargeable gain. This is offset by the recognition, 
through deferred tax, of a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset in relation to prior year losses, along with profits of an associate accounted for 
net of tax.
Deferred tax
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £11,455,000 (2016: £14,335,000) of tax losses carried forward, due to uncertainties over 
the future utilisation of the losses including the future profitability of the relevant subsidiaries. These losses may be available for offset against future 
profits and have no expiry date.
The Finance Act 2016, which was substantively enacted in September 2016, included provisions to reduce the rate of UK corporation tax from 
20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020. Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in 
which the temporary timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the statement of financial position date. Accordingly, deferred tax balances have generally been calculated using a rate of 17% in these accounts, 
apart from balances on overseas companies that are recognised at the relevant rate applicable in the appropriate jurisdictions.

14. Goodwill continued
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination. 
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to six aggregated CGUs on the basis that these represent the lowest level at which goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes, and are not larger than the single operating segment defined under IFRS 8 (Operating Segments). 
In relation to goodwill, the six CGUs identified are Benelux, comprising all the Group companies acquired in the Vesting acquisition, Capquest group, 
comprising all group companies acquired in the Capquest acquisition, Portugal, comprising of all the Group companies acquired in the Whitestar, 
Gesphone and Redrock acquisitions, Arrow Global Receivables Management Limited (‘AGRML’), Zenith Service S.p.A (‘Zenith’) and Mars Capital 
Acquisition Limited (‘Mars Capital’). The Benelux, Capquest, Portugal, Zenith and Mars Capital CGUs, represent the cash flows generated principally 
from collections on acquired purchased loan portfolios and management of third-party debt, and the AGRML CGU represents the cash flows 
generated principally from collections on purchased loan portfolios.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs as follows:
2017
£000
2016
£000
Benelux 42,614 40,921
Capquest 45,608 45,608

AGRML 1,968 1,968
Zenith 10,525 —
Mars Capital 10,839 —
152,779 128,081
An impairment review was carried out at 31 December 2017 that resulted in no impairment to goodwill. The goodwill was assessed to be appropriately 
stated. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 
amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are 
those regarding the discount rate and forecast cash collections net of direct collection costs, and allowable forecast synergies.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the CGUs. The starting point for determining the discount rates for each CGU was to use the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’), and 
adjust this for specific factors for each of the CGUs to derive a market participant’s rate. The factors took into account the risks inherent in each of the 
CGUs, such as currency, regulatory, and economic risks and the different operations in the CGUs were also considered. As a result of applying the 
various risk factors noted above to the Group’s WACC, a market participant rate of 6.11% (2016: 6.09%) was determined for the AGRML and Capquest 
CGUs, a rate of 8.50% (2016: 6.84%) was determined for the Portuguese CGU, a rate of 6.00% (2016: 6.34%) was determined for the Benelux CGU and a 
rate of 6.57% (2016: N/A) for the Italian CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and 
extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity. The forecasts assume growth rates in collection activity which in turn drive the forecast collections and cost 
figures. These assumptions are in keeping with the directors’ expectations of future growth. Appropriate tax rates are applied to the cash flow 
forecasts for each CGU.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGU’s carrying value. The CGUs would become impaired based on an 
unlevered post-tax cash flow noted below, or based on an increase in the discount rate noted below.
Impairment in each CGU, would happen with –

A discount rate

Capquest 19% 3%
Portugal 6% 1%

Benelux 37% 4%

Zenith
The employees in the Zenith business are part of a statutory indemnity scheme, compulsory by law, that entitles them to deferred pay, typically at the 
end of their employment, the ‘Trattamento di fine rapport’ (TFR). A liability is recognised to reflect that the indemnity will be paid in the future when 
the employees leave employment. As at 31 December 2017 the estimated liability is €715,000 (£635,000) and is included within non-current trade and 
other payables on the statement of financial position. The liability is calculated by an independent expert through an actuarial valuation, the key 
assumptions used are detailed below:

Discount rate 1.3% 1.6%
Annual inflation rate 1.5% 1.0%

The investments in subsidiaries are all stated at cost less accumulated impairment.
The 15% interest in the Company’s associate, Promontoria MCS Holding SAS (MCS), was sold on 18 October 2017. The Group had acquired an indirect 
15% economic interest in MCS through a participation agreement on 15 December 2014. The terms of the participation agreement meant that the 
Group demonstrated significant influence over the MCS group. The associate was accounted for using the equity method.
Summarised below is a reconciliation of the movements in the carrying value of the Group’s interest in MCS during the year until the date of disposal:

A number of employees of Vesting Finance were entitled to pension benefits that the company had insured through a contract with an insurance 
company. The arrangement met the definition of a defined benefit plan. 
In the year under review, Vesting Finance agreed on a compensation plan for employees for the change of their defined benefit pension scheme into a 
defined contribution scheme. The change became effective during the reporting period and has been processed as a settlement, which resulted in the 
derecognition of the defined benefit obligations from the balance sheet, 31 December 2017 £nil (31 December 2016: £1,721,000).

26. Risks arising from financial instruments
Risk management
Treasury related risks
The board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations. The board delegates certain responsibilities to the 
treasury and tax committee. The treasury and tax committee, which is chaired by the chief financial officer, is empowered to take decisions within that 
delegated authority. Treasury activities and compliance with treasury policies are reported to the board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic 
independent reviews and audits, both internal and external. Treasury policies are designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in 
relation to funding and liquidity risks, counterparty credit risk and market risks being interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. This is to ensure the 
Group is properly funded, that financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality and that interest rate and currency risk is managed within set 
limits. Policies also set out the specific instruments that can be used for risk management.
The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts. The purpose 
of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s business operations. No transactions of a speculative 
nature are undertaken and written options may only be used when matched by purchased options. No written options were entered into during 2017 
(2016: £nil).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by cash or 
another financial asset.
The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth. The 
treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk by setting a specific policy parameter that there are sufficient committed debt facilities 
to cover forecast borrowings plus operational headroom plus appropriate stress testing for the next 18 months on a rolling basis. Further, the aim is to 
ensure that there is a balanced refinancing profile with phased maturity dates, diversification of debt funding sources and no over-reliance on a single 
or small group of lenders. At 31 December 2017, the Group’s senior secured notes and revolving credit facility had an average period to maturity of 6.1 
years (2016: 5.8 years). Total undrawn facilities as at 31 December 2017 were £60,575,000 (2016: £103,721,000). 118

Liquidity risk continued
The treasury function monitors cash through daily reporting, the management accounts and periodic review meetings. Management has well established 
models used to predict collectability of cash receipts and this represents a key performance indicator of the business. The Group has a low fixed cost 
base, is highly cash generative with weekly cash receipts and portfolio purchases (except forward flows) are discretionary, which helps to mitigate 
liquidity risk.

The analysis above includes the contractual cash flow for borrowings and the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan. Where 
borrowings are subject to a floating rate, an estimate of interest payable is taken. The rate is derived from interest rate yield curves at the statement 
of financial position date.
In addition to the above, the Group has entered in to certain forward flow agreements to which it has committed to pay £2,506,000 
(2016: £12,309,000) over the next five years.
The following analysis shows the gross non-discounted contractual cash flows in respect of foreign currency contract derivative assets and liabilities, 
and interest rate swap derivative liabilities which are all designated as cash flow hedges:

When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined with reference to the projected interest rates as 
illustrated by the interest rate yield curves existing at the statement of financial position date.
The above table shows the gross cash flows receivable and payable on our derivative financial instruments. Our derivative financial instruments are 
held across a number of counterparties; the largest net cash flow exposure to a single counterparty at 31 December 2017 is £1.2 million (2016: £1.0 million). 
A maturity analysis of the Group’s receivables and borrowing facilities as at 31 December 2017 is presented below:

782,792 100.0 803,850 100.0
This demonstrates the headroom on the Group’s borrowings at 31 December 2017 in comparison to the current purchased loan portfolio’s estimated 
collections over an 84-month period. The value of purchased loan portfolio shown above is discounted to net present value. The equivalent 
undiscounted ERC at 31 December 2017 is £1,462 million (2016: £1,339 million).
Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. 
Market risk principally comprises interest rate risk and currency risk considered further below.
Interest rate risk
The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates on its borrowings, principally on the floating rate senior secured 
notes, and therefore seeks to limit this exposure. This is achieved by the use of techniques to fix interest rate costs, including fixed rate funding 
(predominantly longer-term bond funding), forward currency contracts used for non-functional currency funding, bank borrowing loan draw down 
periods and interest rate hedging instruments. These techniques are used to hedge the interest rate costs on a proportion of borrowings over a 
certain period of time. Most hedging is for up to three years. 120

Exposure to interest rate risk
The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments as reported to the management of the Group is as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Fixed rate instruments
Financial liabilities 220.0 220.0
220.0 220.0
Variable rate instruments

Financial liabilities 715.1 558.6
Effect of interest rate swaps (399.5) (285.6)
Net Variable Rate 279.7 249.8
If interest rates across all countries of operation increased by 50 basis points this would have the following impact:
2017
£000
2016
£000
Increase in fair value of derivatives taken to equity 1,048 2,570
Reduction in profit before taxation (874) (656)
This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
• the change in market interest rates occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and/or derivative financial instruments;
• where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging instruments it is assumed that there 
is no impact from a change in interest rates; and
• changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Currency risk
The Group is subject to three types of currency risk; cash flow exposure, net asset exposure and income statement exposure.
Cash flow exposure
The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency. The policy of the Group is to hedge 
a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are expected to arise in the following 12 months. Where cash flow hedges have 
been entered into, they are designated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions.
Net asset exposure
A proportion of the Group’s net assets are denominated in Euro. The statement of financial position is reported in Sterling and this means that there is 
a risk that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have an impact on the net assets of the Group. The Group aims to minimise the value of net assets 
denominated in Euro by funding portfolio assets with Euro denominated borrowings where possible.
Income statement exposure
As with net assets, a proportion of the Group’s profit is denominated in Euro, but translated into Sterling for reporting purposes. The result for the 
period is translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate. A risk therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rate relative to the Euro will 
have an impact on the consolidated result for the period.
If foreign exchange rates had been 10% stronger than Sterling than those at the statement of financial position date and all other variables were held 
constant, the Group’s net assets and net profit for each significant denomination of currency would increase/(decrease) as follows:
Equity and net assets
2017

2016
£000
Currency
Euro (EUR) 6,728 3,506

Net profit
2017
£000
2016
£000
Currency
Euro (EUR) 2,932 2,328
2,932 2,328
The above assumes that there is no impact on retained earnings or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged (where the currency asset 
is exactly equal to the currency liability).  121

The above assumes that there is no impact on retained earnings or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged (where the currency 
asset is exactly equal to the currency liability). 
Credit risk
The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of underperforming consumer debt portfolios. This includes purchased loan 
portfolios and loan notes. Most portfolios by their nature are impaired at acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections that in turn 
inform the ERC’s on which the portfolio statement of financial position value is calculated. The ongoing risk is managed through a portfolio valuation 
process including modelling current expectations of recoverability based on historical information on debt types, also factoring in recoveries from 
collateral held on the secured portfolios. Further details of the forecasting process are given in note 4 b. A pricing gateway process is in place which 
includes at least two members of the executive board as well as other key members from appropriate areas of the business. The Group also monitors 
its exposure to geographic concentration of assets.
This process is in place to scrutinise all aspects of a portfolio acquisition from reputational and regulatory risk through to the financial assumptions 
and maximum bid price.
All purchased loan portfolios are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. As part of the regular monitoring process, the future cash flows in 
the ERCs are updated, with ‘write-ups’ or ‘write-downs’ as a result of changes to the estimated cash flows discounted at the EIR rate. An impairment is 
only recognised if the ‘write-downs’ exceed any previously recognised cumulative write-ups and revenue recognised.
Loan notes are measured at amortised cost or fair value through the profit or loss. They are measured at fair value if the Group manages them as such.
The Group’s most significant credit risk exposure is to debt portfolios. At 31 December 2017 the carrying value by geography is:
2017
£m
2016
£m
UK 474.1 444.2
Portugal 299.1 257.6
Netherlands 95.5 81.0
Italy 32.1 —
900.8 782.8
Additionally, the Group has credit risk exposure on loan notes of £50,698,000 at 31 December 2017 (2016: £21,315,000). 
We constructed our own proprietary data repository in 2005 and have added additional historic data on credit performance in the markets in which 
we operate. It now has tens of millions of records. This is used to inform our collections strategies and to help establish affordable repayment plans and 
settlements with our customers across all geographies. 
As part of credit risk, the Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks and foreign 
currency and derivative financial instruments. Counterparty risk with debt sellers is managed through warranties.
The Group generally deposits cash and undertakes currency and derivative transactions with highly rated banks, with strict limits on the level 
of exposure to any one institution. Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used with board approval. 122

(2016: £9.9 million).
The key risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are managed within an established risk management framework. The Group’s day-to-day working 
capital is funded by its cash and cash equivalents.
Capital risk management
The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business. The Group is currently not 
required to hold regulatory capital.
The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong statement of financial position but at the same time is providing a good 
return on equity to its shareholders. The Group’s long-term aim is to ensure that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity 
finance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity.
Management reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis. As part of this review, management considers the cost of capital and the risks 
associated with each class of capital. The Group’s position as at 31 December 2017 was:

27. Financial instruments
Fair value estimation
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations. 
For all other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other valuation techniques.
For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees of 
judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument.
Valuation models
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Level 1: inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices within level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar 
instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly 
observable from market data.
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable 
data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted 
prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to 
transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer 
quotes for similar instruments and unobservable inputs such as historic performance data and the Proprietary Collections Bureau output. The 
purchased loan portfolios fair value is calculated using our 84-month ERC through our own in-house models. Derivative financial instruments are 
initially recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value. The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Foreign 
currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching 
maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the 
applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Borrowings are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently held at amortised cost.  123

The fair value of loan notes has been calculated by using a discounted cash flow model. The three main influencing factors in calculating this are:
• estimated future cash flows, derived from management forecasts;
• the application of an appropriate exit multiple; and
• discounting using a rate appropriate to the investment and the anticipated rate of return.
The most significant loan note accounted for at fair value has a carrying value of £20.8 million at 31 December 2017. A +/- 3% movement in estimated 
future cash flows used in the 31 December 2017 cash flow model would result in a change of the fair value of +/- £0.6 million.
The Company did not hold any financial instruments at fair value (2016: none).

27. Financial instruments continued
Financial instruments not measured at fair value - fair value hierarchy continued
The statement of financial position value of the Group’s purchased loan portfolios and loan notes not measured at fair value, is derived from 
discounted cash flows generated by an 84-month ERC model. The inputs to the ERC model are historical portfolio collection performance data. This 
ERC model is updated with the core collections experience to date on a monthly basis.
Estimates of cash flows that determine the EIR are based on the Group’s collection history with respect to portfolios comprising similar attributes and 
characteristics such as date of purchase, original credit grantor, type of receivable, customer payment histories, customer location, and the time since 
the original charge off.
Management believes the purchase price is the best indicator of fair value at acquisition. Following acquisition, it is considered that given the nature of 
the loan portfolios, largely comprising non-performing loans, the information available and our forecasting models, the best estimate of the fair value 
of the purchased loan portfolios is their carrying value.
The Group has an established control framework covering the measurement of purchased loan portfolio values. This includes regular monitoring of 
portfolio performance overseen by the portfolio review committee, which considers actual versus forecast results at an individual portfolio level, 
re-forecasts cash flows on a semi-annual basis, reviews actual against forecast gross money multiple, signs off the latest ERC forecast, assesses the 
carrying value of the portfolio assets and reviews revenue recognition.
A reconciliation of the opening to closing balances for the period of the purchased loan portfolios and loan notes can be seen in note 17.
The Company did not hold any other financial instruments not measured at fair value for which a fair value needs to be calculated (2016: none).
Cash flow hedges
The Group uses foreign currency contracts (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge foreign currency cash flows that are highly probable to occur within 12 months 
of the statement of financial position date and interest rate swaps (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge those interest cash flows that are expected to occur 
during the period to September 2019. The effect on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income will also be within these periods. 
An amount of £348,000 has been charged to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2016: £827,000). All hedge relationships 
have been effective in the year and are expected to maintain effectiveness. No charge has been made to the Company’s equity.
The Group has interest rate swaps in place for a notional amount of £399,534,000 (2016: £571,243,000). In 2017, these interest rate swaps covered 
current borrowings, being the floating rate Euro notes. 
Interest rate swaps in place at the statement of financial position date are designated, and are effective under IAS39, as cash flow hedges, and their fair 
value has been recognised in the hedging reserve. All interest rate swaps are categorised as highly effective, so no charge has been made to the 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the year (2016: a credit of £297,000).

The Company did not hold any interest rate swaps at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £nil).
Forward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts and exposure 
to currency rate fluctuations.
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2017 is £127,800,000 
(2016: £186,600,000). These comprise foreign currency contracts to sell sterling for a total notional of £127,800,000 (2016: £186,600,000). 
These contracts have maturity dates to October 2018. These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 
and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity and fair value will be recycled to the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income in October 2018.
As at 31 December 2017 the aggregate amount of net gain/loss under forward foreign exchange contracts that have been recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income relating to the exposure on these anticipated future transactions is £nil 
(2016: £nil gain).
During the year, £1,804,000 (2016: £1,680,000) was recycled from equity to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as a result 
of maturity of the short dated foreign exchange swaps during the year.
The Company did not hold any foreign exchanges swaps at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £nil). 125

The carrying value of the bank borrowings is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value. Bank borrowings can be repaid within six months if 
the Group decides not to roll over for further periods up to the contractual repayment date. The impact of discounting is therefore negligible.
The fair value of the senior secured notes has been calculated by reference to broker quotes that are based on observable market inputs and therefore 
would be included as ‘level 2’ in the fair value hierarchy table should the liability have been held at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value, which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the derivative transaction. 
For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
For the Group, there is no difference between the carrying value and fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities. 126

Share incentive plan (SIP)
In 2017 (and previously April 2016, 2015 and 2014), the Group offered to all UK employees the opportunity to participate in a SIP, where the Company 
gives the participating employees one matching share for each partnership share acquired on behalf of the employee using the participating 
employees’ gross salaries. The shares vest at the end of three years on a rolling basis as they are purchased, with employees required to stay in 
employment for the vesting period to receive the shares.
On 30 December 2014, the Group provided eligible employees with a free share award worth £500, with a grant date price per share of £2.29 as part 
of the Arrow Global Group SIP. The free shares vest at the end of three years, with employees required to stay in employment to receive the shares.
Upon listing in October 2013, the Group provided eligible employees with a one-off award of free shares worth up to £3,000, with a grant price per 
share of £2.425, as part of the Arrow Global Group SIP. The value of SIP shares awarded was dependent on a linear scale of length of service. The free 
shares vested during the previous year, with restrictions attached to these shares ceasing to have effect from vesting date.
Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
LTIP Awards 2015, 2016 and 2017
On 31 March 2017, 8 April 2016 and 19 May 2016, nil-cost share options were granted to eligible employees based on a maximum of 150% of base salary. 
Conditional awards were also granted to eligible Dutch employees on 31 March 2017 and 19 May 2016. The LTIP awards vest at the end of three years, 
being 31 March 2020 and 8 April 2019 respectively, subject to the achievement of performance conditions. On the same dates, tax-qualifying options 
were granted as part of the LTIP awards (‘CSOP options’) to eligible UK employees.
Each CSOP option is subject to the same performance targets as apply to the nil-cost option part of the awards. If a CSOP option is exercised at a gain, 
the number of shares that may be delivered under the above associated nil-cost option under the LTIP will be reduced at exercise by the same value to 
ensure that the total pre-tax value of the original LTIP award delivered to the participant is not increased by the grant of the CSOP option.
On the 30 June 2015 and 15 June 2015, further awards of nil-cost share options were granted to eligible employees, which vest on 15 June 2018, 
subject to the achievement of the same performance conditions set out below.
CSOP options were granted to eligible UK employees on 15 June 2015.
For each eligible employee, 50% of the LTIP awards are subject to underlying basic EPS growth criteria and vest as follows:
Performance condition Percentage vesting
Less than 10% EPS growth per annum 0%
10% EPS growth per annum over the vesting period (‘threshold performance’) 25%
20% EPS growth per annum over the vesting period (‘maximum performance’) 100%
Between 10% and 20% EPS growth per annum over the vesting period Between the threshold performance and maximum
performance on a straight-line basis
For each eligible employee, 25% of the LTIP awards are subject to total shareholder return criteria, being share price growth plus the value of dividend.

On 30 March 2017, the Group issued €400 million senior secured floating rate notes due 2025 (the ‘2025 Notes’) at a coupon of EURIBOR +2.875% per 
annum with EURIBOR being not less than 0%. Interest is paid quarterly in arrears. The 2025 Notes can be redeemed in full or in part on or after 1 April 2019 
at the Group’s option. Prior to 1 April 2019 the Group may redeem, at its option, some or all of the 2025 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of

The proceeds from the 2025 Notes were used to redeem the existing €335 million 2021 Notes, pay the early redemption and transaction fees payable in 
respect of the €335 million 2021 Notes and repay drawings under the RCF.
On 1 September 2016, the Group issued £220 million senior secured notes at a fixed rate of 5.125% due 2024 (the ‘2024 Sterling Senior Notes’). Interest 
is paid bi-annually. The 2024 Sterling Senior Notes can be redeemed in full or in part on or after 15 September 2019 at the Group’s option. Prior to 
15 September 2019, the Group may redeem, at its option, some or all of the 2024 Sterling Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the 
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus an applicable make-whole premium.
On 1 September 2016, upon issuance of the 2024 Sterling Senior Notes, the Group redeemed the £220 million senior secured notes due 2020 
(the ‘2020 Sterling Senior Notes’) which were issued in January 2013. Upon redemption of the 2020 Sterling Senior Notes, the Group incurred costs 
of £15.0 million, details of which are included within finance costs (see note 9).
On 14 April 2016, the Group issued €230 million senior secured notes due 2023, at a floating rate of 4.75% over three-month EURIBOR (the ‘2023 Euro 
Senior Notes’). Interest is paid quarterly in arrears. The 2023 Euro Senior Notes can be redeemed in full or in part on or after 1 May 2019 at the Group’s 
option. Prior to 1 May 2019, the Group may redeem, at its option, some or all of the 2023 Euro Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the 
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus an applicable make-whole premium.
The Euro senior notes and Sterling senior notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Group.
Revolving credit facility
On 24 February 2017 the commitments under the RCF were increased from £180 million to £215 million. Upon the redemption of the €335 million 2021 
Notes on 30 March 2017, the maturity of the facility was extended to 31 March 2022. On 8 January 2018 the RCF was increased by £40 million and 
maturity extended to January 2023. The margin on the RCF was also reduced to 2.5%.
On 21 July 2016, the Group entered into a new £180 million revolving credit facility (the ‘revolving credit facility’) with The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc 
acting as security agent for a syndicate of participating financial institutions. The revolving credit facility has a margin of 2.75% and a committed term 
to 31 July 2021. The Group is required to pay a commitment fee at a rate of 35% of the margin per annum on the undrawn portion of each lender’s 
commitment. The revolving credit facility is secured by the same assets as the 2021 Euro Senior Notes, 2023 Euro Senior Notes and 2024 Sterling Senior 
Notes and ranks super senior to these. The assets that are secured are those of the Arrow Global Guernsey Holdings Limited group. On 24 February 2017 
the commitments under the revolving credit facility were increased from £180 million to £215 million. 130

meeting and has, therefore, not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The 2017 interim dividend was declared at 50% of the 2016 final dividend with the subsequent final dividend being proposed based on the underlying 
profit after tax for the year.
The ex-dividend date for the final dividend is 31 May 2018 with a record date of 1 June 2018 and a payment date of 6 July 2018. Shareholders will have the

election date of 15 June 2018.
32. Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking
Current year acquisitions
a. Zenith Service S.p.A.
On 28 April 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Zenith Service S.p.A. (‘Zenith’). Zenith has a similar principal activity to that 
of the Group and is a leading master servicer in the Italian structured finance market, and provider of various structuring and securitisation services. 
The Group paid cash consideration of €11,327,000 (£9,630,000) together with deferred consideration of €7,551,200 (£6,420,000). Deferred 
consideration is payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction and has been included at its fair value leading to an overall consideration 
of €18,588,000 (£15,803,000).

32. Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking continued
Current year acquisitions continued
a. Zenith Service S.p.A. continued
An intangible asset of €2,872,000 (£2,442,000) has been recognised at acquisition, being the fair value after appropriate discounting, of expected cash 
flows arising from contractual customer relationships. Goodwill of €11,847,000 (£10,072,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary 
reasons for the acquisition were to enter the Italian market via the acquisition of an existing well-established company, and to create scale and 
servicing capabilities across multiple asset classes. 
Trade and other payables in the acquired entity include a finance lease liability of €2,054,000 (£1,746,000) in relation to a property.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2017, Zenith contributed revenue of £8,681,000 and profit after tax of £1,055,000 to the consolidated 
results for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, Group total revenue would have been an estimated £331,942,000 and profit 
after tax would have been an estimated £41,498,000.
The minority interest, relating to a non-controlling interest in Zenith’s subsidiary, Structured Finance Management – Italy S.r.l (SFM), was recorded as 
the non-controlling party’s proportionate interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets of SFM at the acquisition date.
b. Hefesto
On 31 March 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Hefesto STC. Hefesto is a regulated Portuguese special purpose vehicle for 
the securitisation of loans and receivables. Whitestar acts as servicer and administrator of Hefesto. The Group paid cash consideration of €743,000 
(£636,000) which was equal to the fair value of the net assets acquired. The assets and liabilities acquired comprised €1,880,000 (£1,608,000) of cash, 
€1,181,000 (£1,010,000) of trade and other liabilities and €44,000 (£38,000) of other receivables. These figures are after fair value adjustments totalling 
€66,000 (£56,000). 
c. Mars Capital
On 30 November 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Mars Capital Finance Limited (“Mars Capital”). 
Mars Capital is the leading UK and Irish mortgage servicing business and will strengthen the Group’s asset management capabilities and reinforce its 
leading position in the UK, while providing strategic entry into Ireland.
The Group will pay £4,178,000 in cash together with deferred cash consideration of £10,000,000. The deferred consideration is payable on the 
four-year anniversary of the transaction. There is an amount of the deferred consideration contingent on the timing of the commencement of a new 
servicing contract. The deferred consideration has been included at its fair value, £8,581,000, taking into account management’s best estimate of the 
contingent amount payable. This gives an overall consideration of £12,759,000.

The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:

from contractual customer relationships. Goodwill of £10,839,000 was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition 
were to enter the Irish market, which offers significant debt purchasing and servicing potential via the acquisition of an existing well-established 
company, whilst enhancing the Group’s asset management capabilities.  133

c. Mars Capital continued
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2017, Mars Capital contributed revenue of £696,000 and profit after tax of £79,000 to the consolidated 
results for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, Group total revenue would have been an estimated £327,315,000 and profit 
after tax would have been an estimated £41,915,000.
Prior year acquisitions
a. InVesting
On 4 May 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of InVesting B.V. (subsequently renamed Arrow Global Investments Holdings 
Benelux B.V.). InVesting has a similar principal activity to that of the Group and is a leading consumer debt purchaser and third-party collections 
provider with operations both in the Netherlands and Belgium.
The Group paid cash consideration of €76,964,000 (£60,649,000) and contingent consideration of €270,000 (£213,000), with an additional 
requirement to repay outstanding loans and other costs of €12,280,000 (£9,677,000). The contingent consideration was paid on the one-year 
anniversary of the transaction and was included at its fair value, at the amount contractually agreed. The contingent consideration was based on the 
previous shareholders fulfilling their service responsibilities for 12 months post-acquisition; management deemed this to be highly probable at the 
previous reporting date. Included within the opening net assets are debt liabilities of £18,412,000, comprising an overdraft with a facility limit of €20 million, 
drawn at the acquisition date to the value €11,084,000 (£8,735,000) and an intercompany loan of €12,280,000 (£9,677,000) from an entity of the previous 
Group. Further to this an intercompany loan of €12,280,000 (£9,677,000) was created between Arrow Global Investments Holdings Limited and InVesting.
Goodwill of €47,995,000 (£37,821,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition were to create scale and 
servicing capability across multiple asset classes and to create a market leader within the Benelux market.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2016, InVesting contributed revenue of £40,580,000 and profit of £7,729,000 to the consolidated results 
for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of 1 January 2016, Group total revenue would have been an estimated £250,538,000 and 
profit after tax would have been an estimated £27,531,000.

Goodwill of £5,410,000 previously recognised in InVesting is not an identifiable asset when applying acquisition accounting and therefore was written 
off through fair value adjustments accordingly.
Purchased loan portfolios had a fair value at acquisition of £35,343,000. The fair value has been assessed using a methodology consistent with the 
Group’s other purchased loan portfolios as described in note 4.b. An intangible asset of £13,850,000 was recognised at acquisition being the fair value 
of expected cash flows over a seven-year period arising from contractual and non-contractual customer relationships discounted appropriately. A 
deferred tax liability was recognised, in relation to the customer intangible asset and the difference between the fair value of the purchased loan 
portfolios and the seller’s balance sheet carrying value. 134

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
32. Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking continued
Prior year acquisitions continued
a. InVesting continued
A fair value adjustment of £400,000 arose to reduce the deferred tax asset, reflecting the uncertainty over the amounts and timing of historical tax losses. 
Other receivables in the acquired entities comprise gross contracted amounts of £3,675,000. The minority interest was recorded at fair value at the 
acquisition date.
b. Redrock
On 29 February 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Redrock Capital Partners, S.A. satisfied with cash of €3,200,000 (£2,515,000), 
together with deferred consideration of €454,000 (£357 ,000) being a total consideration of €3,654,000 (£2,872,000). The deferred consideration is payable 
on the one-year anniversary of the transaction and has been included at its fair value. Redrock has a similar principal activity to that of the Group being the 
management and servicing of non-performing debt portfolios on behalf of third-party clients and the Group in Portugal.
Goodwill of €3,244,000 (£2,550,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition, which make up the goodwill, were to 
enable further synergy gains within the Portuguese CGU from a combination of lower servicing costs and more control over owned loan portfolios. This also 
allows focus on low valuation collections.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2016, Redrock contributed revenue of £268,000 and loss of £386,000 to the consolidated results for the period. 
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2016, Group total revenue would have been £235,959,000 and profit after tax would have been £26,325,000.
Effect of the acquisition
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:

An intangible asset of £407,000 was recognised at acquisition being the fair value of expected cash flows over a seven-year period arising from 
contractual and non-contractual customer relationships discounted appropriately. A deferred tax liability has been recognised, with respect to the 
customer intangible asset. The fair value of plant, property and equipment in Redrock was assessed to be nil following the relocation of the 
Redrock office.
Other receivables in the acquired entity comprise gross contracted amounts of £315,000. There are no provisions for overdue amounts.
Measurement period
Whilst the Group believes the acquisition accounting fair value adjustments to be complete, IFRS 3 allows a measurement period of up to one year after 
acquisition to reflect any new information obtained about facts and circumstances that were made available to the Group at the acquisition date. If any 
additional material changes are required within this measurement period, these will be reflected in the 2018 half year results of the Group.
33. Commitments
In December 2017, the Group entered into three binding contracts to buy purchased loan portfolios and loan notes for £57,000,000. Adjustments 
may be made to both the purchase price and the makeup of the portfolios and loan notes being acquired, by agreement between both parties, this is 
estimated to have a maximum potential impact on the purchase price of +/- £1.0 million. As payment has not been made and title has not yet passed, 
the portfolios and loan notes and associated purchase price liability have not been recognised within the financial reporting period. 135
Financial statements

34. Events occurring after the reporting period
The Group announced on 1 March that it has agreed terms for two acquisitions which strengthen the Group’s investment and asset management 
capabilities and reinforce its growing presence in Italy. 
The first is for 100% of Parr Credit S.r.l. (“Parr”), a leading Rome-based servicer of Italian non-performing loans for an equity value of €20 million. There 
are no regulatory required approvals for the transaction and the acquisition will complete on 1 March. 
The second is for Europa Investimenti S.p.A. (“Europa”), a leading originator and manager of Italian distressed debt investments, for an equity value of 
€62 million. This equity value includes the Group making an equity injection of €11.5m. While the core Europa business is not regulated, due to Europa 
owning a 74% stake in an Italian real estate fund management company, Vegagest SGR S.p.A., the transaction is subject to a regulatory change of 
control approval by the Bank of Italy and is expected to complete in mid-2018. The acquisitions will be funded in cash from existing Group resources.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
‘Adjusted EBITDA’ means profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, foreign exchange gains or losses and other adjusting items. The 
Adjusted EBITDA reconciliations for the year to 31 December are shown below: ’Adjusted EBITDA ratio’ represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to 
core collections. See page 25 for a reconciliation of the movement in purchased loan portfolios and loan notes under IFRS reconciled to cash ERC.
‘Adjusting items’ are those items that by virtue of their size, nature or incidence (i.e. outside the normal operating activities of the Group) are not 
considered to be representative of the ongoing performance of the Group and are therefore excluded from underlying profit after tax. 
‘Average net assets’ is calculated as the average quarterly net assets from H1 2016 to H1 2017 as shown in the quarterly and half yearly statements. 
In comparative periods this was calculated as the average annual net assets.
‘Cash interest cover’ represents interest on senior secured notes, utilisation and non-utilisation RCF fees and bank interest to Adjusted EBITDA.
‘Cash result’ represents current cash generation on a sustainable basis and is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, income taxes and 
overseas taxation paid, purchase of property, plant and equipment, purchase of intangible assets and average replacement rate.
‘CGU’ means cash-generating unit.
‘Collection activity costs’ represent the direct costs of external collections related to the Group’s purchased loan portfolios, such as commissions 
paid to third-party outsourced providers, credit bureau data costs and legal costs associated with collections.
‘Core collections’ or ‘core cash collections’ means cash collections on the Group’s existing portfolios and loan notes including ordinary course 
portfolio sales and put backs. Core collections is a key metric as it represents the Group’s most significant cash inflow. It is also a key component of 
adjusted EBITDA which is used to monitor the Group’s leverage position. The breakdown of core collections for the years ended 31 December 2017 
and 31 December 2016 are as follows:
2017
£000
2016
£000
Collections from purchased loan portfolios 333,567 285,960
Collections from loan notes 8,643 —
Core collections 342,210 285,960
’Cost-to-collect ratio’ is the ratio of collection activity costs to core collections.
‘Creditors’ means financial institutions or other initial credit providers to consumers, certain of which entities choose to sell paying accounts or 
non-paying accounts receivables related to debt purchasers (such as the Group).
‘CSA’ means Credit Services Association.
‘Customers’ means consumers whose unsecured loan obligation is owed to the Group as a result of a portfolio purchase made by the Group.
‘Defaulted debt’ means a debt where a customer has breached the repayment terms governing that debt such that it is unlikely to be paid. Under the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 there are specific legal obligations which require a customer to be sent the relevant statutory default notice(s) after which 
the customer’s agreement may ultimately be terminated. Other types of debts may also be defined as defaulted in the event that they remain unpaid 
for a period of 90 days or more, if there is not an acceptable arrangement in place to bring the account back up to date, in which case the creditor or 
lender may reasonably believe that the relationship has broken down. Under the Data Protection Act 1990 it is a requirement that any organisation 
seeking to register a default with a credit reference agency must also send a notice of intention to file a default, this notice is very similar in nature to 
that required under the Consumer Credit Act both of which give the debtor 28 days to bring the account back up to date before action is taken.
‘Diluted EPS’ means the earnings per share whereby the number of shares is adjusted for the effects of potential dilutive ordinary shares, 
options and LTIPs. 
‘DSBP’ means the Arrow Global deferred share bonus plan.
‘EBITDA’ means earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation.
‘EBT’ means employee benefit trust.
‘EIR’ means effective interest rate (which is based on the loan portfolio’s gross internal rate of return) calculated using the loan portfolio purchase 
price and forecast 84-month gross ERC at the date of purchase. On acquisition, there is a short period that is required to determine the EIR, 
due to the complexity of the portfolios acquired.
‘EPS’ means earnings per share.
‘84-month ERC’ and ‘120-month ERC’ (together ‘gross ERC’), mean the Group’s estimated remaining collections on purchased loan portfolios over an 
84-month or 120-month period, respectively, representing the expected future core collections on purchased loan portfolios over an 84-month or 
120-month period (calculated at the end of each month, based on the Group’s proprietary ERC forecasting model, as amended from time to time).
‘ERC Rollover’ relates to additional cash flows from rolling the asset life on all portfolios to seven years from the date of ERC, including the impact of 
any foreign exchange movement and the impact of reforecast in the period.
