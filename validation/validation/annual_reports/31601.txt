Grainger at a glance
We are a market leader  
in the UK private rented 
sector. We own and manage 
over 8,900 homes for rent  
across the UK. 
Business overview
We are investing successfully in new 
high-quality homes for rent, generating 
attractive and sustainable total returns 
for our shareholders. This is supported 
by the reliable revenue generated from 
our regulated tenancy portfolio.
We have a high-performing portfolio 
of residential rental properties, which 
provides both strong capital growth and 
rental growth prospects. Our operational 
platform ensures we have a direct 
relationship with our customers and 
enables us to deliver enhanced returns. 
The assets within our portfolio are well 
located and achieve market-leading 
performance. Using our in-house 
knowledge and expertise, combined 
with rigorous research and analysis, 
we choose assets located in the areas 
of greatest demand with the greatest 
growth prospects.

PRS investments
Private rented sector portfolio
We have 4,789 private rented sector 
(‘PRS’) homes in our portfolio. These 
well-located assets are attractive to 
customers and, with our expert 
operational team managing the  
properties directly, our portfolio  
continues to outperform the market. 
Our aim is to offer attractive homes to our 
customers and provide a reliable service 
for them. This means we have more 
satisfied customers, who are staying with 
us for longer, making sure our assets stay 
in high demand. In turn, this generates 
attractive and sustainable long-term total 
returns for our shareholders.
Like-for-like rental growth 
3.3%
Occupancy rate (PRS)
97 %
Regulated tenancy portfolio
Our portfolio of regulated tenancies 
generates stable and reliable cash flow 
of at least £100m per annum.
Around 6.5% of our regulated tenancies 
become vacant each year, enabling us to 
capture the uplift from their tenanted 
value to their vacant value as we sell them. 
Returns from regulated tenancies are 
generated in three ways: rental income, 
capital growth and the reversionary 
surplus (crystallising the reversion when 
they become vacant). Our regulated 
tenancy portfolio provides a resilient 
rental income with growth linked to the 
Retail Price Index, albeit with lower yields 
than our PRS assets. 
We are reinvesting these proceeds into 
higher-yielding new PRS homes.

Business model and strategy
Our inputs
Our people 
The people in our team, with their depth  
of knowledge, ensure we outperform the 
market by investing in the right assets and 
providing a great service to our customers. 
Our assets
Having great homes, in high demand, is 
critical to achieving strong shareholder 
returns. We focus on acquiring the assets 
that will do this. We also ensure we 
optimise the value of our existing assets, 
and reposition our portfolio where required.
Capital discipline
We allocate capital to the right assets, in 
the right locations and at the right price. 
We have a strong capital structure, which 
enables us to deploy capital efficiently.
Relationships
Building and maintaining strong 
relationships with our customers, 
partners, suppliers, shareholders, 
local communities, government and 
within our industry is an important 
ingredient to enabling our success. 
Intellectual property 
In an emerging market such as the PRS, 
where we are market leader, we focus 
on protecting our intellectual property 
and internal market intelligence, to 
ensure we continue to maintain our 
lead and grow our market share.
Technology
We continue to enhance our use of 
technology to improve service, knowledge 
and operational efficiency. It is enabling 
scalable growth, while ensuring we 
continue to improve our service to 
our customers.
How we create value Driving shareholder returns
We have a competitive advantage due to 
our ability to originate, invest and operate 
successfully in this growth market. 
This three-part operating model helps us ensure 
we are investing in the best possible assets and 
providing great service. This enables us to deliver 
market-leading total returns for our shareholders.
Growing income returns
(KPI: Net rental  
income → dividend) 
Through new investments and proactive 
and efficient management of our 
properties, we are growing our net rental 
income, which underpins dividend growth 
for our shareholders. 
+ 
Enhancing capital returns 
(KPI: EPRA NNNAV)
Our targeted development and 
investment activity, along with our 
well-located assets, help deliver strong 
capital growth, underpinning growth  
in the net asset value of our business.

On the following page we discuss our long-term value stream
Our clear strategic priorities
Priority 1
Grow rents
Our strategy is expected to double our  
net rental income from 2015 levels after 
our investment programme has been  
fully deployed.
Through origination and investment,  
we are developing and acquiring new 
assets, which will deliver income growth. 
We operate our assets directly to ensure 
we maximise long-term rental income 
for shareholders.
Priority 2
Simplify and focus
Since 2015, we have simplified our  
business and focused on growing the  
UK PRS, positioning us for growth.  
This involved a significant cost reduction 
programme (overheads and capital 
structure) and sale of our non-core 
businesses. We have repositioned our 
business and our priority now is to control 
costs and improve efficiency, which will 
enable us to grow, and enhance our returns.
Priority 3
Build on our experience
In the emerging PRS market, our  
105-year history as a leading, responsible 
and professional landlord sets us apart 
and underpins our growth plans. We are 
focused on further improving the service 
we provide to our customers, particularly 
through technology.
Sharing the value we create
Customers
We are offering an increasing number 
of high-quality homes for rent to a wide 
range of customers, while focusing on 
providing a great service and ensuring  
our customers get good value for money.
Shareholders
As the value of our assets grows, and  
we create more homes to rent, our EPRA 
NNNAV and dividend grow too, delivering 
attractive returns to our shareholders.
Local communities
We are ensuring our investments in  
local communities have a positive impact 
on those living nearby. This might include 
improving local infrastructure, providing 
new jobs for local people, enhancing  
the public realm or supporting local 
communities, businesses, charities  
and schools. 
Suppliers
The opportunity to grow in the UK PRS  
is substantial, and our growth will benefit 
our supply chain partners. This will 
multiply the positive impact we have  
on local communities and people.
Our employees
Through successfully creating value,  
we are able to be a great employer, 
providing a positive and rewarding  
work environment and a wide-ranging 
benefits package. This will ensure we 
attract and retain the best possible talent  
in the market. Employees are provided 
opportunities to be shareholders 
through various share schemes.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report
How we create value
Originate
Planning, design and delivery 
Creating, designing and developing new PRS homes provides  
us with control over the delivery of new buildings. 
This is important because in this emerging sector there is an 
undersupply of high-quality investment assets available in  
the market and this enables us to enhance returns.
Invest
Capital allocation, geographical targeting, acquisitions,  
asset and portfolio management
Our investment process is efficient and rigorous. It is designed  
to empower the entire organisation to introduce new investment 
opportunities, while ensuring our appraisal process is highly 
disciplined and controlled, yet also efficient. 
We have a twice-weekly Investment Committee chaired by our  
Chief Executive, Helen Gordon. Our investment process is 
supported by our on-the-ground experience, and by our market 
research function, which undertakes detailed economic and 
market analysis for each investment opportunity. 
Creating 104 new homes  
for rent 
In Hampshire, at our Berewood 
project, we are creating 104 new 
high-quality homes for rent.  
Our development team, working 
alongside our operations team, has 
created thoughtfully considered, 
well-designed homes, perfectly 
positioned for the local market. 
The first release of homes has 
been in high demand, with initial 
lettings exceeding expectations, 
and positive customer feedback. 
Encouraging our staff to 
support our investment pipeline
In the past year, one of our 
apprentices brought a PRS 
investment opportunity to  
our sourcing meeting, and  
we successfully acquired it.  
It was a stabilised PRS asset  
worth £12.1m, comprising  
159 PRS homes.
Originate, invest  
and operate
We compete successfully in the market and generate 
enhanced returns through our ability to originate, invest 
and operate in the UK PRS. Collaboration in these three 
areas, and a culture of continuous improvement, allows 
us to grow in a disciplined yet efficient manner , while 
generating attractive returns for shareholders and  
value for our customers.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Operate
Lettings, management and customer service
We believe in the importance of having a direct relationship  
with our customers. This gives us the ability to focus on providing 
a better service to our customers and greater control over the 
performance of our portfolio. We seek to continually improve  
our service based on customer feedback. 
Using first-hand knowledge and 
customer research to inform 
the design of our buildings
At one of our new PRS 
developments, Argo Apartments 
in Canning Town, we have applied 
some new features, including a 
guest suite, and made a number  
of adjustments to our operational 
approach, using customer 
feedback and market research, 
including consumer focus groups.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
Dear shareholders,
In my first report as Chairman, I am pleased to say that 2017  
has been a year of considerable progress in delivering the 
strategy whilst improving financial performance. After ten 
months in the business working alongside the management  
team and Non-Executive colleagues, I remain convinced that  
we have the right strategy and the right team to deliver it.
Financially, we have seen good growth in net rental income, 
strong like-for-like rental growth, good sales profits from our 
regulated tenancy portfolio and a significant reduction in our 
operating costs, all of which have helped drive a significant 
increase in adjusted earnings.
While there is real focus in the business on pursuing our PRS 
strategy, I am pleased to say that there has been an equal  
focus on our existing business. By getting to know our customers 
better we have been able to continue to improve the service we 
provide. By looking at every area of our invested portfolio we 
have found potential opportunities to improve performance.  
We have strengthened our governance structures and processes 
to enhance our control environment and prepare the business for 
growth. Following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, we have redoubled 
our efforts to ensure our customers and employees are kept safe.
For our PRS business, significant efforts have been made  
to secure further assets and to generate new development 
opportunities for the longer term. While our existing PRS assets 
are performing well, it is securing the opportunities for growth, 
completing them on time and to budget and making them 
operational that will enable us to deliver our strategy. 
As Grainger rapidly transforms into an increasingly customer-
driven organisation, it is clear that its culture and people are key to 
its long-term success. During the course of the year my colleagues 
and I have been able to meet with a large number of the 
dedicated Grainger teams around the country, who have a real 
passion for what they do. Going forward, our focus on delivering 
a culture that has customers at its heart will continue to grow.
During the course of the year there have been some changes to 
the Board. Baroness Margaret Ford stepped down in February 
having served eight years as a Non-Executive Director with the 
last two as Chairman. Nick Jopling, Grainger’s Property Director, 
stepped down in September having been with the Company for 
seven years. Belinda Richards has decided to step down at the 
AGM in 2018 having served over six years on the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. I would like to thank all of them for their 
significant contribution to the success of the Company and wish 
them well for the future. I would also like to welcome Justin Read 
to the Board as a Non-Executive Director who joined at the same 
time as I did in February.
Finally, I am pleased to propose an increase in our final dividend 
to 3.26p per share, bringing the total for the year to 4.86p per 
share, up 8% on the prior year, reflecting the growth in net  
rental income. Looking forward, our goal is simple – to generate 
superior total returns for our shareholders in this exciting new 
growth market, the PRS.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s review
Our strategy  
is delivering  
strong results
Helen Gordon
Chief Executive
Dear shareholders,
It is my second year at Grainger, and I am pleased to report 
strong performance of your Company, and good progress  
on our strategy.
We continue to grow rents, simplify and focus the business to 
reposition it for the future, and build on our significant 105-year 
experience in the UK residential market. 
Less than two years ago, we set out a plan to refocus the 
Company on investment in the UK private rented sector, and to 
grow significantly by investing £850m into the UK PRS by 2020.  
Our vision for the business is simple – to be the UK’s best PRS 
landlord and deliver attractive total returns for our shareholders.   
Strategic priority 1: grow rents
We have secured more than 75% of our targeted investment,  
and we anticipate superior returns of typically between 6.5%  
and 8% gross yields from our investments.
When we have deployed the £850m and our investments are 
fully stabilised, we expect net rental income to be more than 
double what it was in 2015.
Strategic priority 2: simplify and focus
In parallel with this growth, we have also delivered on our 
promise to improve Grainger’s efficiency and reduce operating 
costs. Our overheads are 25% lower than in 2015 and we have 
significantly reduced our cost of debt, which now stands at 3.4%. 
We have reduced the cost of running our properties, with gross  
to net leakage reduced to 26%. We have also substantially 
enhanced our capital structure, processes, governance and 
control environment, and we have repositioned Grainger to 
support our strategy for growth. 
Strategic priority 3: build on our experience 
We continue to build on our reputation as a leading residential 
landlord in the UK and remain focused on providing great rental 
homes and continually improving our customer service. We are 
enhancing the service we can provide our customers through 
operational improvements and through investing in technology. 
Our commitment to the health and safety of our customers and 
employees remains central to what we do.

Delivering results
Strong financial performance
As a result of the significant changes we have implemented 
within the business over the last two years, I’m pleased to report 
that the financial performance of the Company is strong. 
Adjusted earnings increased by 40% in the year to £74.4m.  
We have grown net rental income by 8% to £40.4m, delivered 
strong sales performance from our regulated tenancy portfolio 
and created enhanced profits from development activity. In 
addition, we have made great strides in improving our capital 
structure with a cost of debt of 3.4% at the period end. The total 
return for the year was 7 .3%, a strong result, supported by an 
enhanced income return and a lower level of capital growth than 
last year. Last financial year also benefited from the profitable 
disposals of our non-core businesses (FY16: 10.6%). 
I am pleased to report an 8% increase in our total dividend to 
4.86p per share (FY16: 4.50p per share), in line with our policy  
to deliver sustainable, income backed growth and distribute 50% 
of net rental income. (See the Financial review on pages 24 to 28).
Superior operational performance
Underpinning our financial performance is the progress we  
have made on improving the management of our portfolio  
and our increased focus on customer service. To support this 
crucial aspect of the business, we recruited John Kenny as  
Chief Operating Officer. From his previous role operating 
approximately 25k student beds, John brings a wealth of 
experience and knowledge.
Over the year, the performance in our net rental income was 
supported by a reduction in our property operating costs  
(gross to net leakage) from 28% to 26%. Meanwhile, we 
successfully increased the length of stay of our customers from 
less than 18 months to over 2 years, reducing void costs whilst 
also capturing strong rental growth.
Recognition as a market leader
We were proud to be acknowledged for our position as the 
industry’s leading PRS landlord, asset manager and developer. 
We are also grateful to our peers for awarding us Property 
Week’s Property Company of the Year, a highly competitive  
and cross-sector award. Our GRIP REIT joint venture with APG 
was recognised as a Sector Leader by the Global Real Estate 
Sustainability Benchmark.
Our differentiated approach
We refined our operating model during the year. Our success  
is based on our ability to originate, invest and operate our 
investments fully in-house, and we have organised the business 
to provide a strong focus on each area.
This enables us to generate superior returns through our ability 
to collaborate internally across all these areas. In this regard,  
we strongly believe that the whole is greater than the sum  
of its parts. The operational team, for example, works with our 
development team in the design of our new PRS developments, 
and with the investment team to appraise every opportunity we 
consider. This collaborative and informed approach produces 
enhanced returns and reduces risks.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Preparing the business for the exciting growth  
in new PRS homes 
As our pipeline of new PRS homes grows, we are investing to 
support future growth. We examined every process within the 
business to find more efficient ways of working, and through  
a great team effort and a disciplined focus on continuous 
improvement we have laid excellent foundations for the future.
Last year, we completed a full strategic review of the business, 
covering every portfolio and its potential for growth. We 
continue to regularly review all of the assets within our portfolio 
and measure their returns potential. This has led to a series of 
profitable disposals, enhancing our sales revenues. The Board 
and the whole Grainger team are committed to this disciplined 
and continual approach to evaluating assets.
Securing a high-quality pipeline
We strengthened our acquisition team during the year by 
investing in our in-house research capability and improved our 
investment process to ensure it is both robust and efficient.  
The result is a team focused on identifying opportunities with  
the right characteristics for growth, in the right locations, and we 
have successfully secured a number of high-quality investments. 
Customer focus
We continue to look at ways we can improve our service to 
customers. Our annual customer survey and the regular 
feedback we collect provide us with a clear set of priorities 
against which to measure our service and focus our attention.
In our portfolio of regulated properties, we recognise that many 
of our residents are older. We are working with Age UK London  
to help us understand how we can better support our older 
residents. We have also supported the Grainger team with 
technology, enabling them to work remotely and get closer  
to our regulated tenancy customers.
We have made a number of improvements in the way we support 
our PRS customers and we undertook a survey to understand 
what else we could improve upon and to better understand our 
customers’ preferences in the PRS. The survey identified that 
there is scope to improve on our responsiveness and reduce  
the time to resolve maintenance requests. To this end, we are 
investing in technology solutions and our people. This is an 
important area for the Grainger team, and one our investment  
in technology will support.

Chief Executive’s review continued
Attracting and retaining the best talent
Despite the change that has taken place over the past two years, 
I am proud to say that the Grainger team remains as enthusiastic 
as ever. The talent within the organisation is unrivalled, we are 
committed to attracting and retaining the best talent and we 
have a rigorous framework for doing so. We are committed to 
encouraging a positive working culture with a focus on customer 
service and continuous improvement.
Our employee engagement survey highlighted the high levels  
of pride that employees have in Grainger. Levels of staff 
engagement are high, with 87 .5% of staff responding to the 
survey. The survey also identified areas where we can do more  
to support and develop our staff including ‘wellbeing’ and  
‘giving something back’, and we are planning a series of  
initiatives for 2018. 
Making a positive impact
To help secure a long and successful future for Grainger, we 
believe it is important that we make a positive impact, both  
on those around us and the environment. We have therefore 
developed a new corporate social responsibility and sustainability 
strategy which has three focus areas: treating people positively; 
creating desirable, healthy homes; and securing our future  
(see pages 29 to 35).
A positive market backdrop
The fundamental market drivers for the UK PRS remain positive 
and demand for good-quality rental homes far outstrips supply. 
Growth in demand is projected to continue. While political 
uncertainty and Brexit are having an impact on real estate 
generally, the UK PRS is proving resilient. The legislative 
environment across the UK and in London supports growth  
in the UK PRS, particularly through build-to-rent and  
institutional investment.
Looking ahead
Through implementation of Grainger’s strategy and a focus  
on creating great homes for rent, the business has been 
transformed. The work we have done to dramatically improve  
our cost base and invest in a pipeline of quality assets positions 
us for strong growth. Much work remains, however, and we 
intend to maintain our rigour and pace. 
Our longer-term vision for the business goes beyond our £850m 
investment plan, and we have redesigned the business to support 
further growth, both financially and operationally. 
We are looking to introduce technology solutions to further 
improve our operations, generate enhanced returns and  
continue to improve our customer service.
Our focus today remains on fully securing our pipeline of 
high-quality rental homes that will produce attractive and 
enduring returns. 
I would like to thank the Grainger team for their continued hard 
work and dedication to achieving such a great performance this 
year. Our Property Director, Nick Jopling, leaves Grainger at the 
end of 2017 . I would like to thank Nick for his contribution to  
the business over the last seven years, and particularly for the 
support he has given me over the last two years. I would like  
to thank our previous Chairman Baroness Margaret Ford for her 
unwavering support of the executive team and our new strategy. 
I would also like to thank the Board and our shareholders for their 
ongoing support.
The future for Grainger is exciting. We are growing a business 
with great long-term value, and we are delivering a portfolio  
of good-quality homes for rent which our employees and 
shareholders can be proud of.

Financial review
The financial performance for 2017 has been another strong 
result, building on the transition we achieved in 2016 and the 
business is now repositioned for growth. The improvements in 
our operating platform and reduction in finance and operating 
costs have delivered a step-change in the Group’s income 
credentials. As a result, we have enhanced the quality and 
resilience of the total returns from our residential business model. 
Adjusted earnings increased by 40% to £74.4m (FY16: £53. 1m), 
driven by lower finance and operating costs, increased sales 
profit and rental growth. Profit before tax for the year was 
£86.3m (FY16: £84.2m). EPRA NNNAV increased by 5.6% to  
303p per share (FY16: 287p per share). We have delivered a  
total return of 7 .3% (FY16: 10.6%), as a result of our strong 
trading performance and valuation growth of our assets.  
This year our total return was supported by an enhanced  
income return and capital growth which was at a lower rate  
than last year. The previous financial year also benefited from  
the profitable disposals of our non-core businesses.
We have achieved our overhead reduction target, generating  
a 25% saving since we embarked on our new strategy. This has 
been delivered whilst maintaining excellent momentum in 
securing our PRS pipeline of £651m, alongside our strong 
operating performance and good financial results. 
We are focused on delivering sustainable, income backed 
dividend growth. In line with our policy to distribute 50%  
of net rental income (equating to £20.2m), the total proposed 
dividend for the year is 4.86p per share, up 8% year-on-year 
(FY16: 4.50p per share). This is expected to rise significantly  
over coming years as our new investments complete.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Income statement
We have continued to improve our income credentials. New 
acquisitions, active asset management and improved operational 
efficiency have supported growth in net rental income. This has 
been further enhanced by the reductions we have made to our 
overheads and finance costs. We have achieved this alongside a 
strong sales performance, and supported by our development 
activity which has generated profits and additional cash for 
reinvestment into the PRS.

Rental income
Gross rental income increased to £54.6m (FY16: £51.9m), 
supported by like-for-like rental growth across our entire portfolio 
of 3.8%. We saw 3.3% like-for-like rental growth across our 
portfolio of PRS assets and 4.3% annualised growth on regulated 
tenancy reviews. In addition, the acquisitions of tenanted rental 
homes that deliver immediate income more than offset the 
impact of disposals.
Our PRS portfolio has outperformed the market due to the 
strength of our customer proposition. For the year to September 
2017 , Grainger PRS rental growth of 3.3% was ahead of market 
rental growth of 1.6% (average based on ONS, Countrywide  
and HomeLet). 
Net rental income growth of 8% to £40.4m (FY16: £37 .4m) has 
been supported by acquisitions, active asset management and 
increased operational efficiencies. We achieved a further 200bps 
improvement in our gross to net property operating expenditure 
ratio to 26.0% (FY16: 28.0%). We view this as a sustainable level 
for the future and our medium-term target is 25–26%. 
Grainger’s net rental income is broadly equally split between 
regulated tenancies and PRS.

Sales
We have delivered a good performance from sales activities,  
with overall sales profit up 5% to £75. 1m (FY16: £71.5m). 
Our residential sales performance continues to be resilient,  
with regulated tenancies providing regular cash flows on vacancy.  
We have achieved 1% growth in residential sales profit to £60.4m 
(FY16: £59.7m). Growth in tenanted and other sales has driven 
the improvement, helped by active management of our portfolio 
and the attractive nature of our properties (location, pricing  
and type).
On average, the vacancy rate of our regulated tenancy portfolio 
was 6.2% over the year and we have been selling vacant 
properties at 2.7% above the September 2016 vacant possession 
value. Healthy levels of trading, combined with strong demand 
and pricing, demonstrate the resilient nature of our assets. 
Our development activity has been key to the overall sales 
performance. Profit from development activity for the year  
of £14.7m is 25% ahead of the prior year (FY16: £11.8m). This 
performance has been driven by strategic land sales which 
account for one-third of the profit from development activity. 
Other development activity includes sales from our Berewood 
site in Hampshire and our partnership with the Royal Borough 
of Kensington and Chelsea (‘RBKC’), from which funds will be 
received on completion of the homes.
We expect good levels of development activity to continue  
in FY18 as we work through our strategic land sites and our 
partnership with RBKC.

Overheads
Over the year we have made further improvements to our  
cost base, reduced overheads beyond our target and positioned 
the business for significant growth. These actions will continue  
to enhance our income return, a key objective of our strategy. 
Alongside our ambitious growth plans and continued focus  
on performance, we set a challenging target of reducing our 
overhead costs by 24% over two years to £27 .5m by this  
financial year, which we have exceeded. 
Overheads for the year were £27.2m. This is a 14% year-on-year 
reduction (FY16: £31.8m) and a 25% reduction since embarking 
on our new strategy (FY15: £36. 1m). Net overheads for the year, 
as set out in the following table, totalled £22. 1m, down from 
£25.6m for 2016. 
We achieved these savings by restructuring our business, 
improving processes, creating a robust control environment  
and investing in technology. We believe our overheads are at  
a sustainable level to support our medium-term growth plans. 
£m FY17
Overheads 27.2
Management fees (overheads recovery) (5.1)

Financing and capital structure
Net debt increased to £848m (FY16: £764m) as we deployed 
investment into new PRS homes, and Group LTV increased to 
37 .7% (FY16: 35.9%). 
Sales from Grainger’s regulated tenancy portfolio, active asset 
management and gross rental income underpin the Group’s 
highly cash generative business model. We generated £228m  
of cash from sales, gross rental income and management fees in 
the year. We invested £203m in the year, comprising £131m into 
our secured PRS investment pipeline, £50m into development 
and refurbishment activities, £14m into affordable homes and 
£8m into regulated tenancies. Of our £651m secured pipeline our 
cumulative spend by the end of this financial year was c.£220m.
We expect strong cash generation to continue, which, coupled 
with £344m of headroom on our facilities following completion 
of the recent £75m PRS funding noted below, helps support our 
ambitious growth plans. Our planned optimal LTV target range  
is 40–45% once we deploy investment. 
In addition to the progress in reducing our operating costs,  
the actions taken to reduce our cost of debt has also brought 
significant benefits and helped enhance our income returns. 
Our average cost of debt for the year was 3.5%, 90bps down on 
the prior year (FY16: 4.4%). At the period end, our cost of debt 
was 3.4% (FY16: 3.9%). Our net finance cost for the year was 
£27 .0m, 27% lower than the prior year (FY16: £37 . 1m).
The reduction in cost of debt has been achieved by recent 
refinancing activities, including the £100m refinancing in 
November 2016. We secured a new £40m facility with 
Handelsbanken in June 2017 , and extended £450m of our 
syndicated bank facility by two years to 2022 with options  
to extend for a further two years to 2024.
Our PRS investment assets are aligned to longer-term funding 
and this is likely to be an increasing feature as our PRS schemes 
are developed out. Our income returns will continue to be 
enhanced by the low cost of debt we can source. Our headroom 
is accessible at a marginal rate of below 2% and in October, we 
secured a new ten-year, £75m PRS facility with Rothesay Life, at  
a fixed rate. Including this financing activity, our hedging stands 
at 87%. This activity has enabled the Group to secure a low cost 
of debt for the longer term.
26 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items saw a charge of £2.8m in the year 
comprising two main components. £1.2m relates to the 
implementation of the strategic change in our operations and 
£1.6m relates to a provision for historical, non-core businesses.  
Last financial year we had income of £7 .4m, relating mainly  
to these historical, non-core businesses. 
Balance sheet
We continued to secure attractive PRS investment opportunities 
in the period and have seen healthy growth in the overall net 
asset value of the Group.

EPRA NNNAV increased by 5.6% over the 12-month period  
to 303p per share (FY16: 287p per share), driven by a strong 
trading performance and valuation growth. 
Our EPRA NAV/NNNAV excludes a reversionary surplus of 
£310m. This is the difference between the market value of our 
assets whilst they are tenanted and the value we could realise if 
they became vacant today and were sold. £230m (55p per share) 
of this relates to our regulated tenancy portfolio and the 
remaining £80m relates to joint ventures and PRS assets.
EPRA NNNAV includes deferred and contingent tax liabilities 
associated with revaluations of our portfolio. Around 66% relates 
to our regulated tenancy portfolio, which will crystallise over 
time as we dispose of assets. We therefore view EPRA NNNAV  
as an important measure for valuing our balance sheet.

As illustrated in the table below, we have seen good growth in 
our wholly-owned portfolio (regulated tenancies and PRS assets) 
in the South East, Outer London and the regions, with more 
modest growth seen in Central and Inner London. The 11.4%

Summary and outlook
Through the implementation of our clear strategy, we have 
transformed Grainger over the last two years. Our financial 
performance has been strong, we have grown rents, secured 
future rental growth, simplified and focused the business, 
improved operational efficiency and repositioned the business  
for significant growth. 
We have delivered a sustainable improvement in our cost base, 
through improving processes and reducing our operating 
expenditure, overheads and finance costs. This will enhance 
Grainger’s total returns, with an increasing contribution from 
income as we accelerate our transition from regulated tenancy 
assets into the PRS.
Our cost of debt was 3.4% at the period end and as shown by  
our recently secured ten-year, £75m facility, high-quality PRS 
assets enable us to secure attractive long-term financing, further 
underpinning our returns. 
Next year will be an active period for investment and 
construction as our secured PRS assets are developed. New 
acquisition activity will also continue, both to further build our 
secured pipeline and to deliver further rental growth, which  
will come primarily from new tenanted PRS investments in  
the coming financial year.
We expect the next financial year to be another active period  
for disposals. We anticipate robust sales to continue from  
natural vacancies associated with our regulated tenancy 
portfolio. We will supplement this with sales from active asset 
management initiatives and further development activity 
(including strategic land sales and our partnership with RBKC). 
These activities will provide cash for recycling into PRS assets  
and support profits before income starts to come through from 
the new PRS assets we are developing.  
The quality and resilience of Grainger’s portfolio, our reduced 
cost base and secured pipeline places us in a very strong position  
for the future. The market opportunity and scope for growth are 
compelling and we are confident in our ability to create long-
term value for shareholders.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our people, assets and environmental impact
Overview
We are ensuring that we are creating long-term, sustainable 
income by designing and creating homes of the highest quality 
for rent, engaging and empowering the people who create, 
manage and live in these homes, and doing our part to protect 
the environment around us to ensure the conditions are 
conducive to a thriving rental market.
Developing our new strategy
This year we have developed a new sustainability and corporate 
social responsibility (‘CSR’) strategy, following internal and 
external consultation, to ensure it supports our business strategy.
Creating long-term, 
sustainable value
Developing the highest-quality talent and designing and creating the 
best possible homes.
We redesigned our governance of sustainability to strengthen 
it and give it a new lease of life. A new Sustainability and 
CSR Committee, chaired by an Executive Director, has  
senior representation from each aspect of the business,  
with explicit divisional ownership within operational teams.
We undertook a peer review and benchmarking exercise,  
political and legislative analysis, and a materiality review, where 
we consulted employees as well as key external stakeholders, 
including top shareholders, potential customers and key 
suppliers. From this insight, we developed our new strategy.

the Grenfell Tower fire.
• Continued growth in public attention on provision  
of affordable housing.
People

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Developing the highest-quality talent
Over the past year, we have strengthened the way we  
manage and support our people and the great talent we have 
within the organisation. We introduced a talent forum, where 
senior management review each individual in the business, 
identifying potential for growth and planning for succession.  
We reinvigorated our internal training and educational 
programme, with 79.5% of employees taking part in sessions 
covering a range of topics from London housing policy to 
pensions. We undertook a third-party, independent and 
anonymous employee engagement survey, and have committed 
to do so annually and follow up with interactive employee 
workshops and action plans. We have introduced a new health 
and wellbeing cash-back plan for all employees. We have put  
in place a process to support the development of members of 
our team by providing them opportunities to engage with and 
interact with senior management and external stakeholders.

Providing first-class learning opportunities
Nurturing talent within our organisation will be a key ingredient 
to success. We therefore focus on supporting our employees 
through training, development and learning opportunities.  
Over the year, we reinvigorated our internal educational 
programme and held numerous workshops and sessions for 
employees, covering a range of topics, both real estate specific 
and more widely.

Working with our customers
The future of our business is based on our customers and 
their willingness to put their faith in us when they choose  
to rent one of our properties.
We are therefore committed to understanding their wants, 
needs and aspirations fully. Through a structured programme 
of gathering feedback, we ensure we are not just listening to our 
customers, but responding and acting accordingly. This year we 
introduced a new customer survey for our PRS customers to 
provide us with an independent assessment of how we are doing. 
We have also strengthened our complaints process so customers 
know their concerns will be dealt with fairly and promptly.
Our survey highlighted the potential to improve customer 
satisfaction levels by enhancing our responsiveness. We are 
looking at all our service level agreements to ensure suitability 
and we are investing in people and technology solutions to reduce 
the time to address requests and maintenance issues, as we strive 
toward providing excellent customer service. 
Making a positive impact  
in local communities
We are creating 3,850 new homes at Wellesley in Aldershot, Hampshire.
Here we are an active member of the Community Matters 
Partnership Project. During the past year we have supported a 
number of local charity and community events, including Twilight 
Runway Charity Challenge, NUTS Charity Challenge, Christmas  
food drive, Race Night charity event, and mock interviews at local 
secondary schools. 
We provide rent-free or subsidised commercial space to local 
community organisations, including The Source – Bike Start; 
Farnborough Foodbank; Community Bees; and North Lane Lodge, 
a charity facility for the homeless in Aldershot.
Through Rushmoor Borough Council’s employment skills initiative, 
this year we have: 
• created 17 work experience placements; 
• delivered 13 career talks; and
• created 11 new jobs.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Summary of 2017 performance 
This year, Grainger reformed its Sustainability and CSR 
Committee which decided to take stock and review the business’s 
sustainability priorities and approach up to 2020. A robust 
materiality review was undertaken which included:
• internal engagement with Committee members and 
employees;
• external stakeholder engagement with investors, suppliers 
and potential tenants;
• competitor review; and
• political and legislation risk assessment.
The findings provided a clear direction for the business’s 
sustainability approach. The subsequent development of a 
new sustainability strategy (reported on page 29) provides 
Grainger with clear focus areas to set new long-term objectives 
for 2018 and beyond. 
In the meantime, over the past 12 months Grainger completed 
two long-term sustainability projects:
1)  To design, define and agree a consistent process to measure 
customer satisfaction across portfolios and geographies 
and create a baseline for customer satisfaction.
2)  From a property inspection, to identify Grainger properties 
that are not on track to meet required Minimum Energy 
Efficiency Standards and develop a strategy to ensure 
compliance by 2018.
The conclusion of these projects places Grainger in a strong 
position to respond to customer expectations and continue its 
impressive record of customer retention, and to enhance the 
energy efficiency of its existing stock, whilst eliminating risk 
associated with Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards legislation 
that will come into force in 2018 and 2020. 
A further two sustainability objectives relating to the production 
of a sustainable procurement policy and a community 
engagement best practice guide were not pursued. Examples 
of best practice in both of these areas were collated from 
across the business and it was felt that formal documentation 
would not enhance the good practice already taking place. 
Observations and recommendations
The refresh of Grainger’s Sustainability and CSR Committee 
places Grainger in a strong position to continue embedding 
sustainability throughout its business. The Committee 
membership includes representation from all key business units 
and has already proved effective in identifying opportunities to 
measure and enhance sustainability outcomes.
Grainger’s performance in sustainability benchmarks continues 
to demonstrate leadership, with GRIP REIT being awarded 
European listed residential Sector Leader award in the Global  
Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (‘GRESB’) and Grainger 
retaining its listing on the FTSE4Good Index and its gold award  
in the EPRA sBPRs. Its long-standing commitment to disclosure 
places Grainger in a strong position to report to the new social 
and governance indicators set out in the updated version 3 of  
the sBPRs and we encourage Grainger to report in alignment 
with these guidelines in its 2017 disclosure. 
Over the next year, we recommend Grainger sets new long-term 
sustainability targets aligned to its business model and the 
sustainability priorities identified in the recently-completed 
materiality review. Grainger should also continue its efforts  
to respond to feedback gathered in new employee and tenant 
satisfaction surveys, such as formalising its approach to 
supporting employee and customer health and wellbeing. 
Grainger has engaged Upstream Sustainability Services, JLL, as 
advisers on its sustainability strategy and implementation since 
2005. Due to JLL ’s long-standing relationship with Grainger plc, 
our assessment of Grainger’s performance and this statement 
itself cannot be considered entirely independent. 
JLL ’s observations and recommendations are based on analysis of 
documents, interviews and/or other secondary evidence provided 
by Grainger plc and relevant third parties. All reasonable efforts 
were made to check the quality, accuracy and credibility of the 
available information but this did not include site visits or audits 
on primary data (e.g. meter readings and invoices). Consequently, 
this statement does not represent formal assurance or 
verification of the sustainability content of Grainger plc’s 2017 
Annual Report and Accounts.

Risk management
Risk management approach
Good risk management is fundamental to our ability to meet our 
operational and strategic objectives. The competitive market we 
operate in requires effective decision making, ensuring we assess 
the risks we take and achieve appropriate returns. We also need 
to be resilient to risks we have limited control over, by maintaining 
adequate disaster recovery and business continuity procedures.
During the year, we have tried to further establish our risk 
management culture and ‘three lines of defence’ model 
throughout our simplified business. In particular, in 
implementing our PRS strategy we reviewed our operating 
processes in detail, developing risk and control matrices for 
each process that we considered. 
Our overall risk management ambition remains to nurture a 
responsive, forward-looking, consistent and accountable culture 
of risk management.
Rigorous risk assessment
We designed our systematic risk management approach to 
identify risks to the business using both a ‘bottom-up’ and a 
‘top-down’ approach.
Once we identify risks, we determine their impact and probability, 
and give them a Gross (before mitigation) and Net (after 
mitigation) score. This allows us to identify which risks depend 
heavily on internal mitigating controls. We consider a range of 
risk categories, including strategic, market, financial, legal or 
regulatory, operational, IT, project and people. 
We use a risk-scoring matrix to ensure we take a consistent 
approach when assessing the overall impact to the Group.  
For risks arising in operational areas, we base their likelihood on 
how often they occur in a rolling 12-month period. We record 
their impact and likelihood scores in departmental risk registers. 
The relevant internal committee reviews these registers at 
least quarterly. We then collate a Group top risk report for 
the Executive Committee and Audit Committee to consider.
A strong risk  
management framework
T o maintain our position as the UK’s leading PRS landlord, we recognise we need 
a clear understanding of the risks we face. Our systematic and rigorous approach 
aims to monitor those risks continuously, review our systems of risk management 
and internal control, and evolve our approach accordingly.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Risk control framework and appetite
The Board has ultimate responsibility for Grainger’s risk 
management and internal control systems, and for determining 
its risk appetite. During 2017 a detailed assessment of risk 
appetite for our principal risks took place. The Executive 
Committee made recommendations to the Board and Audit 
Committee, which discussed them, then set the risk appetite. 
This process considered the level of risk appropriate for achieving 
our strategic goals and the risk opportunity we may pursue. 
The Board’s tolerance for risk is generally low, particularly for 
regulatory and reputational risks. The Board is willing to take 
an increased level of risk in other matters where there is 
appropriate reward, such as development project risk. 
The Board approves the risk management framework developed 
by the Executive Committee. We have adopted this framework 
following the implementation of our PRS-focused strategy, 
bringing it into line with the reshaped business. The structure 
also complements our further evolution to a ‘three lines  
of defence’ model, with clear divisions between each line.  
This framework includes various management committees 
overseeing key investment, operational and corporate functions.

These management committees and the Executive Committee 
question and discuss the identified risks, reported controls, 
mitigation and the principal risk report. The Audit Committee 
supports the Board by monitoring and reviewing the control 
processes and mitigation for the identified risks. It also ensures 
we continue to carry out the process for reconsidering the 
principal risks. We monitor the internal control framework for 
these risks through the Internal Audit monitoring plan and the 
resulting audit outcomes. For more information on internal 
controls, please refer to page 58.
Assurance on risk controls is currently provided by internal 
management information, internal audits, external audits 
and Board oversight. We also have an externally supported 
whistleblowing hotline that staff can use anonymously if 
other methods are not suitable.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Principal risks and uncertainties
Category of risk Risk description Impact on strategy Key mitigants Risk change
1. Market Weak macro-economic 
conditions leading to 
long-term flat or negative 
valuation movements.
Economic uncertainty 
leading to a reduction in 
home ownership and less 
demand for disposal of 
assets; pressure on 
rental levels; falling asset 
values; subsequent 
investment constraints 
on further investment 
into the PRS; covenant 
compliance risk; less 
attractive business 
to investors. 
  
• We are actively transitioning the business 
to reduce reliance on trading income and 
house price inflation.
• We have a high proportion of liquid and 
diverse assets to enable sales where 
necessary, as was shown clearly in the last 
economic downturn.
• We have a geographically diverse portfolio 
and exercise active asset management to 
enhance returns, and have target towns 
and cities for future investment. 
2. Financial The inability to obtain 
sufficient finance to fund  
the delivery of the strategy 
and maintain a strong  
capital structure.
Lack of availability from 
credit markets and cash 
resources; breach of loan 
and bond covenants; 
adverse movement in 
interest rates could have 
an unacceptable impact 
on the cost of new debt; 
inability to fund 
acquisitions at the 
relevant time.
  
• We monitor our banking covenants  
closely to maintain sufficient capacity.
• We conduct our business within Board-
approved capital operating guidelines 
and interest rate hedging policy. 
• We have a diversity of financing sources. 
• Due to our close monitoring of the 
transactional pipeline, we can control the 
timing and number of new acquisitions, 
to reduce cash outflows if needed. 
• Our strategic focus is to increase income 
credentials to provide greater interest cover. 
3. Regulatory Failure to meet current  
or increased regulatory 
obligations, or anticipate  
and respond to changes  
in regulation that create 
increased and costly 
obligations. These include the 
introduction of rental controls 
or similar limitations, and the 
operating framework facing 
UK businesses following  
the decision to leave the EU.
Fines, penalties and 
sanctions; damage to 
reputation; loss of 
operational efficiency 
and competitiveness; 
increased costs; 
reduction in market 
opportunities; impact 
on ability to finance 
opportunities; reduced 
ability to generate rents; 
inability to build 
competitive PRS 
portfolio.
  
• We have an ongoing programme of 
management and staff training.
• We have invested in employing specialist 
legal, compliance and corporate affairs 
teams which monitor and advise internally, 
review the regulatory horizon and have close 
involvement with leading industry bodies.
• We have strict asset management controls 
and compliance processes which can also 
adapt to change. See page 33 for details  
of our proactive management of the 
forthcoming Minimum Energy Efficiency 
Standards, as an example.
• Our position as the UK’s leading PRS 
provider brings a cultural ethos of 
seeking to adopt best practice.
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors have made a systematic assessment of the Group’s principal risks. They have considered these across four years, 
which aligns with our viability statement on page 41. During the year, the Board also considered closely the potential risks arising 
from the UK leaving the European Union (‘EU’), which we stated in our 2016 Annual Report and Accounts as a principal risk. It was 
the Board’s view that the level of risk to the Company has decreased over the period. Brexit is still a risk to the business in the context 
of wider geo-political uncertainty. However, we are of the view that Grainger’s exposure to this risk is no higher than similar UK-
focused businesses. We have therefore amalgamated the risk into the Regulatory risk, pending the changes in law that will arise 
in connection with it.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Category of risk Risk description Impact on strategy Key mitigants Risk change
4. People Failure to attract, retain  
and develop our people 
to ensure we have the right 
skills in the right place at the 
right time for our strategy.
Reduced ability to 
achieve business plan 
and strategy; reduced 
control; inability to grow 
market share of the PRS; 
failure to innovate and 
evolve to maintain 
competitiveness in a 
customer-driven market.
  
• We have introduced a talent identification 
process and have succession plans and 
retention strategies for key staff.
• We have a programme of learning and 
development for staff, which includes 
management and leadership training.
• We carry out regular performance 
reviews and appraisals of staff.
• We identify opportunities for staff to develop, 
and we provide internal career progression.
5. Supplier A significant failure within,  
or by, a key third-party 
supplier or contractor.
Increased costs; inability 
to achieve performance 
objectives; legal action 
and regulatory sanctions; 
reputational damage; 
customer dissatisfaction; 
a restriction on ability to 
grow platform; negative 
impact on organisational 
or portfolio growth plans.
 
• We have well-established internal controls 
and management systems regarding our 
contractors and suppliers which include 
counterparty reviews and covenant 
strength assessments.
• Experienced senior managers oversee 
relationships closely.
• We aim for a diversity of key suppliers 
and relationships with potential suppliers, 
so we are not over-reliant on any one.
6. Health  
and safety
A significant health and  
safety incident as a result of 
inadequate or inappropriately 
implemented procedures.
Harm to customers, 
tenants, employees, 
contractors or visitors; 
possible legal action 
or fine; subsequent 
reputational damage.
• We have specific internal control and 
management systems to mitigate health and 
safety risk, including technological solutions 
and a programme of audit and assurance.
• We have taken steps to embed the ‘three 
lines of defence’ model to facilitate stronger 
monitoring and controls, and foster a 
culture of health and safety awareness.
• We employ a specialist Health and Safety 
Director and team who are responsible 
for overseeing compliance.
• The risk management framework we have 
adopted applies a system of close oversight 
and reporting of health and safety matters.
7. PRS 
strategy
Failure to implement strategy, 
including failure to: transact 
and acquire assets on 
acceptable terms; integrate 
PRS assets efficiently in the 
management platform at  
the required scale; reduce 
overheads; convert to rental 
and income model; maintain 
our position as the UK’s 
leading landlord while 
managing change.
Acquisition of 
unprofitable schemes 
will depress Group 
returns; lack of 
competitiveness in 
acquiring schemes 
leading to failure to 
achieve strategy; 
reduction in scale and 
profitability of business; 
inability to provide 
shareholders with 
sustainable returns 
in the long term.
 
• Our business is based on taking considered 
risks for appropriate returns in acquiring and 
managing PRS assets. We have introduced 
new technology to improve the efficiency 
and have close controls of transactions 
and scrutiny of investment models and 
business KPIs. 
• We have restructured the business to 
reduce overheads. We closely monitor 
them and have sought to establish a 
culture of cost management.
• The new operating model has put the 
business in a position to support a more 
scalable platform and a well-defined 
technology strategy.

8. Development We allocate a portion of our 
capital to activities which 
carry development risk.
Exposure to risk of  
cost overrun or income 
shortfall, affecting 
achievement of the 
strategy and returns 
in developing rent 
schemes.
  
• We monitor the capital we deploy 
to development matters carefully, 
following capital allocation guidelines.
• We employ an experienced team with 
specialist development skills and have 
established relationships with expert 
advisers and development partners. 
• We have an established governance 
structure to review and monitor our 
development schemes.
• As part of our PRS strategy, the portfolio 
of development schemes now focuses 
on build-to-rent assets and does not 
seek speculative returns from investing 
in development that is solely for sale. 
9. Cyber and 
information 
security
The breach of confidential 
data or technology disruption, 
caused by an internal or 
external attack on our 
information systems and  
data or by internal security 
control failure.
Financial loss; fines; 
reputational damage; 
operational and business 
disruption; loss of 
customers; share price 
devaluation; inability  
to serve our customers, 
manage our properties 
and conduct our 
business.
 
• We employ an experienced IT team with 
qualifications in cyber security matters  
and engaged external advisers to undertake  
a technology effectiveness review.
• Technology is a key part of our PRS strategy. 
We are investing in new technology 
platforms and related processes that 
have ‘data security by design’. 
• We engage external advisers to carry 
out regular penetration testing to ensure 
the systems are robust.
• We are in the process of implementing 
our risk-based roadmap in respect of 
the requirements of the forthcoming 
General Data Protection Regulation.
10. Customers The failure to fulfil our 
customer proposition 
consistently, and meet 
our high service standards  
for our diversified  
customer base.
Negative publicity; 
increased complaints; 
poor customer 
experience; reputational 
damage; loss of 
customers; lower 
rental return.
• We have a leading operational platform 
with substantial experience in managing 
a portfolio of over £2bn of assets and 
of meeting the requirements of our 
residential customers.
• Our new operating model is designed 
to provide a platform for optimising a 
customer-focused strategy.
• We carry out proactive asset management 
and have restructured to increase staff 
time in the field, to gain greater asset 
and customer knowledge.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Viability statement
The Group has completed one year of its five-year business 
plan since the launch of its new PRS-focused strategy.
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group 
considering its current position, potential impact of our principal 
risks and future prospects. Based on the assessment, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the four-year period to September 2021. 
They made this assessment recognising the principal risks that 
could have an impact on the future performance of the Group 
(see pages 38 to 40). The business plan process incorporates 
severe-scenario planning, with the amalgamation of multiple 
risks to assess impact and the longer-term viability of the Group. 
The key scenarios assessed included:
• sensitivity to valuation movements, including a sudden and 
severe deterioration in market conditions in the housing market;
• sensitivity to increasing interest rates;
• cost inflation ahead of rental growth;
• reducing rental levels; and
• combinations of the above circumstances.
In addition, the Group has a business planning process, 
conducted annually, which comprises a five-year strategic plan, a 
financial forecast for the current year and a financial projection 
for the next four years. The Board reviews the plan each year as 
part of its budget and strategy review process. Once approved by 
the Board, the plan is cascaded across the business. It provides a 
basis for settling all detailed financial budgets and strategic 
action subsequently used by the Board to monitor performance, 
and for the Remuneration Committee to set targets for the 
annual incentive.
The Group’s business model has proved to be resilient 
throughout the different economic cycles, even with higher 
levels of gearing and over the long term, with consistent 
demonstration, through its ability to sell assets and let vacant 
properties, of providing stable income returns and cash 
generation, even during challenging market conditions. Currently 
the Group directly owns £1.7bn of residential property assets, 
which are relatively liquid, as proved throughout previous 
property cycles. 
The Group would remain viable even in the event of severe and 
sustained house price deflation, as it would be able to accelerate 
the natural conversion of assets to cash, including the sale of 
tenanted assets, and reduce or suspend development and 
acquisition activity. An unprecedented and continued long-term 
lack of liquidity in UK residential property markets would cause 
a threat to the Group.
The Board has reviewed its strategic and financial plans in detail, 
and believes a viability assessment period to September 2021 is 
appropriate, as it could manage any of the principal risks during 
this period. The financial plan has been stress-tested against 
severe and prolonged reductions in house prices.
The financing risks of the Group are also considered to have 
an impact on the Group’s financial viability. The two principal 
financing risks for the Group are the Group’s ability to replace 
expiring debt facilities and adverse movements in interest rates. 
The Group has secured funding to deliver the secured PRS 
pipeline, and has prepared the strategic plan on this basis. 
In addition, the Group manages its hedge exposure with 
interest rate swaps, caps and fixed rate facilities.
Our 2017 Strategic Report, from pages 1 to 41, has been 
reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on 
30 November 2017.

Governance
Chairman’s introduction to governance
Dear shareholders,
I was delighted to have the privilege of joining Grainger as its 
Chairman in February 2017 following the retirement of Margaret 
Ford. The Directors and I are committed to applying effective 
corporate governance and promoting the highest standards. 
I am therefore very pleased to introduce this year’s corporate 
governance report. 
Grainger has a long and established heritage in residential 
property and is wholeheartedly leading the way in the PRS.  
I have joined the Company at a very exciting and interesting  
time. The strategy was already established when I was appointed, 
and we are now firmly in the implementation phase. As a Board, 
we need to lead the business through this period of change, 
providing the appropriate balance between supporting and 
challenging the management. This good governance also  
means ensuring we have rigorous risk management and controls. 
The application of the skills and experience of the Directors, 
coupled with the substantial work of the Audit Committee, 
provides this for the benefit of all our stakeholders.
Culture
The culture of a business is crucially important to its successful 
performance over the long term. The Financial Reporting Council 
(‘FRC’) 2016 report ‘Corporate Culture and the Role of Boards’ 
articulates how directors can influence and contribute to 
fostering a strong and positive corporate culture. Whilst the 
culture of the organisation comes up in many aspects of the 
Board’s work, at the September 2017 Board meeting, we spent 
time specifically discussing Grainger’s culture. As part of this we 
received a presentation from the HR Director on our employee 
engagement programme and survey, which included details  
of our employees’ views on the Company. We provide further 
details on our culture and employee engagement on page 31. 
As a new member of the Grainger team, my impression of the 
culture of the Company is that its knowledgeable and expert 
staff care about our tenants and customers and about leading 
the professionalisation of the sector. It is an open culture, with  
a willingness across the business to share ideas and engage in 
continuous improvement to achieve all parts of the strategy.  
As a Board, we need to continue to encourage this openness, 
and ensure we have a culture that puts customers at the heart 
of our business. 
Strong governance 
supports the 
implementation  
of our strategy

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2016 (the ‘Code’)
The governance rules applying to all UK companies on the 
Official List of the UK Listing Authority are set out in the Code, 
published by the FRC. You can obtain copies of the Code from 
www.frc.org.uk. The Board fully supports the principles set out in 
the Code, and confirms we have complied with all its provisions 
throughout the financial year ended 30 September 2017 .
This report sets out Grainger’s governance policies and practices, 
and includes details of how the Company applies the principles 
and complies with the provisions of the Code.
Board composition and independence
In accordance with the Code, all current Directors, with the 
exception of Belinda Richards, will stand for election or re-
election (as applicable) at the 2018 Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’). Belinda has served on the Board for over six years and 
during her time has chaired the Audit, Risk and Remuneration 
Committees as well as being the Company’s Senior Independent 
Director. She has made a significant contribution to Grainger 
during a period of substantial change. Nick Jopling stepped 
down from the Board in September 2017 after seven years as  
our Property Director. Nick played a fundamental part in making 
Grainger the market leader in the PRS and helping create the 
strategy that the Company is now pursuing. My predecessor, 
Margaret Ford, retired from the Board in February 2017 following 
nine years of excellent service, with the last two as Chairman. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Belinda, Nick and 
Margaret for their significant contributions to the success of the 
Company and wish them well for the future.
Details of the Directors are set out on pages 46 and 47 , together 
with a summary of their experience and skills.
The Board reviews Non-Executive Director independence annually, 
and takes into account the individual’s professional characteristics, 
their behaviour at Board meetings, and their contribution to 
unbiased and independent debate. The Board agreed that  
I was independent on my appointment as Chairman. The Board 
considers all the Non-Executive Directors to be independent. 
Diversity
Grainger believes that a diverse perspective is key to success, 
and supports the aspiration of the Hampton Alexander Review 
to promote greater female representation on listed-company 
boards and achieve 33% female representation. Grainger has 
achieved in excess of this and will look to continue to follow 
the recommendations of the Review and the Code to maintain 
a balanced and diverse Board. 
Diversity is of course much wider than gender. The Board and 
Nominations Committee also have regard to the Parker Review 
on ethnic diversity. Diversity of thought is also hugely important 
to the Board. By bringing together Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors with diverse backgrounds and experience, we gain 
enormously from varied perspectives across a range of issues. 
The Nominations Committee report contains further details  
of diversity in our business. 
Board evaluation
This year the evaluation of Board effectiveness was externally 
facilitated, as it was three years since the previous external 
assessment. As a recently appointed Chairman, and with Justin 
Read joining as a new Non-Executive Director during the year, 
the evaluation process had a forward-looking focus. We provide 
further details on page 50. 
Shareholder engagement
The Board regards strong engagement with stakeholders and 
investors as fundamental to understanding their views. 
Helen Gordon and Vanessa Simms had regular meetings with the 
Company’s shareholders and analysts throughout the year and, 
in particular, held a successful Capital Markets Day in September 
2017 . I also met with our major shareholders as part of my 
induction process and have been clear that I am happy to engage 
with them should they wish to. We anticipate that we will engage 
with fund managers and corporate governance officers of our 
major shareholders before the AGM in February 2018. 
We provide further details of our shareholder engagement 
programme on pages 59 to 61. 
How the Board supports strategy
Building on the progress made previously, the Board spent 
a significant portion of its time this year reviewing the key 
elements of the implementation of the PRS strategy, such as 
the operating model, development pipeline, technology strategy, 
asset hierarchy and customer proposition. The Board feels it is 
important to engage with this process, and as the strategy is 
delivered there is appropriate time given to how it is adapted  
and extended as progress is made. We are planning to complete 
a full review in mid-2018 to ensure the discussion around strategy 
is kept current. In particular, we plan to spend time reviewing 
further opportunities to grow our PRS base over the coming 
years and consider the implementation of the technological and 
cultural changes required to implement our customer-focused 
PRS strategy. To learn more about our Board activity in 2017, 
please see page 48.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Information flow
The Chairman and the Company Secretary ensure the Directors 
receive clear, timely information on all relevant matters. 
We circulate Board papers well in advance of meetings to 
ensure there is adequate time for them to be read and to 
facilitate robust and informed discussion.
The papers contain the Chief Executive’s written report, high-
level reports on each business area, key figures and papers on 
specific agenda items. Also, minutes of the Executive Committee 
meetings and detailed financial and other supporting information 
are provided. The Board also received presentations throughout 
the year from various departments, including Human Resources, 
Legal, Investment, Corporate Finance and Health & Safety, and 
from external advisers on subjects including financing and 
business valuation.
Time commitment
The Board, supported by the Nominations Committee, carefully 
considered the external commitments of the Chairman and each 
of the Non-Executive Directors. The Board is satisfied that each 
Director committed enough time to be able to fulfil their duties, 
and has capacity to continue doing so. None of them has any 
conflict of interest not disclosed to the Board, in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association.
Access to independent advice
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who ensures we follow Board processes 
and maintain high corporate governance standards. Any 
Director who considers it appropriate may take independent, 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. None of the 
Directors did so in the current year.
Engagement with stakeholders
The Board acknowledges and understands that Grainger’s 
stakeholders may have different views and interests regarding 
the Company. It is therefore important we engage with each key 
stakeholder group to understand their views and priorities. The 
table below shows where you can find further detail in this report:
Stakeholder Page
Employees 31
Customers and communities 32–34
Shareholders 59–61
Induction and professional development
In accordance with the Code, Grainger’s policy is that the 
Chairman, supported by the Company Secretary, is responsible 
for ensuring that each Director receives a comprehensive and 
tailored induction. 
Case study: Mark Clare and Justin Read
As both Mark Clare and Justin Read were appointed at the same time, 
as Chairman and Non-Executive Director respectively, the Chief 
Executive and outgoing Chairman were involved in the induction 
and orientation process, to ensure a smooth and effective handover. 
Each new Director met the Company Secretary in the year to discuss 
their particular induction and training requirements. This covered 
matters such as Directors’ duties, corporate governance, share 
dealing and use of the Company’s electronic Board portal. Mark and 
Justin’s induction involved them visiting our London and Newcastle 
offices, and meeting Executive Directors and senior managers from 
across the investment, development, operational and central 
functions of the business. They both also met key third-party advisers 
such as the external auditor and brokers. In addition, they both visited 
a number of operational or ‘in development’ sites; so as well as the 
site visit to Manchester referred to on page 48, they also visited our 
properties at Berewood, Aldershot and Abbeville. Justin also visited 
PRS homes in Newcastle, Whitley Bay and Pimlico. 
As Chairman, Mark had an induction which emphasised shareholder 
engagement. He met a number of key shareholders to hear their 
views on Grainger, and to understand their expectations from the 
Company and from him as Chairman. Mark reported to the Board 
on this engagement process.
The Board is updated on a range of matters throughout the year. 
Subjects include the business of the Group, legal and regulatory 
responsibilities of the Company and changes to accounting 
requirements. This takes the form of presentations by Grainger 
senior management and external advisers, and in Board papers 
and briefing materials. We also expect individual Directors to 
identify their own training needs, and to ensure they are 
adequately informed about the Group and their responsibilities 
as a Director.
The Board is confident that all its members have the knowledge, 
ability and experience to perform the functions required of a 
Director of a listed company.

Effectiveness continued
Performance evaluation
Board Alchemy, an independent specialist consultancy, 
undertook the annual evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees for 2017. They performed a thorough independent 
review of the Board and its Committees. This included the 
completion of a detailed questionnaire, followed by individual 
meetings with each of the Directors and the Company Secretary. 
This process ensured that there was a complete follow-up to 
those matters highlighted in the questionnaire exercise. They 
also reviewed recent Board and Committee papers. Board 
Alchemy’s report concluded that the Board and its Committees 
were all operating effectively.
Key findings and recommendations are set out below.
The review of individual Director performance was outside of 
the scope of Board Alchemy’s work. The Chairman undertook 
this in one-to-one meetings with each Non-Executive Director. 
He also conducted a formal review of the Chief Executive’s 
performance. Notwithstanding that the Chairman has been in 
the role for a relatively short period, Belinda Richards, the Senior 
Independent Director, led a review of his performance, taking into 
account feedback from the Directors. This concluded that the 
Chairman’s leadership and performance were effective and of 
a high standard. 
The Board and its Committees will monitor progress and 
continue their critical review of its effectiveness during the 
year ahead. In accordance with the Code, we intend the next 
external evaluation of the Board to be carried out in 2020. 
Election and re-election of Directors
We continue to adopt the recommendations of the Code that all 
Directors offer themselves for re-election annually, even though 
the Company’s Articles of Association only require this every 
three years. Therefore all current Directors, with the exception  
of Mark Clare, Justin Read and Belinda Richards, will stand for 
re-election at the 2018 AGM. Belinda will be retiring from the 
Board having served for more than six years. As it will be Mark 
and Justin’s first AGM as Directors of the Company, they will be 
subject to election by the shareholders at the AGM.
In light of the performance evaluation, the Board recommends 
that all Directors proposed are so elected or re-elected 
(as applicable).

Key findings from the 2017 external Board evaluation
Findings
• The new Chairman has settled in well and established good working relationships with the Chief Executive and other Board members. 
• There are good Board dynamics and appropriate challenge. 
• The Board focuses on key matters and its work is supported by good-quality Board papers and management briefings. This was supported  
by the work of the Company Secretariat as well as the various Committees.
• Certain improvements were in progress at the time of the evaluation. These included:
 » greater customer focus being brought to Grainger’s strategy, recognising the business’s move to PRS;
 » the Board giving greater focus to succession planning; and
 » plans to give Non-Executive Directors greater exposure to a wider range of staff, and to bring greater external perspective to the Board.
Principal recommendations 
• Give greater consideration to the values and culture needed to support the PRS strategy.
• Take a more structured approach to Board development.
• Provide Board members with information updates between Board meetings.
• Carry out formal annual reviews of the effectiveness of Grainger’s Internal Audit function.
• When the opportunity arises, recruit a retail consumer experienced Non-Executive Director to complete the skill sets required.

The Nominations Committee currently comprises the Chairman 
of the Board and five independent Non-Executive Directors.
Dear shareholders,
I took over as Chairman of the Nominations Committee in 
February 2017 , after my appointment to the Board, and I am 
pleased to present my first report. The Nominations Committee 
plays a fundamental role in ensuring we select and recommend 
strong candidates for appointment to the Board. The Committee 
monitors the balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Board and its Committees, with any changes 
recommended to the Board for its review and decision. The 
Committee is also responsible for succession planning, and 
monitors talent development at senior management level. 2017 
was a particularly busy year for the Nominations Committee with 
significant change to the Board and its Committees. This report 
details the main activities we undertook during the year.
Key responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to:
• review the size, balance and constitution of the Board, 
including the diversity and balance of skills, knowledge  
and experience of the Non-Executive Directors;
• consider succession planning for Directors and other  
senior executives;
• identify and nominate, for the approval of the Board, 
candidates to fill Board vacancies;
• review annually the time commitment required of  
Non-Executive Directors; and
• make recommendations to the Board, in consultation with 
the respective Committee Chairmen, regarding membership 
of the three Board Committees.
Process for Board appointments
Before making an appointment, the Nominations Committee  
will evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
currently on the Board. Following this we will draft a specification 
of the personal attributes, experience and capabilities required to 
perform the relevant appointment effectively. In circumstances 
where external recruitment or benchmarking of an internal 
candidate is appropriate, we will engage an independent external 
search consultancy to help identify appropriate candidates for 
the role. We will then make recommendations to the Board 
concerning the appointment of any Director. The Committee 
also supports the Board in the appointment of the Company 
Secretary when required.

Effectiveness: Nominations Committee report continued
Main activities of the Committee during the year
The Committee met formally three times during the year  
to 30 September 2017, supplemented by other less formal 
meetings and discussions to support the work of the Committee. 
At the formal meetings the Committee considered a number of 
standing agenda items relating to its key responsibilities detailed 
above. In applying those responsibilities, the Committee made 
decisions on a range of matters during the year, the most 
significant of which are detailed below. We announced changes 
to the Board during the year in accordance with the Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules. These changes have now 
taken place or will take place by the time of the 2018 AGM, 
and for completeness are also included below.
Board changes
Chairman
Margaret Ford retired from the Board at the February 2017 AGM. 
As a result the Nominations Committee oversaw the selection  
of Mark Clare as Non-Executive Chairman with effect from the 
February 2017 AGM. In accordance with best practice, this was led 
by Belinda Richards as Senior Independent Director and supported 
by Non-Executive colleagues.
We appointed the Zygos Partnership, an independent executive 
search consultancy, as advisers and asked them to compile a long 
list of candidates. Zygos have worked previously with the Board 
on other appointments of Directors, and the Board confirms they 
are not connected with the Company in any other way. 
The Committee determined that the candidate brief was for 
a business leader in the property sector, with main Board 
experience and strong credentials in strategic leadership and 
driving business growth. We agreed a short list of four 
candidates. Each was interviewed by the Senior Independent 
Director and at least one other Non-Executive Director. The Chief 
Executive was also involved in the process. The Committee then 
discussed the candidates. The unanimous recommendation of 
the Committee to the Board following this meeting was that 
Mark Clare be appointed as Non-Executive Chairman effective 
from February 2017 .
Property Director
As previously announced and referred to on page 10, Grainger’s 
Property Director, Nick Jopling, left the Board in September 2017 . 
The Committee met to consider the Chief Executive’s proposal 
for restructuring her senior team to align it more closely with the 
agreed PRS strategy to ‘Originate, Invest and Operate’. The senior 
management team will include the Director of Investment, 
the Director of Development and the Chief Operating Officer. 
As a result the role of Property Director became redundant. 
The Committee supported this proposal and recommended to 
the Board that it be adopted. Nick will remain with the business 
until the end of 2017 to help ensure an orderly handover. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Committee reviewed the composition of the Board, including 
the range of skills, knowledge, level of experience and balance 
between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. We then 
agreed to search for an additional independent Non-Executive 
Director with public company, financial and real estate experience. 
We appointed Zygos as advisers and unanimously recommended 
to the Board that Justin Read join as an independent Non-
Executive Director, and Justin subsequently joined the Board 
in February 2017. 
Belinda Richards has served on the Board for over six years  
at the date of this report, and therefore will be stepping down 
from the Board at the February 2018 AGM. Consequently, 
Andrew Carr-Locke will be taking on the role of Senior 
Independent Director in addition to his role as Audit Committee 
Chairman and Justin Read will become Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Committee changes
During the year under review there have been a number of 
changes to the Committees of the Board. They are set out below: 
• As a result of Margaret Ford’s retirement as a Director,  
she also stepped down as Chairman of the Nominations 
Committee and as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee. The Directors considered it in the interests of the 
Company, and in accordance with market practice, to appoint 
Mark Clare as Chairman of the Nominations Committee and 
as a member of the Remuneration Committee in addition to 
his position as Chairman of the Board.
• Membership of the various Board Committees was reviewed, 
looking at the balance of skills, knowledge and experience, 
and the relative size of the Board. We subsequently decided 
it was in the best interests of the Company and the 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees to adopt a 
policy whereby all Non-Executive Directors are members 
of each of the Committees. Thus, we made the following 
appointments:
 » Rob Wilkinson joined the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees as a member.
 » Justin Read was appointed as a member of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
52 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Diversity
The Directors are committed to having a balanced Board 
which includes diversity of perspectives, skills, knowledge and 
background. For gender diversity specifically, the Board supports 
the aspiration of the Hampton Alexander Review to promote 
greater female representation on listed company boards, and 
notes the significant progress made in this area in FTSE 350 
companies since the original Lord Davies report of 2010. We 
make all appointments to the Grainger Board on merit, and 
within this context the Directors will continue to follow best 
practice and the issue of diversity as it develops further. At the 
date of this report, female representation at Board level was 
38%. This is above the 33% level recommended by the Hampton 
Alexander Review and the objective for the Board is to maintain 
at least one-third of the Board being female Directors. 
Page 33 contains details of the gender ratio of all Grainger staff.
The Board is also mindful of the Parker Review regarding ethnic 
diversity on UK boards that was published during the year. The 
Review recommends that each FTSE 250 board should have at 
least one director of colour by 2024. The Committee will work 
with the Board with a view to adopting this recommendation. 
Balance of knowledge, skills and experience
The Directors have wide-ranging experience as senior business 
people. The Board has particular expertise in finance, property 
and the listed company environment. Following the external 
Board evaluation process conducted during the year, we have 
agreed that we will look to add retail consumer-facing skills  
to the Board when the opportunity arises, recognising the 
changing nature of Grainger’s business as it delivers its PRS-
focused strategy.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance
Accountability: Audit Committee report
The Audit Committee currently comprises five independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
Dear shareholders,
This is my second year of chairing Grainger’s Audit Committee, 
and I am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the 
year ended 30 September 2017 . During the year, the Committee 
has continued to carry out a key role within the Company’s 
governance framework, supporting the Board in risk management, 
internal control and financial reporting. This report provides an 
overview of the significant issues the Committee considered, and 
its assessment of the Annual Report and Accounts as a whole, 
including how we have reviewed the narrative reporting to ensure 
it accurately reflects the financial statements. 
There is substantial change occurring in Grainger. Implementing 
the PRS strategy has meant introducing new processes and 
refining existing systems. Therefore, the Committee has focused 
on assessing the risks and controls regarding these changes. 
We have also carefully considered the risk management 
framework to assess its continued relevance for a PRS-focused 
business undergoing the implementation of its strategy. We 
have also supported the Board in considering the principal risks 
and appetite of the Company. We provide details of the risk 
management framework, principal risks and key mitigants 
on pages 36 to 40.
As a matter of course, the Committee considers its terms of 
reference each year, taking into account changes to Grainger 
and to external governance requirements. In addition, we develop 
a clear work plan through the year to ensure we fulfil all our 
responsibilities. At the heart of those responsibilities is ensuring 
that the Company operates an effective risk assessment and 
management process, and has an appropriate control framework 
in place. We are helped by the Internal Audit team at Deloitte, 
which reports directly to us, and which works to an agreed plan 
to ensure controls are effective.
One of the Committee’s other key responsibilities is ensuring 
the Group’s published accounts are true and consistent with 
accounting and governance requirements. In achieving this we 
have considered the viability statement closely, having regard to 
the progress of the implementation of the PRS strategy and the 
overall strategic horizon. This included interrogating the financial 
models and related sensitivity analyses of various economic 
scenarios. In addition, we have concentrated on the fair, balanced 
and understandable requirements for the Annual Report. In this 
regard, we are helped by receiving a number of appropriate 
papers from the Chief Financial Officer and her team, and by 
the independent work of our internal and external auditors.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 In addition to our planned work programme, we respond to key 
matters arising during the year as required. An example of this 
during the year was to consider closely the appropriate accounting 
treatment of our development partnerships with the Royal 
Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (‘RBKC’), and the changes  
to the contractual arrangements that occurred in summer 2017 . 
We also supported the Board in its 2016 review of the Group’s 
key performance indicators. Being aware of the developing 
practice for assessing and reporting alternative performance 
measures, we plan to carry out a further review in 2018. 
As part of the FRC’s work programme, we received a report on 
the quality of the Big 4 audit firms, including Grainger’s external 
auditor, KPMG. We discussed the findings of the report with 
KPMG and what it has done to implement the recommendations. 
We found this independent review constructive, and it will help  
in our annual evaluation of external auditor effectiveness. 
I believe the regular challenge and engagement with 
management, the external auditor and the internal audit team, 
together with the timely receipt of high-quality reports and 
information from them, has enabled the Committee to 
discharge its duties and responsibilities efficiently.
I would like to record my thanks for the support of the other 
members of the Committee, to Grainger’s Finance and Legal 
teams, to Deloitte, and to KPMG for its thorough approach.
Andrew Carr-Locke
Chairman of the Audit Committee
30 November 2017
Significant matters relating to the Group’s 2017 financial statements
The most significant matters considered by the Committee and discussed with the external auditor in relation to the Group’s 2017 
financial statements were as follows:
1
 Property valuations
We received reports from management on the assumptions to be used in valuing the Group’s property assets, the suggested 
discount rates for reversionary assets and the valuations. We considered the proposed process changes to the valuation of the 
reversionary portfolio, which involved increasing the level of external review and a reduction in tolerance differential between 
external and internal valuations. We also considered that the external valuers were sufficiently independent and report directly 
to the Committee. We were content, after close scrutiny and debate, with the change in valuation approach, and the assumptions 
and judgements applied to the valuations.
The results of the valuations form the basis of management’s assessment to support the carrying value of investments in 
subsidiary companies by the parent company. 
2
 Fraud risk from revenue recognition and management override of controls
In respect of the presumed risk of fraud in revenue recognition by overstatement and management override of controls, 
the Committee considered the presumed risk of fraud as defined by auditing standards, and was content that there were no 
issues arising. During the year, the Committee considered the accounting implications in respect of the Group’s contractual 
arrangements with the RBKC, along with the treatment of significant land sales.

Accountability: Audit Committee report continued
Fair, balanced and understandable 
The Committee has undertaken a detailed review in assessing 
whether the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced 
and understandable, and whether it provides the necessary 
information to shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. The Committee reviewed and made 
suggestions about the processes put in place by management 
to provide the necessary assurance that they have made the 
appropriate disclosures. The Committee considered 
management’s assessment of items included in the financial 
statements and the prominence given to those items. This review 
also included receiving a near final draft of the Annual Report 
in advance of the November 2017 Committee meeting. This 
was accompanied by a reminder of the areas the Committee 
should focus on having regard to the Audit Committee Institute 
guidance, and how it can be applied to the draft Annual Report. 
The Committee, and subsequently the Board, were satisfied that, 
taken as a whole, the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable. 
Going concern
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of adopting  
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the full  
year financial statements and assessed whether the business  
was viable in accordance with the requirements of the Code.  
The assessment included a review of the principal risks facing  
the Group, their financial impact and how they were managed, 
together with a discussion as to the appropriate period for 
assessment. The Group’s viability statement is on page 41.
Invitations to attend meetings
There is a standing invitation to the Chairman of the Board 
and the Executive Directors, who in turn attended all of the 
Committee’s meetings during the year. The Group Financial 
Controller and representatives of the internal and external 
auditors also attended all meetings of the Committee, and both 
sets of auditors met privately with the Committee during the year.
Role, responsibilities and experience
The Committee’s role and responsibilities are concerned 
with financial reporting, narrative reporting, whistleblowing 
and fraud, internal control and risk management systems, 
internal audit and external audit. 
Andrew Carr-Locke, Belinda Richards, Rob Wilkinson and Justin 
Read have recent and relevant financial experience as required 
by the Code. The Committee as a whole has the competence 
relevant to the sector in which it operates. Please refer to pages 
46 and 47 for skills and experience of the Directors and pages  
51 to 53 for the Nominations Committee report. 
Terms of reference 
The Committee’s terms of reference are approved by the Board. 
We review them at least annually and last reviewed them at the 
Committee’s meeting in February 2017. The Committee’s terms 
of reference comply with the Code. They can be found on the 
Group’s website.
Objectives 
The Board has delegated authority to the Committee to oversee 
and review the Group’s financial reporting process, system of 
internal control and management of business risks, the internal 
audit process, the external audit process and relationship with 
the external auditor, and the Company’s process for monitoring 
compliance with applicable laws and external regulations. For the 
statutory audit, the Committee provides the Board with a report 
on the outcome and the Committee’s role. Final responsibility for 
financial reporting, compliance with laws and regulations and risk 
management rests with the Board, to which the Committee 
reports regularly.
Meetings
The Committee’s main work follows a structured programme of 
activity agreed at the start of the year between the Committee 
Chairman, management and the external auditor. As well as its 
main work, the Committee undertakes additional work in 
response to the evolving audit landscape. The following non-
exhaustive list provides highlights of the Committee’s work 
during the year under review.

External auditor objectivity and independence
The objectivity and independence of the external auditor are 
critical to the integrity of the Group’s audit. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed the external auditor’s own policies and 
procedures for safeguarding its objectivity and independence. 
There are no contractual restrictions on the Group appointing  
an external auditor. The audit engagement partner provided  
his annual representation to the Committee as to the external 
auditor’s independence, and confirmed that KPMG’s reward  
and remuneration structure includes no incentives for him to 
cross-sell non-audit services to audit clients. KPMG duly applies 
the requirement to rotate audit partners every five years, and  
this rotation will be due for the 2020 audit.
The Committee’s assessment of KPMG’s independence is 
underpinned by the Group’s policy on not using the external 
auditor for non-audit services, which we applied during the year. 
We may disapply the policy and engage KPMG for non-audit 
services only if those services are permitted and where we can 
demonstrate they are best suited to undertake those services. 
The Audit Committee Chairman must also approve this. 
Services the external auditor is prohibited from providing to 
the Group include, amongst others:
• bookkeeping and preparing financial information;
• the design, supply or implementation of financial 
information systems;

1 Commissioned in July 2014, prior to KPMG’s appointment as external auditor.
2 Commissioned in May 2016. 
In addition, a further £8,200 for audit services was billed by 
KPMG to Walworth Investment Properties Limited, the joint 
venture in which Grainger has a 50% shareholding.
The Committee was satisfied that the overall levels of audit 
related and non-audit fees were not material relative to the 
income of the external auditor firm as a whole. It was satisfied 
that the external auditor maintained objectivity and 
independence throughout the year. 
External auditor tenure
The Company confirms that it has complied with the Competition 
and Markets Authority’s Order for the year. Due to the relatively 
recent appointment of KPMG in 2015, the Committee was 
satisfied that it was not optimal to tender external audit services 
in the current year. The Committee noted that a competitive 
tender for the external auditor must be held no later than 2025.
The Committee monitors the performance of the external 
auditor, providing an in-depth evaluation of its performance 
following the external audit, and then makes a recommendation 
to the Board. When considering the appropriateness of the 
re-appointment of KPMG, we considered our review, the ratio 
of audit to non-audit fees and the effectiveness of the audit 
process, together with other relevant review processes. 
We also considered the findings of the FRC Audit Quality 
Review of the Big 4 audit firms. We were satisfied that we 
should recommend the re-appointment of KPMG. 
Internal controls
The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, is responsible for 
reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls. This internal control system is designed to manage risks 
as far as possible, acknowledging that no system can eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives entirely. The Board 
did not identify any significant failings or weaknesses in the year.
The Board is also responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
systems are in place to enable it to identify, assess and manage 
key risks. The preparation of financial statements and the wider 
financial reporting process and control system are monitored by 
the adoption of an internal control framework to address principal 
financial reporting risks. This includes risks emerging as a result  
of changes to the business or accounting standards. The 
effectiveness of the controls is evaluated by a combination of 
review by the Grainger Finance team, and the internal and 
external auditors. 
A key project in the year was the review of the business’s core 
operational processes and the development of RACMs for each 
process. This involved Deloitte providing training to staff on the 
preparation of effective RACMs, carrying out a review of the 
matrices and reporting to the Committee.
Internal Audit 
Deloitte is appointed by the Company as Internal Auditor. Internal 
Audit focuses on the areas of greatest risk to the Company.  
Audits are identified during an annual audit planning cycle. This  
is informed by the results of current and previous audit testing, 
the Company’s strategy, performance and the risk management 
process. Additional audits may be identified during the year in 
response to changing priorities and requirements. The Committee 
approves the plan and monitors progress accordingly. All Internal 
Audit findings are graded, appropriate remedial actions agreed, 
and progress monitored and reported to the Committee.
Internal Audit has a direct reporting line to the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee. We assess the effectiveness of Internal 
Audit by reviewing its reports, feedback from the Chief Financial 
Officer, and through meetings with the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee without management being present.
The Internal Audit programme for 2017 gave attention to the 
Group’s core operational processes and the risk and controls 
in that regard. The plan for 2018 and thereafter has been 
designed to align with the implementation programme for the 
new strategy. This approach will focus on providing assurance, 
process improvement and insights for Grainger’s core processes, 
complemented by an appropriate number of targeted risk 
reviews on principal risks or areas of management concern.

Q
    The market 
What is the competitive landscape  
in the UK PRS like at the moment?
A  
Demand for renting continues to outstrip supply. 
There has been an increase in interest in the UK PRS among institutional investors. 
However, it is estimated that the PRS will grow from 4.5m by a further 1.8m 
households by 2025, and the current supply of new purpose built PRS stock is less 
than 100,000 units. 
We currently have 4,789 operational PRS units, with a pipeline of a further 5,000 
units, positioning us as one of the largest players in the market. We have 
demonstrated our ability to deliver on our strategy through the success in our 
secured pipeline of £651m.
Q
    Looking ahead 
Do you have ambitions to grow beyond 
the initial £850m investment target?
A  
Our ambition is to grow beyond the £850m target and the market opportunity is 
substantial. The natural wind down of our regulated tenancy portfolio is expected 
to generate at least £100m per annum of proceeds over the next few years, which 
can support further growth, as will other funding options, including active asset 
recycling.
Q
    Operational potential and costs 
Can your operational platform 
support growth beyond the initial 
investment plan, and can you 
maintain relative overheads?
A  
We have designed our business model and operating platform to enable scalability 
and support significant future growth without the need to significantly increase our 
central overhead cost base.
Q
    Transformation of the income statement 
How will the investment of £850m into 
PRS assets transform your returns profile?
A  
Our strategy is to transform Grainger into a business that generates superior total 
returns from UK rental homes, with an increasing contribution from income through 
investing in higher-yielding assets. Our £850m investment plan is projected to more 
than double our net rental income since we embarked on our new strategy to £75m 
once our investment pipeline is completed and stabilised.
Q
    Capital structure 
Is there scope for further reductions 
in your cost of debt, and lengthening 
your average maturity even more?
A  
We have reduced our cost of debt by 190bps to 3.4% since setting out our new strategy 
(FY15: 5.3% average). 
PRS assets are well aligned to longer-term funding and this is likely to be an 
increasing feature for Grainger as our PRS schemes are developed out. Our new, 
£75m facility for some of our PRS assets with Rothesay Life at a fixed rate for a 
ten-year term demonstrates this future potential. In addition, our current headroom 
is accessible at a marginal rate of below 2%. 
Our £275m corporate bond with a 5% coupon matures in 2020, and could provide an 
opportunity for further improvement. 
Frequently asked questions
60
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Board believes that understanding the views of its 
shareholders is a fundamental principle of good corporate 
governance. Strong engagement with stakeholders and 
investors is key to achieving this.
Investor relations are based on the financial reporting calendar, 
with additional engagement when considered beneficial to 
the Company. We have held more than 125 meetings with 
shareholders, analysts and potential investors in the year, in 
addition to the usual half yearly results announcements and 
briefings. Helen Gordon and Vanessa Simms held the vast 
majority of these meetings, and manage the Group’s investor 
relations programme with the Director of Corporate Affairs. 
We always seek feedback at these meetings and present it to 
the Board. In addition, the Company Secretary engaged with 
a combination of fund managers and corporate governance 
officers of the Company’s major shareholders before the 2017 
AGM. We anticipate a similar pre-AGM engagement process 
will take place in 2018. 
Attendance at key investor meetings

The Group’s website includes a comprehensive investor relations 
section, containing all RNS announcements, share price 
information, annual documents available for download and 
similar materials. All the Directors standing for election or 
re-election (as applicable) intend to attend the 2018 AGM and 
be available to answer questions. All shareholders can attend 
the AGM, which is a means of communication with smaller 
and private shareholders.
We send out the notice of meeting and Annual Report and 
Accounts at least 20 working days before the meeting. We hold 
separate votes for each proposed resolution. A proxy count is 
given in each case after the voting on a show of hands. Grainger 
includes, as standard, a ‘vote withheld’ category, in line with 
best practice. Shareholders can also lodge their votes through 
the CREST system.
Having regard to environmental considerations, the 2018 AGM 
will be the final year in which we issue hard copy proxy voting 
cards by post. Thereafter, we will move towards using online 
proxy forms.

Dear shareholders,
This is my third and final year as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, prior to my retirement as a Director in February 
2018. I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, the 2017 
Directors’ Remuneration report.
What is in this report?
This Directors’ Remuneration report sets out a summary of  
the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 8 February  
2017 . It took effect on that date and will apply for three years. 
You can find a full copy of the policy in the 2016 Annual Report  
or on our website. 
This statement and report will be subject to an advisory vote at 
the AGM on 7 February 2018. 
This report also discloses the amounts paid to our Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors for the year ended 30 September 2017 . 
The report complies with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013. We have prepared it in line with the recommendations of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and the requirements of the 
UKLA Listing Rules. 
Aligning remuneration with strategy
A number of refinements were made to our previous 
Remuneration Policy to improve alignment with our long-term 
PRS-focused strategy and overriding objective of creating 
returns for our shareholders. Over 98% of our shareholders 
approved the revised Remuneration Policy at the 2017 AGM. 
The policy refinements included simplifying the number of 
incentive schemes we operated, and placing a greater weighting 
on our long-term performance, which is more aligned to the 
long-term nature of our business. We achieve this longer-term 
weighting through the part deferral of annual bonus into shares, 
operating a share-based Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)  
with a two-year holding period on vested shares, and a 200%  
of salary share ownership guideline. Furthermore, the refined 
performance measures we targeted for improvement in the 2017 
financial year (including adjusted earnings, return on shareholder 
equity (‘ROSE’), total property return (‘TPR’) and relative total 
shareholder return (‘TSR’)), are also fully aligned with supporting 
our PRS-focused strategy, targeting a clear balance between 
income growth and long-term shareholder returns. As a result, 
we will retain these measures in our incentives in 2018.
2017 performance and reward
Under our refined policy, the majority of the annual bonus in 2017 
was subject to a combination of ROSE and adjusted earnings 
targets. These measures combined to ensure Executive Directors 
focused on improving profit from their day-to-day activities, at 
the same time as maximising the value of Grainger’s underlying 
assets. In addition, we based a minority of the bonus opportunity 
on how well each of our Executive Directors performed on an 
individual scorecard of key performance measures.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 With regard to the performance during the year, we achieved 
adjusted earnings of £74.4m and ROSE of 7.3%. The performance 
against adjusted earnings was £7 .8m ahead of the target set  
for the year of £66.6m, and ROSE was in the lower half of the 
5%–15% performance range. When we combined these figures 
with the individual strategic targets, annual bonuses ranged from 
55% to 63% of the maximum available. Full disclosure of the 
actual targets set, and performance towards those targets,  
is on pages 69 to 71. 
With our LTIP, the 2014 awards will vest in December 2017.  
The performance targets for this award related to EPRA NNNAV 
(50% of award) and absolute TSR. For the performance period 
ended 30 September 2017, EPRA NNNAV has increased by 25.2% 
against the 15.9% increase in the Halifax and Nationwide House 
Price indices. This will result in 6% vesting of this part of the 
award. TSR is forecast to show an annual compound increase  
of approximately 14% over the three-year performance period 
(ending 16 December 2017). If this level of TSR is maintained for 
the period, it will result in 90% of this part of the award vesting.
In light of the strong performance achieved over the relevant 
performance periods, the Committee is comfortable, overall, with 
the level of variable pay earned and the forecast for the 2014 LTIP . 
Board changes 
It was announced on 30 August 2017 that Nick Jopling would be 
leaving Grainger by reason of redundancy. His redundancy forms 
part of a Group-wide restructuring undertaken over the past 18 
months to better align our structure with achieving our strategy. 
Nick stepped down from the Board on 29 September 2017 and, 
following an orderly handover, his employment will terminate on 
31 December 2017 (the date his role is made redundant). His role 
will not be replaced. 
In line with the terms of his service agreement, Nick will receive 
a payment in lieu of his six-month notice period following the 
termination of his employment. He will also be treated as a good 
leaver for the purposes of annual bonus and LTIPs, with the 
relevant performance conditions continuing to apply over the  
full performance periods. Incentives will be reduced, pro-rata, 
where his employment ceases part way through the relevant 
performance or vesting period as appropriate. Further details 
relating to his redundancy and termination arrangements are  
set out in detail on page 72.
Implementing the policy for 2018
Pursuant to the strategic focus on management of overheads, 
there was no increase to the base salaries in respect of the 
Executive Directors during the 2016/17 pay review process.  
For the 2017 /18 period, the base salaries of the Executive  
Directors will be increased with effect from 1 January 2018, in line 
with the typical increase given to the wider employee population. 
See page 76 for more details.
Since the revised Remuneration Policy implemented in 2017 is 
working well, we are to retain the same structure and 
performance measures for 2018.
Directors will continue to earn the annual bonus based on 
performing to a combination of challenging ROSE and adjusted 
earnings targets, with a small but significant proportion of the total 
bonus opportunity reserved for achieving tailored strategic 
personal objectives. One-quarter of any bonus earned will 
continue to be subject to deferral into the Company’s shares, 
to provide a link between attaining short-term objectives 
and longer-term performance. In addition, strict recovery and 
withholding provisions will continue to apply to any bonus 
earned in relation to 2018.
For the LTIP, the three-year performance targets will again relate 
to an equal combination of TPR and relative TSR compared to 
our sector peers. As with the annual bonus, strict recovery and 
withholding provisions apply, along with a two-year holding 
period on any shares that vest.
For 2018, our general approach to target setting in respect of 
adjusted earnings and strategic targets will remain consistent 
with the approach taken in 2017 . In relation to ROSE, we have 
taken the opportunity to recalibrate the performance range  
to take appropriate account of the current strategic focus on 
developing PRS accommodation and also having due regard  
to the wider macro-economic outlook which includes lower 
forecast house price inflation (‘HPI’). Full details of the 2018 
bonus structure are included on page 76 and the Committee  
is comfortable that the degree of stretch in the overall bonus  
is no less challenging than the structure in place for 2017 ,  
giving appropriate allowance for current circumstances.
The choice of metrics, and balance between short and long-term 
performance, are fully aligned with our PRS-led strategy and 
overall objective of maximising suitable shareholder returns. In 
line with best practice, the Committee also retains the discretion 
to override incentive plans’ formulaic outcomes if it considers 
there to be an inconsistency between performance and reward. 
In addition, I would highlight that we have implemented the 
new Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) share scheme rules approved by 
shareholders at the last AGM, and continue to operate them 
in line with the principle of broad employee share ownership. 
Grainger regularly encourages employees to become owners 
in the Company, by providing frequent awareness sessions and 
assistance in joining available share schemes.
Shareholder engagement
The Committee is committed to maintaining an ongoing dialogue 
with shareholders and other stakeholders on the issue of executive 
remuneration, and we welcome any feedback you may have. 
We look forward to your support on the resolution relating to 
remuneration at the AGM on 7 February 2018.

Remuneration Policy Summary
Overview of the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Our Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 8 February 2017 and it is intended 
to apply for the full three-year period permitted by the applicable regulatory regime. You can find the full policy on our website. 
Below is a summary of the policy. Details of the remuneration arrangements for the Non-Executive Directors are on page 77 . 
Base salary
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To enable the recruitment and retention of individuals of the calibre necessary to execute the Company’s  
business strategy.
Operation Reviewed annually and effective from 1 January. Decision influenced by:
• role, experience and personal performance;
• average change in total workforce salary;
• total organisational salary budgets; and 
• Company performance and other economic conditions. 
Salaries are benchmarked periodically to companies of a similar size and complexity.
Opportunity Salaries will be eligible for increases during the three-year operational period, in line with percentage increases 
granted to the wider workforce. 
Increases beyond these may be awarded in certain circumstances, such as a change in responsibility or experience,  
or a significant increase in the scale of the role, or size, value or complexity of the Group. 
Where new joiners or recent promotions have been placed initially on pay below market rate, a series of percentage 
increases above those granted to the wider workforce may be considered, subject to individual performance and 
development in the role.
Framework to assess 
performance
The Committee considers individual salaries at the appropriate meeting each year, after considering the factors  
noted in operating the salary policy.
Benefits
Purpose and 
 link to strategy
To aid recruitment and retention of high-quality executives. 
Operation Car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance, ill health income protection, travel insurance, health 
check-ups. Other ancillary benefits, including relocation expenses, as required.
Opportunity The value of benefits may vary from year to year depending on the cost from providers.
Pension
Purpose and  
link to strategy
To aid recruitment and retention of high-quality executives and enable long-term savings through pension provision.
Operation The Company may contribute directly into an occupational pension scheme (an Executive Director’s personal pension) 
or pay a salary supplement in lieu of pension. If appropriate, a salary sacrifice arrangement can apply.
Opportunity The pension contribution or allowance is based on 15% of basic salary. 
64
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Annual bonus
Purpose and  
link to strategy
To incentivise achievement of annual targets.
Operation Compulsory deferral of 25% of any bonus paid into shares for three years, with the balance of the bonus paid in cash. 
Deferred shares typically vest after three years and are normally subject to continued employment.
Dividend-equivalent payments may be made in cash or shares, on deferred shares at the time of vesting, and may 
assume the reinvestment of dividends. Bonus will be predominantly based on demanding financial targets (for 
example, ROSE and adjusted earnings) and a minority of other performance targets (for example, strategic targets).
Opportunity Maximum bonus potential is capped at: 
• 140% of salary for the Chief Executive; and
• 120% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
Framework to assess 
performance
Details of the performance measures used for the current year, and targets set for the year under review and 
performance against them, are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Malus and clawback provisions apply, and withholding provisions may apply for three years from the date  
of payment of any bonus.
Long-term incentive plans
Purpose and  
link to strategy
To incentivise sustained performance over the longer term. 
To encourage greater shareholder alignment through personal investment in the Company’s shares.
Operation Long-term incentive plans are provided under the 2007 LTIP and the 2017 LTIP (collectively referred to as ‘LTIP’).  
LTIP provides for awarding share options (i.e. either conditional shares or nil-cost options), normally made annually, 
which are eligible to vest after three years, subject to continued service and the achievement of demanding 
performance conditions.
Shares are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period for awards granted under the 2017 LTIP. Dividend-
equivalent payments may be made (in cash or shares) on LTIP shares at the time of vesting on vested shares, and  
may assume the reinvestment of dividends.
Opportunity Annual awards are capped at:
• 175% of salary for the Chief Executive; and
• 130% of basic salary for the other Executive Directors.
The Committee may grant awards at up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances (e.g. recruitment to 
compensate for value forfeited from a previous employer).
Framework to assess 
performance
Granted subject to a blend of demanding financial (for example, TPR) and TSR performance targets, tested over  
three years.
25% of awards will vest for threshold performance, with full vesting taking place for equalling, or exceeding, 
the maximum performance targets. No awards vest for performance below threshold. A graduated vesting 
scale operates between threshold and maximum performance levels. Malus and clawback provisions apply.

Remuneration Policy Summary continued
Shareholding guidelines
The Executive Directors are expected to build up a shareholding 
of equivalent value to 200% of their base salary. As a minimum, 
half the after-tax number of vested LTIP shares granted from 
2017 must be retained towards satisfaction of this guideline, 
which is expected to be met within five years of its introduction 
(subject to personal circumstances).
How the Executive Directors’ Remuneration  
Policy relates to the wider Group
As the Executive Directors have the greater potential to influence 
overall Group performance, their Remuneration Policy is more 
heavily weighted towards variable pay than that for other 
employees. The Committee considers any general basic 
salary increase for the broader Company when determining 
the annual salary review for the Executive Directors. 
How the views of employees and shareholders  
are taken into account
The HR Director attends and reports to the Remuneration 
Committee regularly and in doing so takes into consideration  
and reports on the employees’ views collected via staff-wide 
surveys and other cascade/feedback sessions. This process will be 
reviewed once the current FRC consultation into Remuneration 
Committee engagement with the wider workforce is complete. 
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback 
received from the AGM, along with guidance from shareholder 
representative bodies and any feedback received during 
meetings with shareholders, as part of its ongoing review  
of remuneration policy. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration 
When setting the remuneration package for a new Executive 
Director, the Committee will apply the principles in the 
Remuneration Policy. 
For appointments from outside the Company, the Remuneration 
Committee may offer compensation that it considers appropriate 
and reasonable for awards and benefits forfeited from a previous 
position. This would reflect the performance requirements, 
timing and other specific matters the Committee considers 
relevant, and could be in cash or share awards. The policy is that 
the maximum payment under any such arrangements (which 
may be in addition to the normal variable remuneration) should 
be no more than the Committee considers is required to provide 
reasonable compensation to the incoming Executive Director.
In the case of an employee who is promoted to the position  
of Executive Director, it is the Company’s policy to honour  
the terms of existing award commitments.
Directors’ service contracts and provision  
on payment for loss of office
The Company can terminate Executive Directors’ service 
contracts with up to one year’s notice, and the Director 
can terminate it with at least six months’ notice. 
If an Executive Director’s employment is to be terminated,  
and in the absence of a breach of the service agreement by  
the Executive Director, the Committee’s policy is to agree a 
termination payment based on the base salary and contractual 
pension amounts and benefits that would have accrued during 
the notice period. The departing Executive Director may work,  
or be placed on leave, for all or part of their notice period, or 
receive a payment in lieu of notice in accordance with the service 
agreement. Depending on the circumstances, the Committee 
may also apply the principle of mitigation, to reduce any 
termination payment.
In addition, the Committee may also make payments in relation 
to any statutory entitlements, to settle any claim against the 
Company (e.g. in relation to breach of statutory employment 
rights or wrongful dismissal) or make a modest provision in 
respect of legal costs or outplacement fees.
The Company has an enhanced redundancy policy allowing 
redundancy amounts to be calculated by reference to actual 
basic weekly salary, and the policy may be extended to 
Executive Directors where relevant.
Savings related share schemes
Purpose and  
link to strategy
To encourage employees to make a long-term investment in the Company’s shares.
Operation All employees, including the Executive Directors, are eligible to participate on the same terms in the Company’s SAYE 
scheme and Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’), both of which are approved by HMRC and subject to the limits prescribed. 
Opportunity SAYE: Participants may invest up to £500 a month (or other amount permitted by HMRC from time to time) for three 
or five-year periods, in order to purchase shares at the end of the contractual period at a discount of up to 20% to the 
market price of the shares at the commencement of the saving period. 
SIP: Participants can invest up to £150 a month (or other amount permitted by HMRC from time to time) in shares in 
the Company, and the Company matches that investment. The Company may also allocate free shares annually on  
a percentage of basic pay, subject to a maximum of £3,600 (or other amount permitted by HMRC from time to time). 
Dividend payments on SIP shares are reinvested into shares.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 With regard to annual bonus for a departing Executive Director,  
if employment ends due to redundancy, retirement with the 
agreement of the Company, ill health, disability or death, or any 
other reason as determined by the Committee (i.e. the individual 
is a good leaver), the Executive Director may be considered for  
a bonus payment. If the termination is for any other reason,  
any entitlement to bonus would normally lapse. Under any 
circumstance, it is the Committee’s policy to ensure any bonus 
payment reflects the departing Executive Director’s performance 
and behaviour towards the Company.
Any bonus payment will normally be delayed until the 
performance conditions have been determined for the relevant 
period, and be subject to a pro-rata reduction for the portion  
of the relevant bonus year the individual was employed. 
Share-based incentives granted to an Executive Director will be 
based on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment will be 
for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment.  
For awards granted under the Company’s LTIPs, in certain 
prescribed circumstances, such as injury or disability, redundancy, 
transfer or sale of the employing company, retirement with the 
Company’s agreement or other circumstances at the discretion of 
the Committee (reflecting the circumstances that prevail at the 
time), good leaver status may be applied. 
If treated as a good leaver, awards will be eligible to vest subject 
to performance conditions, which will be measured over the 
original performance period (unless the Committee elects  
to test performance to the date of cessation of employment), 
and be subject to a pro-rata reduction (unless the Committee 
considered it inappropriate) to reflect the proportion of the 
vesting period actually served. 
With regard to the deferral of annual bonus, deferred share 
bonus awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment 
other than where an Executive Director is a good leaver, 
with awards then vesting on the normal vesting date. It is the 
Company’s policy to honour pre-existing award commitments.
Where the Executive Director participates in one or more of 
the Company’s HMRC-approved share plans, awards may vest 
or be exercisable on, or following, termination of employment 
in certain good leaver circumstances, where permissible, in 
accordance with the rules of the plan and relevant legislation.
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to accept external non-
executive appointments with the prior approval of the Board.  
It is normal practice for Executive Directors to retain fees 
provided for non-executive appointments.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The policy on Non-Executive Directors’ fees is set out below:
Non-Executive Directors
Purpose and 
link to strategy
To provide a competitive fee which will attract high-calibre individuals who, through their experience, can further the 
interests of the Group. 
Operation The fees for Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) are typically reviewed every second year, or more 
frequently if required.
Fee levels are set by expected time commitment and responsibility, and are benchmarked with relevant market roles 
as appropriate and reflecting the size and nature of the role. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive an annual fee paid in cash. They do not participate in any of the 
Company’s incentive arrangements or receive any pension provision. 
The Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee, with additional fees for chairing the Company’s key 
committees or for performing the Senior Independent Director role. 
Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for travel and related business expenses reasonably incurred in performing 
their duties. 
The Committee (without the Chairman) determines the Chairman’s fee and recommends it to the Board. The 
Chairman and Executive Directors determine the Non-Executive Directors’ fees.
Opportunity Fee levels can be increased to ensure they continue to recognise the time commitment of the role, fee levels 
for Non-Executive Directors in general, and fee levels in companies of a similar size and complexity.
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have letters of 
appointment for an initial fixed term of three years, subject to 
earlier termination by either party on written notice. In each case, 
this term can be extended by mutual agreement. Non-Executive 
Directors have no entitlement to contractual termination payments. 
The dates of the initial appointments of the Non-Executive 
Directors are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

1 There was no salary increase awarded during the year under review with Helen Gordon’s base salary remaining at £460,000 with effect from 3 November 2015 and 
Vanessa Simms’ base salary remaining at £320,000 with effect from 4 February 2016. The values included in the 2016 single figure table reflect Helen Gordon’s and 
Vanessa Simms’ salaries paid for part of the financial year that they were employed. Nick Jopling’s base salary during the year under review was £356,842 with 
effect from 1 January 2016. 
2 Taxable benefits include a car allowance and private medical insurance.
3 In light of Nick Jopling’s role being made redundant, the Remuneration Committee determined he would be a good leaver for incentive plan purposes. Since he was 
in active employment for the full 2017 financial year, his bonus was not subject to any time pro-rating for 2017 and, in line with the 2017 Remuneration Policy, 25% 
of the bonus is deferred into shares for three years. 
4 In line with the requirements of the Remuneration Reporting Regulations, the 2017 LTIP vesting values are based on the forecast value of the awards due to vest 
on 16 December 2017 (50% of the award is based on EPRA NNNAV performance measured over the three years to 30 September 2017, and 50% of the award is 
based on absolute TSR measured over the three-year period to 16 December 2017). The growth in Grainger’s EPRA NAV over the three-year period to 30 September 
2017 was 1.6 times the increase in the Halifax and Nationwide House Price indices over the same period (i.e. 25.2% growth versus 15.9% growth). Absolute TSR 
performance (based on an assessment of performance measured to 30 September 2017) is forecast to be 14% per annum based on absolute TSR growth over the 
three-year performance period to date of 44.3% with the performance period due to end on 16 December 2017. The share price for valuing the award is the share 
price at 29 September 2017 (268.2p) for the EPRA NNNAV element, and the three-month average share price to 29 September 2017 (259.0p) for the TSR element. 
This value will be trued up in next year’s report to reflect the actual level of vesting and share price at the vesting date. In addition, the total LTIP value of awards 
vesting in December 2017 in respect of Andrew Cunningham and Mark Greenwood are £189,000 and £78,000 respectively, both being former Directors of Grainger. 
The 2016 LTIP value has been restated and reflects the actual value of the awards that vested in December 2016. Nick Jopling stepped down from the Board on  
29 September 2017 and will cease employment on 31 December 2017 due to his role being made redundant. As previously reported, Andrew Cunningham and  
Mark Greenwood retired and stepped down from the Board on 4 January 2016 and 22 December 2015 respectively. Retirement is a standard good leaver 
circumstance under the 2007 LTIP, and so they retained their outstanding LTIP awards, which remain eligible to vest on their original vesting dates subject  
to performance targets being applied and a pro-rata reduction for the reduced period of employment relative to the three-year vesting period. 
5 The pension benefits are based on 15% of base salary.
6 Please see Note 6 on page 73 in relation to the vesting of the Tranche 2 buy-out award made to Helen Gordon.
7 With regard to the single total figure of remuneration for each Director in relation to the year under review, the Committee was comfortable with the amounts 
payable given the performance achieved. In forming this view the Committee noted the achievement of a ROSE of 7.3% and adjusted earnings of £74.4m in a 
challenging market context. In addition, substantial strategic progress was also made, with a refined strategy being developed and embedded in the organisation. 
From a longer-term perspective, three-year forecast annualised TSR of 44.3% was achieved at the same time as an increasing EPRA NNNAV relative to the increase 
in the Halifax and Nationwide House Price indices of 9.4%.
8 The salaries for Non-Executive Directors reflect payments in relation to any chairmanship roles (as applicable during the year under review or the preceding year) 
and in some cases pro-rata adjustments are made to reflect the changes in respect of such roles being taken part way through the relevant year.
9 On 8 February 2017 Margaret Ford retired from the Board. Mark Clare was appointed to the Board as Non-Executive Chairman and Justin Read was appointed  
as a Non-Executive Director on 13 February 2017.

2. Annual bonus awards – performance assessment for 2017
Actual performance against the targets set for 2017 are listed below (straight-line payouts occur between the relevant  
performance points). 
All Executive Directors during the year of review were eligible to participate in the 2017 annual bonus plan.
Below are the financial targets set at the start of the year (which were considered as challenging as those set in prior years) and 
performance achieved against them, together with the personal targets and the extent of achievement against these.

The ROSE as detailed above at 7.3% was calculated from the closing EPRA NNNAV of 303p per share plus the dividend of 4.86p per 
share for the year, divided by the opening EPRA NNNAV per share of 287p. 
In respect of the personal performance targets set for each Executive Director, these were set against a range of strategic targets  
at the start of the year. The targets set were aligned to Grainger’s corporate objectives having due regard to the refocused strategy 
being the key overarching deliverable during the year.

Chief Executive
Measure Objective Performance
Achieve strategy and business plan Targets included:
• delivering above market growth from 
executing strategy;
• gaining Board approval for asset hierarchy; 
and
• effectively managing relevant stakeholders.
Achieved in full following the delivery of rental 
growth ahead of the UK average, gaining Board 
approval for asset hierarchy and gaining positive 
feedback from stakeholders (e.g. through direct 
feedback to the Board and evidenced via 
attracting new institutional investors into 
the Company).
Improve operational performance Targets included:
• designing and embedding improved operating 
processes; 
• improving talent management processes; and
• improving customer focus.
Predominantly achieved. Evidenced by:
• the design and implementation of improved 
operating processes. This achievement  
was evidenced by external assessment 
(Deloitte LLP);
• Board oversight of revised talent management 
processes; and
• the design of a new customer proposition  
and implementation of customer  
satisfaction surveys.
Grow rental income to enhance dividend The target was to deliver net rents  
ahead of £40.2m.
Achieved in full with net rental income of £40.4m.
On the basis of the above performance, the Committee determined that payment of 18% of the maximum 20% of this part of the 
bonus was proportionate and reasonable in the circumstances. 
Chief Financial Officer
Measure Objective Performance
Improve debt maturity and cost of debt Targets included improving the debt maturity 
profile and reducing the overall Group 
financing costs.
Achieved in full with the debt maturity profile 
restructured to 4.4 years (from 3.1 years) and 
5.2 years if extension options are exercised.  
Cost of debt reduced to 3.4% (from 3.9%). 
Secure technology transformation Targets included:
• defining a clear IT strategy and roadmap to 
demonstrate early stage implementation 
successes; and
• refining the effectiveness and leadership  
of the IT function.
Achieved in full. Evidenced through the 
establishment of a clear IT roadmap which 
included the identification of success milestones 
and achievement against applicable milestones. 
New leadership of the IT function has been 
established with a view to leading the continued 
transition in technology. 
Secure overhead reduction Target included delivering cost savings in  
Group overheads. 
Cost reductions achieved resulted in actual 
overheads of £27 .2m being lower than the target 
of £27.5m.
Pursuant to the above performance, with targets met or exceeded across all measures, the Committee determined that the 
maximum 20% of this part of the bonus would be payable.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Property Director
Measure Objective Performance
Deliver agreed PRS pipeline Target included achieving a quality pipeline  
of up to £500m in 2017.
Partial achievement with approximately £220m  
of quality pipeline secured by 30 September 2017 .
Secure sales in line with target Targets included sales across seven targeted 
business segments.
The targets were met in five out of seven 
segments including regulated sales, freehold, 
commercial, CHARM and strategic land.
Improve gross to net leakage and 
property operational performance
Targets included:
• exceeding gross rental budgets;
• delivering gross to net costs below 26.5%; and
• keeping PRS voids below 3%.
Partial achievement with gross to net costs of 26% 
and PRS voids of 2.9%, both being ahead of targets.
Following consideration of the performance against the objectives set, the Committee determined that payment of 12.5% of the 
maximum 20% of this part of the bonus was appropriate in the circumstances. 
The total bonuses earned, therefore, were 61%, 63% and 55% of the maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive, Chief 
Financial Officer and Property Director respectively.
3. LTIP awards – performance assessment for 2017
The awards made to Executive Directors in December 2014, and which are due to vest in December 2017, are based on  
EPRA NNNAV and absolute TSR targets measured over a three-year period. Performance against the vesting schedule  
can be summarised as follows:

The forecast vesting value of the awards made in December 2014, subject to the above performance targets, is included in the 2017 
single figure table above.
The awards made to Executive Directors in December 2013, and which vested in December 2016, were based on EPRA NNNAV and 
absolute TSR targets measured over a three-year period. Performance against the vesting schedule can be summarised as follows:

Helen Gordon 329,162 805
Vanessa Simms 170,101 416
Nick Jopling 189,685 464
The face value for Helen Gordon, Vanessa Simms and Nick Jopling is based on a price of 244.56p, being the average share price 
from the five business days immediately preceding the award made on 9 February 2017. The face value of performance shares 
awarded was 175% of salary for Helen Gordon, 130% of salary for Vanessa Simms and 130% of salary for Nick Jopling.
The awards will be eligible to vest in three years, dependent upon continued employment and satisfying the performance criteria. 
Half of the award is subject to a relative TSR growth condition (versus FTSE 350 Real Estate Supersector constituents) with the  
other half subject to a TPR condition (both measured over three financial years, starting with the year the award was granted). 
The relative TSR performance condition requires Grainger’s three-year relative TSR performance versus the comparator group to  
be at least at median for 25% of this part of the award to vest, with vesting then increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% for upper 
quartile relative TSR performance or better. The TPR performance condition requires three-year growth in TPR to be above 5% for 
25% of this part of the award to vest, with vesting then increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% for 9% growth or better. 
5. Payments for loss of office and to past Directors
As detailed earlier, Nick Jopling stepped down from the Board on 29 September 2017 and his employment will terminate on  
31 December 2017 (‘leaving date’) when his role will be made redundant. 
In connection with his termination of employment, he will receive the following payments (each subject to applicable PAYE deductions):
• A total payment of £213,868 in lieu of six months’ notice and ancillary benefits for the six months’ notice period (including 
£178,421 in lieu of six months’ notice, £7 ,500 in lieu of car allowance, £26,763 in lieu of pension allowance and £1, 184 in lieu  
of additional benefits and accrued holiday pay up to cessation of employment of seven days).
• A payment of £72,055 which is inclusive of statutory redundancy payments, the Company’s enhanced redundancy payments  
(with the policy applicable to all employees on redundancy) and a payment in settlement of any statutory claims he may  
have against the Company.
• Outplacement support of up to £20,000 and a contribution to legal fees of £1,500 (both plus VAT and paid or to be paid 
(if applicable) directly to the service provider).
• In light of his being made redundant, consistent with the Company’s Remuneration Policy and the relevant terms in each plan,  
the Remuneration Committee resolved to treat him as a good leaver for the purposes of annual and long-term incentive plans.  
As a result:
 » he remained eligible to receive a full bonus award subject to satisfying the performance targets in relation to the 2017 
financial year, and 25% of any bonus paid will be deferred into the Company’s shares for a period of three years;
 » the LTIP awards granted in January 2016 and February 2017 will remain eligible to vest on their normal vesting dates, subject  
to satisfying the relevant performance criteria. The number of shares comprising each award will be scaled back, prior to  
testing the performance conditions, to reflect the period of his employment relative to the relevant three-year vesting  
period; and
 » he will continue to be eligible to participate in the Company’s employee-wide SAYE and SIP schemes until his leaving date. 
For SAYE, he can participate for an additional six months following the leaving date in accordance with the HMRC-approved 
rules, when his options will mature, and be capable of exercise in accordance with the rules.

shares, of which 5,520 shares vested in May 2016 and 27,602 lapsed at the same time. Tranche 2 included 69,328 shares, of which 21,353 vested in March 2017 
and 47,975 shares lapsed at the same time. The number of shares vesting in relation to Tranches 1 and 2 related to the Committee’s assessment of the value 
forfeited having had regard (where relevant) to the performance targets applying to the awards originally granted (i.e. the adjustments reflected the Committee’s 
assessment of the number of shares that would have vested in her previous employment, following application of the performance conditions attached to the 
relevant awards, with the assessment made based on publicly disclosed information by her previous employer).
  Tranche 3, comprising 50,045 shares, is subject to the EPRA NNNAV and absolute TSR performance targets attached to the Grainger 2014 LTIP award disclosed  
in prior years. This award is eligible to vest on 9 March 2018, subject to continued employment and satisfaction of the performance targets.
  The total number of shares included in the table above is the opening number of shares at the start of the year under review, that remained eligible to vest  
(i.e. relating to Tranches 2 and 3), and the movement during the year related to the vesting and lapsing of Tranche 2 shares. The balance of 50,045 shares relates 
solely to Tranche 3.

Chief Executive. Accordingly, there is an element of double counting in her single figure of total remuneration for 2016. 
2 Andrew Cunningham was acting Chief Executive for most of 2009 due to the absence through illness of Rupert Dickinson.
9. Percentage change in remuneration of Chief Executive and employees
The percentage change in remuneration between 2016 and 2017, excluding LTIP and pension contributions, for the Chief Executive 
and for all other employees in the Group was as follows:
Percentage change 2016–17
Base salary Benefits
Annual 
bonus
Chief Executive
1
0% 0% 5%
Employee population 2% 4% 22%
1 The base salary and benefits for the Chief Executive have not increased since 3 November 2015. The bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive has also remained 
unchanged in 2017. The Chief Executive was only employed for part of the prior year. The variation calculated above has therefore been pro-rated to avoid 
distortions in the metric.
10. Relative importance of spend on pay
The difference in actual expenditure between 2016 and 2017 on remuneration for all employees, in comparison to profit before 
tax – continuing operations and distributions to shareholders by way of dividend, is set out in the charts below. Profit before tax is 
considered to be an appropriate financial metric as it is not impacted by changes in tax rates which are outside of the direct control 
of the Company. Total employee pay has reduced following the restructuring activity undertaken in 2016.

Annual Report on Remuneration continued
11. Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2018
Base salary
In line with the typical increase given to the wider employee population, the Remuneration Committee determined that the base 
salaries for the two Executive Directors should be increased by 2.2%.
Annual bonus
As detailed in the Annual Statement and Summary Remuneration Policy, the structure and metrics to operate for the 2018 annual 
bonus are as follows:
• Chief Executive: 140% of salary
• Chief Financial Officer: 120% of salary
With regard to the level of bonus earned, 25% will be deferred into Grainger shares for three years. 
The range of targets to apply to the 2018 annual bonus have been set after taking into account the current stage of our transition to a 
PRS-focused business model. This has resulted in the same approach being applied to target setting for the adjusted earnings element 
(i.e. the same performance range around budget is being retained) but with a revised range of targets being introduced for ROSE. 
The table below sets out the performance targets and their respective weightings for 2018:
Metric Weighting Rationale and description
Adjusted earnings   40% Incentivises operational success in achieving rental growth, income from sales and reduction in 
operational and finance costs relative to a challenging budget.
Performance level Budget Payout
Threshold 90% 0%
Target 100% 60%
Maximum 120% 100%
Straight line between performance points.
ROSE  40% Incentivises the delivery of targeted levels of return from our property portfolio which is aligned 
with a strong balance sheet in respect of the EPRA NNNAV performance and dividend level.
Performance level Payout
4.5% 0%
4.75% 10%
7% 60%
12% 100%
A graduated vesting scale operates between performance points.
Strategic personal 
objectives
20% Each of the headline metrics are underpinned by defined measurable milestones or a range of targets 
set with reference to budgeted objectives. These are consistent with the strategy and targeted 
objectives for the year agreed by the Board. Due to matters of commercial sensitivity it would not be 
in the interests of the Company to disclose the precise personal targets for the annual bonus at the 
date of production of this report. Details of the objectives and the performance achieved will be 
disclosed retrospectively in the 2018 Annual Report. 
In respect of the revised range of ROSE targets, these have been recalibrated to take account of our current investment in new PRS 
accommodation. The investment programme will result in lower but more stable returns over time as income increasingly replaces 
capital growth from property sales as a proportion of total income. The current strategic focus on developing PRS accommodation also 
increases the time period associated with recognising the full return from investments. The revised range of ROSE targets take due 
account of the above, along with wider changes in the wider macro-economic environment, which also includes lower forecast HPI.
76
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overall, the Committee considers the 2018 annual bonus targets to be equally challenging as the targets set in 2017 for annual 
bonus purposes and considers the range to provide a keen balance between being achievable at the lower end but very demanding 
at the top end of the range, particularly in the context of a challenging budget agreed by the Board.
With regard to the above targets, full retrospective disclosure of the targets will be provided in next year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration (subject to considering any perceived areas of price sensitivity). 
LTIP
It is expected that the LTIP awards to be made to the Executive Directors in the year ending 30 September 2018 will be at the levels 
detailed below and subject to a two-year holding period:
• Chief Executive: 175% of salary
• Chief Financial Officer: 130% of salary
The performance measures to apply for 2018 will be as follows:
Metric Targets Rationale for metric

As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, strict recovery and withholding provisions apply to both LTIP and annual bonus awards, 
which will enable the Committee to reclaim or adjust future variable pay awards if there is a misstatement of the Company’s results, 
any errors in calculation of actual performance against a target set, or in the event of misconduct.
Furthermore, the Committee will retain the right to reduce overall pay outcomes if it considers the variable pay result does not  
reflect broader Company performance over the relevant performance periods.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The Non-Executive Directors’ fee levels have been increased with effect from 1 October 2017 following a benchmarking exercise,  
and to take account of the anticipated time commitment of each role. Current fee levels for the year under review are as follows:
• Basic Non-Executive Director fee: £45,000
• Additional fee for chairing Board Committee: £9,000
• Additional fee for Senior Independent Director duties: £7 ,500
• Chairman’s fee: £165,000
Revised fee levels from 1 October 2017 are as follows:
• Basic Non-Executive Director fee: £47 ,000
• Additional fee for chairing Board Committee: £9,500
• Additional fee for Senior Independent Director duties: £8,000
• Chairman’s fee: £165,000 (no change since Mark Clare’s appointment)

In accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing 
Rules (‘LR’), the information to be included in the Annual Report 
and Accounts, where applicable under LR 9.8.4, is set out in Note 
16 to the financial statements on page 111 in relation to the 
dividend waiver arrangements.
Information incorporated by reference
The Corporate Governance Statement on pages 42 to 81  
forms part of this Directors’ Report and is incorporated into  
this Directors’ report by reference.
Directors’ interests in significant contracts
No Directors were materially interested in any contract 
of significance.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (‘EU IFRS’) and applicable  
law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, 
including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company 
and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant 
and reliable; 
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with EU IFRS; 
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed; 
• assess the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and 
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy  
at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the Directors  
in respect of the annual financial report 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face. 
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Financial risk management
Details are included in Note 28 to the financial statements.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
The Company has in place contractual entitlements for the 
Directors of the Company and its subsidiaries to claim 
indemnification by the Company for certain liabilities they might 
incur in the course of their duties. We have established these 
arrangements, which constitute qualifying third-party indemnity 
provision and qualifying pension scheme indemnity provision, in 
compliance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 
2006. They include provision for the Company to fund the costs 
incurred by Directors in defending certain claims against them 
in relation to their duties. The Company also maintains an 
appropriate level of Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance
Directors’ report continued
Summary
Grainger complies with the greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions 
reporting requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. Grainger reports all 
material GHG emissions, wherever possible using ‘tonnes of 
CO
2
-equivalent’ (‘tCO
2
e’) as the unit of measurement. Our 
reporting period for GHG emissions is 1 October 2016 to 
30 September 2017 and we report emissions for the previous 
year to demonstrate the trend. Our German business was sold in 
April 2016 and we have chosen to exclude emissions associated 
with this portfolio from the data reported above for the previous 
reporting year, to enable a meaningful comparison of our 
emissions with the most recent reporting year. We have also not 
included our Grainger Trust portfolio and are working to collect 
data for future reporting.
Grainger’s Scope 1 and 2 location-based GHG emissions 
increased by 1% between 2016 and 2017 , and market-based  
GHG emissions decreased by 2%.
On an intensity basis, emissions per £m value of assets under 
management and per owned unit reduced between 2016 and 
2017; however, due to a reduction in employee numbers, 
emissions per employee increased.
Methodology
Grainger follows the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard  
(revised edition) and ISO14064: Part 1 standard for its reporting. 
We have used the UK Government conversion factors 2017 for 
location-based reporting and the Association of Issuing Bodies 
European Residual Mixes 2016 for market-based reporting.  
We have reported on all emissions sources required under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013. We have used the operational control 
consolidation method. These sources fall within our 
consolidated financial statements. 
In 2015 the GHG Protocol guidance was updated advising 
organisations to provide separate figures to reflect the market 
and location-based emissions resulting from purchased 
electricity. The location-based method uses average emissions 
intensity of the grid network for that area; the market-based 
method uses emissions based on purchasing decisions made 
by Grainger. For market-based emissions there is a reporting 
hierarchy and Grainger has used contractual instruments where 
there is data readily available. We purchase 100% renewable 
electricity tariffs for GRIP REIT which has resulted in reduced 
Sustainability 
Further information is provided on our website at www.graingerplc.co.uk/responsibility. Our approach to sustainability is based on  
our assessment of the potential risk and opportunity to our business. In the year ended 30 September 2017 , the Group achieved 50% 
and partially achieved 33% of the applicable sustainability targets that it committed to meeting by that date. Further information 
is provided on our website at www.graingerplc.co.uk/responsibility.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Scope 2 emissions using the market-based approach. Where no 
contractual data is available we use residual mix factors.
Scope 1 data
This includes landlord-obtained gas consumed in common areas 
and by tenants on an unmetered basis as well as fuel consumption 
in vehicles owned or leased by Grainger. Fugitive emissions are 
not included as they have been assessed to be immaterial.
Scope 2 data
This includes landlord-obtained electricity consumed in common 
areas and by tenants on an unmetered basis as well as electricity 
consumed by Grainger in its own offices. There is no purchased 
heat or steam.
Scope 3 data
This includes estimated emissions from electricity used by 
Grainger’s tenants in its buildings based on EPC analysis and 
extrapolation. Emissions from the transmission and distribution 
of Grainger’s Scope 2 electricity are included. We also report 
emissions from business travel, including emissions from 
employee grey fleet data which was not available in 2016.  
No other Scope 3 emissions are included.
A more detailed breakdown of our carbon footprint for our 
property portfolios is available in our EPRA Sustainability 
Performance Measures Report, available on our website.
Restatements
We have recalculated emissions for 2016 as we are able to report 
more accurate data for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from 
energy consumption in owned properties. We have also restated 
our associated Scope 3 emissions from electricity transmission 
and distribution losses.
Intensity metrics
We have used three intensity metrics: emissions by market 
value of AUM (tCO
2
e/£m value of AUM), emissions per the 
number of owned units (tCO
2
e/owned unit) and emissions  
per number of employees in line with our financial reporting 
(tCO
2
e/employee).
Health and safety
Grainger has a well-developed health and safety management 
system for the internal and external control of health and safety 
risks, managed by the Health and Safety Director. This includes 
using online risk management systems for identifying, mitigating 
and reporting real time health and safety management 
information. The Health and Safety Committee is responsible 
for overseeing health and safety management. It consists of 
members of staff from across the organisation. The Committee 
continues to monitor legal compliance in health and safety 
through audit and implementation of improvements, to enable 
the Group to become ‘best in class’. Further oversight is also 
carried out by the Operations Board. In addition, a health and 
safety report is provided to each meeting of the Board of 
Directors, and the Health and Safety Director gives a 
presentation to the Board at least once a year.
Employment of disabled persons
The Company gives full and fair consideration to applications 
for employment made by disabled persons, having regard to 
their particular aptitudes and abilities. In the event of an 
employee becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure 
their employment within the Company continues, and that we 
arrange appropriate training where necessary. It is Company 
policy that the training, career development and promotion of 
disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that 
of other employees.
Employee engagement
The Group places considerable value on the engagement of  
its employees and has continued its practice of keeping them 
informed on and involved in business and strategic matters,  
for example through team meetings, presentations by senior 
management and regular all-staff conference calls hosted  
by the Executives. For more information on our people, see  
page 31.
Independent auditor and disclosure  
of information to auditor
As far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware. 
Each Director has taken the steps they ought to have taken 
as Directors, to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information, and to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information. 
Political donations
In accordance with the Company’s policy, we made no political 
donations in 2017 (2016: £nil).
Takeover directive
On a change of control, the main bank facility (included in Note 
27 to the financial statements) will become repayable should 
alternative terms for continuing the facilities not be agreed with 
the lenders within 45 days. In addition, the corporate bond (also 
referred to in Note 27) may become repayable following a change 
of control. There are no other material matters relating to a 
change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. 
The Directors have confirmed approval of the Directors’ report.
By order of the Board.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Grainger plc 
1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Grainger plc  
(“the Company”) for the year ended 30 September 2017 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, 
the Parent Company Statement of Financial Position and the 
Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity, and the  
related notes, including the accounting policies in Note 1.
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the  
state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs  
as at 30 September 2017 and of the Group’s profit for  
the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, 
including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and  
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion.  Our audit opinion is consistent with our 
report to the Audit Committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the shareholders on 6 February 
2015. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 
three financial years ended 30 September 2017 . We have fulfilled 
our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of 
the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including 
the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard  
were provided.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment  
of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified  
by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the 
overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit;  
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We 
summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order  
of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, 
together with our key audit procedures to address those  
matters and, as required for public interest entities, our  
results from those procedures. 
82 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, 
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
The risk Our response
Valuation of investment properties 
(£391.0m; 2016: £261.3m)
Refer to page 55 (Audit Committee Report), 
pages 95-98 (critical accounting estimates and 
judgements) and pages 111-112 (accounting 
policy and financial disclosures).
Subjective valuation 
The valuation approach adopted by the 
Directors varies between portfolios:
• For the Tricomm portfolio, valuation is 
based on a discounted cash flow model 
produced by an external valuer. There is  
a risk that the assumptions of house price 
inflation (“HPI”) and discount rates could  
be inappropriate which could lead to a 
material misstatement in valuation.
• For properties let into the private rental 
market, valuation is derived by applying a 
gross initial yield to the estimated rental 
value of the property. Yield is based on 
market evidence and an inherently 
unobservable judgement in respect of  
rental growth. There is a risk that applying 
an inappropriate yield could lead to a 
material difference in valuation.
• Property held in the core residential 
portfolio is valued by determining vacant 
possession (“VP”) value and applying a 
discount to reflect the fact that the property 
is tenanted. Both VP value and the discount 
applied are estimated with reference to 
comparable market evidence and the 
Group’s own experience, which in some 
cases may be limited.  This means that  
the valuation is inherently subjective  
and susceptible to misstatement.
Our procedures in respect of all property types 
identified included: 
• Our property expertise: Using our own 
property valuation specialist to assist us  
in assessing the methodologies and key 
assumptions used in the valuations adopted 
by the Directors for use in the financial 
statements;
• Sensitivity analysis: Performing sensitivity 
analyses over the assumptions and 
considering the outcomes with reference to 
benchmarks to identify the key assumptions 
affecting the valuation.
Our procedures in respect of the Tricomm 
portfolio included: 
• Benchmarking assumptions: Comparing the 
HPI assumption included in the discounted 
cash flow model to market indices and the 
discount rates to market information including 
gilts and benchmarked risk premiums.
Our procedures in respect of the private rented 
sector blocks included: 
• Our property valuation expertise: Critically 
assessing the yield rates applied using our 
understanding of the nature of the assets  
and comparing to available market data. 
Our procedures in respect of property held in UK 
residential portfolios included:
• Control design and observation: Assessing 
the design of the Directors’ valuation process 
and observing that supporting evidence was 
obtained for a sample of properties; 
• Our property valuation expertise: Using our 
property valuation specialist, assessing the 
degree of challenge, quality of evidence 
presented and conclusions reached in the 
Group’s regional valuation meetings with their 
external valuer; 
• Our sector experience: Challenging the inputs 
used in the valuations including challenging 
comparing to comparable transactions.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued
The risk Our response
Incorrect data 
Valuations are based on data held by the 
in-house surveying team, in some cases 
corroborated by inspection by external valuers.  
This data is regularly updated to include new 
properties and reflect changes in condition  
of existing properties.  There is therefore a  
risk that it may not be updated correctly.  
Errors or omissions in the data could result  
in inappropriate valuations.
Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the Group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of fair values to changes  
in key assumptions reflected the uncertainties inherent in  
the property valuations. 
Data integrity: We assessed the completeness and accuracy of 
the property information provided by the Group to the external 
valuers by agreeing key inputs, such as address, rental income, 
occupancy and current tenancy details to property contracts  
on a sample basis.
Our results 
We found the estimated valuation of investment properties  
to be acceptable.
Recoverability of inventories 
(trading properties) 
(Net realisable value provision: 
£8.1m; 2016: £3.2m)
Refer to page 55 (Audit 
Committee Report), pages 
95-98 (critical accounting 
estimates and judgements) and 
page 116 (accounting policy 
and financial disclosures).
Subjective valuation 
Inventory is carried at the lower of cost and  
net realisable value (“NRV”). The Directors’ 
assessment of NRV of inventory differs 
between residential properties and 
developments:
• For residential trading property NRV is 
based on vacant possession (“VP”) value 
which is estimated with reference to 
comparable market evidence and the 
Group’s own experience, which in some 
cases may be limited.  This means that  
the valuation is inherently subjective and 
susceptible to misstatement.
• For development trading property where 
the intention is to develop further prior to 
sale NRV is the forecast selling price less  
the remaining costs to complete and sell. 
There is a risk that the total forecast profits 
on a development may be overestimated 
and an impairment may not be recorded. 
This risk is highest for developments where 
the current carrying value exceeds the 
current market value. 
In addition to the procedures set out in respect of core  
portfolio investment properties, our procedures for  
residential properties included:
• Historical comparisons: Comparing the year end valuation 
with the sales prices achieved for property sales after the 
balance sheet date.
For development trading properties our procedures included:
• Benchmarking assumptions: Challenging the key assumptions 
in the Group’s plans and forecasts using third party data and  
the Group’s historic experience of costs and revenues;
• Sensitivity analysis: Challenging the key assumptions in the 
Group’s plans and forecasts using third party data and the 
Group’s historic experience of costs and revenues;
• Comparing valuations: Where the intention is to sell without 
further development, comparing the carrying value of inventory 
to the market value of the site in its current condition.
Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the Group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the net realisable value 
provision to changes in key assumptions reflected the 
uncertainties inherent in property valuations and the Group’s 
forecasts for developments.
Our results 
We found the resulting estimate of the net realisable value  
of inventories to be acceptable.
Recoverability of parent 
company’s investment  
in subsidiaries  
(£899.6m; 2016: £893.3m)
Refer to page 55 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 138 
(accounting policy) and page 
139 (financial disclosures).
Subjective valuation 
The carrying amount of the parent company’s 
investments in subsidiaries represents  
92.3% (2016: 93.5%) of the Company’s total 
assets.  Their recoverability is not at a high  
risk of significant misstatement or subject  
to significant judgement. However, due  
to their materiality in the context of the  
parent company financial statements, this is 
considered to be the area that had the greatest 
effect on our overall parent company audit.
Our procedures included: 
• Tests of detail: Comparing the carrying amount of 100% of 
investments with the relevant subsidiaries’ prior year financial 
statements and current year draft balance sheets to identify 
whether their net assets, being an approximation of their 
recoverable amount, were in excess of their carrying amount. 
Our results  
We found the Group’s assessment of the recoverability of the 
investments in subsidiaries to be acceptable.
84
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3. Our application of materiality and  
an overview of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was  
set at £16.0m (2016: £15.0m), determined with reference to  
a benchmark of Group total assets of which it represents 
approximately 1% (2016: 1%). 
In addition, we applied lower materiality of £3.0m (2016: £3. 1m) 
to the specific income statement items which depict the trading 
performance of the Group, which exclude valuation movements 
and taxation. We believe misstatement of these specific income 
statement items of a lesser amount than materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole could reasonably be expected  
to influence the Company’s  members’ assessment of the 
financial performance of the Group. 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as  
a whole was set at £16.0m (2016: £15.0m) determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Company net assets of which it 
represented 5% (2016: 4%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected  
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.48m 
(2016: £0.45m), in addition to other identified misstatements  
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
The Group team performed the audit of the Group as if it was  
a single aggregated set of financial information. The audit was 
performed using the materiality levels set out above and covered 
100% of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax and total 
Group assets (2016: 100% of total Group revenue, Group profit 
before tax and total Group assets).

4. We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if:
• we have anything material to add or draw attention to  
in relation to the Directors’ statement in Note 1 to the  
financial statements on the use of the going concern basis  
of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that 
basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date  
of approval of the financial statements; or 
• if the same statement is materially inconsistent with our  
audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5. We have nothing to report on the  
other information in the Annual Report 
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented 
in the Annual Report together with the financial statements.  Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion 
or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in  
doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements 
audit work, the information therein is materially misstated  
or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit 
knowledge.  Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information.
Strategic report and Directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report; 
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006.

Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ confirmation within the Viability Statement  
on page 41 that they have carried out a robust assessment  
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity; 
• the Principal Risks and Uncertainties disclosures describing 
these risks and explaining how they are being managed  
and mitigated; and  
• the Directors’ explanation in the Viability Statements of how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they considered that period 
to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Viability 
Statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements  
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider that  
the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole  
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy; or  
• the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance 
Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the 
eleven provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified by the Listing Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters 
on which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or  
• the parent Company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7 . Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 79,  
the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing 
the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company  
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud, other irregularities, or  
error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions  
of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. The risk  
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud  
or other irregularities is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as they may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control and may 
involve any area of law and regulation not just those directly 
affecting the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
86 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom  
we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and  
the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements
1. Accounting policies
Accounting policies applicable throughout the financial statements are shown below. Accounting policies that are specific to a 
component of the financial statements have been incorporated in the relevant note. 
(a) Basis of preparation
Grainger plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. It is a public limited liability company listed on the London  
Stock Exchange. The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries, together referred to  
as the ‘Group’, and equity account the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates. The parent company financial statements  
present information about the Company and not the Group.
The Group financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2017 have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘EU IFRS’), IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has prepared its company financial statements in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’), which are presented on pages 136 to 144.
The accounting policies set out below and in notes to the financial statements have, unless otherwise stated, been applied 
consistently to all periods presented in the Group financial statements. No new accounting policies have been adopted in the 
year and there has been no change to the basis of accounting estimates in the year.
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following assets and 
liabilities, and corresponding income statement accounts, which are stated at their fair value: investment property; derivative 
financial instruments; financial interest in property assets; and assets classified as held-for-sale.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with EU IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the events and amounts involved, actual 
results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas 
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.
Going concern
The Directors are required to make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue to trade as a going concern for the 
foreseeable future. The Directors have given this matter due consideration and have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare  
the Group financial statements on a going concern basis. The main considerations were as follows: 
i) Covenant compliance – The Directors have reviewed the Group’s financial projections covering a minimum period of at least  
12 months beyond the date of signing of these financial statements, which include covenant compliance forecasts. These 
projections show that the Group will meet its covenant requirements.
ii) Banking facilities – The Directors have reviewed the available headroom on the Group. Cash flow projections confirm that  
the Group will remain within its facilities for a minimum period of at least 12 months beyond the date of signing of these financial 
statements.
(b) Basis of consolidation
i) Subsidiaries – Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the 
date control ceases. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Accounting 
policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
93
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
ii) Joint ventures and associates – Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established 
by contractual agreement. Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Where the Group owns less than 50% of the voting 
rights but acts as property and/or asset manager an assessment is made as to whether or not the Group has de facto control over 
an investee. This includes a review of the Group’s rights relative to those of another investor or investors and the ability the Group 
has to direct the investees’ relevant activities (further detail is provided in Note 19).
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, 
and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss after the date of acquisition. 
The joint venture and associate results for the 12 months to 30 September 2017 and the financial position as at that date have 
been equity accounted in these financial statements. The Group’s share of its joint ventures’ and associates’ post-acquisition profits 
or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. Where the Group’s interest has been reduced to £nil, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is 
recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the  
joint venture or associate. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. 
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates. The accounting policies of joint ventures and associates have been changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
iii) Business combinations – At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents the acquisition 
of a business or the acquisition of an asset. The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated 
set of activities are acquired in addition to the property. When the acquisition of a subsidiary does not represent a business, it is 
accounted for as an acquisition of assets and liabilities. The cost of acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired 
based on their fair values, and no goodwill or deferred tax is recognised.
iv) Goodwill and impairment – Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition 
is measured as the fair value of the assets given and equity instruments issued. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets, 
including intangible assets, of the acquired entity at the date of acquisition. If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value  
of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Costs attributable  
to an acquisition are expensed in the consolidated income statement under the heading ‘Other expenses’. 
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included within this caption in the statement of financial position. Goodwill on acquisition 
of joint ventures and associates is included in investments in joint ventures and associates. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment and 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the 
disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
1. Accounting policies continued
94
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group’s significant accounting policies are stated in the relevant notes to the Group financial statements. The preparation  
of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires  
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and 
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in 
any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below.
Estimates 
1) Valuation of property assets
Residential trading property is carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value and investment 
property is carried at fair value. The Group does, however, in its principal non-GAAP net asset value measures, EPRA NAV and EPRA 
NNNAV, include trading property at market value. The adjustment in the value of trading property is the difference between the 
statutory book value and its market value as set out in Note 5. For investment property, market value is the same as fair value.
(c) Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the current financial year  
that have a material impact on the Group. 
A number of new standards and amendments to standards have been issued but are not yet effective for the Group. The most 
significant of these, and their potential impact on the Group’s accounting, are set out below:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 April 2018) – The standard applies to classification and measurement of financial 
assets and financial liabilities, impairment provisioning and hedge accounting. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact 
of IFRS 9. Adoption of the new standard is expected to have limited impact on the measurement of the Group’s financial 
liabilities. The adoption will require presentational changes.
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective from 1 April 2018) – The standard will be applicable to property 
and asset management fee income and proceeds from the disposal of trading and investment property, but not gross rental 
income. Based on the transactions impacting the current financial year and future known transactions, the Group does not 
expect the adoption of IFRS 15 to have a material impact on the Group’s reported results. However, we will continue to assess 
new transactions as they arise to the date of adoption.
• IFRS 16 Leases (effective from 1 April 2019) – The adoption of this standard is not expected to significantly impact the 
recognition of rental income earned under the Group’s leases with tenants. The Group holds operating leases as a lessee in 
relation to its office premises which are affected by this standard and as such adoption of the new standard may impact the 
measurement and presentation of the Group’s assets and liabilities.
• IAS 40 Investment Property, proposed amendment. In November 2015 the IASB issued an Exposure Draft on a proposed 
amendment to clarify situations in which properties can be transferred from investment property to trading property and 
vice versa. The IASB further announced in July 2016 that it has now recommended finalising this amendment. The Group 
will consider reclassification of individual assets if it is appropriate and circumstances meet the definitions and requirements 
of the amendment. 
Of the other IFRSs that are available for early adoption, none are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

3 Allsop provides vacant possession values used by the Directors to value the financial asset in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 21.
i) Residential – The Group’s own in-house qualified team provided a vacant possession value for the majority of the Group’s UK 
residential properties as at 30 September 2017 . A structured sample of these in-house valuations was reviewed by Allsop LLP , an 
external independent valuer. Valuing the large number of properties in this portfolio is a significant task. For this reason it is undertaken 
on an external inspection basis only. Invariably, when the in-house valuations are compared with those of the external valuer, around 
75% of the valuations are within a small acceptable tolerance. Where the difference is more significant, this is discussed with the valuer 
to determine the reasons for the difference. Typically, the reasons vary, but it could be, for example, that further or better information 
about internal condition is available or that respective valuers have placed a different interpretation on comparable sales. Once such 
reasons have been identified, the Group and the valuer agree the appropriate valuation that should be adopted as the Directors’ 
Valuation.
Allsop LLP has provided the Directors with the following opinion on the Directors’ Valuation.
Property held in the Residential Portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2017 by Grainger’s in-house surveyors. These valuations 
were reviewed and approved by the Directors. Allsop LLP has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Directors’ Valuation and 
they are satisfied with the process by which the in-house valuations were conducted. Allsop LLP valued approximately 78% of the  
96 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Residential Portfolio, independently of the Group. Based on the results of that review, Allsop LLP has concluded that they have  
a high degree of confidence in those Directors’ Valuations. 
Allsop LLP also recommends a discount to apply to the vacant possession valuations to establish the market value of each property. 
For property in the Residential Portfolio, the discounts are established by tenancy type and are based on evidence gathered by  
Allsop LLP from recent transactional market evidence.
ii) GInvest – All of the property owned by the Group in the GInvest portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2017 by Allsop LLP . 
The market value of the properties subject to the assumption that the dwellings would be sold individually, which is deemed to be the 
highest and best use, in their existing condition, and subject to any existing leases or tenancies was provided by Allsop LLP . 
The valuer’s opinion of market value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arm’s-length terms.
iii) Tricomm Housing – Allsop LLP provided an investment valuation as at 30 September 2017 for the property assets owned by  
the Group and let under a long-term lease arrangement with the Secretary of State for Defence under a PFI project agreement.  
The investment valuation has been made in accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards, and is based on a discounted 
cash flow model.
iv) Affordable housing – For properties let on affordable rents, social rents or sold on shared ownership leases, Allsop LLP valued  
the assets on the basis of Existing Use Value for Social Housing (EUV-SH) in line with RICS Global Standards. Properties subject to 
intermediate rents have been valued at market value as these assets are not restricted as social housing in perpetuity.
Significant unobservable inputs within the valuation relate to assumptions for house price inflation and the discount rates to apply  
to the cash flows. The assumptions adopted for house price inflation are 3.25% in 2018, 3.50% in 2019, 3.25% in 2020, 2021 and  
2022 and 2.75% thereafter. The discount rates applied to the cash flows range between 3.3% and 9.0%.
v) Financial asset (CHARM) – The valuation methodology adopted for the CHARM asset is set out in Note 21 to the financial 
statements.
The key assumptions affecting the carrying value are house price inflation and the discount rate. The assumptions used to value 
the asset adopt an increase in house prices of between 2.5% and 4.0% per annum. A discount rate of 3.5% has been applied to the 
interest income and a rate of 6.5% has been applied to the projected proceeds from sales of the underlying properties, reflecting  
the risk profile of each individual income stream. 
The fair value of the interest changes as cash flows are realised and a decrease of £1.0m (2016: increase of £2.9m) in the fair value 
has been recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income and the available-for-sale reserve.
Credit risk arises from the credit exposure relating to cash receipts from the financial instrument. All of the cash receipts are payable 
by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered to be low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and 
there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end.
vi) Developments – The current market value of the Group’s land and property held within the development segment has been 
assessed by CBRE Limited which are external independent valuers. Their valuation, representing 85% of the total value of 
development trading stock, is on the basis of fair value as defined in the RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value  
is the same as market value. The remaining 15% of the portfolio is a Directors’ Valuation.
vii) PRS build-to-rent assets – CBRE assessed the current fair value of the completed assets and assets in the course of construction. 
The principal approach was to value the apartments on an income capitalisation basis, having regard to prevailing market conditions 
and evidence, and with close regard to the relativity between the market value and the aggregate vacant possession value. Where 
applicable, estimated costs required to complete construction have been taken into account. The valuation has been prepared in 
accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same as market value.

2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
viii) Joint ventures and associates – Property assets in the joint venture Walworth Investment Properties Limited (‘WIP’) are valued  
on the same basis as the GInvest portfolio. 
Property assets in the associate GRIP REIT PLC were valued at 30 June 2017 by external valuers, CBRE Limited. In aggregate, the 
valuation of the individual dwellings as at 30 June 2017 was £660.5m for all assets still held at 30 September 2017 . In assessing the 
Group’s share of GRIP REIT net assets for the purposes of the Group’s financial statements to 30 September 2017, after full 
consideration of movement in house price indices, the Group’s Directors made a 0.25% (£1.5m) adjustment to increase the 30 June 
2017 valuations. 
The Directors consider the valuations provided by external valuers to be representative of fair value.
As required by RICS Professional Valuation Standards, all of the external valuers in the UK mentioned above have made full 
disclosure of the extent and duration of their work for, and fees earned by them from, the Group, which in all cases are less than 
5% of their total fees.
2) Net realisable value of trading property
The Group’s residential trading properties are carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the net sales proceeds which the Group expects on sale of a property with vacant possession. The Group has  
a net realisable value provision of £8.1m as at 30 September 2017 (2016: £3.2m). The provision includes specific properties which  
are vacant and properties we expect to become vacant in the future.
3) Derivative financial instruments
Fair value measurements for derivative financial instruments are obtained from quoted market prices and/or valuation models 
as appropriate. When not directly observable in active markets, the fair value of derivative contracts must be computed internally 
based on internal assumptions as well as directly observable market information, including forward and yield curves for commodities, 
currencies and interest. Changes in internal assumptions and forward curves could materially impact the internally computed fair 
value of derivative contracts, particularly long-term contracts, resulting in a corresponding impact on income or loss in the 
consolidated income statement.
Changes to key assumptions could impact both income and financial position. The impact of changes to key assumptions is 
considered for assets using a range of reasonable changes. The Group measures its market risk exposure internally by running  
various sensitivity analyses. The Directors consider that a +/– 2 percentage point (2016: 2 percentage point) movement in house 
prices represents a reasonable possible change. The table below sets out potential impacts that may result from changes to  
certain assumptions:

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Judgements 
1) Distinction between investment and trading property
The Group considers the intention at the outset when each property is acquired in order to classify the property as either an 
investment or a trading property. Where the intention is either to trade the property or where the property is held for immediate 
sale upon receiving vacant possession within the ordinary course of business, the property is classified as trading property.
Where the intention is to hold the property for its long-term rental yield and/or capital appreciation, the property is classified  
as an investment property.
2) Adjusted earnings
Adjusted earnings is one of Grainger’s key performance indicators. The metric is utilised as a key measure to aid understanding of 
the performance of the continuing business and excludes valuation movements and non-recurring items that are one-off in nature, 
which do not form part of the normal ongoing revenue or costs of the business and, either individually or in aggregate, are material 
to the reported Group results. The classification of amounts as non-recurring is a significant judgement made by management and 
is a matter referred to the Audit Committee for approval.
Non-recurring items in 2017 saw a charge of £2.8m (2016: £7.4m income). The charge in the year comprised two main components. 
£1.2m relates to the implementation of strategic change in operations and £1.6m relates to a provision for historic non-core 
businesses. In 2016, £7 .4m income was recorded relating to these non-core businesses. 
3. Discontinued operations
Accounting policy
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly 
distinguished from the rest of the Group and which:
• represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
• is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or
• is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified 
as held-for-sale. For the discontinued operation, the comparable income statement and other comprehensive income have been 
re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.

5. Segmental information
Accounting policy
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified based upon the Group’s internal reporting to the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) so that the CODM can make decisions about resources to be allocated to segments 
and assess their performance. The Group’s CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The three significant segments for continuing 
operations are Residential, Development and Funds.
The title ‘Other’ has been included in the tables below to reconcile the segments to the figures reviewed by the CODM and 
includes certain central costs that cannot be allocated to the operating segments. The key operating performance measure of 
profit or loss used by the CODM is adjusted earnings before tax, valuation and non-recurring items. The CODM reviews by segment 
two key statement of financial position measures of net asset value. These are EPRA Net Asset Value (‘EPRA NAV’) and EPRA 
Triple Net Asset Value (‘EPRA NNNAV’).
Information relating to the Group’s operating segments is set out in the tables below. The tables distinguish between adjusted 
earnings, valuation and non-recurring items and should be read in conjunction with Note 4.

The two principal net asset value measures reviewed by the CODM are EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV. These measures reflect 
the current market value of trading property owned by the Group rather than the lower of historical cost and net realisable value. 
These measures are considered to be a more relevant reflection of the value of the assets owned by the Group (see EPRA 
performance measures on page 145 for definitions).
These measures are set out below by segment along with a reconciliation to the summarised statutory statement

Accounting policy
Property is regarded as sold when the significant risks and returns have been transferred to the buyer. This is deemed to be on  
legal completion. Profits or losses are calculated by reference to the carrying value of the property sold. For a development  
property this is assessed through the use of a gross margin for the site as a whole or such other basis that provides an appropriate 
allocation of costs.
Contract revenue and expenses from construction contracts is recognised in the income statement in accordance with the stage 
of completion of the contract. Revenues are recognised as amounts recoverable on contracts in trade and other receivables  
(Note 24) and will be recovered on completion of the development.

14. Tax
Accounting policy
The taxation charge for the year represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The charge is recognised in  
the income statement and statement of comprehensive income according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Current tax payable or receivable is based on the taxable income for the period and any adjustment in respect of prior periods  
and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. 
Tax payable upon the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release  
of the associated deferred tax. 
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax 
rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply 
when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets 
are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will give rise to a future tax liability against which the 
deferred tax assets can be recovered. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will  
not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax 
authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

Total tax charge for the year 13.1 10.9
The 2017 current tax adjustments relating to prior years include adjustments to recognise tax losses and other reliefs available to the 
Group, whilst deferred tax adjustments relate primarily to losses carried forward, which have been included in submitted tax returns.
The Group works in an open and transparent manner and maintains a regular dialogue with HM Revenue and Customs. This 
approach is consistent with the ‘low risk’ rating we have been awarded by HM Revenue and Customs, and to which the Group  
is committed.
The Group’s results for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 19.5% (2016: 20%).
The tax charge for the year is different to the charge for the year derived by applying the standard rate of corporation tax in the  
UK of 19.5% (2016: 20%) to the profit before tax. The differences are explained below:
 
2017  
£m
2016

Total deferred tax (22.9) (21.6)
Deferred tax has been predominantly calculated at a rate of 17% (2016: 17%) in line with changes to the main rate of corporation  
tax from 1 April 2020 which have been substantively enacted. 
In addition to the tax amounts shown above, contingent tax based on EPRA market value measures being tax on the difference 
between the carrying value of trading properties in the statement of financial position and their market value has not been 
recognised by the Group. This contingent tax amounts to £109.8m (2016: £110.4m). 
It is not possible for the Group to identify the timing of movements in deferred tax between those expected within one year 
and those expected in a period greater than one year. This is because movements in the main balances, both assets and liabilities,  
will be determined by factors outside the control of the Group, namely the vacation date of properties and interest yield curve 
movements. However, given the long-term nature of our property ownership, we anticipate that the balance will predominantly  
be crystallised in a period greater than one year.
15. Dividends
Accounting policy
Dividends are recognised through equity when approved by the Company’s shareholders or on payment, whichever is earlier.
Dividends paid in the year are shown below:

Subject to approval at the AGM, the final dividend of 3.26p per share (gross) amounting to £13.6m will be paid on 9 February 2018 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 29 December 2017 . Shareholders will again be offered the option to participate 
in a dividend reinvestment plan and the last day for election is 15 January 2018. An interim dividend of 1.60p per share amounting to a 
total of £6.6m was paid to shareholders on 30 June 2017 .
110 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16. Earnings per share
Accounting policy
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held both in 
Trust and as treasury shares to meet its obligations under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’) 
and Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) scheme, on which the dividends are being waived.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares in issue by the dilutive effect of 
ordinary shares that the Company may potentially issue relating to its share option schemes and contingent share awards under the 
LTIP and DBP, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2017 was the end of the contingency period. 
Where the effect of the above adjustments is antidilutive, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

17 . Investment property
Accounting policy
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the companies  
in the consolidated Group, is classified as investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value. Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, if 
necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specified asset. If this information is not available, the 
Group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. 
Investment property falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13. Further details are given in Note 28.
Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of the property when it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair 
and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the Group’s investment properties are included in the income statement  
of the period in which they arise.
Where specific investment properties are expected to sell within the next 12 months their fair value is shown under assets 
classified as held-for-sale within current assets. Any loss on the reclassification of these assets from investment properties  
to assets held-for-sale is charged to the income statement of the period in which this occurs.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Although the Group acts as property and/or asset manager for GRIP REIT PLC, the remaining equity is held by a single investor. This 
investor is actively involved in the business and in controlling the key financial and operational activities of the business. Accordingly, 
the Group does not have de facto control of the entity. The accounting period end for GRIP REIT PLC is 31 December. The results for 
the 12 months to 30 September 2017 and financial position as at that date have been equity accounted in these financial statements.

21. Financial interest in property assets (‘CHARM’ portfolio)
Accounting policy
The CHARM portfolio is a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church of England Pensions Board as mortgagee.  
It is accounted for under IAS 39 in accordance with the designation available-for-sale financial assets and is valued at fair value.
It is initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
the net change in value recorded is as follows: i) the carrying value of the assets is increased by the effective interest rate; ii) cash 
received from the instrument in the year is deducted from the carrying value of the assets; and iii) the carrying value of the assets 
is revised to the net present value of the updated projected cash flows arising from the instrument using the effective interest rate 
applicable at acquisition. The change in value arising from i) and iii) above is recorded through the income statement and is shown 
on the line ‘Income from financial interest in property assets’. 
Differences between the updated projected cash flows using the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition compared to updated 
projected cash flows using a year end effective interest rate, assessed as the rate available in the market for an instrument with a 
similar maturity and credit risk, are taken through other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying 
value of the assets. When gains or losses in the assets are realised, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are 
included in the income statement as gains and losses from financial interest in property assets.

The CHARM portfolio is considered to be a Level 3 financial asset as defined by IFRS 13. The key assumptions used to value the asset 
are set out within Note 2 ‘Critical accounting estimates and judgements’, and the financial asset is included within the fair value hierarchy 
within Note 28.

22. Intangible assets
Accounting policy
Intangible assets comprise computer software and goodwill.
IT software is amortised on a straight-line basis over 5–7 years being the estimated useful lives of the assets, from the date they 
are available for use. Amortisation is charged to the income statement. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment based on a value in use calculation at each reporting date.
23. Inventories 
Accounting policy
Tenanted residential properties held-for-sale in the normal course of business are shown in the financial statements as a current 
asset at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes legal and surveying charges and introducer fees incurred during 
acquisition together with improvement costs. 
Land and property held within the development segment of the business are shown in the financial statements at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents the acquisition price including legal and other professional costs associated with the acquisition together with 
subsequent development costs net of amounts transferred to costs of sale. 
Net realisable value is the expected sales proceeds that the Group expects on sale of a property or current market value net of 
associated selling costs.

It is not possible for the Group to identify which properties will be sold within the next 12 months. The size of the Group’s property 
portfolio does result in a relatively predictable vacancy rate. However, it is not possible to predict in advance the specific properties 
that will become vacant. Trading property is shown as a current asset in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group has an obligation, under an agreement for sale in relation to its land at West Waterlooville, to pay further consideration 
should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts. It also has an obligation under a profit sharing agreement to share profits 
above an agreed threshold. It is not possible to determine the amount or timing of any such future payments due to the long-term 
nature of the site’s development and the associated uncertainties. However, our current best estimate is that the earliest payment under 
these arrangements will not be before October/November 2019 and any payments are likely to be spread over a number of years.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24. Trade and other receivables
Accounting policy
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment in trade receivables is established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. The amount of the provision is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The 
movement in the provision is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

assets that are neither past due nor impaired is discussed in Note 28 ‘Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments’. 
25. Provisions for other liabilities and charges
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when: (i) the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event; (ii) it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
26. Trade and other payables
Accounting policy
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

27 . Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Accounting policy
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value 
is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for  
at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.

(a) Bank loans 
Sterling bank loans include variable rate loans bearing interest at rates between 1.6% and 1.8% above LIBOR and Euro bank loans 
include variable rate loans bearing interest at a rate of 1.6% above EURIBOR. 
The weighted average variable interest rate on bank loans as at 30 September 2017 was 2.0% (2016: 2.0%). Bank loans are secured  
by fixed and floating charges over specific property and other assets of the Group.
Unamortised costs in relation to bank loans of £7 .2m (2016: £5.9m) will be amortised over the life of the loans to which they relate. 
(b) Non-bank financial institution
The £7.6m loan is funded by the Homes and Communities Agency and bears interest at 1% over the European Commission reference 
rate applicable to the UK.
(c) Corporate bond
The £275m, 5.0% secured corporate bond, due December 2020, was issued in the financial year ended 30 September 2014. The 
primary issue was £200m issued at par in November 2013 with a secondary tap issue in August 2014 of £75m issued at 101. 125%.  
The premium on the tap issue is being amortised to the income statement using the straight-line method.
Unamortised costs and the outstanding premium in relation to the corporate bond are, in total, £2.0m (2016: £2.6m) and will be 
amortised over the remaining life of the bond. 
(d) Other loans and borrowings information
The above analyses of loans and borrowings are net of unamortised loan issue costs and the premium raised on the secondary  
tap issue of the corporate bond. As at 30 September 2017 , unamortised costs totalled £9.6m (2016: £9.0m) and the outstanding 
premium was £0.4m (2016: £0.6m).

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 28. Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments
Accounting policies
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative instruments to help manage its interest rate risk. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group 
does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. Derivatives are classified as current assets and current liabilities. 
The derivatives are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently, the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, and have been designated  
as such, in which case any gain or loss is taken to equity in a cash flow hedge reserve via other comprehensive income. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being 
hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an  
ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted transaction is ultimately 
recognised in the income statement. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or  
loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on a discounted cash flow model using market information.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Derecognition is the point at which the Group removes an asset or liability from its statement of financial position. The Group’s 
policy is to derecognise financial assets only when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires. The 
Group also derecognises financial assets that it transfers to another party provided that the transfer of the asset also transfers 
the right to receive cash flows from the financial asset. When the transfer does not result in the Group transferring the right to 
receive cash flows from the financial asset but it does result in the Group assuming a corresponding obligation to pay cash flows 
to another recipient, the financial asset is derecognised. 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when its obligation is discharged, is cancelled or expires. 
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are the financial interest in property assets. 
Derivative financial instruments not in hedge accounting relationships are classified as fair value through profit and loss.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The fair value difference relates to the Group’s corporate bond, which is stated at amortised cost in the consolidated statement  
of financial position. The fair value of the bond is calculated as £299.8m (2016: £301.8m) based on quoted prices in traded markets. 
There is no requirement under IAS 39 to revalue these loans to fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Included in cash above is £11.3m (2016: £10.7m) relating to cash held on behalf of tenants, leaseholders and clients comprising 
service charge amounts, sinking fund balances, tenant deposits and cash held on behalf of joint ventures. These cash amounts  
are held by the Group in client bank accounts and are excluded from net debt. In addition £29.0m (2016: £37 .9m) of the cash balance 
is restricted in use by underlying financing arrangements comprising either reserve fund amounts or amounts where the release of 
cash is contingent upon proof of qualifying expenditure.

Financial risk management
The Group’s objectives for managing financial risk are to minimise the risk of adverse effects on performance and to ensure the ability 
of the Group to continue as a going concern while securing access to cost-effective finance and maintaining flexibility to respond 
quickly to opportunities that arise.
The Group’s policies on financial risk management are approved by the Board of Directors and implemented by Group treasury. 
Written policies and procedures cover interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments 
and investment of excess liquidity. Group treasury reports to the Audit Committee.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to financial risk but does not take positions for  
speculative purposes.
The sources of financial risk and the policies and activities used to mitigate each are discussed below and include credit risk, liquidity 
risk and market risk, which includes interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit availability risk, house price risk in relation to the 
Tricomm Housing portfolio and the CHARM portfolio, our financial interest in property assets, and capital risk.
Financial risk factors 
1) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. The Group’s principal financial assets 
include its financial interest in property assets, bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables. The carrying amount of financial 
assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the 
value of any collateral obtained.
The Group’s financial interest in property assets (CHARM) relates to a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church 
of England Pensions Board. The Group’s cash receipts are payable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered to be 
low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end. 
The Group sometimes enters into land sales contracts within the Development division under which a proportion of the consideration 
is deferred and recognised within other receivables (Note 24). Each purchaser is subject to financial due diligence prior to sale.  
At 30 September 2017 , £29.0m (2016: £nil) was outstanding.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements

28. Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued
The Group also has credit risk relating to trade receivables. Where it is identified that recovery is doubtful, a provision for impairment 
is made. For all assured shorthold tenancies, credit checks are performed prior to acceptance of the tenant. Regulated tenants are 
incentivised through the benefit of their tenancy agreement to avoid default on their rent. Lifetime tenancies are generally at low or 
zero rent and hence suffer minimal credit risk. Rent deposits and personal guarantees are held in respect of some leases. Taking these 
factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low, as is 
borne out by the low level of trade receivables written off both in this year and in prior years.
Tenant deposits of £2.5m (2016: £2.0m) are held that provide some security against rental arrears and property dilapidations caused 
by the tenant. The Group does not hold any other collateral as security. Of the net trade receivables balance of £1.5m, we consider 
£nil to be not due and not impaired. We consider all of the £49.4m other receivables balance, and all of the £86.8m amounts 
recoverable on contracts as not due and not impaired.
As at 30 September 2017 , tenant arrears of £0.6m within trade receivables were impaired and fully provided for (2016: £0.5m). 
The individually impaired receivables are based on a review of outstanding arrears and an assessment of collectability. Impaired 
receivables and receivables not considered to be impaired are not material to the financial statements and, therefore, no further 
analysis is provided. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed through the Group’s policies of monitoring counterparty 
exposure, monitoring the concentration of credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties and the use of counterparties of good 
financial standing. At 30 September 2017 , the fair value of all interest rate derivatives that had a positive value was £3.4m (2016: £0.3m).
At 30 September 2017 , the combined credit exposure arising from cash held at banks, money market deposits and interest rate swaps 
was £80.0m (2016: £80.3m), which represents 4.5% (2016: 5.0%) of total assets. Deposits were placed with financial institutions with 
A- or better credit ratings. 
The Group has the following cash and cash equivalents:
2017 
£m
2016
£m
Pounds Sterling 83.2 79.4
Euros 5.7 11.3
 88.9 90.7
At the year end, £35.3m was placed on deposit (2016: £42.3m) at effective interest rates between 0.2% and 0.3% (2016: 0.2% and 
0.3%). Remaining cash and cash equivalents are held as cash at bank or in hand. 
The Group has an overdraft facility of £1.0m as at 30 September 2017 (2016: £1.0m).
2) Liquidity risk
The Group ensures that it maintains continuity and flexibility through a spread of maturities.
Although the Group’s core funding is subject to covenants requiring certain levels of loan to value with respect to the entities in the 
Group of obligors, and to maintaining a certain level of interest cover at the Group level, the loan is not secured directly against any 
property allowing operational flexibility. The Group has operated within its covenants during 2017 and as at 30 September 2017 
(see Note 1 ‘Accounting policies – Going concern’).
The Group ensures that it maintains sufficient cash for operational requirements at all times. The Group also ensures that it has 
sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a diverse range of banks and other sources to allow for operational flexibility 
and to meet committed expenditure. The business is highly cash generative from its sales of vacant properties, gross rents and 
management fees. In adverse trading conditions, tenanted sales can be increased and new acquisitions can be stopped. 
Consequently, the Group is able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.

3) Market risk
The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, the availability of credit and house price 
movements relating to the Tricomm Housing portfolio and the CHARM portfolio. The approach the Group takes to each of these 
risks is set out below. The Group is not significantly exposed to equity price risk or to commodity price risk.
Fair values
IFRS 13 sets out a three-tier hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value. These are as follows:
Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 
Level 3 – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:
2017 2016
£m Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities
Level 3
CHARM 86.1 – 93.1 –
Investment property 391.0 – 261.3 –
477.1 – 354.4 –

The significant unobservable inputs affecting the carrying value of the CHARM portfolio are house price inflation and the effective 
interest rate. Assumptions used are detailed in Note 2 and reconciliation of movements and amounts recognised in the income 
statement and other comprehensive income are detailed in Note 21.
The investment valuations provided by Allsop LLP and CBRE Limited are based on the RICS Professional Valuation Standards,  
but include a number of unobservable inputs and other valuation assumptions. 
The fair value of swaps and caps were valued in-house by a specialised treasury management system, using first a discounted cash 
flow model and market information. The fair value is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates obtained 
by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments. As all significant inputs required to value the swaps and caps 
are observable, they all fall within Level 2.
Interest rate swaps and caps are all classified as either current assets or current liabilities.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap and cap contracts as at 30 September 2017 was £460.9m  
(2016: £462.2m). 
In accordance with IAS 39, the Group has reviewed its interest rate hedges. In the absence of hedge accounting, movements in fair 
value are taken directly to the income statement. However, where cash flow hedges have been viewed as being effective, and have 
been designated as such, any gains or losses have been taken to the cash flow hedge reserve via other comprehensive income.
The reconciliation between opening and closing balances for Level 3 is detailed in the table below:
Assets – Level 3
2017 
£m
2016 
£m
Opening balance 354.4 205.2
Amounts taken to income statement 23.3 26.1
Transfer from Level 2 – 246.3
Other movements 99.4 (123.2)
Closing balance 477.1 354.4
The following assets and liabilities are excluded from the above table as fair value is not the accounting basis for the Group’s financial 
statements, but is the basis for the Group’s EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV measures:
2017 2016
£m Accounting basis Classification if fair valued Book value Fair value Book value Fair value
Inventories – trading property Lower of cost and  
net realisable value

904.3 1,553.7 
Corporate bond Amortised cost Level 1 275.0 299.8 275.0 301.8
In prior years, investment property has been included within Level 2. However, as all inputs to their valuation on a property by 
property basis are not always observable, investment property is better shown within Level 3 and a transfer has been made in the 
prior year to reflect this. 
(a) Interest rate risk – The Group’s interest rate risk arises from the risk of fluctuations in interest charges on floating rate borrowings. 
The Group mitigates this risk through the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps and caps. This subjects the Group to fair value risk 
as the value of the financial derivatives fluctuates in line with variations in interest rates. However, the Group seeks to cash flow hedge 
account where applicable. The Group is, however, driven by commercial considerations when hedging its interest rate risk and is not 
driven by the strict requirements of the hedge accounting rules under IAS 39 if this is to the detriment of achieving the best commercial 
arrangement.
Hedging activities are carried out under the terms of the Group’s hedging policies and are regularly reviewed by the Board to ensure 
compliance with this policy. The Board reviews its policy on interest rate exposure regularly with a view to establishing that it is still 
relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment. The current Group treasury policy is to maintain floating rate exposure 
of no greater than 30% of expected borrowing. As at 30 September 2017 , 79% (2016: 87%) of the Group’s net borrowings were 
economically hedged to fixed or capped rates.
124 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Based on the Group’s interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease 
annual profits by £2.0m (2016: £1.8m). Similarly, a 1% decrease would increase annual profits by £2.0m (2016: £1.8m). 
Based on the Group’s interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase 
the Group’s equity by £9.9m (2016: £14.5m). Similarly, a 1% decrease would decrease the Group’s equity by £9.9m (2016: £14.5m). 
Upward movements in medium and long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectation, increase the value of 
the Group’s interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves. The converse is true for downward movements in the 
interest yield curve. Where the Group’s swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39, these movements in fair value are recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement.
As at 30 September 2017 , the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 is a net liability of £1.9m 
(2016: £13.1m). No amount is recognised within the income statement for ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges (2016: £nil). The fair 
value movement on derivatives not in hedge accounting relationships resulted in a gain of £0.2m (2016: a charge of £9.9m) in the 
income statement.
At 30 September 2017 , the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 is a net asset of £0.4m  
(2016: £0.3m). The cash flows occur and enter in the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.

the weighted average rates are shown in the table above.
(b) Foreign exchange risk – The Group’s foreign exchange risk arises from the exposure due to translating overseas trading 
performance and overseas net assets into Sterling. The Group does not have foreign currency trading with cross-border currency 
flows. The Group hedges foreign currency assets naturally by funding them through borrowings in the applicable foreign currency 
and aims to ensure that it has no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Profit translation is 
not hedged.

As at 30 September 2017 , it is estimated that a general increase/decrease of 10 percentage points in the value of Sterling against the 
Euro would decrease/increase the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £0. 1m (2016: £0.4m) and equity by £nil (2016: £nil).
(c) Credit availability risk – Credit availability risk relates to the Group’s ability to refinance its borrowings at the end of their terms  
or to secure additional financing where necessary. The Group maintains relationships with a range of lenders and maintains sufficient 
headroom through cash and committed borrowings. On 30 September 2017, the Group had available headroom of £268.6m. 
(d) House price risk – The cash flows arising from the Group’s financial interest in property assets (CHARM) and the Tricomm 
Housing portfolio are related to the movement in value of the underlying property assets and, therefore, are subject to movements 
in house prices. However, consistent with the Group’s approach to house price risk across its portfolio of trading and investment 
properties, the Group does not seek to eliminate this risk as it is a fundamental part of the Group’s business model.
(e) Capital risk management – The Board manages the Group’s capital through the regular review of: cash flow projections; the 
ability of the Group to meet contractual commitments; covenant tests; dividend cover; and gearing. The current capital structure of 
the Group comprises a mix of debt and equity. Debt is both current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings as set out 
in the consolidated statement of financial position. Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as set out in 
the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Group loans and borrowings have associated covenant requirements with respect to loan to value and interest cover ratios. The 
Board regularly reviews all current and projected future levels to monitor anticipated compliance and available headroom against 
key thresholds. Loan to value is reviewed in the context of the Board’s view of markets, the prospects of, and risks relating to, the 
portfolio and the recurring cash flows of the business. The Group is now operating within a range of gearing of 40–45%, which it 
considers to be appropriate in the medium term.
The Group monitors its cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’) on a regular basis. At 30 September 2017, the 
weighted average cost of debt was 3.4% (2016: 3.9%). Investment and development opportunities are evaluated using a risk adjusted 
WACC in order to ensure long-term shareholder value is created.
126 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 29. Pension costs
Accounting policy
i) Defined contribution pension scheme – Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised 
as an expense in the income statement in the period to which they relate.
ii) Defined benefit pension scheme – The Group currently contributes to a defined benefit pension scheme that was closed to 
new members and future accrual of benefits in 2003. The full deficit in the scheme was recognised in the statement of financial 
position as at 1 October 2004.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the 
Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each statement of financial position date by a qualified 
actuary, also under the Projected Unit Credit Method, for the purpose of determining the amounts to be reflected in the Group’s 
financial statements under IAS 19.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement 
of financial position date less the fair value of scheme assets. The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best 
estimate of future benefit outgoings (allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for 
deferred members and annual pension increases for all members) and then discounting to the statement of financial position date.
There are no current or past service costs as the scheme is closed to new members and future accrual. The net interest amount, 
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability, is reflected in the income statement each year. 
Actuarial gains and losses net of deferred income tax are reflected in other comprehensive income each year.
(a) Defined contribution scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately 
from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further 
contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current 
and prior periods. Pension arrangements for Directors are disclosed in the report of the Remuneration Committee and the Directors’ 
Remuneration report on pages 62 to 78. The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by 
the Group. The charge of £0.9m (2016: £1.0m) is included within employee remuneration in Note 11. 
(b) Defined benefit scheme
In addition to the above, the Group also operates a final salary defined benefit pension scheme, the BPT Limited Retirement Benefits 
Scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by Trustees and are invested with Rathbones Investment 
Management Limited, an independent investment manager. Pension benefits are linked to the members’ final pensionable salaries 
and service at their retirement date (or date of leaving if earlier). The Trustees are responsible for running the scheme in accordance 
with the scheme’s trust deed and rules, which sets out their powers. The Trustees of the scheme are required to act in the best 
interests of the beneficiaries of the scheme. There is a requirement that at least one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the 
members of the scheme. 
There are three categories of pension scheme members:
• Active members: currently employed by the Group. Note no benefits have accrued since 30 June 2003, although active members 
retain a final salary link.
• Deferred members: former employees of the Group.
• Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit payments (allowing for future salary 
increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members)  
and then discounting to the statement of financial position date. In the period up to retirement, benefits receive increases linked to 
Consumer Prices Index (‘CPI’) inflation (subject to a cap of no more than 5% p.a.). After retirement, benefits receive fixed increases  
of 5% p.a. The valuation method used is known as the Projected Unit Credit Method. The approximate overall duration of the 
scheme’s defined benefit obligation as at 30 September 2017 was 20 years.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the results of the actuarial valuation carried out as at 1 July 2016, 
updated to 30 September 2017 , by a qualified independent actuary.

Risks
Through the scheme, the Group is exposed to a number of risks:
• Asset volatility: the scheme’s defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond 
yields; however, the scheme also invests in equities. These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, 
but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
• Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the scheme’s defined benefit obligation; however,  
this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings. 
• Inflation risk: some of the scheme’s defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher 
defined benefit obligation (subject to the appropriate caps in place). The majority of the scheme’s assets are either unaffected 
 by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
• Life expectancy: if scheme members live longer than expected, the scheme’s benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing 
the scheme’s defined benefit obligation.
The Trustees and Group manage risks in the scheme through the following strategies:
• Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact  
on the overall level of assets.
• Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.

Future funding obligation 
The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years. The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was 
performed by the Actuary for the Trustees as at 1 July 2016. This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of £3.6m. As a result  
of this valuation, the Group agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees to pay additional contributions to eliminate the deficit  
by 30 April 2022. Based on this plan, the Company expects to pay £0.6m p.a. to the scheme, until 30 April 2022. 
In line with paragraph 23 of IFRIC 14, no additional liability is recognised as the additional contributions under the funding plan will 
reduce the future contributions payable into the scheme. 
Sensitivity analysis
Set out below is an analysis of how the scheme deficit would vary with changes to the key actuarial assumptions:
Discount rate movement of 0.25% p.a. Increase/decrease in deficit of 4.6%/4.3%
Salary movement of 0.25% p.a. Increase/decrease in deficit of 0. 1%
Life expectancies movement of one year Increase/decrease in deficit of 3%

30. Issued share capital
Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown  
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Acquisition of and investment in own shares
The Group acquires its own shares to enable it to meet its obligations under the various share schemes in operation. No gain or 
loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own shares. The acquisition cost 
of the shares is debited to an investment in own shares reserve within retained earnings. 
Where the Group buys back its own shares as treasury shares it adopts the accounting as described above. Where it subsequently 
cancels them, issued share capital is reduced by the nominal value of the shares cancelled and this same amount is transferred to  
the capital redemption reserve.

During the year, The Grainger Employee Benefit Trust has not acquired any shares (2016: none acquired). The Group paid £0.3m 
(2016: £0.6m) to the Share Incentive Plan during the year for the purchase of matching shares and free shares in the scheme. The  
total cost of acquiring own shares of £0.3m (2016: £0.6m) has been deducted from retained earnings within Shareholders’ equity. 
As at 30 September 2017, share capital included 1,240,060 (2016: 1,733,127) shares held by The Grainger Employee Benefit Trust and 
1,506,300 (2016: 1,506,300) shares held by Grainger plc as treasury shares. The total of these shares is 2,746,360 (2016: 3,239,427)

31. Share-based payments 
Accounting policy
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans comprising awards under a Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’), a Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’), a Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) and a Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) scheme. The fair value of 
the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares and options is recognised as an employee expense. The total 
amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and options granted. For 
market-based conditions, the probability of vesting is taken into account in the fair value calculation and no revision is made to the 
number of shares or options expected to vest. For non-market conditions, each year the Group revises its estimate of the number  
of options or shares that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income 
statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Awards that are subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model. 
Awards not subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
When options are exercised the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital 
(nominal value) and share premium.

these awards is based on the assumptions relating to previous LTIP awards. Please see section 6 of the remuneration report on page 73 for further details. 
(b) DBP scheme
Awards granted under the DBP scheme have no specific performance conditions other than the Company meeting its target  
for operating profit before valuation movements and non-recurring items (‘OPBVM’) and employees in the scheme continuing  
to be employed. There is a three-year vesting period from the date of grant. One-third of the awards vest at the end of each year. 
Participants can choose to exercise their awards on vesting or to retain their awards within the plan until the end of the third year  
at which point a 50% matching element is added to their award entitlement. 
In addition to the normal DBP scheme, an enhanced DBP scheme (‘EDBP’) is also provided. The enhanced scheme operates in exactly 
the same way as the normal DBP scheme except that if participants retain their awards within the plan until the end of the fifth year, 
a further additional 50% matching award is added to their award entitlement. Awards under the DBP/EDBP have been valued based 
on the share price at the date of the award less the dividend yield at the award date as there is no entitlement to dividends during the 
vesting period.

36. Operating leases
Accounting policy
i) Group as lessor – Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The net present 
value of ground rents receivable is, in the opinion of the Directors, immaterial. Accordingly, ground rents receivable are taken to 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Properties leased out to tenants are included in the 
statement of financial position as either investment property or as trading property under inventories. 
ii) Group as lessee – The Group occupies a number of its offices as a lessee. After a review of all of its occupational leases, the 
Directors have concluded that all such leases are operating leases. Payments, including prepayments, made under operating leases 
(net of any incentives from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
(a) Group as lessor
The future aggregate minimum lease payments due to the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:
2017 
£m
2016
£m
Operating lease payments due:
Not later than one year 3.0 2.6
Later than one year and not later than five years 8.5 6.9
Later than five years 96.1 73.3
107.6 82.8
There are no contingent rents recognised within net rental income in 2017 or 2016 relating to properties where the Group acts as a 
lessor of assets under operating leases. A significant proportion of the Group’s non-cancellable operating leases relate to regulated 
tenancies under which tenants have the right to remain in a property for the remainder of their lives. It is therefore not possible to 
estimate the timing of future minimum lease payments in respect of these regulated tenancies and so these are excluded from the 
above analysis.

The future aggregate minimum lease payments payable by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

4.7 5.6
Operating lease payments represent the lease payments made in the year relating to renting of office space used by the Group,  
car leases under contract hire arrangements and operating lease payments relating to office equipment such as photocopiers.  
Leases relating to office space used by the Group have initial terms of varying lengths, between one and ten years. 
Rent reviews generally take place every five years. Contract hire car leases generally have a three-year term. 
37 . Contingent liabilities
The properties in certain subsidiary companies forming a ‘guarantee Group’ with a market value of £1,348.0m provide the security  
for the Group’s core debt facility. 
Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC have provided guarantees under performance bonds relating to the Group’s UK 
Development division. As at 30 September 2017 , total guarantees amounted to £3. 1m (2016: £2.3m).
There is uncertainty relating to the future of the site at Curzon Park in which the Group has a 50% joint venture interest. The proposed 
High Speed Rail Link (‘HS2’) from London to Birmingham indicates that the potential route will cover at least part of our development 
site at Curzon Park in Birmingham. We are assessing the long-term impact with our advisers and aim to collaborate with other affected 
owners in the area as well as with HS2 Ltd, the company responsible for developing and promoting this new rail link. Should the value 
of the site, together with any compensation received, be insufficient to recover the carrying value of our investment, the Group 
may incur further charges in excess of those provided in these financial statements, in respect of obligations to the joint venture. 
38. Capital commitments
The Group has current commitments under a number of its PRS projects totalling £136.2m as at 30 September 2017 (2016: £117 . 1m).
39. Post balance sheet events
On 12 October 2017 , the Group agreed a new ten-year £75m loan with Rothesay Life at a fixed rate. Including this financing activity, 
our hedging stands at 87% and our headroom increases to £343.6m.
On 23 November 2017 , the Group agreed to forward fund and acquire a PRS, build-to-rent development, Gilder’s Yard in Birmingham, 
comprising 156 private rental homes for £28m. 
Also on 23 November 2017 , outstanding conditions relating to the £80m 375 home forward funding acquisition in Gore Street, 
Manchester were finalised and the scheme became fully secured. 
On 24 November 2017 , the Group acquired a stabilised portfolio of three blocks in Manchester, comprising 192 PRS homes for  
£26m (the Tribe portfolio).

Notes to the parent company financial statements
1. Company accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (‘FRS 101’). The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost 
convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The application of FRS 101 has enabled the Company to take advantage of certain disclosure exemptions that would have been 
required had the Company adopted International Financial Reporting Standards in full. The exemptions that have been applied  
in the preparation of these financial statements are as follows:
• A cash flow statement and related notes have not been presented.
• Disclosures in respect of new standards and interpretations that have been issued but which are not yet effective have not  
been provided. 
• Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries have not been made. 
• Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures have not been made. 
The Company has taken the exemption allowed under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from the requirement to present  
its own profit and loss account. The loss for the year was £18.9m (2016: £19.7m). These financial statements present information 
about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group. 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation  
to the Company’s financial statements. 
(b) Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost less provision for impairment based upon an assessment of the net 
recoverable amount of each investment. To the extent that the assessment of the recoverable amount improves due to changes  
in economic conditions, impairment provisions are reversed, with all provision movements recognised in profit and loss.
(c) Tax
Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits or losses at the current rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the end of the reporting 
period, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future 
have occurred at that date.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences  
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
(d) Own shares including treasury shares
Transactions of The Grainger Employee Benefit Trusts are included in the Company’s financial statements. The purchase of shares  
in the Company by each trust and any treasury shares bought back by the Company are debited direct to equity.
(e) Share-based payments
Under the share-based compensation arrangements set out in Note 31 to the Group financial statements, employees of Grainger 
Employees Limited have been awarded options and conditional shares in the Company. These share-based arrangements have 
been treated as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements. In the Company’s financial statements, the share-based 
payment charge has been added to the cost of investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
(f) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value  
is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.

but is not expected to be repaid within the next 12 months. Interest payable and similar charges for the year amounted to £9.9m  
(2016: £10.0m). All other amounts owed to Group undertakings are unsecured, bear no interest, and are repayable on demand.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1. Introduction
The EPRA Best Practices Recommendations (‘EPRA BPR’) were issued by EPRA’s Reporting and Accounting Committee in August 
2011 and the guidance was subsequently updated in November 2016. Included within EPRA BPR are six EPRA performance measures 
deemed to be of key importance to investors in property companies and which aim to encourage more consistent and widespread 
disclosure. The EPRA performance measures are set out below:
Performance measure Definition
1) EPRA Earnings Recurring earnings from core operational activities. This is a key measure of a company’s underlying operating 
results providing an indication of the extent to which current dividend payments are supported by earnings.
2) EPRA NAV Net asset value adjusted to include properties and other investment interests at fair value and to exclude 
certain items not expected to crystallise in a long-term property business model. This measure is consistent 
with NAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 5 to the Group financial statements.
3) EPRA NNNAV EPRA NAV adjusted to include the fair values of i) financial instruments, ii) debt and iii) deferred taxes.  
This measure is consistent with NNNAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 5  
to the Group financial statements.
4i) EPRA Net Initial Yield (‘NIY’) Annualised rental income based on cash rents at the balance sheet date, less non-recoverable property 
expenses, divided by the market value of the property, increased with (estimated) purchasers’ costs.
4ii) EPRA ‘topped-up’ yield This measure incorporates an adjustment to EPRA NIY in respect of the expiration of rent free periods  
(or other unexpired lease incentives such as discounted rent periods and step rents).
5) EPRA Vacancy Rate Estimated Market Rent Value (‘ERV’) of vacant space divided by ERV of the whole portfolio.
6) EPRA Cost Ratios This measure includes all administrative and operating expenses including share of joint ventures’ overheads 
and operating expenses, net of any service fees, all divided by gross rental income.
Grainger is supportive of EPRA’s initiative and, in this report, is disclosing against five of the EPRA measures: EPRA Earnings,  
EPRA NAV, EPRA NNNAV, EPRA NIY and EPRA Vacancy Rate. EPRA topped-up NIY is not appropriate to Grainger’s business.  
The EPRA Cost Ratios, too, is less relevant to Grainger as it is distorted by the fact that in the reversionary portfolio rental levels  
are at a sub-market level. 
In relation to EPRA NIY and EPRA Vacancy Rate, the figures shown are in respect of the Grainger wholly-owned market rented assets 
only. Not included in these numbers are Grainger’s wholly-owned reversionary assets or any assets within joint ventures or associates.
The numbers presented in the tables below for EPRA Earnings, EPRA Earnings per share, EPRA NIY and EPRA Vacancy Rate relate  
to continuing operations only.
The EPRA measures being reported and the calculation of EPRA Earnings, EPRA NAV, EPRA NNNAV and EPRA NIY are set out below:
 2017 2016 
EPRA Earnings £57.6m £41.8m
EPRA Earnings per share 14.0p 10.1p
EPRA NAV £1,434.5m £1,379.5m
EPRA NAV per share 343p 330p

* Sale of trading property is a fundamental part of Grainger’s business model. Therefore, it is not appropriate to show any measure of earnings that excludes profit  
on sale of trading property and so no adjustment has been made for this in the table above. The adjustment made under this heading in both years relates to an 
impairment provision made against trading stock.

* The Grainger measures of NAV and NAV per share disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements is equal to the EPRA NAV presented above. The adjustment to add the 
value of the Group’s own shares is recognised as these shares do have a market value and this has been the historical basis of the Group’s calculation. In addition, the 
number of shares used in the NAV calculation is the total number of shares in issue including those held by the Company in treasury or trust for the purposes of settling 
future share awards. This should be a close representation of the fully diluted number of shares and so is very unlikely to produce materially different NAV measures.
