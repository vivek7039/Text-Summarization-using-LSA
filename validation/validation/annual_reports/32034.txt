IBC Five year summary
IBC Advisors and Company information
Frontier’s founder David Braben began his work 
in games back in 1982 when he co-authored the 
seminal game Elite. David founded Frontier in 
1994 in order to build a team to continue creating 
high quality, innovative games in the rapidly 
evolving games industry with an ambition that 
only teams of skilled professionals can deliver.
Frontier has thrived over the subsequent three decades. 
We have built a uniquely diverse catalogue of games 
– enabled by our Cobra technology – that has defi ned 
genres, earned critical acclaim and won a place in the 
hearts of millions of players.
Having worked with a succession of top publishers we 
now self-publish our own high quality, innovative games 
of different genres that embody our world-class expertise 
across all major gaming formats.
BUILDING ON OUR 
SELF-PUBLISHING SUCCESS 
After successfully proving our ability 
to launch franchises, we are scaling up 
to deliver roughly one major launch 
per year and achieve our long-term 
ambition of becoming a global leader 
in entertainment. HIGHLIGHTS
TRANSITION COMPLETED
Operational and strategic highlights
• The Company’s transition to a fully self-publishing 
business model was completed in November 2016 
with the successful launch of Frontier’s second 
franchise, Planet Coaster. In July 2017 Planet Coaster’s 
first paid additional downloadable content was launched.
• Elite Dangerous, which launched in December 2014, 
continues to perform well. In June 2017 the franchise’s 
addressable audience was further expanded with 
release on the Sony PlayStation 4 platform.
• Frontier’s next major game franchise, based on 
the Jurassic World movie franchise, was revealed 
in August 2017. Jurassic World Evolution is planned 
for launch in summer 2018 alongside the movie 
launch of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.
• £17.7 million was raised in July 2017 through a strategic 
investment from Tencent, a leading Internet and 
interactive entertainment company based in China. 
This will improve and accelerate Frontier’s growth 
into the key Chinese market and help drive scale-up 
of the business.
Financial highlights
• Total revenue grew 75% to £37.4 million 
(FY16: £21.4 million) as the launch of the Planet Coaster 
franchise in November 2016 drove a step-up in 
annual sales.
• Self-publishing revenue of £36.4 million 
(FY16: £21.1 million) accounted for 97% of total 
revenue with the balance being related to our legacy 
work-for-hire business.
• Operating profit grew by 550% to £7.8 million 
(FY16: £1.2 million) representing an operating 
margin of 21% (FY16: 6%) and EBITDA increased 
to £12.7 million (FY16: £4.9 million).
• Operating cash flow (operating profit excluding 
non-cash items, less investments in franchises and 
other intangible assets) was an inflow of £3.4 million 
(FY16: outflow of £2.7 million).
• Cash balances increased £4.0 million during the year 
to £12.6 million (FY16: £8.6 million). Following the 
£17.7 million strategic investment by Tencent the 
Company’s cash balance was £27.5 million on 
31 August 2017.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 01 EVOLVING OUR BUSINESS
Frontier’s objective of transitioning to a business-to-consumer video game 
developer with multiple self-published revenue generating franchises has 
been successfully completed. The launch of our second franchise, Planet 
Coaster, combined with continued strong performance from Elite Dangerous 
drove a step-up in all financial measures. Our third franchise, based on the 
Jurassic World movie franchise, is on track for launch in summer 2018. 
After successfully proving our ability to launch franchises, our ambition is to 
continue our evolution to create a self-publishing multi-franchise success story. 
Ongoing investment in our people, organisation and facilities, supported by the 
proceeds from the £17.7 million strategic investment by Tencent completed in 
July 2017, will enable the business to continue scaling up.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 02 SCALING UP
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
 “I AM DELIGHTED WITH OUR 
RESULTS AND EXCITED ABOUT 
OUR FUTURE.”
I am pleased to report on a very satisfying 
year in Frontier’s continued development. 
We completed the transition of our 
business to our chosen multi-franchise 
self-publishing model with the successful 
launch of our second franchise, 
Planet Coaster, and we are excited 
about the potential for our third 
franchise, Jurassic World Evolution. 
Meanwhile, Elite Dangerous continues 
to grow its addressable audience and 
is performing well.
Our long-term ambition is to become a 
global leader in entertainment and we are 
scaling up to continue our multi-franchise 
success story. Our recent strong self-publishing 
performance, as well as our long history of 
delivery and capability, positions us very 
well to achieve this. We have established a 
scale-up plan to achieve our next step which 
includes investments in people, organisation, 
geographical distribution and facilities. To 
support these plans we took a strategic 
investment from Tencent in July 2017, 
raising £17.7 million. This will enable us to 
further deepen the success of our franchises, 
reach new audiences, enrich the audience 
experience and continue to grow their number.
We continue to develop our organisation 
to fulfi l our goals. In particular, we are 
focusing on our management teams and 
our infrastructure. As noted in last year’s 
report, Jonathan Milner stepped down 
from the Board as a Non-Executive Director 
in July 2016 and Charles Cotton joined in 
his place. I would like to again express my 
thanks to Jonathan, who was a great 
help during our transition. Charles has 
a successful worldwide track record in 
high-growth technology companies and has 
been a valuable source of advice and wisdom 
since he joined the Board. In April 2017 we 
further strengthened the Board with the 
appointment of Alex Bevis as CFO and 
Company Secretary. Alex brings extensive 
board experience as VP Finance and CFO 
of high technology growth companies from 
his work at CSR plc and Xaar plc. 
I am delighted with our results and excited 
about our future. On behalf of the Board, 
I take this opportunity to thank our people 
for their dedication, engagement, skill and 
professionalism that has produced such 
pleasing progress for the Company.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 03 CREATING FRANCHISES
In 2013 we set out our plan to transition 
the business from work-for-hire to 
multi-franchise self-publication. The 
rise of digital distribution was the 
catalyst for our change, and our 
extensive experience in the games 
industry gave us the confi dence to 
make the switch.
Four years later I am delighted with 
our achievements; we have overcome 
a number of challenges to transform 
our business model with two successful 
franchises, Planet Coaster and 
Elite Dangerous already in the market, 
and more to come. Our next major 
development, Jurassic World Evolution, 
is progressing well, and is scheduled 
for launch in summer 2018. I would like 
to thank our amazing team who have 
achieved so much since our decision to 
transition our business four years ago.
THE GAMES MARKET
We operate in an exciting industry. The games 
market is now the premier form of 
entertainment worth over $100bn per year, 
in the wider $300bn entertainment industry. 
That’s larger than each of the fi lm, TV or music 
industries, with the games sector overtaking 
fi lm in 2017. The games sector is growing 
fast, increasing at 8% per year, with TV 
experiencing a decline of 8%.
Today the games market is split into three 
roughly comparable sectors by revenue: 
PC, console and mobile. However, the 
characteristics of each sector are quite 
different. Frontier has chosen to prioritise 
the PC and console sectors where audiences 
value high quality games, and that quality is 
a key determinant of success. In contrast the 
mobile sector is overcrowded, so success 
can be a lot more hit-and-miss.
The whole market is moving rapidly to digital 
downloads. Mobile and PC are now almost 
100% digital, and consoles are at approximately 
50% but are quickly moving to digital downloads, 
as focus moves from older consoles to the 
new generation, and older business models 
are gradually replaced.
There are already some very large and well 
established companies in the games market; 
for example EA and Activision Blizzard both 
based in the US, who have a combined value 
of over $80 billion. The nature of our industry 
is change and evolution, and it is interesting 
to see the rapid development of companies 
like Valve Inc (with their Steam platform) in 
the US and Tencent in China, based on their 
focus on the opportunities that digital 
distribution presents. It is also clear that 
the model Frontier has already adopted 
– supporting our games continually with 
community and regular updates: essentially 
‘games as a service’ – is working very well, 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
 “I WOULD LIKE TO THANK 
OUR AMAZING TEAM WHO 
HAVE ACHIEVED SO MUCH 
SINCE OUR DECISION TO 
TRANSITION OUR BUSINESS 
FOUR YEARS AGO.”
DAVID BRABEN 
FOUNDER AND CEO
and has meant that the two franchises 
already released have continued to perform.
STRATEGY 
We believe that publishing our own franchises 
is the best way to maximise the benefi t of 
our core skills and our assets and our COBRA 
technology platform. The Company’s focus 
is on developing top quality self-published 
PC and console titles for digital distribution, 
as together these segments represent the 
majority of the available market by revenue. 
Generally the audiences on these platforms 
value high quality games, and quality is one 
of Frontier’s key development strengths.
We will also continue to follow our repeatable 
model; to create further franchises in potentially 
successful but under-served sectors where 
we have key expertise and knowledge and/
or IP, in order to further build our revenue 
pipeline over the long term.
Our strategic objective is to create long-term 
sustainable growth through success in a 
multi-franchise self-publication business 
model. Our strategic focus is on two key areas:
• developing our business to achieve 
repeatable success; and
• creating and managing franchises
Further detail is set out in the strategy 
section of this report, but I’d like to briefl y 
comment on the fi rst area.
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 04 We believe that developing our business to 
achieve repeatable success requires scale. 
Over time we aim to double our output, from 
roughly one major launch every two years, 
to one every 12 months or so. To do this we 
will grow our capability to accelerate our 
progress, although it does not mean we 
need to double our workforce. We have 
established a scale-up plan, to expand 
our team and to invest in facilities and 
organisational development.
Strong partnerships have always been vital 
to our success. In our past as a work-for-hire 
developer we worked successfully with many 
prestigious industry partners including Atari, 
Lucasfilm, Microsoft and Sony, and became 
well-known in the games industry for our 
development track-record of innovation, 
quality and delivery.
Our new business model of self-publication 
has required us to build new partnerships. 
Our commercial partners now include 
Valve Inc (with its Steam platform), Humble 
Store and the distribution channel teams 
at both Microsoft and Sony; we are also 
excited to be partnering with Universal on 
the Jurassic World Evolution project.
I look forward to working with Frontier’s 
people and our partners to build on our 
early self-publishing success and establish 
a new long-term, self-published track record 
of quality, innovation and delivery as we 
scale-up to create a multi-franchise 
success story.
DAVID BRABEN
FOUNDER AND CEO
7 September 2017
CURRENT TRADING 
AND OUTLOOK
The Board have been encouraged by trading since the year end (31 May 2017). 
The number of players of Frontier’s games continues to grow. In August 2017, 
Planet Coaster, which launched in November 2016, passed 1 million cumulative 
unit sales, and Elite Dangerous, which launched in December 2014, exceeded 
2.75 million cumulative franchise unit sales. 
We have further expanded the addressable audience for Elite Dangerous by 
launching on PlayStation 4 in June 2017. During the summer Planet Coaster 
and Elite Dangerous participated in successful price promotions on our major 
distribution channels with the Steam and Xbox Summer Sale events. These 
events were in turn supported by major updates for each game as we followed 
our strategy of continuing to further enhance the experiences they deliver. 
We launched our first in-game Paid Downloadable Content (PDLC) for Planet 
Coaster in July 2017, and announced that Elite Dangerous 2.4 ‘The Return’ will 
be released in September 2017 which supports the on-going story arc related 
to Thargoids, the franchise’s first alien species.
In August 2017 we announced that our third franchise, Jurassic World Evolution, 
will launch in summer 2018 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One simultaneously. 
In 2015, Universal Pictures’ Jurassic World became one of the biggest blockbusters 
in cinema history, grossing more than $1.67billion at the global box office on its way 
to becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time. Jurassic World Evolution will 
launch in the year that Universal Pictures’ celebrates the 25th anniversary of the 
original Jurassic Park film, and the next chapter of the franchise Jurassic World: 
Fallen Kingdom will be in theatres June 2018.
We anticipate that the next step-up in our financial performance will be delivered 
by the launch of Jurassic World Evolution in summer 2018. The Board currently 
expect that the majority of initial revenues from this new franchise will fall into 
the financial year ending 31 May 2019, as the Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom 
movie is released in June 2018. The Board therefore anticipates that trading in 
the current financial year, the twelve months ending 31 May 2018, will principally 
be based on sales from the Elite Dangerous and Planet Coaster franchises.
The Board is excited about the growth opportunities ahead in the coming years, as 
existing franchises continue to be strengthened and new franchises are developed 
and launched. Frontier is developing, evolving and investing in our people, 
organisational structure and facilities to effectively create, develop, market and 
sell even more distinct franchises aimed at different audience segments to achieve 
the Company’s ambition to create a self-publishing multi-franchise success story.
STRATEGIC REPORT
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 05 DEVELOPING OUR BUSINESS TO 
ACHIEVE REPEATABLE SUCCESS
We invest our development resources in games with strong 
franchise potential. In order to maximise the return on our 
core skills and assets we target game genres where we 
have established expertise and intellectual property.
OUR STRATEGY AND BUSINESS MODEL
How we create and nurture our franchises
a level more appropriate to the local economy, 
as we did with Planet Coaster in China in 
February 2017. In particular we note the 
growing Chinese market for premium PC 
games. Importantly, the recent strategic 
investment in our business by Tencent will 
allow us to more easily take advantage of 
their unparalleled expertise and distribution 
capabilities in their home market for 
our franchises.
Major new releases will be key drivers of 
revenue. Because of the small number of 
franchises and relatively infrequent major 
releases Frontier is currently able to make, 
revenue is sensitive to the specific schedule 
of such releases and may therefore exhibit 
‘stepped’ behaviour, as those new franchises 
are released. In the future, as we successfully 
scale the number and frequency of franchise 
releases, annual revenue growth should 
accelerate and our dependency on each 
major release should decrease. 
Our development process uses our proprietary 
COBRA development tools and technology 
to facilitate innovative features and the 
creation of top quality self-published games 
with strong differentiation for the PC and 
console audiences. Our control of this 
technology also removes risk related to 
ongoing access to third party licensed 
technology alternatives, risk relating to 
ability to fix uncovered problems in that 
technology and lack of control over the 
delivery dates and feature roadmap of such 
solutions. It also facilitates rapid response 
to market opportunities like support for 
virtual reality and augmented reality.
We continue to assess the distribution 
channels and platforms we use to achieve 
an optimal addressable audience for each 
game, and the monetisation strategy for 
each franchise. We participate in price 
promotions on each of the distribution 
platforms we use for each of our games as 
appropriate to its life-cycle stage, allowing 
us to reach the widest possible audience.
We also monitor the geographical performance 
of our franchises and will continue to look 
for opportunities to tailor our local price to 
We continue to invest in our organisation 
to create a model of repeatable success. 
To accelerate our progress and increase 
the frequency of launches we are scaling 
up our organisation, not just in terms of staff 
numbers, but also in terms of leadership skills, 
training, organisational structure and process.
We are also investing in facilities. It is our 
belief that having all our people in Cambridge 
working together in a single building will 
maximise our operational effectiveness 
and efficiency, and in spring 2018 we will 
achieve this when we move into new office 
space on the Cambridge Science Park.
Our development focus is on PC and console 
titles, as together these segments represent 
the majority of the available market by revenue 
and generally the audiences on these 
platforms have valued games that exhibit 
Frontier’s key development strengths.
We use online channels to create and engage 
with a fan-base or community during game 
development, which provides a valuable 
source of feedback and an enthusiastic 
community for each franchise before 
first release.

FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 06 In order to maximise the return on our core 
skills and assets we target game genres on PC 
and console platforms where we believe we 
can both i) deliver high quality, differentiated 
offerings using our established expertise and 
intellectual property, and ii) have a strong 
chance of successful market entry, based on 
past experience or knowledge of that sector.
We use this repeatable model to invest 
our resources with the intention of creating 
world-class games with strong franchise 
potential, and plan for strong post-launch 
franchise support to further help realise 
this potential.
We will continue to grow the capacity and 
capability of our organisation in both commercial 
and development areas in order to further 
the successful evolution of our franchises.
As part of this process, we will explore 
potential partnerships and licensing 
opportunities. We will also continue to 
review potential acquisition targets that 
could augment our capacity or add new 
capabilities as well as IP that may help 
us achieve our goals.
We will endeavour to enhance and expand 
our franchises and grow their audiences using 
appropriate additional products, platforms, 
media, marketing, distribution channels and 
charging models through investing in the 
necessary people, organisation, resources 
and infrastructure.

We are already scaling up for the future

whilst continuing to develop our existing 
franchises. As well as Jurassic World Evolution 
being in full production we are in the early 
stages of planning our next two, as yet 
unannounced franchises.
All future franchises will be selected using 
the same approach described above that was 
used for Elite Dangerous, Planet Coaster 
and Jurassic World Evolution. The use of 
external IP in Jurassic World Evolution does 
not imply that this will be the case for all 
our future franchises; we will continue to 
review all possibilities to determine the 
optimum strategy for each franchise on a 
case-by-case basis. We are building a broad 
portfolio of franchises, each different to the 
last, and each with the capabilities to expand 
over time, as we have already seen with 
Elite Dangerous and Planet Coaster.

The Horizons season of expansions
Each expansion offers new headline gameplay features 
plus a large number of quality of life and other tweaks, 
ﬁ xes and improvements, and there is an accompanying 
‘1.x’ update to the base game.
The release of 2.4 ‘The Return’ will complete the Horizons 
season of expansions. Horizons will continue to be sold as 
a substantial expansion product with all content available 
at the time of purchase. 
2.0 2.1
Elite Dangerous is now in its third year of 
full release. We have continued to release 
expansions in the Elite Dangerous: Horizons 
season, and corresponding updates to the 
original Elite Dangerous game, simultaneously 
on both PC and Xbox One platforms following 
the launch of Horizons on Xbox One in 
June 2016.
Simultaneous releases on all supported 
platforms is planned to continue going forward, 
including Sony’s PlayStation 4 following the 
franchise’s debut on the platform in June 2017, 
after the end of the ﬁ nancial year, which 
signiﬁ cantly expanded its addressable audience.
These updates add to the quality of the game, 
renew the interest of existing players, and 
also generate additional coverage resulting 
in new sales. The attach rate of Elite Dangerous: 
Horizons to the base game continues to 
grow steadily, helped by the regular updates.
Having the base game and Horizons seasons 
of expansions in the market covers mid-price 
entry to the franchise with an upgrade path, 
and we bundle the two together with in-game 
digital items to create a Deluxe edition for a 
premium price point entry. We believe each 
product in the franchise offers great value, 
and our further in-game monetisation 
avoids ‘pay-to-win’ game mechanics.
The Elite Dangerous franchise continues to 
perform strongly and we continue to focus 
on enhancements within the strategy of 
further improving perceived quality and 
sentiment, adding signiﬁ cant long-term 
new features and supporting the unique 
evolving player-driven story, which all 
players experience together. We expect 
to further expand the player base over 
the next ﬁ nancial year, adding new 
content and increasing the audience.

Continued expansion after a successful launch
In addition to major free expansions, in July 2017 we 
released our ﬁ rst paid downloadable content (PDLC) for 
Planet Coaster. As with Elite Dangerous, this follows an 
in-game monetisation model that avoids ‘pay-to-win’ 
mechanics. We will continue to expand Planet Coaster’s 
PDLC offering, as we have with Elite Dangerous. 
We believe Planet Coaster offers great value at its current 
price-point and we anticipate franchise revenue over 
multiple years, similar to that seen with our RollerCoaster 
Tycoon 3 game from 2004 in the same genre. 
OUR FRANCHISES CONTINUED

after a short Beta period, achieving the global #1 position 
on the Steam distribution channel and continuing to sell 
strongly through the subsequent holiday period. 
In accordance with our strategy we began to release 
free updates, each of which add headline features 
but also expand and improve different creative 
and management aspects of the game. 
This update strategy is intended to further improve 
perceived quality and sentiment by adding signiﬁ cant 
long-term new features. Such updates add to the quality 
of the game, renew the interest of existing players, and 
also generate additional coverage resulting in new sales. 
WINTER UPDATE
DECEMBER 2016
In addition to new rides being 
added, there were further 
improvements to streamline 
management operations within 
parks, new scenarios, new shops, 
new transport rides and a new 
snowy winter theme.
SPRING UPDATE
APRIL 2017
Added security guard staff 
members and go-karts tracked 
rides for players to use in their 
parks, along with more rides, 
coasters, scenarios and further 
management improvements, as 
well as doubling the maximum 
size of blueprints that can be 
shared via Steam workshop to 
4,000 pieces.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 11 OUR FRANCHISES CONTINUED
Our third franchise, Jurassic World Evolution, 
was identiﬁ ed using the same approach 
described above that we used for Elite 
Dangerous and Planet Coaster. Our original 
concept for Jurassic World Evolution would 
leverage our management and builder game 
expertise, plus our unrivalled expertise 
implementing believable in-game animals 
from games such as Dog’s Life, Kinectimals 
and Zoo Tycoon. In this case we felt that 
being able to use the Jurassic World IP 
would signiﬁ cantly beneﬁ t awareness with 
the next ﬁ lm in the franchise to be released 
in June 2018, around the 25th anniversary 
of the original Jurassic Park ﬁ lm.
Jurassic World Evolution was announced in 
August 2017, for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 
and will be released in summer 2018.
Jurassic World Evolution evolves players’ 
relationship with the Jurassic World ﬁ lm 
franchise, placing them in control of 
operations on the legendary islands of Isla 
Nublar and the surrounding islands of the 
Muertes Archipelago. Players will create 
and manage their own Jurassic World as 
they bioengineer new dinosaur breeds, 
and construct attractions, containment and 
research facilities. Every choice leads to a 
different path, and spectacular challenges 
arise when ‘life ﬁ nds a way.’
Jurassic World Evolution will be Frontier’s 
ﬁ rst self-published title (although not our 
ﬁ rst game) to debut on PC, PlayStation and 
Xbox simultaneously, and the ﬁ rst to beneﬁ t 
from such major marketing events in 2018 
as the celebration of 25 years of Jurassic 
Park and the launch of the next ﬁ lm in the 
franchise, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.
We will reveal more details about Jurassic 
World Evolution at FrontierExpo in London 
in October 2017, our ﬁ rst community event 
dedicated to all of Frontier’s franchises.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 12 STRATEGIC REPORT
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 13 OVERVIEW
The Company achieved a signifi cant step-up 
in fi nancial performance in the year ended 
31 May 2017, as the transition from a 
work-for-hire business model to multi-franchise 
self-publishing was completed through the 
launch of Planet Coaster in November 2016. 
The addition of this second franchise helped 
boost annual revenue by over 75% to 
£37.4 million and operating profi t grew 
by 550% to £7.8 million. Cash fl ow was also 
strong, with an increase of £4.0 million in 
the year to £12.6 million. Cash balances 
were further boosted by the £17.7 million 
strategic investment in July 2017; cash 
balances at 31 August 2017 stood at 
£27.5 million.
TRADING
Total annual revenue grew 75% to £37.4 million 
(FY16: £21.4 million) as the launch of the 
Planet Coaster franchise in November 2016 
drove a step-up in annual sales. The Elite 
Dangerous franchise continued to perform 
strongly in the year, supported by on-going 
developments to further improve quality, 
add new features and support the unique 
evolving player-driven story.
Self-publishing revenue accounted for 97% 
of sales (FY16: 99%) with the balance being 
related to our legacy work-for-hire business. 
This legacy revenue included COBRA licensing, 
as a publisher partner took up two options in 
FY17 under previous work-for-hire contracts 
to license COBRA to facilitate ports of existing 
games to new platforms. Licensing our COBRA 
technology to new customers is not a current 
focus and remains a future strategic 
opportunity that we will continue to evaluate.
Gross profi t grew to £27.4 million in the 
year (FY16: £16.3 million) with gross margin 
at 73% (FY16: 76%). The largest element of 
cost of sales is the margin payable to our 
digital distribution partners.
Gross research and development expenses 
in the period were £12.7 million (FY16: 
£12.6 million) with the majority of spend 
being internal staff costs. Capitalisation of 
development costs on franchise assets and 
other intangibles accounted for £9.6 million 
in FY17 (FY16: £8.9 million). Amortisation 
charges grew to £4.5 million (FY16: £3.3 million) 
following the launch of Planet Coaster 
in November 2016. 
Net research and development expenses 
recorded in the income statement in the year 
were therefore £7.6 million (FY16: £7.0 million), 
being gross spend, less capitalised costs, 
plus amortisation charges.
Sales, marketing and administrative 
expenses grew £3.9 million to £11.9 million 
(FY16: £8.0 million). The increase was due 
to a combination of factors; investments in 
staff, facilities and marketing, higher bonus

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
FINANCIAL REVIEW
ALEX BEVIS
CFO AND COMPANY 
SECRETARY
 “REVENUE GREW 75% 
AND OPERATING PROFIT 
INCREASED 550%”
charges and forward contract related 
foreign exchange losses.
The growth in revenue in the period 
resulted in a signifi cant increase in profi ts. 
Operating profi t grew by 550% to £7.8 million 
(FY16: £1.2 million) representing an 
operating margin of 21% (FY16: 6%) and 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) increased 
to £12.7 million (FY16: £4.9 million).
Corporation tax charges in the period were 
minimal overall at £0.1 million (FY16: a credit 
of £0.2 million) despite the growth in profi ts. 
This was due to a combination of brought 
forward tax losses and Video Games Tax Relief. 
Profi t after tax increased to £7.7 million 
(FY16: £1.4 million) and basic earnings per 
share increased by a similar proportion 
(FY17: 22.7 pence, FY16: 4.2 pence).
BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW
The Company continued to run a robust 
balance sheet during the fi nancial year, and 
this was further boosted by the strategic 
investment completed in July 2017.
Non-current intangible and tangible assets 
increased by £5.6 million to £22.6 million 
at 31 May 2017 (FY16: £17.0 million) as 
investments in franchise assets and other 
intangibles exceeded amortisation charges.
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 14 The balance of trade and other receivables 
was £2.9 million at the end of the period 
(FY16: £2.4 million), lower than the trade 
and other payables balance which totalled 
£4.9 million (FY16: £3.1 million). The increase 
in payables was in part due to a higher 
bonus provision following the strong 
growth in financial performance.
Total deferred income reduced to £1.4 million 
at the period end (FY16: £2.2 million) as a 
result of the launch of Planet Coaster, as 
pre-sales in the previous financial year 
had been deferred. 
Cash balances increased £4.0 million during 
the year to £12.6 million (FY16: £8.6 million). 
Operating cash flow (operating profit excluding 
non-cash items, less investments in franchises 
and other intangible assets) accounted for 
£3.4 million of the increase. (FY16: an operating 
cash outflow of £2.7 million).
Following the £17.7 million strategic investment 
by Tencent the Company’s cash balance was 
£27.5 million on 31 August 2017. In addition 
the Company has a £4 million overdraft facility 
with Barclays. Frontier’s scale-up plans, 
which include significant investments in 
people and facilities, are fully supported 
by existing financial resources.
SHARE ISSUES
Employees exercised options over 359,150 
Ordinary Shares during the 12 months to 
the end of May 2017. 241,150 of these 
Ordinary Shares were transferred under 
arrangements with the Employee Benefit 
Trust with the remaining 118,000 Ordinary 
Shares being newly issued shares. 
In July 2017 the company completed a 
strategic investment with Tencent Holdings 
Limited. Tencent acquired 3,386,252 newly 
issued Ordinary Shares at 523.2 pence per 
share generating proceeds of £17,716,870.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 15 The Group faces competitive, strategic and financial risks that are inherent in a 
rapidly growing emerging market. The executive team maintains the risk register and 
escalates the key risks for further consideration at full Board level on a regular basis.
The key business and financial risks for the Group are set out below:
EFFECTIVELY MANAGING OUR RISKS
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
DESCRIPTION MITIGATION CHANGE IN RISK
STAFF AVAILABILITY
If the Group does not have the correct numbers 
of people with the correct skills available, the 
execution of its business plan will be compromised.
The Group continues to prioritise direct recruitment 
and outreach. We have visibility of our future needs 
via a regularly reviewed plan of record, and undertake 
analysis of potential bottlenecks. We seek to minimise 
days lost to sickness via healthcare benefits and general 
morale and wellbeing initiatives. The Group is a Tier 2 
visa sponsor, to facilitate its objective to employ the best 
possible people from the worldwide talent pool. In 2017 
we have expanded our HR team to add dedicated talent 
acquisition resources. We also balance internal and 
external resources through outsourcing.
STAFF RETENTION
Staff departures could create staff and key  
skill/experience shortages and compromise 
the execution of the Group’s business plan.
Whilst there will unavoidably be some level of staff 
turnover, the Group believes that its attractive project 
portfolio, talented staff and good quality leadership 
make Frontier a place where talented people want 
to build their careers. We use our business success 
to deliver benefits to our people, and the Group is 
undertaking a programme of improving incentives 
and leadership skills which is intended to further 
enhance its attractiveness as an employer.
CYBERSECURITY
A breach of security could take many forms, 
and could significantly impact the business 
and impair our self-publishing plans.
Exposure includes that of failure of security at 
our partners including Amazon, Valve, Microsoft 
and Sony.
We review our security provisions regularly and believe 
them to be in accordance with industry best practices.
EXECUTION RISK
The Group has transitioned from a work-for-hire 
model to a multi-franchise self-publishing 
model. Whilst successful project execution 
is very important under both models, inherently  
both the rewards and the risks under a 
self-publishing model are probably greater.
Frontier has a long history of strong project execution. 
Nevertheless it is vital Frontier continues to push 
itself and so avoid complacency to retain its excellent 
execution record. It must continue to challenge its own 
internal assumptions and those about the industry 
trends to remain at the forefront of the industry. The 
Group remains confident that it can use its experience 
and expertise to continue to deliver on the product, 
technology, commercial and operational aspects that 
support its strategy

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 16 This Strategic Report was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:
ALEX BEVIS
DIRECTOR AND COMPANY SECRETARY
7 September 2017
KEY
 No change Increase Reduction
DESCRIPTION MITIGATION CHANGE IN RISK
CURRENCY RISK
The majority of Frontier’s resources are located 
in the UK and therefore the Group’s operating 
costs are mainly in Pounds Sterling (GBP). Sales 
are global, in multiple countries and in multiple 
currencies. The Group therefore has short term 
transaction and translation risks, in addition to the 
longer term economic risk of developing in the UK 
and selling worldwide. The largest exposure is the 
US Dollar (USD). 
The Group has expanded its revenue sources and there 
has been a subsequent increase in revenue from non-GBP 
currencies in the last few years. Whilst the longer term 
economic risks of selling globally cannot be avoided, 
forward contracts have been used to gain certainty over 
the rate of conversion of foreign currency income. The 
Group will continue to review the most effective way of 
managing transaction and translation risks.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT
The Group’s future success will depend on 
its ability to manage and fund its anticipated 
expansion. This includes the management of 
overseas-based subsidiaries and may include 
acquisitions. Such expansion and investment 
is expected to place demands on management, 
support functions and working capital. If the 
Group is unable to manage and fund its expansion 
effectively, its business and financial results 
could suffer.
In order to mitigate the risk, the Group is investing in 
suitable training for key staff and key internal systems. 
The Group has appointed experienced key Non-Executive 
advisors to ensure risks are managed objectively, and 
will continue to review its requirements for strategic 
advice. The Group prudently manages its liquidity by 
monitoring forecast cash in flows and out flows both in 
the short and medium terms, as well as its long-term 
investment needs and opportunities.
MARKET DISRUPTION
The Group operates in a fast moving industry 
where competitive products, larger competitors, 
new market trends or disruptive technology may 
emerge which reduce its ability to compete and 
execute its business plan.
Investing in its own COBRA technology and self-published 
games allows the Group to continue to innovate, and we 
seek to make our processes and business decisions agile 
and well informed so we can anticipate and exploit such 
changes. We believe this risk is mitigated by our track 
record of execution on new platforms and the flexibility 
demonstrated by the diverse range of video games we 
have successfully developed in the past.

(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs and of the 
profit or loss of the Company and Group for 
that year. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether the applicable IFRSs have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the Company’s financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
a going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 20 The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and to enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that:
• so far as each Director is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s Auditor is unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all steps that 
they ought to have taken as Directors to 
make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that 
the Auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITY ARRANGEMENTS
During the year the Company purchased 
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
in respect of itself and its Directors.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group actively protects its intellectual 
property via trademark registrations. 
Whilst the Directors consider these to be 
of significant value, the costs associated 
with registrations are expensed.
The Group invests significant resources into 
the development of franchise assets and in 
research and development through the COBRA 
engine and associated development tools. 
Costs that meet the criteria for capitalisation 
are included in intangible assets (see note 10 
of the financial statements). The Group‘s gross 
research and development spend to support 
its strategy was £12.7 million in the year 
(2016: £12.6 million).
DIVIDEND
The Directors are not recommending the 
payment of a dividend at this time (2016: £nil).
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
The Group seeks to encourage and promote 
an agile, open, fair and meritocratic culture 
of engagement, achievement and fun.
The Group is committed to the principle 
of equal opportunities in employment. 
Its aim is to ensure that no job applicant 
or employee receives less favourable 
treatment or is placed at a disadvantage 
by requirements or conditions that cannot 
be shown to be justifiable and thereby promote 
equality of opportunity for employment 
within the Group on grounds such as sex, 
disability, marital status, religion, colour, 
race, nationality, ethnic or national grounds, 
age or sexual orientation.
The Group’s policies and procedures are 
created and administered in such a way 
that they do not tolerate or foster such 
discrimination. The Group has an Employee 
Consultation group that meets regularly 
with senior management.
The Group encourages employee involvement 
in the Group’s performance by using a bonus 
scheme for all staff. In addition, it seeks to 
issue share options at relevant times or to 
utilise other equity plans where appropriate.
EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
The Group is committed to following UK 
employment law for its Cambridge-based 
operations and applicable labor codes 
for its US operations based in Nevada 
and Kansas.
Where possible the Group strives for similar 
employment and benefit arrangements 
between territories.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT
The aim of the Directors is to provide healthy, 
safe and congenial working conditions, 
equipment and systems of work for 
all employees.
The Directors further intend to provide 
sufficient information, training and supervision 
to enable employees to do their work safely, 
effectively and without risk to themselves 
or to others.
We acknowledge that we are responsible 
for the safety of visitors, both professional 
and social, who enter the premises.
Frontier Developments plc recognise 
its duty to comply and operate within the 
requirements of statutory environmental 
legislation and is committed to minimising 
the environmental impacts of its business 
operations. The Directors of the Group will 
support this policy with this commitment 
in mind.

one further Non-Executive Director and four 
Executive Directors: the Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Operating Officer, Chief Creative 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer (also the 
Company Secretary). As per the individual 
biographies, the Directors have a range of 
experience and provide a balance of skills, 
experience and knowledge to the Board.
All Directors are subject to election at the 
first Annual General Meeting following their 
appointment and to re-election thereafter 
at intervals of no more than four years.
The composition of the Board of Directors is 
illustrated on pages 18 and 19. On 1 July 
2016, Jonathan Milner stepped down as 
Non-Executive Director and Charles Cotton 
was appointed in his place. On 3 April 2017 
Alex Bevis joined the Board as CFO, also 
taking over Company Secretarial 
responsibilities from Neil Armstrong 
who resigned from the Group in 2016.
COMPANY SECRETARY
The role of the Company Secretary is to 
ensure reliable and regular information 
flows to the Board and its committees and 
to ensure applicable rules and regulations 
are followed. The Company Secretary is 
available to all Directors to provide advice 
and assistance and is responsible for 
providing governance advice to the Board.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The committees report regularly to the 
Board on the performance of the activities 
they have been assigned.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises only 
independent Non-Executive Directors; its 
members are: David Gammon (committee 
Chair) and Charles Cotton. The committee 
is supported by Alex Bevis, CFO and 
Company Secretary.
The Audit Committee determines the terms 
of engagement of the Company’s Auditor and, 
in consultation with the Auditor, the scope 
of the audit. It will receive and review reports 
from management and the Auditor relating 
to the interim and annual accounts as well 
as the accounting and internal control systems 
in use by the Company and Group. The Audit 
Committee has unrestricted access to the 
Company’s Auditor. The Audit Committee also 
reviews accounting and treasury policies, 
financial reporting including key performance 
indicators and supporting key areas of 
management judgements, and corporate 
governance standards. The Audit Committee 
is open to attendance by any Director and 
reports its key issues at Board meetings.
In the financial year to 31 May 2017 the 
Audit Committee met on four occasions, 
including three meetings with the 
Auditor present.
The Board of Frontier Developments 
plc established Corporate Governance 
arrangements through consideration 
of best practice guidelines and aspects 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
relevant to the Company. Progress is 
reviewed against the 12 principles of 
Corporate Governance issued by the 
Quoted Companies Alliance issued in 
the 2013 Corporate Governance Code 
for Small and Mid-sized Quoted 
Companies. Being an AIM-listed 
company Frontier is not required 
to comply, and has not fully complied, 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
THE BOARD
The Board is responsible for the long-term 
growth and profitability of Frontier 
Developments plc. Among its responsibilities 
it works with management to set corporate 
values and to develop strategy, including 
deciding its risk management policy and 
financial objectives.
A schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board’s resolution details key aspects of the 
Company’s affairs that are not delegated 
beyond the Board (including, among other 
things, approval of business plans and 
budgets, material expenditure and 
alterations to share capital).
Approximately half of the time at Board 
meetings is set aside for Core Strategic 
issues. At least two meetings a year have 
extended time allowed where the focus is 
predominantly on Core Strategic issues.
The following statements set out the principles 
and methods to which it adheres.
BOARD MEETINGS AND PRACTICES
The Board seeks to meet regularly during 
the year with appropriate time allocated for 
extended strategic reviews. The entire Board 
is invited to attend all meetings. In the financial 
year to 31 May 2017 the Board met on 
eight occasions.
The Chairman and the Company Secretary 
plan the agenda for each Board meeting in 
consultation with all other Directors. The 
agenda is issued with supporting papers 
ahead of the Board meetings, along with 
appropriate information required to enable 
the Board to discharge its duties.

AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
Frontier Developments’ external Auditor is 
Grant Thornton UK LLP, who has served the 
Company since 2012. The external audit 
function provides independent review and 
audit. It is the responsibility of the Audit 
Committee to review and monitor the 
external Auditor’s independence, objectivity 
and the effectiveness of the audit process, 
taking into consideration relevant UK 
professional and regulatory requirements 
as well as developing and implementing 
policy on the engagement of the external 
Auditor to supply non-audit services.
The Audit Committee monitors procedures 
to ensure the rotation of external audit 
partners every five years and audit 
managers every seven years. For the 
12 months ended 31 May 2017 the previous 
Grant Thornton audit partner, Alison Seekings, 
rotated off the audit of the Group, to be 
replaced by James Brown.
SENIOR MANAGEMENT 
AND GROUP FUNCTIONS
Frontier’s Senior Management are involved 
in multiple functions within the Company.
They are responsible for reviewing the overall 
organisational structure of the Company, 
as well as refining and implementing the 
recruitment and retention programme in 
order to identify and hire the right candidates 
as required in addition to retaining existing 
staff members.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND 
ASSESSMENT OF BUSINESS RISK
The systems for internal control and risk 
management processes are designed to 
manage and mitigate risks that may impact 
achievement of the Company’s strategic 
objectives. Such systems can only provide a 
reasonable but not absolute level of assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The strategic risks are regularly reviewed 
by the Board and a Corporate Risk Register 
(CRR) is maintained.
The risk assessment process is facilitated 
by the COO who holds and appraises the 
Risk Register at least once a year.
A further review is then undertaken with 
Senior Management and the Register itself 
is updated for the Executive Team to consider.
Once the review has concluded the revised 
CRR is forwarded to the Audit Committee 
which assesses the updated register and 
confirms the key risks. A proposal for updating 
the risks reported in the Annual Report is 
then drawn up; the Audit Committee will then 
take its recommendations to the Board on 
key risks and the reporting thereof.
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 23
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT 
AND INTERNAL AUDIT
The Group has established operating 
procedures appropriate to its size and 
structure for reporting both financial and 
non-financial information to the Board.
These include, but are not limited to:
• operating guidelines and procedures 
with approval limits;
• accounting policies, controls and procedures;
• performance monitoring systems updated 
monthly for review at Board meetings; and
• regulatory and legal changes that may 
materially impact on the business.
Due to the Executive Directors’ close 
involvement in business activities, the 
Group does not currently believe that 
an internal audit function would be cost 
effective. The Audit Committee considers 
the need annually and will advise the Board 
as and when it feels this position is required.
INVESTOR RELATIONS
The Company places considerable 
importance on communication with 
Shareholders and maintains regular contact 
with its larger institutional Shareholders 
through its investor relations team, meetings 
with the Executive Directors and the 
Chairman and through investor events.
The Directors, together with the Group’s 
advisors, held a number of meetings and 
discussions with key institutional Shareholders, 
ensuring clarity around the Group’s strategic 
intent. The Executive Directors and officers 
also took the opportunity during the year to 
hold external (London based) and on-site 
meetings to demonstrate Elite Dangerous: 
Horizons and Planet Coaster to both 
investors and potential investors.
The Group uses the Annual General Meeting 
to encourage attendance and participation 
by Shareholders. In order to support internal 
capacity building for investor relations the 
Group has continued to be a member of the 
Quoted Companies Alliance.
The latest results presentation is 
available through the Company’s 
investor relations website.

Milton Road 
Cambridge CB4 0WG

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2017
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 24 As Frontier Developments is an AIM-listed 
company it is not required to disclose all the 
information included in this Remuneration 
Report; however, in the interests of transparency 
the Board has chosen to provide the following 
details as a voluntary disclosure.
The Auditor is not required and has not, 
except where indicated, audited the information 
included in the Remuneration Report. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
to the Board for developing remuneration 
policy. The Report of the Remuneration 
Committee has been approved by the Board 
of Directors for submission for Shareholders’ 
approval at the Annual General Meeting.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
both Non-Executive Directors of the Company, 
the Chief Operations Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer (also the Company Secretary). 
The Committee Chairman is David Gammon. 
The Remuneration Committee meets at least 
twice a year. In July 2016 Charles Cotton 
replaced Jonathan Milner. Alex Bevis (CFO 
& Company Secretary) replaced Neil 
Armstrong in April 2017.
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for the following functions:
• setting of remuneration for Directors and 
officers, including pay, annual cash bonuses 
and long-term incentive arrangements;
• approval of the overall increase for annual 
pay and bonus levels for all other staff;
• approval of share option plans 
or arrangements;
• setting of overall share option issues;
• approval of any significant employee 
benefit arrangements; and
• reviewing the Committee’s terms of 
reference and submitting to the Board 
for subsequent approval.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Remuneration Committee approved 
the following policy:
“Frontier endeavours to pay salaries 
and benefits around the median level for 
relevant skills. Where there is a material 
gap in remuneration, it is the policy of the 
Group to close this over time and subject 
to affordability.”
In 2016 the Remuneration Committee 
commissioned a report from KPMG LLP on 
Executive Incentives, bonus schemes and 
Long Term Incentive plans in order to bring 
incentives in line with the Group’s strategic 
objectives and investor interests by way of 
linking the majority of remuneration with 
market based performance criteria and 
structure commonly operated by AIM 
and FTSE 350 companies.
Having reviewed the report the Remuneration 
Committee made changes to the various 
components of Directors Remuneration 
in both FY16 and FY17, and is planning 
changes in FY18, as explained below.
COMPONENTS OF EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
OVERVIEW
The remuneration policy is to establish 
and maintain arrangements and individual 
packages which attract, retain and motivate 
the talent necessary to support the Company’s 
strategy. The Committee believes it is 
important to achieve an appropriate balance 
between fixed elements of remuneration 
and performance related elements, with 
a particular focus on the latter given the 
Company’s growth aspirations.
Directors and staff are all encouraged 
to acquire shares in the Company and 
to hold these shares for the long term. 
This participatory element is an important 
aspect of the Group’s culture and its 
focus on long-term performance.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The service agreements adopted on 
1 July 2013 for the Executive Directors can 
be terminated by either party provided at 
least six months’ notice has been given.
BASIC PAY
Having considered the results of KPMG’s 
survey of Executive remuneration in AIM 
companies, an update of base pay was 
implemented with effect from 1 June 2016.
ANNUAL BONUS
In December 2016 bonuses totaling £87,873 
were paid to the Executive Directors in 
relation to performance in the 12 months 
ended 31 May 2016. For the 12 months 
ended 31 May 2017, the Company achieved 
a significant step-up in financial performance 
and market capitalisation following the 
successful completion of it’s transition to a 
multi-franchise self-publishing model. As a 
result the Committee expects to pay more 
substantial bonuses in December 2017 
relating to the 12 months ended 31 May 2017. 
From 1 June 2017 a new bonus scheme has 
been established for all employees, including 
the Executive Directors. To support the 
Company’s scale-up the new scheme covers 
the two year period starting 1 June 2017 
and ending on 31 May 2019. Bonus payouts 
will be determined by individual performance 
and by the Company’s financial performance 
against a target range. The chosen financial 
performance measure is operating profit as 
reported under IFRS. An interim payment 
will be made in December 2018 with the 
final payment in September 2019. It is 
anticipated that following this two year 
period, the Company will return to a more 
typical annual bonus scheme but with 
similar performance based characteristics.
EQUITY
The Company runs an HMRC approved 
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP). In the 
year to 31 May 2017 the following grants 
were made to Directors:
Jonathan Watts was awarded an unapproved 
option over 60,000 Ordinary Shares at an 
exercise price of 174 pence per share under 
the same terms as the CSOP.
Charles Cotton was awarded an unapproved 
option over 25,000 Ordinary Shares at an 
exercise price of 278 pence per share and 
an unapproved option over 25,000 Ordinary 
Shares at an exercise price of 174 pence per 
share under the same terms as the CSOP.

REMUNERATION REPORT
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 25
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMPONENTS OF EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION CONTINUED
EQUITY CONTINUED
Alex Bevis was awarded an unapproved option 
over 300,000 Ordinary Shares at an exercise 
price of 250 pence per share on the same 
terms as the CSOP and an approved option 
over 7,389 Ordinary Shares at an exercise 
price of 406 pence under the CSOP.
David Braben, David Walsh and Jonathan Watts 
were each awarded unapproved options over 
7,389 Ordinary Shares at an exercise price 
of 406 pence under same terms as the CSOP.
During the current financial year 
(the 12 months ending 31 May 2018), 
the Committee is establishing two 
new schemes.
The first scheme is an all-employee HMRC 
approved Sharesave scheme which rewards 
participants for committing to a monthly 
savings contract over a three year period 
with a discounted share option which is 
granted at the start of the savings contract. 
This scheme encourages share ownership 
and commitment to the Company, whilst 
providing another opportunity for our people 
to share in the success of the Company.
The second scheme that the Committee 
plans to introduce is a Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) which will be targeted at 
Executive Directors and senior management. 
Under the scheme, share options with zero 
exercise price will be issued, which will vest 
after three years dependent on appropriate 
performance criteria. For the Executive 
Directors the performance criteria is expected 
to be shareholder return. It is expected that 
the LTIP scheme will largely replace the 
CSOP scheme, although the CSOP will 
continue to be used in certain circumstances. 
PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, MEDICAL 
INSURANCE AND LIFE COVER
The Executive Directors joined the Group’s 
scheme for pension auto enrolment and life 
cover arrangements. A basic life cover sum 
of £25,000 per person was adopted from 
1 October 2013. Pension auto enrolment of 
a 1% employer contribution was commenced 
from 1 July 2014. These benefits are the 
same as adopted for all UK-based staff. 
From August 2014, medical insurance 
including family cover was offered to all 
employees including Executive Directors. 
All Executive Directors elected to take up 
these arrangements.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors 
is determined by the Board and reflects 
their anticipated time commitment to fulfil 
their duties. The Non-Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is subject to the same principles 
of the remuneration policy for the Group and 
the same transitional phase of alignment 
to median market rates was undertaken. 
The letters of appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors can be terminated with six months’ 
notice for the Chairman and three months’ 
for all other Non-Executives under notice 
given by either party.
Share warrants were issued to the 
Non-Executive Directors in connection with 
the IPO in 2013 (see note 19 to the accounts).

Directors’) was £147,752 (2016: £207,765) 
with the amount attributable to the highest 
paid Director being £91,083 (2016: £46,149).
The gain attributable to Directors on share 
options in the year at the date of exercise 
was £279,662 (2016: £31,573).

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2017
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
Frontier Developments plc ‘the Group’ develops video games for the interactive entertainment sector. The Company is a public limited 
company and is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is 306 Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 0WG.
The Group’s operations are based in the UK and its North American subsidiary, Frontier Developments Inc. in the US.
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of this financial information are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial information of Frontier Developments plc has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial instruments held at fair value. 
The financial information is presented in Sterling, the presentation and functional currency for the Group and Company. All values are 
rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000) except when otherwise indicated.
GOING CONCERN BASIS
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of current cash resources and reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
support the conclusion that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. The Group therefore 
continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
Post year end a strategic inward investment of £17.7 million completed. This investment was by way of a share issue and supports the company 
growth projections for investing in future franchises.
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of the Group and all entities controlled by it, after eliminating internal transactions. 
Control is achieved where the Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the 
Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The entities’ results are adjusted, where 
appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method under the revised IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” (IFRS 3R). 
The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair value 
of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Group, which includes the fair value of any asset or liability 
arising from a contingent consideration agreement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC

(effective 1 January 2018) (not yet endorsed).
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard establishes 
a principles based approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for obligations only when they 
are satisfied and the control of goods or services is transferred. It applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of 
other standards. It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts under the current accounting standards. 
The Group is still reviewing the impact of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted 
if IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ has also been applied. IFRS 16 is not yet endorsed by the EU. The standard represents 
a significant change in the accounting and reporting of leases for lessees as it provides a single lessee accounting model, and as such, requires 
lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less. 
The standard may also require the capitalisation of a lease element of contracts held by the Group which under the existing accounting 
standard would not be considered a lease. 
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new standard. Work performed includes assessing the accounting impacts of the change 
and the data required. From work performed to date it is expected implementation of the new standard will have a significant impact on the 
consolidated results of the Group. On adoption, lease agreements will give rise to both a right of use asset and a lease liability for future 
lease payables. Depreciation of the right of use asset will be recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis, with interest 
recognised on the lease liability which will result in a change to the profile of the net charge taken to the income statement over the life 
of the lease. These charges will replace the lease costs currently charged to the income statement.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND KEY JUDGEMENTS
Revenue recognition
Where self-published titles have pre-orders, recognition is made by reference to delivery of performance obligations. Revenue stemming 
from the sale of ‘early versions’ of a game is recognised from the date of release of the ‘early access versions’. Where pre-orders include 
delivery of the final version of the game, an estimate is made of this final element and moved to deferred income. An estimate of the final 
element is based on the number of man months it would take to complete the development and is released from deferred income when 
the final version is released to the public.
Where the Group has made a self-published title containing a season of content (a number of periodic releases) recognition is made by 
reference to delivery of performance obligations which use a measure of development man months incurred per periodic release as an 
estimate of delivery of these performance obligations. FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND KEY JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED
Intangible assets capitalisation
The Group invests heavily in research and development. The identification of development costs that meet the criteria for capitalisation 
is dependent on management’s judgement and knowledge of the work done. Development costs of software tools within a project that can 
be utilised generically are separately identified. Judgements are based on the information available at each period end. Economic success 
of any development is assessed on a reasonable basis but remains uncertain at the time of recognition as it may be subject to future 
technical problems and therefore a review for indicators of impairment is completed by product at each period-end date. The net book 
values of the Group and Company intangible assets including rights acquired at 31 May 2017 are £21,870,689 (2016: £16,689,747).
Intangible assets are subject to amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable, for example, a decision to suspend a self-published title under development.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are reviewed by project for which there are separately identifiable cashflows.
Games developed to be self-published are reviewed for impairment based on the status at the end of each financial year and at the half 
year against a prudent level of the projected net earnings.
In respect to amortisation, normally self-published titles are amortised on completion of the game; however an exception to this occurs when 
project funding is obtained via innovative crowd-funded platforms, such as Kickstarter. Such funding is generally seen as ‘contributing to 
making the game happen’ and requires the Company to set up a number of pledge levels which include a donation element. When 
‘donation and intangible’ elements of pledge levels are recognised as revenue, an equivalent amount of amortisation charged reflects this 
‘contribution element’. The pledge levels also include delivery of a number of ‘early versions’ of the game and an estimated and prudent 
cost is applied as amortisation.
Deferred tax
A deferred tax asset is recognised where the Group considers it probable that future tax profits will be available against which the tax credit 
will be utilised in the future. This specifically applies to tax losses and to outstanding vested share options at the statement of financial 
position date. In estimating the amount of the deferred tax asset that should be recognised, the Directors make judgements based on 
current forecasts about the amount of future taxable profits and the timings of when these will be realised. A deferred tax asset is 
currently not being recognised in full due to the unpredictability of future taxable trading profits.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are measured at historic cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful economic life. 
They comprise three categories:
• development tools;
• software (self-published games); and
• software (third party software bought from suppliers for use within the Group’s activities).
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development activities is recognised only if all of the following conditions 
are met:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use in developing games (in respect of 
development tools) or for sale of games (in respect of self-published software);
• the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and has the ability to use or license it as indicated above, thus generating probable 
future economic benefits;
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development, mainly salary costs, can be measured reliably; and
• the Group has adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset. FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Intangible assets continued
Internally generated intangible assets, consisting of direct labour costs, other specific direct project costs and attributable project support 
costs, are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives. The estimated useful lives of current development projects 
are between three and five years. When a self-published game is intended for release on multiple platforms without material content 
change, amortisation is based on the length of time in which that game is expected to be supported in an unchanged format with a limit of 
up to six years. Acquired rights are assessed for their useful ‘franchise life’. For Elite Dangerous this is prudently estimated at eight years; 
within the sector successful franchises normally have useful lives of over ten years. Until completion, the assets are subject to annual 
impairment testing. In most circumstances amortisation commences upon completion of the asset and is shown within research and 
development expenses in the income statement.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred.
Research activities
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment of intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its individual intangible assets for any indication that these assets 
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of the impairment loss, if any. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
Fair value is measured for self-published games by discounting future cashflows.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation is 
charged to the income statement so as to write off the cost less estimated residual values over their expected useful lives on a straight 
line basis over the following periods:
Fixtures and fittings – 5 years
Computer equipment – 2 ½ years–5 years
Leasehold improvements – length of the lease
Residual values and useful economic lives are assessed annually. The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in administrative expenses.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its individual property, plant and equipment for any indication that 
these assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
Fair value is measured by a review of the expected useful economic life compared to that implied in the amortisation rate.
Financial assets
Loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequent to initial recognition 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or 
reversal of impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it 
in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cashflows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits available on demand. FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC

Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its financial liabilities. Equity 
instruments do not include a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to another entity. Any instrument that does 
have the obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity is classified as a financial liability.
Financial liabilities are presented under liabilities on the statement of financial position.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s other financial liabilities include trade and other payables.
Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate 
method, except for financial liabilities designated at fair value though profit and loss (FVTPL). 
Employee benefits
All accumulating employee compensated absences that are unused at the balance sheet date are recognised as a liability within trade 
and other payables.
The parent company operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme which was commenced on 1 January 2014 ahead of the 
Company’s expected auto enrolment date. Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense in the 
period to which they relate.
Provisions 
Provisions for dilapidations are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required from the Group and amounts can be estimated reliably. Timing or amount 
of the outflow may be uncertain.
Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence 
available at the reporting date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation.
Share capital and reserves
Share capital represents the nominal value of the shares that have been issued.
Share premium – Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, 
net of expenses of the share issue.
Equity reserve – This represents the value of the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) that gets offset against distributable reserves and 
equity-settled share-based employee remuneration until such share options are exercised.
Foreign exchange reserve – This represents the exchange difference on consolidation of overseas subsidiaries. 
Retained earnings – Retained earnings include all current and prior period retained earnings.
Employee Benefit Trust
As the Company is deemed to have control of its Employee Benefit Trust (EBT), it is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the 
purposes of the consolidated financial statements. The EBT’s assets (other than investments in the company’s shares), liabilities, income 
and expenses are included on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements. The EBT’s investment in the Company’s shares 
is deducted from equity in the consolidated statement of financial position as if they were treasury shares. The gain or loss on transfer 
of the shares from the EBT to employees is recognised within equity.
Revenue
Revenue represents amounts derived from the design, production and sale of computer games software and related technology which fall 
within the Group’s ordinary activities, exclusive of value added tax and other similar sales taxes. Revenue is measured by reference to the 
fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Revenue includes income from the release of full games and early access versions of self-published games, royalties from published 
games and associated merchandise both physical and digital. FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Revenue continued
Revenue from released self-published titles is recognised on download of the game or upon purchase of in-game digital items.
Revenue from pre-orders of games and crowdfunding for self-published titles is normally deferred, then recognised when the Group meets 
its performance obligations. Where there is no clear performance obligation, for example a customer buys membership to a development 
forum, this is taken as revenue over the expected development period of the game on a straight line basis.
Revenue earned from royalties under distribution agreements is recognised in the period that the sales to the end customer are made, 
estimated on an accruals basis as royalty reports are received on a monthly or calendar quarter basis.
Segment reporting
The Group identifies one operating segment as the business is managed as a whole reflecting the transition of the Group from an external 
publisher to self-publishing. For management purposes the chief operating decision maker reviews the financial information which is 
consistent with that reported in its financial statements, with financial performance measured on the basis of contribution before central 
costs. Assets are not fully directly attributable to any separable activity, other than to self-published software intangibles.
Share-based payment transactions
Share options are periodically granted to staff. Share options are measured at fair value at the date of grant and recognised over the vesting 
period of the option. Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the model is an estimate 
of the likely average expiry date of the options by reference to the current rate of exercise by employees. The share-based payment is recognised 
as an expense in profit or loss, together with a corresponding credit to an equity reserve. This expense is recognised on a straight line 
basis based on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication 
that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in 
the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to 
that estimated on vesting. Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received up to the nominal value of the shares issued are allocated 
to share capital with any excess being recorded as share premium. Upon the exercise or lapsing of the grant a transfer of the cumulative 
value of the grant is made from the equity reserve to the profit and loss reserve.
Income taxes
Income tax expense comprises the current and deferred tax.
Current income tax liabilities comprise those obligations to fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting period that are unpaid 
at the statement of financial position date. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods to 
which they relate, based on the taxable profit for the year. All changes to current tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component 
of tax expense in the income statement, except where it relates to items outside profit or loss. Tax relating to items in other comprehensive 
income is recognised in other comprehensive income and tax relating to items directly in equity is recognised directly in equity.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements with their respective tax bases. In addition, tax losses available to be carried 
forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets. However, deferred tax is not 
provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability, unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the underlying 
deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, 
without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement. Deferred tax relating to items directly in equity is recognised 
directly in equity and deferred tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged to 
the income statement net of any incentives received from the lessor on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC

Foreign currencies
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement 
of financial position date. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate. The exchange differences arising from the 
retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income and are accumulated in the 
foreign currency reserve in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative translation differences are transferred to the profit 
and loss as a reclassification adjustment as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at a month-end rate in order to approximate 
to the actual rate for the relevant transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Foreign exchange differences are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Financial assets and liabilities at FVTPL
Derivative financial instruments are financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through the profit and loss (FVTPL) and are 
financial instruments that are either classified as held for trading or that meet certain conditions and are designated at FVTPL upon initial 
recognition. All derivative instruments fall into this category.
Financial instruments in this category are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. The fair values of 
financial assets and liabilities in this category are determined by reference to active market transactions or using a valuation technique 
where no active market exists.
4. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group identifies operating segments based on internal management reporting that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating 
decision maker and reported to the Board. The chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer.
Management information is reported as one operating segment, being revenue from self-published franchises and other revenue streams 
such as royalties and licensing.
The Group does not provide any information on the geographical location of sales as the majority of revenue is through third party 
distribution platforms which are responsible for the sales data of consumers. 
All of the Group’s non-current assets are held within the UK.
All material revenue is categorised as either self-publishing revenue or other revenue.
In the period ending 31 May 2017 ‘Other revenue’ included licensing revenue of £520k (31 May 2016 £nil).

22. SHARE OPTIONS CONTINUED
22.1 FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The fair value of services received in return for share options is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted. 
The estimate of fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model. Details of the fair value granted in the period, together with the 
assumptions used in determining the fair value, are summarised below:
March 2017 September 2016
Share price at date of grant (p) 278 174
Exercise price (p) 278 174
Expected time to expiry (years) 8.36 8.63
Risk-free interest rate (%) 2.52 1.77
Expected dividend yield on shares (%) 0 0
Expected volatility of share price (%) 35 34
Fair value of options granted (p) 125.6 74.89
Share options granted on 31 May 2017 have been excluded from the fair value calculations above. Due to the date of grant being 31 May 2017 
these options were deemed to be granted on 1 June 2017 for accounting purposes and will therefore be included in the next financial year 
financial statements.
22.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST (EBT) 
On 5 December 2014 the Company set up an Employee Benefit Trust for the purposes of allowing employees to exercise their share options, 
including the choice of being able to do this on a cashless exercise basis. The exercise of options is approved by the Board at each Board meeting, 
outside of share dealing closed periods, under a letter of recommendation to the Trustees of the EBT. The fulfilment of the share option conversions, 
whether by issue of shares to the EBT or market purchases, is also made at the same time. The EBT is limited under ABI guidelines to holding 
not more than 10% of the Ordinary Share capital of the Group. The Trustees are appointed by Estera Trust (Jersey Limited) (formerly Appleby 
Trust (Jersey) Limited), which administers the Trust. The number of share options exercised by employees in the year and fulfilled as part of 
these arrangements was 241,150 Ordinary Shares. The EBT purchased 116,395 Ordinary Shares from employees exercising under the cashless 
options. The EBT had no other assets or liabilities at 31 May 2017 outside of its interest in 105,645 Ordinary Shares, and a voluntary contribution 
was made to the Trust to repay the outstanding loan balance in full in April 2017 (2016: £1,353,770) from the £10 million facility provided by 
the Company.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISKS 
RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group is exposed to various risks in relation to financial assets and liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities by category are summarised 
in note 20. The main types of risks are credit risk, currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s risk management is co-ordinated in close co-operation with the Board of Directors.
The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes. The most significant financial risks to which 
the Group is exposed are described below.
24.1 CREDIT RISK
The Group’s exposure is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets and cash and cash equivalents recognised at the year-end date 
(as summarised in note 20).
The Group’s management considers all financial assets, not impaired, for each reporting date to be of good credit quality, including those 
past due. In respect of trade and other receivables the Group is exposed to significant credit risk for a single counterparty. The Board monitors 
the credit risk by reference to the date of receipt compared to the contractual terms.
The Group considers it has minimal credit risk for liquid funds and other short-term financial assets as cash is held with reputable UK, US 
and Canadian banks.
At the year end the Group’s financial assets are secured by a debenture issued in favour of Barclays Bank plc.
24.2 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group’s reporting currency is Sterling. Exposure to currency exchange rates arises where transactions are in a currency other than 
the functional currency of the entity, primarily US Dollars (USD) and Euros (EUR).
The Group has entered into several forward contracts during the financial year in order to mitigate the risk of US currency movements. 
The closing value of the contracts has been disclosed within financial assets, and accounted for at fair value through the profit and loss.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s Canadian Dollar, US Dollar and Euro denominated monetary assets outside the functional currency 
of the entity at the reporting date are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% increase or decrease in the Sterling exchange rate against all relevant currencies, 
albeit the main exposures are USD and EUR. An increase in Sterling would lead to a decrease in income and a decrease in equity.

Equity 381 188 368 118
24.3 LIQUIDITY RISK ANALYSIS
Liquidity risk is the risk arising from the Group not being able to meet its obligations as they fall due. The Group manages its liquidity needs by 
carefully monitoring forecast cash inflows and outflows due in day-to-day business. Net cash requirements determine headroom or any 
shortfalls over the medium term. This analysis shows if there is a need to use the revolving credit facility, seek external funding or the 
need for secure finance from its shareholder base.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING CONTINUED
EXPLANATORY NOTES
To the Notice of Annual General Meeting
NOTES
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is also entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote instead of 
him. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights 
attached to a different share or shares held by that member. The proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the 
meeting to represent you.
2. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy, you will need 
to complete a separate Form of Proxy in relation to each appointment. To request additional Forms of Proxy, please contact the Company 
Secretary on 01223 394300 or at Frontier Developments plc, 306 Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 0WG. You will need to state 
clearly on each Form of Proxy the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is appointed. A failure to specify the number of shares 
a proxy appointment relates to or specifying a number of shares in excess of those held by the member will result in the proxy appointment 
being invalid.
3. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the meeting, you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and 
give your instructions directly to them. If you wish to appoint a proxy other than the Chairman, write the full name of your proxy in the 
box provided in the Form of Proxy.
4. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. 
In the absence of instructions, the person appointed proxy may vote or abstain from voting as he/she thinks fit on the specified resolutions 
and, unless otherwise instructed, may also vote or abstain from voting on any other matter (including amendments to resolutions) 
which may properly come before the meeting.
5. In the case of joint holders, the signature of any one of them will suffice but the names of all joint holders should be stated. The vote of 
the senior who tenders a vote (whether in person or by proxy) will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other holders. For this 
purpose, seniority is determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members in respect of the joint holding.
6. To be effective, the Form of Proxy must be duly completed and deposited together with any power of attorney or other authority (if any) 
under which it is executed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) and lodged at PXS, Capita Asset Services, 34 Beckenham 
Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU no later than 9.15 am on 13 October 2017 (being not more than 48 hours (excluding non-working days) 
prior to the time fixed for the meeting).
7. Whether or not you propose to attend the Annual General Meeting, please complete, sign and submit a Form of Proxy to our registrars, 
Capita Asset Services, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU, by no later than the time and date specified above.
8. Completion and return of the Form of Proxy will not preclude a shareholder from attending and voting in person at the meeting. If you 
have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
9. The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, specifies that only those members entered on 
the register of members of the Company by close of business UK time on 13 October 2017 (being not more than 48 hours (excluding non-working 
days) prior to the time fixed for the meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting or, if the meeting is adjourned, by close of 
business UK time on such date being not more than 48 hours (excluding non-working days) prior to the date fixed for the adjourned meeting. 
Changes to entries on the register of members after such time shall be disregarded in determining the right of any person to attend or 
vote at the meeting.
10. The following documents will be available for inspection from the date of this notice until the meeting at the Company’s registered office 
and at the meeting convened by this notice:
 (a) register of Directors’ share interests; and
 (b) Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment (as applicable).
11. A corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise, on its behalf, all its powers as a member. COMPANY SECRETARY AND CFO
