GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S REVIEW
We’re proud of where we’ve come  
from and proud of where we’re going. 
In a combination that is unparalleled 
in the industry, NEX will continue to 
build platforms and services that  
enable our clients to execute efficiently

A defining transaction
For more than 15 years our strategy has been based  
on continually investing in the development of financial 
technology for the trading community. During the course 
of last year we took our most significant step to date 
with the founding of NEX. The sale of our voice broking 
business to TP ICAP, which closed on 30 December  
2016, enabled NEX to become a focused financial 
technology business.
Our marketplace is in flux. The ever evolving global 
regulatory environment has caused our traditional 
client base – the sell-side – to change their strategies 
and business models as they seek to adapt. Banks and 
other market participants rely even more on technology 
to support their business and their management of 
regulatory requirements. An increasing focus on 
electronic markets and pre and post trade services has 
created exciting opportunities for NEX and enables the 
expansion of our product and service portfolio. 
Becoming NEX
During the last quarter of the financial year we turned 
our focus to the future with a spirit and perspective 
that confirms the decision to change our Company.
Our culture is one of our great strengths. Only the right 
characteristics can propel a company into the vanguard 
of its industry, and we have a long-standing culture of 
anticipating the needs of the markets and of our clients. 
These are the foundations from which we will invest in 
the long-term growth and success of our business.
Our rebranding from ICAP to NEX was an exercise carried 
out with our customary attention to detail, speed and 
professionalism. During the last weeks of 2016 we 
rebranded our offices around the world with no 
disruption to our business, and we successfully launched 
a new global intranet and multiple external websites 
across the Group. This was accompanied by the largest 
external advertising campaign we have undertaken. I am 
confident that NEX is now firmly anchored in the minds 
of our employees, clients and partners.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Our move towards the consolidated infrastructure 
and interface of NEX Infinity with its unified sales and 
support environment that caters for both sell- and 
buy-side as well as major corporates will provide us 
with enormous opportunities.
As part of this consolidation process we are aligning our 
structure with that of our clients, allowing them a clear, 
NEX business-agnostic view of our full suite of products 
and services. 
 “ The transformation of the Group 
into a focused financial technology 
company and our continued 
investment in new product and 
service offerings will result in  
long-term growth.”
Single legal agreements and a single interface will 
further simplify our clients’ ability to pick and choose 
multiple products either individually or in combination 
based on their requirements and not our own  
corporate structure. 
An example of this is NEX Regulatory Reporting. 
Launched in March, this combines a suite of best-in-
breed services provided by multiple NEX Optimisation 
businesses under a single umbrella to offer our clients 
an extremely powerful and fully resilient cross-asset 
and cross-jurisdictional regulatory reporting solution.
At the beginning of the year we acquired ENSO Financial 
Analytics. We have been and continue to be impressed 
by ENSO, who have demonstrated the ability to build 
a hedge fund client base to which they deliver an 
expanding and well-regarded product set. In October 
we completed our acquisition of Abide Financial. Since 
Abide first came to our attention, we knew it was a 
business which fitted perfectly with our strategy to  
serve our clients’ changing needs. It is one of a very 
small number of companies who offer holistic regulatory 
reporting services, which will become ever more critical 
as financial markets evolve.
During the period we also invested in RSRCHXchange, 
a MiFID II marketplace for institutional research; Axoni, 
a leading provider of distributed ledger technology; 
OpenFin, a unifying operating layer for financial desktops; 
and Cloud9 Technologies, a cloud-based communication 
provider. In addition, we made a further investment  
in OpenGamma, a leading provider of derivatives  
risk analytics.
These acquisitions and investments demonstrate  
how the team within our financial technology 
investment business, NEX Opportunities, 
is successfully building an impressive portfolio  
of emerging financial technology companies. 
In February, Per Sjöberg, CEO of TriOptima, decided 
to leave the business to pursue other ventures. I would 
like to record here my thanks to him for all his 
contributions since he founded the business in 2000. 
Ready for the future
NEX is in a position to change our industry. We have 
a portfolio of services that no one else can offer, and 
which gives us the ability to build our reputation and 
brand as the world’s leading electronic platform for  
OTC transactions and post trade services to all parties. 
We are already expanding beyond our traditional 
sell-side client base of banks and professional trading 
firms to embrace hedge funds, corporates, asset 
managers, sovereign wealth funds and global, regional 
and central banks. NEX will become synonymous with a 
supermarket of services, delivering world-class products 
and first-rate service and support to our clients.
With NEX Markets we have the world’s leading 
electronic trading platform for the fixed income 
markets and a leading electronic FX trading business 
with significant market share in many currencies. We 
continue to develop the next generation of financial 
technology for the trading community which will enable 
us to create the pre-eminent global e-platform for the 
FX and fixed income markets. At the same time, we are 
restructuring the business to be far more client-focused.
This past year we have seen significant growth on 
EBS Direct, our FX relationship-based trading venue, 
with new counterparties trading on the platform, record 
daily volumes and the roll out of FX forwards to new 
client segments. Our enhancements to the EBS central 
limit order book, EBS Market, such as the launch of EBS 
Live Ultra – our premium market data service – are 
benefiting clients and maintaining our market share,  
and we have seen further expansion of our Asian NDF 
business in addition to our eFix matching service.
BrokerTec continues to be the reference point in the 
US Treasury market and we have seen growth in US  
and EU repo. In March, BrokerTec acquired a majority 
share in e-MID – a multilateral trading platform for 
interbank deposits and money market instruments  
in Europe. Integrating the e-MID technology into our 
infrastructure, we can offer its Italian government 
bond repo and interbank deposit businesses to our 
extensive international client base. With access to 
the domestic financial community in Italy, we plan to 
establish a money market offering for Italian corporates 
and are excited about contributing to the further 
development and evolution in this central market.
In NEX Optimisation we already have many solutions 
that help clients simplify and optimise their resources 
across the transaction lifecycle.
8 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors’ report Financial statements Definitions
The event raised £8.2 million supporting over 200 
charities globally, which is equivalent to more than 5% 
of NEX’s full-year pre-tax trading profit. My thanks to 
all involved for their tremendous spirit and support.
This year’s dividend and outlook for the 
coming year
The directors recommend a final dividend of 27 .0p per 
share which will result in a full-year dividend of 38.5p per 
share (2015/16: 38.5p per share). If approved, the final 
dividend will be paid on 21 July 2017 to shareholders  
on the register at the close of business on 30 June 2017 .  
The shares will be quoted ex-dividend from 29 June 2017 .
Our performance continues to be strong in a tough 
market environment while trading activity since the 
start of the year has been subdued as volatility remains 
low despite sporadic activity around political events. In 
the year ahead NEX will continue to make progress on 
its strategy to deliver against its growth objectives and 
drive operational leverage.
I would like to thank our employees for their energy and 
commitment during this transition year. We have much 
ahead of us as we create a strong identity for NEX. I am 
convinced that together we have the innovation and 
leadership skills to enable us to build a great business.
Michael Spencer
Group Chief Executive Officer
We continue to identify and provide capital to firms 
delivering new platforms, business models and next 
generation technologies with the objective of driving 
significant efficiency, transparency and scale across  
the transaction lifecycle.
NEX Exchange has exactly the same regulatory, legal 
and tax status as the alternative markets, which we 
combine with a high-quality service to help 
entrepreneurs raise capital on the public market.
2016/17
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , the Group reported 
revenue from continuing operations of £543 million,  
up 18% on the prior year. On a constant currency basis, 
revenue from NEX Markets was up 8% and from NEX 
Optimisation was up 9%.
During the course of the year, the Group’s trading 
performance benefited from increases in market share 
across various products including BrokerTec UST Actives 
and Asian NDFs and new product launches such as 
triResolve Margin and new functionality on EBS Treasury. 
This was partly offset by historically low FX volatility 
impacting trading activity on the EBS FX platform.
The Group reported a trading operating profit of  
£145 million, an increase of 4% on the prior year  
(or 12% if we exclude the impact of FX hedging). 
Although the Group’s trading operating profit margin 
reduced to 27% (2015/16: 30%), underlying profitability 
was higher after adjusting for FX hedging.
Charity Day
Our 24th Annual Charity Day was held in December 
2016. This truly global fundraising event has become 
a fixed point in the financial services industry calendar. 
It was a delight to welcome Prince Harry as well as the 
Countess of Wessex and many other celebrity patrons 
of our selected charities to the London office.

tomorrow. This is a key component of the 
various solutions we offer to enable our clients

RESOURCES, RELATIONSHIPS 
AND RESPONSIBILITIES
We value the views of our employees and will  
continue to increase engagement with them through  
our internal communications programme. Our new 
global intranet and our regular employee newsletters 
and communications have been welcomed across 
the business.
Our technology
Our position as a leading provider of market infrastructure 
to the global financial markets has been achieved through 
significant investment in technology over many years. 
We operate technology research and development hubs  
in New Jersey, Stockholm and T el Aviv and also work with 
external suppliers. We continue to enhance the security  
of our global systems to mitigate the risk of cyber attack, 
which is ever evolving in sophistication and scope.
Our relationships
We build trust with our clients, partners, investors 
and regulators, and we engage with our stakeholders 
in an open and co-operative way. This transparency 
encourages the growth of mutually rewarding long-
term relationships.
Our people
NEX employs more than 1,900 people and we recognise 
that our success depends on their quality. We make a 
significant investment in training to develop the 
capabilities of our people and to ensure that each 
employee is aware of their responsibilities.
We have traditionally brought talent into our businesses 
through our graduate recruitment programme, 
internships and apprenticeships. We continue to be 
passionate about hiring early career talent and are 
redesigning and widening the scope of our talent 
programme to help employees at all stages of their 
career to take control of their development. Our 
approach to recruitment at all levels is focused on 
identifying people who will help drive outstanding 
business performance, while also demonstrating the 
crucial qualities of integrity and the ability to deal with 
constant change.
We recognise that a mix of backgrounds, skills and 
experience within teams improves adaptability and 
agility, and we aim to appeal to a broad range of people.

the principles of professional conduct. 
The board and senior management define the cultural 
agenda and are engaged in ensuring that we are a 
values-driven organisation. As part of the rebranding  
to NEX, we are redefining our corporate values and the 
behaviours that support them, and we have consulted 
with our management teams, employees and clients as 
part of this process. These values and behaviours are the 
bedrock of our organisation and are embedded through 
leadership, governance, communication, talent 
management and compensation.

Reducing environmental impact
Our environmental policy is approved by the board and 
owned by the Group Chief Financial Officer. 
Most of our greenhouse gases arise from the running of 
our offices and employee travel commitments, and we 
mitigate our total carbon emissions through investment 
in carbon reducing projects.
Emissions associated with electricity consumption 
decreased from 14,685 tonnes of CO

These estimates were provided by Natural Capital 
Partners, an environmental consultancy. Natural Capital 
Partners’ assessment was carried out in accordance with 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard. Responsibility for emissions sources 
was determined using the operational control approach.
Working for society
Our business performs a useful role in society:
 – by contributing to the stability and prosperity of 
economies by helping governments and companies 
to raise capital and manage risk;
 – by supporting the efficient functioning of global 
markets by providing transparency for clients and 
helping to maintain the liquidity of markets; and
 – by using our position as a leader in electronic trading 
in OTC markets to help make markets safer by 
enabling greater use of technology.
Although we have a small direct footprint in terms of 
social and community issues, we recognise that our 
behaviour and activities can have a positive effect. Our 
annual Charity Day raises money for charities worldwide, 
and we also support employees wishing to volunteer.
One of our key strategic priorities is to grow, expanding 
and diversifying our client base outside our traditional 
areas. We know that client experience is ultimately the 
most important driver of our brand reputation and 
strength. Our clients rely on us to provide them with 
insight into the marketplace and to use our expertise  
to their advantage. They require us to be absolutely 
trustworthy and professional in everything we do. 
We work with governments and regulatory authorities  
to maintain a current and detailed understanding of the 
legislation and regulation that affect us and our clients. 
These relationships give us insight into the policy 
process and enable us to respond efficiently to change.
Doing business responsibly
We aim to do business in a socially responsible way and 
to contribute to the communities of which we are part.
We are committed to the highest ethical standards  
in our business. As a key part of the global financial 
infrastructure, we adhere to the spirit and the letter  
of the law within our control, compliance and  
assurance environment. Our compliance and  
control risk infrastructure includes trade surveillance, 
communications monitoring, comprehensive training 
and a whistleblowing hotline.
We have a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct policy 
which is approved by the board. Clear ethical guidelines 
are issued to all Group companies, and compliance  
with these guidelines is monitored through the Group’s 
internal control framework. We have a zero-tolerance 
attitude towards money laundering, bribery and 
corruption, and an ongoing programme of internal 
training is in place to ensure all employees are aware  
of these policies.
We promote equal access to jobs and promotion 
opportunities as we believe that differences in 
background and outlook are key to creating a healthy 
and dynamic organisation. We expect our employees 
and all those who work with us to show tolerance, 
respect and dignity for all. No employee, applicant, 
contractor or temporary worker is treated less 
favourably, victimised or harassed on any grounds. 
Consideration is always given to human rights 
principles as part of our working practices.
The Group’s health and safety policy is approved by the 
board and owned by the Global Chief Operating Officer. 
Regional health and safety committees ensure there is 
an effective structure for delivering compliance with the 
policy. It is the responsibility of managers to provide a 
healthy and safe working environment for employees. 
As most of our employees work in office environments, 
there are no significant areas of risk on which to report.
17 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 CHARITY DA Y
On Charity Day, we donate 100% of our revenue  
and commissions globally to charity. Each business 
division and all our offices around the world 
participate. The impact of the day is phenomenal.
Charity Day is a day unlike any other. Employees 
swap suits for fancy dress, and visiting celebrities 
keep spirits high and lend a hand to help close 
transactions. Charity Day gets tremendous 
support from the market too, with clients 
working closely with us on the day to maximise 
the amount of revenue and commission placed 
with the business and therefore the amount of 
money raised for charity.
This global initiative has a local focus. We invite 
employees to nominate their favourite charities 
and each regional centre decides which 
charities benefit. We prefer to work with 
small organisations where our contribution 
will make a big difference.
Our policy is to help different charities each year, 
and in 2016 we supported 200 charities around 
the world.
Thanks to the efforts of our employees, clients 
and suppliers, our 2016 Charity Day raised a 
fantastic £8.2 million/$10.3 million, bringing 
the total amount raised over 24 years to nearly 
£135 million.
18 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 In 1993 we held our first Charity Day. We had no 
agenda at that time apart from ‘let us give a day’s  
work totally to charitable causes’ but it proved to  
be a defining moment for our character and ethos. 
We have continued each year since and in all our 
offices around the world to dedicate one day in early 
December exclusively to giving our entire revenue, 
whether it be dollar, euro, pound or yen, to local 
charities. I am extremely proud of what we have 
achieved together. Over those nearly 25 years,  
many staff have said to me ‘this is the best day  
in the year’; I share that sentiment.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk function
NEX maintains a strong and independent Group Risk 
function, responsible for providing independent 
expertise, challenge, advice and escalation with regard 
to noteworthy risk issues and developments. The Chief 
Risk Officer reports for governance purposes to the 
Risk Committee and, in order to ensure continuing 
independence, the Chairman of the Risk Committee 
makes recommendations to the Remuneration 
Committee regarding compensation of the  
Chief Risk Officer. 
Risk culture
NEX maintains a strong risk culture, whereby all staff are 
expected to embrace their responsibility to manage risk 
properly, and where the ‘first line of defence’ business 
management is primarily and ultimately responsible  
for the identification, analysis and management of the 
risks in its business. Essential to the risk management 
programme is widespread acceptance of a ‘no surprises’ 
culture, where transparency and prompt identification 
and escalation of mistakes or problems are fundamental 
and non-negotiable, and are the foundation for constant 
introspection and continuous self-improvement. 
NEX seeks to generate attractive returns through 
informed risk-taking and proper consideration of 
both the upside and potential downside of the risks it 
takes and faces. We also strive to ensure that our risk 
management programme operates within a framework 
of transparency and continuous self-improvement, 
and that it effectively responds to changes in the 
internal and external environment and what is learned 
through experience. 
The core nature of our approach to risk management 
has not changed. The key elements of that approach  
are below.
Board oversight and governance
The Risk Committee of the board has responsibility and 
oversight of our risk management and internal control 
systems. It provides this oversight through approval of 
the risk appetite and key policies, collection and review 
of extensive management information about key and 
emerging risks, risk developments and risk events, and 
regular meetings with the Chief Risk Officer and other 
key executives to discuss, analyse and challenge risk 
developments. The report from the Chairman of the  
Risk Committee is on page 47 .
A strong and robust risk management programme is 
fundamental to NEX’s ability to meet its strategic objectives. 
20 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors’ report Financial statements Definitions
Below is a description of what we view to be NEX’s principal risks along with a discussion of the nature of the risk, the NEX businesses affected by the risk, 
the relevant risk appetite, and whether the risk level is increasing or decreasing. We also describe some of the controls in place to mitigate the identified 
risk. While no control can guarantee that a risk event will never occur, these are controls that we believe contribute to a well-designed framework around 
risk management and mitigation. 
Risk Nature of risk and appetite Trend Mitigating controls
Liquidity risk
The risk that NEX will have 
insufficient funds to meet 
its obligations under 
ordinary and reasonably 
stressed conditions.
This risk occurs within the BrokerTec US matched 
principal business, where it serves as a fully matched 
counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by 
clients of its electronic trading platform to facilitate 
anonymity and access to clearing and settlement.  
In the course of utilising a central clearing house as 
well as a third party clearing bank for the settlement 
of transactions, BrokerTec will be required to post 
collateral as well as twice-daily short-term margin 
based on the size of executed but unsettled 
transactions. Without sufficient funds to meet its 
obligations, BrokerTec could be exposed to breach of 
contract claims, a reluctance of clients to continue 
using the platform, and an inability to continue as  
a member of the central clearing house. The board’s 
risk appetite provides for NEX to maintain access  
to sufficient funding to meet its obligations during 
ordinary and reasonably stressed market conditions.
This risk has increased 
somewhat over the past year, 
as both the clearing house  
and the Group’s clearing banks 
have increased their margin 
requirements industry wide in 
response to more aggressive 
stress scenarios.
The Group seeks to mitigate 
and control this risk through 
the following:
 – periodic reviews, including 
going concern assessments;
 – membership of the clearing 
house netting group;
 – $200 million swingline facility 
maintained centrally for 
same and next day utilisation;
 – contingency funding 
arrangements and 
procedures in place; and
 – daily monitoring and 
escalation to executive 
management and Group Risk 
of funding requirements.
Counterparty credit risk
The risk of loss from the 
failure of a matched 
principal counterparty to 
settle its trades.
This risk occurs within the BrokerTec US matched 
principal business, where it serves as a fully matched 
counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by 
clients of its electronic trading platform to facilitate 
anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. 
Transactions with clearing house members are 
typically confirmed and novated shortly after 
execution, at which point the clearing house  
assumes the risk of settlement. For transactions  
with counterparties that are not members of the 
clearing house, however, settlement typically  
occurs on the day following execution and, prior to 
settlement, BrokerTec is exposed to the risk of loss  
in the event a counterparty fails to meet its 
obligations. If that were to occur, BrokerTec would 
have the right to cover or liquidate the open position, 
but could incur a loss in doing so. The board’s risk 
appetite provides for the establishment and 
administration of counterparty credit limits and other 
risk management tools reasonably designed to avoid 
any significant credit loss. 
This risk has decreased 
somewhat over the past year as 
NEX has increased its collection 
of collateral from clients and 
lowered the available trading 
limits for certain clients. 
Moreover, with the sale of the 
voice broking business, the 
instruments that are the subject 
of settlement risk are exclusively 
high-quality sovereign 
instruments and not the broader 
range of instruments in which 
the broking business used  
to transact. 
The Group seeks to mitigate 
and control this risk through 
the following: 
 – membership of the 
clearing house netting group;
 – establishment and 
administration of board-
approved credit limit matrix;
 – regular review of client 
financial position and 
trading activity;
 – collection of client credit 
enhancement (e.g. collateral, 
letters of credit); and
 – system-administered blocks 
on transactions in excess of 
notional limits.
PRINCIPAL RISKS
The principal risks to our business model and strategic objectives are regularly 
identified and reviewed. These are not the only risks NEX faces, but they are those 
considered to be the more significant ones flowing from the business model. 
21 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report
PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED
Risk Nature of risk and appetite Trend Mitigating controls
Legal and regulatory risk
The risk of breaching  
regulatory requirements, 
general laws and/or  
contractual commitments.
This risk generally applies to all of NEX’s 
businesses, though in different ways. BrokerTec, 
TriOptima, NEX SEF (previously called EBS Global 
Facility) and NEX Exchange operate regulated 
introducing or trading platforms, and the Abide 
Financial regulatory reporting service is an 
approved reporting entity. These businesses are 
subject to extensive regulation, including 
adherence to specific rules and standards, 
regulatory exams and inquiries, monitoring and 
surveillance, and creation and maintenance of 
required records. All of NEX’s businesses utilise  
to a significant degree client contracts that  
set forth mutual obligations to be adhered to in 
the course of the provision of products and 
services. A breach of those obligations by NEX 
could result in damages, as well as harm to its 
reputation and loss of clients. In addition to the 
risks associated with NEX’s existing businesses,  
it may also be exposed to legacy risks from the 
voice broking business sold to TP ICAP pursuant  
to indemnities and warranties agreed to as part  
of the sale. The board’s risk appetite provides for 
NEX to materially  operate at all times in 
accordance with its legal, regulatory and 
contractual obligations.
This risk has decreased in certain 
ways and increased in others. 
With the sale of the voice broking 
business, the Group believes that its 
regulatory risk, while still important 
for certain of its businesses, has 
decreased on an overall basis as 
compared with ICAP. The Group  
now has significantly fewer regulated 
entities, engages in significantly 
fewer regulated activities, and has 
substantially fewer staff engaging  
in regulated activities. The risk of 
breaching contractual commitments, 
however, has increased, not because 
of a greater likelihood of breaches, 
but because the consequences of a 
breach have become greater as the 
business increasingly gives rise to 
assisting its clients with completion 
of their regulatory obligations. 
The Group seeks to mitigate 
and control this risk through 
the following:
 – NEX has internal legal and 
compliance departments 
which act as independent 
advisory and investigation 
functions to enable and 
defend the Group’s 
strategic aims;
 – the Group seeks to utilise 
standard contracts for its 
baseline services that have 
been reviewed by both the 
legal department and 
commercial management  
to properly allocate risks;
 – advice is taken regularly 
from appropriately qualified 
external advisors and 
professionals;
 – documented policies and 
procedures are communicated 
to all relevant staff; and
 – training is provided to staff  
on an ongoing basis.
Information security risk
The risk of confidential client 
information being improperly 
shared or accessed.
This risk generally applies to all of NEX’s 
businesses. The NEX Markets business will 
routinely have access to information about 
the trading activity of its clients on its platforms, 
and the NEX Optimisation business provides 
a variety of services that necessitate access to 
its clients’ trading, settlement, margining and 
risk activity. The failure to protect this 
information effectively could result in damages 
for breach of contract, breach of data protection 
requirements in certain jurisdictions and a loss 
of client trust. The board’s risk appetite provides 
for the Group to maintain robust policies, 
procedures and systems reasonably designed to 
protect the confidentiality of client information.
This risk has increased as the 
incidence and gravity of cyber 
security threats and attacks 
continue to increase in the financial 
sector and in the markets generally. 
The risk is also likely to increase in 
light of two impending regulatory 
developments. One is the 
implementation of the EU General 
Data Protection Regulation, which 
takes effect on 25 May 2018, and 
which increases both the 
obligations associated with 
protecting confidential information 
and the penalties associated with 
failing to do so. The other is the 
implementation of MiFID II, which 
takes effect on 1 January 2018, and 
which will require specified new 
monitoring of the Group’s EU-based 
EBS and BrokerTec trading 
platforms that will necessitate 
collection and proper handling 
of individual trader information.
The Group seeks to mitigate 
and control this risk through 
the following: 
 – timely escalation and 
mitigation of risk events;
 – provision of training and 
guidance;
 – information security breach 
monitoring;
 – cyber security programme, 
including penetration testing; 
 – contractual liability 
limitations; and 
 – restrictions on physical access 
to Company facilities.
22 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors’ report Financial statements Definitions
Risk Nature of risk and appetite Trend Mitigating controls
Business resiliency risk
The risk that key operating 
and control systems are 
unavailable.
This risk applies to all of NEX’s businesses. 
NEX’s clients utilise the Group to provide essential 
execution and optimisation services and, as such, 
rely on the services being available and operating 
as intended. A failure to maintain this availability 
could result in disruption and loss for clients, as 
well as increase their interest in utilising 
competitor service providers. This is a particularly 
significant risk for NEX Markets’ trading platforms, 
which have established well-regarded levels of 
liquidity that encourage continued use, but could 
face difficulty replicating those same levels of 
liquidity if clients were to make a significant and 
sustained switch to alternative venues. Certain of 
the NEX Optimisation businesses also rely on the 
network effects of multiple participants utilising a 
service at the same time, so a service disruption 
that prompted client defections could also have  
a pronounced negative affect on certain of these 
businesses. The board’s risk appetite provides for 
the Group to maintain robust policies, procedures 
and systems reasonably designed to ensure the 
availability of key systems. 
This risk has increased in 
recognition that cyber threats 
generally are increasingly targeted 
not only at the theft of information 
but at disrupting the operations of 
market participants.
The Group seeks to mitigate 
and control this risk through 
the following: 
 – timely escalation and 
mitigation of risk events;
 – provision of training and 
guidance;
 – cyber security programme, 
including penetration testing;
 – contractual liability 
limitations; and
 – documented and tested 
business recovery programme.
External change risk 
The risk that NEX does not 
effectively respond to 
significant political and 
regulatory changes 
pertinent to its business.
This risk applies to all of NEX’s businesses.  
NEX’s businesses are either themselves regulated, 
or serving financial institutions that are. As such, 
developments in the regulatory environment 
have the potential to significantly affect NEX’s 
business. Two recent examples of such 
developments are particularly noteworthy.  
First, the vote for the UK to leave the EU has the 
potential to change significantly the prevailing 
model of how financial institutions in Europe 
operate and how and from where they provide 
their services. With UK-based regulated platforms 
that have relied on EU passporting (notably 
BrokerTec Europe), the Group will have to respond 
to changes in licensing requirements as well as 
decisions by its clients, all of which may entail 
added cost and operating complexity. Secondly, 
with the change in presidential administration in 
the US, the regulatory climate of the past eight 
years may change significantly, potentially 
manifesting itself in reduced regulatory burdens 
and greater flexibility. This would be helpful for 
some of the Group’s businesses that are 
regulated, but potentially unhelpful for those that 
provide services to financial institutions seeking 
to comply with regulatory obligations. The 
board’s risk appetite provides for sufficient 
resources and expertise to be allocated to 
the identification, analysis, monitoring and 
response to such changes.
This risk has increased, given the 
magnitude of the change and 
uncertainty that both the UK vote 
to leave the EU and the new US 
administration pose to the future of 
financial services. The elevated risk 
level is not a judgement that the 
eventual changes will be negative 
for the Group; they may in fact be 
positive. It is, rather, a judgement 
that the level of change and 
uncertainty is at an almost historic 
level, creating a necessarily higher 
degree of challenge to manage 
the change effectively.
The Group seeks to mitigate 
and control this risk through 
the following: 
 – maintenance of internal and 
external regulatory affairs 
advisors to provide updates 
on regulatory developments 
and convey the Group’s 
perspective on legislative  
and regulatory issues to 
policymakers;
 – internal committees tasked 
with monitoring, analysing 
and implementing change 
necessitated by regulatory 
developments; and
 – regular reporting and 
discussion of key and 
emerging risks at the 
board Risk Committee.

NEX transformation programme
NEX is focused on driving revenue growth, increasing its operating profit 
margin and delivering value to its shareholders. By the end of 2019/20 both 
divisions, NEX Markets and NEX Optimisation, aspire to report an operating 
margin of at least 40%, with Group revenue compound annual growth rate 
(CAGR) at 7-10%.  
NEX’s current core cost base is expected to increase in line with inflation 
over the medium term. Following the completion of the sale of ICAP’s  
Global Broking division to TP ICAP, NEX management has undertaken a 
review of the business and its requirements. As a result, NEX has identified 
cost savings of approximately £25 million to be delivered by 2019/20. These 
savings will be derived from the reassessment of corporate functions and 
the streamlining of infrastructure, particularly within NEX Optimisation. The 
cost to achieve these savings will be approximately £10 million, which will 
not be treated as an exceptional item. The costs savings will be offset by 
continued investment in new products in addition to increased costs from 
potential acquisitions and special projects.
Financial performance
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , the Group reported revenue of  
£543 million, an increase of 18% on a reported basis on the prior year and 
an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis. On a constant currency 
basis, revenue from NEX Markets was up 8% and from NEX Optimisation 
was up 9%.
During the course of the year, the Group’s trading performance benefited 
from increases in market share and volatility across European repo, 
BrokerTec UST Actives and Asian NDFs. triResolve continued to show  
growth underpinned by an increase in client numbers and the launch  
of triResolve Margin.
This was partly offset by low FX volatility impacting trading activity on the 
EBS platform and low euro interest rate volatility impacting Reset, the risk 
mitigation product.
NEX continues to make focused investments to drive product innovation  
in response to evolving market needs. Major areas of focus include products 
that provide clients with solutions to regulatory requirements and ones that 
are targeted at expanding NEX’s client base. In addition, NEX Opportunities 
has continued to invest in new start-ups leveraging next generation 
technologies. During the year NEX acquired ENSO and Abide Financial  
in which it already had minority stakes. 
The Group reported a trading operating profit of £145 million, an increase  
of 4% on the prior year. Although the Group’s trading operating profit margin 
reduced to 27% (2015/16: 30%) underlying profitability was higher after 
adjusting for FX hedging losses of £17 million (2015/16: loss of £6 million) 
and one-off costs of £5 million relating to the integration of offices in the  
US. Moreover, the newly acquired high-growth ENSO and Abide Financial 
businesses added operating losses of £5 million and should reach run rate 
breakeven in the next 18 months.
The Group’s continuing operations reported a trading profit before tax of 
£114 million (2015/16: £110 million), 4% up on the prior year. Continuing 
trading EPS (basic) of 23.2p per share (2015/16: 23.6p per share) was down 
from the prior year as a four percentage point increase in the trading ETR 
offset the 4% improvement on the trading profit before tax.

Geo-political events dominated this past year’s news and underpinned 
sporadic trading in US Treasuries. Last November, the result of the US 
presidential election produced the second highest volume day since  
the launch of BrokerTec underpinned by the resilience of the platform. 
Speculation around the US President’s policies also continued to drive 
heightened volatility. Additionally, the Federal Reserve, although keeping 
interest rates on hold for much of the year, has now embarked on a 
measured agenda of raising rates providing trading opportunities. 
Trading activity in the secondary market for European government bonds 
has steadily improved from the lows seen in the first half of the year.  
Banks continue to hold less inventory and client flow is still substantially 
lower. Trading activity remains concentrated around new bond issuance in 
addition to an uplift more generally in France and Holland in the run-up to 
their elections.  
In March 2017 , BrokerTec announced that it had completed the transaction 
to acquire a majority stake in e-MID, the first Italian electronic central limit 
order book platform for interbank deposits and overnight indexed swaps. 
The transaction offers BrokerTec Europe a strong footprint in the Italian debt 
and money markets. 
The US repo product benefited from the uptick in market volatility that 
began ahead of the UK vote to leave the EU and persisted through the US 
presidential election. Trading activity in the European repo market benefited 
from increased volatility, demand for good quality collateral and a lack of 
supply from the buy-side.
BrokerTec Direct is the relationship-based trading platform that provides the 
opportunity for liquidity consumers to receive tailored streams of liquidity  
for US Treasury benchmarks from major liquidity providers. The existing 
platform will be upgraded to deliver enhanced functionality which will 
enable BrokerTec to increase its existing client base and broaden the overall 
offering to further complement the existing core BrokerTec business.
EBS
EBS, a global electronic platform for the FX markets, is a reliable and  
trusted source of executable and genuine liquidity across major and 
emerging market currencies. Both its anonymous and disclosed trading 
venues give its clients multiple execution and distribution options and the 
benefit of an established and far-reaching distribution network of liquidity 
providers and consumers.
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , revenue is flat on a constant currency 
basis and increased by 13% on a reported basis to £145 million (2015/16: 
£128 million) contrasting with a 7% decrease in average daily volume to  
$83 billion. The significant uptick in volume for the five weeks following the 
result of the US presidential election was unable to offset lower volumes in 
the first half of the year.
EBS Market, the exchange-like central limit order book, remains the 
benchmark for the professional FX trading community, connecting buyers 
and sellers of currencies in more than 50 countries. It has maintained its 
position as a primary interbank venue for the trading of the world’s most 
actively traded currency pairs, including euro/dollar and dollar/yen. There is 
a focused plan in place to enhance the user experience on the EBS Market 
platform and expand into other currency pairs.

banks and non-bank professional trading firms. 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , revenue increased by 8% on a constant 
currency basis and increased by 17% on a reported basis to £155 million 
(2015/16:  £133 million). This performance reflects a 2% decrease in  
US Treasury average daily volume to $164 billion, a 3% increase in US  
repo to $219 billion and a 6% increase in European repo to €186 billion.

RESULTS FOR 2016/17 CONTINUED
EBS Select, which allows non-banks to become liquidity providers to 
non-bank liquidity consumers, has seen a sharp increase in participants  
with more than 25 liquidity providers and 180 liquidity consumers now 
actively trading. FX forwards and swaps volumes continue to grow and 
attract additional participants, with more than 20 new liquidity consumers 
added since November 2016. This allows access to a significant part of the 
FX market in which EBS has never previously participated.
During the year, NEX Treasury added new FX functionality onto the platform 
to support the trading of FX spot, forwards and swaps, leveraging FX pricing 
from EBS Direct. Currently there are more than 475 corporates and more 
than 625 funds and banks active on the platform.
CFETS contract
In June 2016, NEX announced that CFETS, China’s official interbank market 
trading platform and infrastructure provider, had chosen NEX Markets to 
deliver the underlying technology for fixed income and FX electronic 
execution services in mainland China. The deal, valued at $65 million over  
a three-year period, will see NEX expand into China, a key growth market  
for the business.  
During the year EBS Market has continued to develop and create liquidity in 
both CNH and NDFs with average daily volume growing by more than 11% 
and 24% respectively compared with the same period last year.
Despite the ongoing headwinds from a low interest rate environment, EBS 
Market continues to innovate. In February 2017 , it launched EBS Live Ultra, 
the fastest FX live-streaming data feed available from a primary FX market 
venue at five millisecond (ms) intervals. This faster data feed is available 
only to market participants that meet certain trading criteria. The slower 
data feeds at 100ms and 20ms have been competitively repriced to attract 
new client interest.
NEX eFix, the matching service that enables clients to execute against daily 
benchmark rates electronically on the EBS Market platform, has continued 
to demonstrate significant growth. Average daily volume has increased by 
more than 50% over the same period in 2015/16 to more than $1.6 billion 
matched per day.
EBS Direct is a platform that allows liquidity providers to stream tailored 
prices directly to liquidity consumers. Interest in the platform continues  
to grow and the platform has more than 45 liquidity providers and 400 
liquidity consumers using the service. The EBS Direct platform had a 21% 
increase in average daily volume over the prior year to $21 billion.

TriOptima
TriOptima lowers costs and mitigates risk in OTC derivatives markets, 
primarily through the elimination and reconciliation of outstanding 
transactions. It continues to benefit from the strategic alignment of its 
offerings with the G20 policy objectives of transparency and risk reduction  
in the financial system. 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , revenue increased by 6% on a constant 
currency basis and by 19% on a reported basis to £86 million (2015/16:  
£72 million). Revenue growth was driven by the expansion into new market 
segments for the portfolio compression service, triReduce, and the uptake  
of new offerings in the reconciliation service, triResolve.
The stringent leverage ratio included within the Basel III rules continues to 
drive demand from banks for the compression service. During the year, the 
compression service terminated $191 trillion of gross notional outstanding 
(2015/16: $168 trillion). Since launch, more than 253 financial institutions 
have participated in eliminating $959 trillion in total notional outstanding 
from the OTC derivatives market. 
triReduce continues to innovate and expand its product and market 
coverage. In April 2016, it launched the first Swedish krona swaps 
compression cycle in collaboration with Nasdaq; in May 2016, it completed 
the first compression cycle for cleared euro interest rate swaps in Eurex 
Clearing; in August 2016, the first cycle for cleared Mexican pesos at the 
CME Group clearing house took place and compression for NDF and non-CLS 
eligible currencies was launched; and in October 2016, it introduced the 
compression for client cleared swaps at LCH SwapClear.
Initially a portfolio reconciliation service, triResolve has expanded its suite  
of offerings during the year to include triResolve Margin for the automated 
calculation and agreement of variation margin allowing clients to meet the 
regulatory requirements for variation margin which took effect in March 
2017 . Since launch, 70 subscribers have joined the triResolve Margin service.
Standard portfolio reconciliation, as required by regulation, continues to 
experience steady growth. The number of institutions using the triResolve 
core service has increased from 1,680 during 2015/16 to more than 1,900 
who participate in 476,000 party-to-party reconciliations each month 
(2015/16: 384,000). 
Traiana
Traiana monitors pre trade risk and automates post trade processing  
of financial transactions across multiple asset classes. Its solutions  
have become the market standard for post trade processing of FX, 
exchange-traded derivatives, fixed income, CDS and synthetic and cash 
equity transactions. Traiana’s Harmony network connects more than  
1,000 global banks, broker/dealers, buy-side firms and trading platforms. 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , revenue decreased by 5% on a  
constant currency basis and increased by 8%  on a reported basis  
to £57 million (2015/16: £53 million) following a reduction in FX  
volume-related services and the introduction of a new pricing structure 
 to incentivise long-term client contracts. This was partly offset by an  
increase in non FX-related revenue.
Traiana continues to innovate, grow and diversify its business into other 
asset classes. In June 2016, it announced that Barclays and UBS had gone 
live on its Harmony CCP Connect for Equities platform. These banks will 
further enhance the netting benefits already seen by the market through 
automated central clearing of OTC equity trades. In February 2017 , Traiana 
launched Swaps Centre, a suite of services which enable swaps providers to 
electronically manage payments and confirmations in equity swaps. Traiana 
has seen continued strong growth in volumes via its Harmony Equity CCP 
service which plays an important role in reducing counterparty risk and 
increasing transparency. 
NEX OPTIMISATION
NEX Optimisation offers a portfolio of cloud-hosted services across the 
transaction lifecycle. Ranging from pre-execution credit checking to 
multilateral portfolio compression, NEX Optimisation’s purpose is to  
simplify its clients’ workflow and help them optimise their resources  
by mitigating risk, increasing efficiency, reducing costs and streamlining 
increasingly complex processes.
During the year NEX Optimisation acquired ENSO Financial Analytics,  
a treasury and portfolio finance solution business for the hedge fund 
industry, with over $1 trillion in assets under advisory, and Abide Financial, 
which provides solutions for market participants to meet their regulatory 
reporting obligations. 
Alongside Traiana and NEX Data, Abide Financial forms a central piece  
of the NEX Regulatory Reporting business which provides a cross-asset  
and cross-jurisdictional regulatory reporting solution for NEX’s clients.  
NEX Optimisation is currently reshaping its organisational structure.  
The primary focus is to organise the business in a way that clients want to 
use services, matching the way they think about their financial, regulatory 
and operational challenges. This will be achieved by restructuring NEX 
Optimisation’s legal entities and products to six solutions which resonate 
with clients: trade and portfolio management, analytics, regulatory 
reporting, financial resource optimisation, data insights and opportunities.  
In conjunction with the restructuring, NEX Optimisation continues to build 
the NEX Infinity platform which will provide clients with a single platform 
that seeks to simplify trade processing, reduce costs and optimise their  
risk and capital across the entire transaction lifecycle. It will be capable of 
delivering both NEX Optimisation’s suite of industry-leading services and 
others available from third party vendors.
NEX Infinity will deliver efficiencies in the division’s operating model by 
reducing duplicated functions and having a single data ingestion and 
interface with clients.
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , revenue increased by 9% on a constant 
currency basis and increased by 24% on a reported basis to £240 million 
(2015/16: £194 million). The trading operating profit was marginally down 
at £69 million (2015/16: £70 million) and the trading operating profit 
margin reduced by seven percentage points to 29%, driven by the 
consolidation of recent loss-making acquisitions (ENSO and Abide Financial) 
and additional investment.

RESULTS FOR 2016/17 CONTINUED
 “ ENSO is looking to leverage the capabilities of the 
other NEX companies, the first example of which 
is the partnership with NEX T reasury.”
NEX Data
NEX Data delivers independent market intelligence and price information  
for OTC data to financial market participants from information received from 
NEX Markets and third parties. NEX Data generates subscription-based fees 
as well as licensing fees from other index administrators for the use of NEX 
Data in their indices.
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , revenue increased by 30% on a constant 
currency basis and 50% on a reported basis to £48 million (2015/16:  
£32 million) driven by organic growth on existing services, the launch of  
new pricing and analytics products and electronic-transaction based indices. 
In addition, a change to direct client billing increased both revenue and the 
related operating expenses.
During the year, NEX Data launched the first fully electronic trade-backed 
CNH FX Spot benchmark following considerable interest from a number of 
major Chinese banks. In addition, NEX Data and ENSO released the ENSO 
Market Rate, a reference rate which provides securities lending data from 
100 of the largest asset managers. 
In January 2017 , NEX Data became a key distributor for Tradition’s market 
data and information services division. The agreement includes real-time 
and end-of-day prices sourced directly from Tradition’s global electronic, 
hybrid and voice broking operations in all asset classes.  By acting as a 
distributor to Tradition, which offers complementary data services, NEX  
Data will be able to expand its multi-asset class and Asian market coverage 
and develop new services in pricing, analytics and indices. 
Reset
Reset is a provider of risk mitigation services, reducing basis risk within 
trading portfolios in interest rate, FX, equity index and inflation derivatives.
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , revenue decreased by 12% on a constant 
currency basis and was flat on a reported basis at £37 million (2015/16:  
£37 million) as the business continues to be affected by low short-dated 
interest rate volatility in Europe and further dampened volatility as a result 
of the ECB’s quantitative easing programme. During the year, commentators 
speculated about the timing of an increase in US interest rates which began 
a period of increased demand for Reset’s US dollar services and continued 
with the US presidential election and Federal rate rises in December 2016 
and March 2017 . Related FX volatility also benefited NDF volumes. Despite 
the drag of subdued Eurozone demand, the business is well placed to 
capitalise on higher client volumes on the back of further US interest  
rate rises.
ENSO Financial Analytics 
In April 2016, ENSO was acquired by NEX through NEX Opportunities.  
ENSO delivers data, analytics and workflow tools that enable hedge  
funds and asset managers to manage their relationships with prime  
brokers more effectively. ENSO provides a complete view of an individual 
hedge fund’s relationships across multiple counterparties, delivering insights 
on counterparty credit risk, collateral management, portfolio financing  
and treasury. 
During the course of the year, ENSO’s client base grew by 16% to 104 clients 
and its revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 was £9 million. Based on 
current investment plans, ENSO is expected to achieve run rate break even 
profitability within the next 18 months.
The future expansion of ENSO’S hedge fund client base is expected to be 
driven by sales of ENSO Edge, a product which has been developed for  
funds with assets under management of less than $1 billion, and the entry 
into new geographies, specifically Asia. ENSO is looking to leverage the 
capabilities of the other NEX companies, the first example of which is the 
partnership with NEX Treasury that will allow ENSO clients to invest excess 
cash into money market funds via the NEX Treasury platform.
Abide Financial 
In October 2016, Abide Financial was acquired by NEX through NEX 
Opportunities. Abide Financial is a market leader in the provision of 
regulatory reporting technology, helping market participants ensure they  
are compliant with evolving reporting obligations. The company acts as a 
reporting hub for EMIR and as an Approved Reporting Mechanism for MiFID. 
Abide Financial is currently awaiting ESMA’s approval to become a trade 
repository, and recently submitted an application to become a MiFID II Data 
Reporting Services Provider. Alongside Traiana and NEX Data, Abide Financial 
powers the NEX Regulatory Reporting division to deliver a holistic MiFID II 
offering for NEX’s clients.  
For the period since acquisition to 31 March 2017 , revenue was £3 million. 
Abide Financial is expected to achieve run rate break even profitability 
within the next 18 months.

NEX OPPORTUNITIES
Through NEX Opportunities, NEX is building an investment portfolio of 
emerging financial technology companies. It identifies and provides capital 
to companies delivering new platforms, business models and next 
generation technologies with the objective to drive efficiencies, transparency

£35 million in eight portfolio companies.
During the period, NEX Opportunities invested in RSRCHXchange, a MiFID II 
compliant marketplace for institutional research; Axoni, a leading provider  
of distributed ledger technology; OpenFin, a unifying operating layer for 
financial desktops; and Cloud9 Technologies, a cloud-based communication

Performance review
The results for the 2016/17 section of the strategic report (pages 1 to 33) 
focus on the Group’s divisional revenue and trading operating profit. 
Management plans and reviews the financial performance of the business 
using trading results that exclude acquisition and disposal costs and 
exceptional items (see the basis of preparation note to the financial 
statements). We choose to focus on trading results as we believe that  
this provides a clearer view of the business performance.
On 30 December 2016, the Group completed the disposal of IGBB to TP ICAP. 
The results of the IGBB business, the gain on disposal of IGBB and one-off 
separation costs arising from the Transaction have been presented as 
discontinued operations on one line in the Group consolidated income 
statement (net of tax). This financial review focuses on the trading 
performance from continuing operations. 
Trading revenue
Trading revenue from continuing operations was £543 million, which is  
£83 million (18%) up on the prior year. Revenue benefited from the 
weakening of pound sterling against the dollar and from new businesses.
Trading profit before tax
The Group reported a £6 million (4%) increase in trading operating profit 
from continuing operations. The trading operating profit excluding the 
effects of hedging losses was £17 million (12%) up on the prior year. Trading 
profit before tax was £4 million (4%) up on the prior year as the improved 
trading operating profit was partially offset by a £2 million increase in net 
finance costs. 
Tax on trading profit
The Group’s tax charge of £28 million on trading profit before tax from 
continuing operations represents a continuing ETR of 25% (2015/16: 21%). 
The continuing ETR primarily reflects the various statutory tax rates applied 
to taxable profits in territories in which the Group operates.
Acquisition and disposal costs 
Continuing 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , acquisition and disposal costs from 
continuing operations were a £1 million gain (2015/16: £74 million charge) 
before a tax credit of £6 million (2015/16: £16 million). 
The acquisition and disposal costs from continuing operations include  
a £19 million (2015/16: £nil) fair value gain arising from the increased 
investment in ENSO and an additional £2 million fair value gain arising  
from other transactions, which were partially offset by £20 million of 
amortisation charges (2015/16: £38 million) on acquired intangible assets. 
A more detailed breakdown of the Group’s acquisition and disposal costs  
is given in notes 3 and 15 to the financial statements. 
Exceptional items 
Continuing 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , exceptional items from continuing 
operations were a £5 million gain (2015/16: £9 million charge) before tax of 
£nil (2015/16: £2 million tax credit). The exceptional items from continuing 
operations relate to a £7 million release of onerous lease provisions as 
previously vacated office spaces have now been sub-let, proceeds from a 
legal expenses insurance claim of £3 million less legal expenses incurred  
in relation to regulatory matters of £5 million. 
Discontinued 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , exceptional items from discontinued 
operations were £1,134 million (2015/16: £31 million) before a tax credit  
of £6 million (2015/16: £4 million). 
The exceptional items from discontinued operations represent the gain on 
the disposal of IGBB of £1,162 million (2015/16: £nil), which is presented  
net of £28 million of costs of sale. Other Transaction-related costs include 
separation costs of £28 million (2015/16: £31 million). The proceeds from 
the Transaction in the form of 56% of the shares in TP ICAP were fully 
transferred to NEX shareholders. 
For further information, please see notes 4 and 5 to the financial 
statements. 
Trading EPS and dividend
Trading EPS (basic) is calculated based on the trading profit for the year. 
Management believes that trading EPS (basic) is the most appropriate EPS 
measurement ratio for the Group as this most closely reflects the ongoing 
generation of cash attributable to shareholders and in turn the Group’s 
ability to fund sustainable dividends. In line with this, the Remuneration 
Committee primarily considers trading EPS (basic) in its review of 
management performance and uses that metric in the remuneration of  
the executive directors; see the remuneration report on pages 56 to 72.

Intangible assets arising on consolidation
The Group’s goodwill and other intangible assets arising from consolidation 
from continuing operations as at 31 March 2017 were £1,026 million 
(2015/16: £826 million). During the period, the Group recognised £103 million 
goodwill and other intangible assets in relation to its acquisitions of ENSO, 
Abide Financial and e-MID. The remaining increase mainly resulted from the 
depreciation of pound sterling against the dollar and euro.
Management reviewed the Group’s goodwill and other intangibles assets 
arising on consolidation for impairment as at 31 March 2017 and concluded 
that there was no impairment at the date.
The review was based on certain estimates and assumptions, including 
future cash flow projections and discount rates. The Audit Committee 
challenged management’s judgements and estimates and has approved  
the appropriateness of management assumptions. Please see the report  
of the Audit Committee on pages 44 to 46.
Trade receivables and payables
NEX has changed its accounting policy for recording financial instruments 
relating to its matched principal business from trade date accounting to 
settlement date accounting. Matched principal trade receivables and 
payables as at 31 March 2016 have been restated as a result of the change 
in accounting policy.
The Group reported a trading EPS (basic) from continuing operations of 
23.2p per share, down from the prior year (2015/16: 23.6p per share). This 
was driven by the 4% increase in trading profit before tax offset by a four 
percentage point increase in trading ETR. Trading EPS (basic) for the Group 
including discontinued operations was 42.9p per share, down from the prior 
year (2015/16: 43.4p per share). 
The current year earnings include only nine months of discontinued 
operations in comparison with 12 months in the prior year. 
The directors recommend a final dividend of 27 .0p per share. If approved, 
the final dividend will be paid on 21 July 2017 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 30 June 2017 . The shares will be quoted 
ex-dividend from 29 June 2017 .
The full-year dividend will be 38.5p per share (2015/16: 38.5p per share) 
including the interim dividend of 11.5p per share (equivalent to the interim 
dividend paid of 6.6p per share on ICAP plc shares). The 2015/16 full-year 
dividend comparative has been restated from 22.0p per share to 38.5p per 
share to reflect the effect of the share consolidation. The full-year dividend 
per share is covered 1.1 times (2015/16: 1.1 times) by trading EPS (basic) 
from continuing and discontinued operations of 42.9p per share.

** Free cash flow for the year ended 31 March 2016 has been restated to include movement

Trading free cash flow generated during the period was £188 million, a 
conversion rate of 118% (2015/16: 107%). Over the medium term free cash 
flow is expected to be 80-90% of post tax trading profit. The excess in cash 
conversion over profit for the current year was mainly as a result of working 
capital movements, which is expected to normalise. 
Excluding the effects of working capital, the cash conversion would be in the 
order of 90%. The underlying shortfall in cash conversion is from the excess 
in capital expenditures, primarily IT spend, over amortisation and 
depreciation. Other non-cash expenses, such as share-based payment 
charges, partially offset this. 
Trading free cash flow of £188 million was used to pay £142 million  
in dividends to shareholders.

Liquidity and funding 
The Group’s overall funding position as at 31 March 2017 remains strong. 
As at 31 March 2017 , the Group had committed undrawn headroom under 
its core credit facilities of £300 million (2015/16: £315 million). During the 
year, the Group agreed an extension of the maturity date on its revolving 
credit facility to 31 March 2019. 
The gross debt position from continuing operations decreased by £76 million 
(13%) to £507 million as at 31 March 2017 . The decrease primarily relates  
to the repayment of the RCF (2015/16: £108 million) following the receipt  
of £330 million cash from TP ICAP .  
At 31 March 2017 , the Group’s long-term issuer ratings were unchanged  
at Baa3 (stable) by Moody’s and BBB (stable) by Fitch.

Net debt including restricted funds from continuing operations decreased  
by £6 million (7%) in the year to £83 million as at 31 March 2017 . During the 
period, the Group (including discontinued operations) converted £188 million 
of free cash flow. This was used to pay £142 million in dividends.  
On disposal of IGBB on 30 December 2016, NEX received £330 million of 
cash from TP ICAP under the terms of the Transaction, which partially offset 
the cash derecognised on the disposal. During the year, the Group paid  
£60 million in relation to various acquisitions (ENSO, Abide Financial, e-MID 
and other investments). There were also £48 million of exceptional items 
paid during the year in connection with Transaction-related expenses.

33 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Governance and directors’ report
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Leadership
During the year, the board undertook a detailed review of 
its composition, skills and experience in order to ensure 
that it is made up of members with the experience to 
challenge and contribute to NEX’s vision. As a result of 
this review, I am delighted that Anna Ewing will be 
joining the board of NEX as a non-executive director in 
May. Having previously worked for Nasdaq and Merrill 
Lynch, she brings significant technology and operations 
experience to NEX which I am confident will support  
our development and growth as a financial technology 
company. We look forward to working with Anna. In 
accordance with the articles of association of NEX, she  
is expected to stand for appointment at the annual 
general meeting in July.
John Sievwright was appointed to the board in July  
2009 and has been Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committees and the senior independent director for 
much of this time. With John’s length of service reaching 
nine years in July 2018, we are seeking to appoint a 
non-executive with the appropriate experience to take 
over, in due course, the chairs of both the Audit and 
Risk Committees.
Dear shareholders,
It is with great pleasure that I am introducing the first 
corporate governance statement and directors’ report 
as Chairman of NEX. During the year, the focus for the 
board and senior management was, to a very large 
extent, on ensuring a successful completion of the 
Transaction with TP ICAP. This was complex and took 
longer than anticipated and consumed a great deal of 
the board and senior management’s time. The result, 
with completion at the end of December 2016, was a 
very good outcome for shareholders. 
This focus led to the deferment of a number of other 
strategic priorities which had previously been identified 
for action and/or completion during the financial year. 
Because of the importance of the Transaction, the board 
supported the Remuneration Committee’s views on 
the impact this had on the executive directors’ bonus 
arrangements. Further details of the outcomes relative 
to the performance goals for 2016/17 are detailed in the 
remuneration report.
Charles Gregson
Chairman
34 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors’ report Financial statements Definitions
While these recruitment processes remain ongoing,  
we recognise that our diversity, in terms of gender and 
ethnicity, fell short of prescribed targets during the year. 
All board appointments will continue to be made on 
merit with due regard for the benefits of diversity. In the 
interim, we are confident that our diversity in terms of 
thinking and challenge remains strong within  
the boardroom. 
Governance
With the launch of NEX and its new position in the 
competitive financial technology marketplace, we  
have started a review of our governance framework.  
We recognise that, in this different competitive space, 
we must be ‘fit for purpose’ with all functions 
appropriate to the new environment, whether regulated 
or not. While there is more work to be done, the Risk 
Committee has begun its debate on its focus for 
2017/18 and the outcome of this discussion is 
documented within the risk management and Risk 
Committee’s activities sections of this Annual Report.
As a result of the Transaction and the subsequent review 
of the governance framework for NEX, we undertook 
internal evaluations of the board and its committees 
during the year, focusing on the outcomes of previous 
reviews and the requirements for the new Group.  
When our governance review has completed and the 
proposed changes to our board have been embedded  
for a suitable period during 2017/18, we will undertake 
an externally facilitated evaluation of the board and  
its committees. 
Culture
We have always recognised the need for a strong and 
identifiable culture and we want everybody within the 
Group to feel and be part of the NEX family as our 
business continues to develop and grow. As part of the 
rebranding to NEX, we are redefining our corporate 
values and the behaviours that support them. Once 
formalised, these values and behaviours will be 
embedded and reinforced throughout the Group. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all board 
members for their time commitment during the year 
and continued commitment and enthusiasm for NEX 
going forward.
In the new NEX world, we continue to strive to be a good 
investment, a great employer and a valued contributor 
to our communities, year after year. Thank you for 
continuing to support these goals.

37 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Governance and directors’ report
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Board governance framework
To ensure it maintains an appropriate level of oversight, the board 
delegates certain roles and responsibilities to its five principal committees: 
Governance, Nomination, Audit, Risk and Remuneration. Membership of 
these committees consists primarily of our non-executive directors and, 
in some cases, the Chairman. The Nomination Committee makes 
recommendations for appointments to the board, Audit and Risk 
Committees. The board makes all other committee appointments.
The activities of the principal committees in 2016/17 are explained in more 
detail on pages 43 to 49. Each committee chairman reports back to the 
board and the board reviews the minutes of previous committee meetings 
at its next meeting. Each committee’s terms of reference are documented 
and agreed by the board and available to view in the corporate governance 
section of the Company’s website (www.nex.com). 
During the year, the board began a detailed review of the Group’s 
governance framework in order to improve the board’s oversight and 
understanding of the Group’s governance arrangements. The initial 
outcomes of this review are discussed in more detail on page 43.
Group Company Secretary
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Group Company 
Secretary who is responsible for ensuring that board procedures and 
applicable rules are observed. The Group Company Secretary works closely 
with the Chairman and the chairmen of the board’s principal committees  
to set meeting agendas and ensure the timely presentation of high-quality 
information to the board. All directors have the power to propose items 
for discussion at board meetings and regularly did so during the year. 
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
As NEX is listed on the London Stock Exchange we apply the main principles 
of the Code and comply with the Code’s provisions. For the year ended 
31 March 2017 , and at the date of this report, we complied with the 2014 
Code. A revised Code came into effect in 2016, applying to financial years 
beginning on or after 17 June 2016, and will apply to NEX in 2017/18. 
Copies of the 2014 and 2016 Codes can be found on the FRC’s website  
at www.frc.org.uk.

proposals and financial statements. The board is also responsible for 
promoting the highest standards of corporate governance and ensuring 
the Group has the necessary resources, processes, controls and culture 
in place to deliver Group strategy and promote long-term growth. 
Board members
A clear division of responsibilities is maintained between the roles of the 
Chairman and the Group Chief Executive Officer. It is the responsibility of the 
Chairman to lead and manage the work of the board. Responsibility for the

London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore. The boards of NEX Group plc 
and ICAP plc also convened a further six times during the year by 
conference call and held two ad hoc meetings, principally in connection 
with the Transaction. 
At the board’s request, members of the GEMG attended certain board 
meetings during the year to provide updates on specific developments. 
Their attendance provided a valuable opportunity for the non-executive 
directors to engage directly with the executive team and challenge 
management’s thinking on discussion items, particularly strategic 
investment reviews and acquisition proposals.
The table below sets out the scheduled board meeting attendance of  
the directors who served on the board in 2016/17 . Due to unavoidable 
circumstances, Ivan Ritossa was unable to attend one board meeting  
of ICAP plc on 10 November 2016. He did, however, receive the meeting 
papers and provided input to the Chairman in advance of the meeting.

SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
The Company’s annual general meeting is a key date in the diary for the 
board. Shareholders who attend the meeting will receive an update from the 
Group Chief Executive Officer on the activities and performance of the Group 
since the prior financial year end. All directors attended the 2016 ICAP plc 
annual general meeting and were available to answer questions from 
shareholders on matters put to the meeting. 
For those shareholders who are unable to attend annual general meetings, 
particularly our overseas shareholder base, NEX has put in place systems to 
allow for electronic proxy voting through the NEX shareholder portal website 
(www.nex-shares.com). The proxy votes received on annual general meeting 
resolutions are published on the Company’s website (www.nex.com) 
following the meeting.
The board gives high priority to shareholder and investor communications. 
It receives regular investor reports which detail the feedback from investor 
meetings. It also receives the results of investor perception studies which 
are undertaken by external consultants. 
Subject to regulatory constraints, the directors and members of senior 
management hold regular meetings with investors and analysts to update 
them on the Group’s strategy and performance. In 2016/17 these meetings 
included presentations from the Group Chief Executive Officer and other 
senior executives to take analysts and investors through the Group’s 
half-year results and future vision for NEX.
The senior independent director and non-executive directors are available 
to meet with shareholders during the year. The Chairman and non-executive 
directors hosted an investor lunch following the 2016 ICAP plc annual 
general meeting. This was a valuable opportunity for the non-executive 
directors to engage with key investors and stakeholders, particularly in 
relation to the Group’s dividend policy, measurements of success and 
approach to executive director remuneration. 
2017 NEX Group plc annual general meeting
The first annual general meeting of NEX Group plc was held on 
14 September 2016 prior to its listing on 15 December 2016. 
The 2017 annual general meeting will be held on Wednesday 12 July 2017 
at 2 Broadgate, London EC2M 7UR. In accordance with the Code and the 
Company’s articles of association, all directors will stand for appointment 
or re-election in July.
Full details of the resolutions to be proposed at the 2017 annual general 
meeting are set out in the notice of annual general meeting. The notice 
is made available to shareholders on www.nex.com or sent to them, if 
they have elected to receive hard copies, at least 20 working days before 
the meeting.
Details of proxy votes for and against each resolution, together with votes 
withheld, will be made available after the vote has been dealt with on a show 
of hands and the results of the meeting will be published on www.nex.com.
2016 ICAP plc annual general meeting
All resolutions proposed at the 2016 annual general meeting were duly 
passed and the board was pleased to note that the total number of proxy 
votes received for all resolutions at the 2016 annual general meeting 
represented more than 85% of the total voting rights of ICAP plc 
(2015 ICAP plc annual general meeting: more than 83%).
Shareholder approval of the Transaction
On 9 September 2016, ICAP plc held two shareholder meetings to approve 
the Transaction: a court meeting and a general meeting. All resolutions  
were conducted on a poll and passed with at least 96% of shareholder 
votes in favour of all resolutions. The total number of votes received for both 
meetings represented more than 86% of the total voting rights of ICAP plc. 
The original terms of the Transaction received ICAP plc shareholder approval 
on 24 March 2016. Further information regarding the Transaction is available 
on www.nex.com.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED
EFFECTIVENESS
The composition of the board and its committees is regularly reviewed 
to ensure there is the right mix of skills, experience and knowledge of 
the Company to enable board and committee members to perform  
their roles effectively. 
Time commitment
In order to effectively discharge their responsibilities, the non-executive 
directors must commit sufficient time to their role which, at a minimum, 
the board considers to be between 30 and 36 days each year. The Chairman 
has confirmed that, in his view, each non-executive director continued to 
demonstrate commitment to their role during the year, particularly in light 
of the significant time impact of the Transaction. None of the non-executive 
directors took on further significant commitments during the year. The 
Chairman, who is based at NEX’s London office, continued to commit as 
much time as was necessary to fulfil his duties with his responsibilities to 
NEX taking priority over other business commitments.
In addition to the time spent preparing for and attending board and 
committee meetings, during the year the Chairman and the non-executive 
directors allocated sufficient time to further their understanding of the 
Group. This took the form of briefing meetings with executive and local 
management in our Stockholm and Tel Aviv offices as well as regular 
training sessions to ensure ongoing business awareness.
The table below summarises the directors’ attendance at board committee 
meetings during the year.

Performance evaluations
The board considers the outcomes of its evaluations as fundamental to 
driving performance and engagement. Key recommendations from each 
year’s assessments are prioritised as actions for the following year. With 
a significant proportion of the board’s time and activities having been 
committed to the Transaction in 2016/17 , the board agreed that an external 
assessment, which had been scheduled to be undertaken in 2016/17 
following completion of the Transaction, would be deferred to 2017/18. 
This approach remains in line with the Code. 
In prioritising its evaluation actions from 2015/16, the board had agreed 
that a detailed review of its composition was a key action for 2016/17 and 
ensured that proposed changes to the balance of the board would form 
part of the board’s 2017/18 assessments. Further details of this review are 
included in the Nomination Committee report on page 44. The board 
confirmed it had received good-quality and relevant information throughout 
the year and agreed it had benefited from enhanced engagement with NEX’s 
senior management team as part of NEX strategy discussions. During the 
year, the board committees also implemented a number of their prior year 
evaluation actions, as discussed in more detail on pages 43 to 49.
With support from its principal committees, the board has agreed that 
its key priorities in 2017/18 should include further development and 
communication of NEX’s strategy, setting appropriate performance 
metrics for executives and evaluating the talent that the Group has  
or requires to successfully achieve its objectives. 
Led by John Sievwright, our senior independent director, the non-executive 
directors provided input for the Chairman’s 2016/17 performance evaluation. 
Taking into account the views of the executive directors, the evaluation 
concluded that the Chairman had fully discharged his duties in terms of 
leadership and ensuring the effectiveness of the board during the year. 
In particular, the Chairman had played a crucial role in the context of the 
Transaction, through his support of the Group Chief Executive Officer 
and ensuring that the board was kept fully informed as the Transaction 
progressed. The evaluation also recognised the Chairman’s strong lines of 
communication with many executives in the Group and his excellent grasp 
of day-to-day operations, both areas which he regularly discusses and shares 
with the non-executive directors.

Independence 
During the year, the board carried out a formal review of the independence 
of its non-executive directors. The review considered the nature of the 
non-executive directors’ other appointments, any other positions they hold 
within the Group, any potential conflicts of interest they have identified 
and their length of service (including in their capacity as former directors 
of ICAP plc). Their individual circumstances were also assessed against the 
independence criteria set out in the Code. Following this review, the board 
determined that all non-executive directors continue to be independent 
in character and judgement, particularly in their thinking and challenge 
of management.
Board inductions
Based on their background, knowledge and skill set, all new directors receive 
a comprehensive and tailored induction following appointment to the board. 
Through a combination of office visits, technical briefings and introductory 
meetings, the NEX board induction programme is designed to broaden 
directors’ understanding of the Group’s business operations, strategic 
priorities, people, culture and clients. 
Training and development
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all directors receive ongoing 
training and development to enhance their roles as board and committee 
members. Our non-executive directors engage fully in this process. 
Throughout the year, the directors were kept fully apprised by external 
advisors of their legal and fiduciary duties in the context of the Transaction. 
They also received strategic business updates and detailed briefings on 
corporate governance, regulatory and legislative developments, including 
changes required by the EU Market Abuse Regulation.
External advice
Where appropriate, the directors may obtain independent professional 
advice in respect of their duties to the board and its committees at the 
Company’s expense. No directors sought external advice in 2016/17 .
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The board has procedures in place for the disclosure of conflicts of interest. 
The directors are aware of their responsibility to avoid a situation whereby 
they have an actual or potential conflict of interest and the requirement to 
inform the Chairman and the Group Company Secretary of any change in 
their situation. An effective procedure is in place for the board to authorise 
conflict situations should they arise, in accordance with the Companies Act 
and the Company’s articles of association.
The Group Company Secretary is responsible for keeping appropriate records, 
including the scope of any authorisations granted by the board. The board 
undertakes an annual review of conflict authorisations. No additional 
conflicts of interest were required to be authorised during the year.
Compliance with the Code
It is the board’s view that, for the year ended 31 March 2017 , the Company 
has applied all the main principles and been fully compliant with all 
provisions set out in the 2014 Code.
GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE
In order to facilitate efficient and effective management and deliver 
long-term shareholder value, the role of the Governance Committee is to 
review, recommend and make decisions in relation to all aspects of the 
Group’s governance environment. The committee reports to the board.
Members
The Governance Committee’s membership is made up of the Chairman 
of the board, the senior independent director, a non-executive director, 
the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer. 
The committee is chaired by the Chairman of the board. The Group General 
Counsel and Global Chief Operating Officer have standing invitations to 
attend committee meetings.
The table on page 42 sets out the directors who served on the 
Governance Committee during the year and their meeting attendance.
Key activities
A key action identified by the committee’s performance evaluation in 
2015/16 was for the committee to undertake a detailed review of the 
Group’s corporate governance framework in 2016/17 . Driven by the 
committee’s responsibility to ensure effective corporate governance 
throughout the Group, this review began in May 2016. 
With assistance from the Group’s internal audit, legal and company 
secretarial functions, the committee debated how best to evaluate Group 
governance standards. Recognising developments in best practice and  
the importance of accountability to shareholders, the review focused on 
oversight of the Group’s regulated subsidiaries and an evaluation of the  
role and activities of the committee. 
Identified improvements included an enhanced framework for robust and 
regular performance evaluations of subsidiary level boards and committees 
and improved circulation of regulated entity board minutes to relevant 
stakeholders. In order to ensure board composition and business 
oversight remain effective throughout the Group, all subsidiary board 
appointments will require the committee’s prior approval going forward, 
including an assessment of the value and experience which each nominated 
board member will bring to the board.
The committee’s terms of reference were updated in July 2016 and 
March 2017 to reflect these changes. The review remains ongoing 
and we look forward to reporting on any further enhancements to 
our governance structure in next year’s report.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee is primarily responsible for reviewing the 
structure, size, composition and succession planning of the board. It also 
ensures that a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure exists for the 
appointment of new directors. The committee reports to the board.
Members 
Members of the Nomination Committee are appointed by the board 
and comprise a majority of independent non-executive directors. 
The committee is chaired by the Chairman of the board. 
The table on page 42 sets out the directors who served on the 
Nomination Committee during the year and their meeting attendance.
Key activities 
In line with the output from its 2015/16 performance evaluation, the 
committee focused on a review of the board’s composition during the  
year. The committee agreed that a diversity of gender, race, experience  
and approach are powerful drivers for board effectiveness and determined 
that the board, as composed, was not considered to be sufficiently diverse. 
In addressing this, the committee was assisted by the Group Head of HR 
and appointed Heidrick & Struggles as external search consultants. 
Heidrick & Struggles is an experienced and reputable executive search 
firm and a signatory to the voluntary code of conduct on gender diversity 
for external search consultants. 
The committee evaluated the specific skills and experience required for 
the board, taking into account the future of NEX as a forward-thinking, 
technology-based services company. The committee determined that a 
strong technology background would be a key skills requirement for future 
appointments and, on that basis, a short list of suitable board level 
candidates was prepared for the committee’s review. The committee 
evaluated each of these candidates and refined the list further. Potential 
candidates were invited to meet with the full board and key members of 
the executive team. 
In line with NEX’s board appointment policy, final recruitment decisions  
are made by the board based on merit and we are pleased that Anna Ewing 
will be joining the board as a non-executive director in May 2017 . Having 
previously worked for Nasdaq and Merrill Lynch, she brings significant 
technology and operations experience to the board which we are confident 
will support our development and growth as a financial technology company.
During the year, and particularly following completion of the Transaction,  
we also considered the importance of effective succession planning as a key 
component of talent and resourcing risk management. These discussions 
resulted in a detailed succession plan being finalised in February 2017 for 
the board, key executives and senior management team. 
Aside from recruitment services, Heidrick & Struggles had no other 
connection with the Company during the year.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Chairman’s overview 
As Chairman of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to introduce this report 
which sets out how the committee has discharged its responsibilities during 
the year. 
In line with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services Order, the 
committee’s terms of reference were updated during the year to reflect  
the committee’s increased responsibilities for approval of audit fees and 
oversight of a tender process for the Group’s external audit contract at  
least every ten years. 
We issued a competitive tender for our external audit contract in 2015/16 
and this resulted in a recommendation from the committee that Deloitte  
be appointed as the Company’s auditor for the year ending 31 March 2018. 
Throughout the year under review, PwC and Deloitte have worked together 
to ensure a smooth transition of the audit contract with minimal disruption 
to the business. In line with prevailing independence rules in the UK, the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and upcoming changes to EU 
rules, a detailed independence transition plan was prepared and launched in 
November 2016. The plan enabled Deloitte to familiarise itself with NEX and 
receive a structured and formal handover from PwC. Deloitte has regularly 
reported to the committee on the progress of the transition and has met 
with senior management in London, New York, Stockholm and Tel Aviv.  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank PwC, Deloitte and the NEX 
management team for their hard work in ensuring a successful transition.  
A resolution to propose the appointment of Deloitte as the Group’s new 
external auditor will be put to the 2017 annual general meeting.
While recognising that 2016/17 was its final year of audit, as required by the 
Code and in accordance with the committee’s terms of reference, during the 
year the committee evaluated the effectiveness of the Group’s external 
audit process for the prior year. The evaluation process is discussed in more 
detail on page 46 but I am pleased to report that PwC’s performance in 
2015/16 was rated positively overall and I wish to take this opportunity  
to thank PwC for its services to the Group throughout the years. 
Finally, the board is required to provide a statement that, taken as a whole, 
it believes the Annual Report and financial statements to be fair, balanced 
and understandable. The governance framework to provide such assurance 
to the committee and to the board is set out on pages 45 and 46. The 
statement itself is on page 54.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for the effective governance of the 
Group’s financial reporting, including the adequacy of financial disclosures 
and both the external and internal audit functions. It is authorised by the 
board to carry out any activity within its terms of reference. The Audit 
Committee reports to the board.
Members
The Audit Committee members are all independent non-executive directors 
and the committee is chaired by John Sievwright. The board is satisfied that 
at least one member of the committee has recent and relevant financial 
experience and that all members bring extensive expertise to the committee. 
The table on page 42 sets out the directors who served on the Audit 
Committee during the year and their meeting attendance.
Meetings are attended by the Chairman, the Group Chief Financial Officer, 
the Global Chief Operating Officer, the Group General Counsel, the CFO Group 
Finance, the Group Head of Internal Audit and the external audit partner.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee maintains contact with attendees 
throughout the year. There were two meetings during 2016/17 when the 
committee met with the Group Head of Internal Audit and the external audit 
partner without any executive director or management present.
Key activities 
An annual work plan is agreed to ensure all areas of significance are 
considered by the Audit Committee and that business and reporting 
requirements are met. The committee’s key activities during the year 
included reviewing and discussing:
 – a transition plan in respect of Deloitte’s appointment as the Company’s 
external auditor in 2017;
 – approval of the 2016/17 external audit fee;
 – the appropriateness of the Group’s half-year and annual financial 
statements and financial announcements to the London Stock Exchange;
 – accounting treatment of the Transaction;
 – the viability assessment and viability statement on page 55;
 – the going concern statement on page 54 and the appropriateness of 
preparing the Group’s half-year and annual financial statements on  
a going concern basis;
 – reports from the external auditor;
 – the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems for financial 
reporting;
 – an annual schedule of work to be conducted by the external and 
internal audit teams; and
 – the effectiveness of the external and internal audits.
Financial reporting
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s accounting policies and monitors 
the integrity of the Group’s financial statements, including the half-year and 
annual reports, and other announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance to ensure that they present a balanced and clear assessment 
of the Group’s financial position and outlook.
During the year, the committee considered certain accounting and financial 
reporting areas to be of a more subjective nature. Throughout the year, 
management presented to the committee its position on those areas that 
were material in nature and involved significant management judgement 
and assumptions. In reviewing management’s judgements and estimates in 
these areas, where appropriate, the committee discussed these judgements 
and estimates with the external auditor. 
The committee discussed and approved the appropriateness of items that 
were presented in the exceptional items column in the consolidated income 
statement, considering their nature and materiality. Management presented 
financials attributable to the IGBB business and to the retained Group 
separately in the consolidated income statement. The committee 
considered and approved management’s presentation of items, including 
discontinued operations and a £1,162 million gain on the disposal of IGBB; 
see note 5 to the financial statements.
The committee considers the annual goodwill impairment review to be a 
significant judgement area and, as such, reviewed the impairment testing 
which was undertaken by management during March 2017 . The impairment 
test identified that there was no impairment. In reviewing this area, the 
committee considered the appropriateness of management’s judgements 
and estimates; see note 15 to the financial statements. 
The committee considered and approved the Group’s significant accounting 
policies, including a new accounting policy for technology development 
revenue and a change to the segmental reporting accounting policy. 
The committee also considered and approved a change from trade date 
accounting to settlement date accounting for matched principal receivables 
and payables.
The committee noted that management considered investment in joint 
ventures and associates, provisions, contingent liabilities and technology 
development revenue to be other significant areas where increased 
judgement is required. The committee reviewed management’s 
assessments and discussed the appropriateness of management’s 
estimates with the external auditor. The committee approved 
management’s conclusions.
The committee considered management’s going concern statement and 
the appropriateness of preparing the Group’s annual financial statements on 
a going concern basis. It also considered management’s viability statement 
and the appropriateness of management’s judgements, estimates and 
assumptions made in assessing the viability of the Group. The committee, 
on behalf of the board, is satisfied that an assessment of the solvency and 
liquidity of the Group over a period of three financial years up to 31 March 
2020 has been carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code. 
The viability statement is disclosed on page 55 and should be read together 
with the Group’s risk management framework and principal risks as set out 
in the risk management section of the strategic report on pages 20 to 23.
45 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Governance and directors’ report
Additionally, auditing standards require the external auditor to presume risks 
of fraud in revenue recognition as a significant audit risk area and to perform 
procedures to address those risks. The committee concluded that, based on 
the findings reported by the external and internal auditors and from its own 
review of the Group’s internal control and risk management frameworks, the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 were not exposed to 
a material risk arising from this risk area.
The committee has delegated responsibility for the day-to-day financial 
management and monitoring of financial controls to the GFC.
The work described above, together with a review of the content of the 
strategic report, provided the assurance to the committee, and to the board, 
that the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2017 , taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s and the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
Internal audit 
The internal audit function consists of a small in-house team supported by 
KPMG (as outsourced providers). Internal audit establishes an annual audit 
plan based on discussions with management and an assessment of the 
risks inherent in the Group’s activities. The activities of internal audit are 
reported to the Audit and Risk Committees and provide assurance to both 
management and these committees that the system of internal control 
achieves its objectives and highlights gaps and areas for improvement.
During the year, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function was carried out through a questionnaire and key stakeholders 
across the Group were asked to participate. The questionnaire addressed 
the function’s quality of planning and communication, understanding of 
the key risks and controls within the business, resourcing, engagement 
and independence. A subsequent report to the Audit Committee provided 
empirical data on which the function’s overall performance was assessed. 
The report also included specific comments made by respondents, 
providing valuable insight into management’s views. The results of the 
evaluation concluded that the function’s performance in 2016/17 was rated 
positively overall, particularly its independence, quality of reporting to the 
Audit Committee and high levels of engagement across the Group. 
External auditor
As reported on page 44, a recent tender of the Group’s external audit 
contract concluded that Deloitte be appointed as the Company’s external 
auditor for the year ending 31 March 2018. Resolutions proposing Deloitte’s 
appointment and giving authority to the Audit Committee to determine 
their remuneration will be proposed at the 2017 annual general meeting. 
PwC will not be proposed for re-appointment. 
Non-audit services
In line with best practice, the Audit Committee is responsible for 
determining the non-audit services that the external auditor may or may 
not provide to the Group and monitoring the balance of spend on audit 
and non-audit fees to ensure the continued independence of the Group’s 
external auditor. A policy is in place whereby the expenditure with the 
Group’s auditor for non-audit work should not exceed 75% of the audit fee. 
Any proposed non-audit assignments with fees in excess of £100,000 are 
subject to the Audit Committee’s prior approval. Fees below this limit are 
approved by the Chairman of the Audit Committee and reported to the 
committee. All non-audit services provided to the Group are in accordance 
with applicable legislation.
The total spend on non-audit services during the year was approximately 
£1.2 million, being approximately 38% of the audit fee (2015/16: 90%). 
The non-audit fee was mainly in relation to corporate finance and other 
assurance services required in connection with the Transaction. Note 3 
to the financial statements provides further details of the fees paid for  
audit and non-audit services during the year.
Effectiveness
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the external audit process in 2015/16 
was carried out through a questionnaire. Key stakeholders across the Group 
were asked to participate in the evaluation. While mindful that 2016/17 
would be its last year of external audit, the questionnaire was designed to 
evaluate PwC’s audit process in its entirety and addressed PwC’s quality of 
planning and communication, sufficiency of audit firm resources, technical 
knowledge, independence and objectivity and PwC’s understanding of the 
business. A subsequent report to the Audit Committee provided empirical 
data on which the committee assessed the audit process. It also included 
specific comments made by respondents, providing valuable insight into 
management’s views. The results of the evaluation concluded that PwC’s 
performance in 2015/16 was rated positively overall, particularly its 
independence and objectivity. Specific learnings from the feedback received 
will be shared with Deloitte going forward.
Whistleblowing
The Group maintains a global whistleblowing hotline through which 
employees may raise issues of concern, report suspected wrongdoing,  
or seek clarification on ethical dilemmas in confidence. The service is 
administered through an independent third party vendor. The Audit 
Committee receives reports of notifications made through the system.  
No such notifications were submitted during the year.
Statutory Audit Services Order
Following the tender of the Group’s external audit contract in 2015/16, 
the Company confirms its compliance with the requirements of the 
Statutory Audit Services Order for the year ended 31 March 2017 . 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED

RISK COMMITTEE
Chairman’s overview 
I am pleased to introduce the Risk Committee report for 2016/17 . My role 
as Chairman of the Risk Committee is to safeguard the independence and 
oversee the performance of the Group Risk function.
Based on the work the committee has undertaken during the year, which 
is described in more detail on the following pages, I believe that the Group’s 
risk management and internal control systems remain effective. No 
significant failings or weaknesses were identified during the year. In addition, 
I and the other committee members believe we have regularly received 
high-quality information and that the key executives we rely on have acted 
with skill, independence and transparency.
Such an assessment is important from a governance perspective but 
it is as important to ensure that the Group is always looking forward, 
continually ensuring its effectiveness and taking steps to enhance its risk 
management and internal control systems. With the Transaction now 
complete, both the committee and the executive team will continue to 
be particularly vigilant to ensure that our risk management systems and 
internal controls are properly tailored to the principal risks of the Group. 
We are particularly attuned to information security and business resiliency 
risk from cyber security and other events and these will continue to be key 
areas of focus. In addition, there are significant changes occurring both 
internally and externally that we will need to be prepared for, including the 
impact of Brexit, MiFID II, the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe 
and the change in administration in the US. All of these developments, and 
the Group’s business strategic priorities, are likely to have implications for 
our risk management and internal control systems and we will need to 
ensure the consequences of such change are addressed in a timely and 
effective manner.

Risk Committee
The Risk Committee reports to the board and is responsible for setting the 
overall risk strategy, risk appetite and risk tolerance for the Group in order 
to ensure that the risk management function within the Group promotes 
the success of the Company. The committee is authorised by the board to 
carry out any activity within its terms of reference. Its principal areas of 
responsibility include:
 – ensuring that the Group’s principal risks (including key and emerging 
risks) are properly identified, assessed and mitigated on an ongoing basis; 
 – regularly reviewing the quality and effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control frameworks; and
 – reviewing the internal audit programme as part of integrated assurance.
Members
The Risk Committee members are all independent non-executive directors 
and the committee is chaired by John Sievwright. 
The table on page 42 sets out the directors who served on the Risk 
Committee during the year and their meeting attendance.
The Chairman of the board, the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Global 
Chief Operating Officer, the Group General Counsel, the Chief Risk Officer,  
the Global Head of Compliance, the Group Head of HR, the Group Head of 
Internal Audit and the external audit partner regularly attend meetings of 
the committee.
The Chairman of the Risk Committee maintains contact with attendees 
throughout the year and has met with the Group Head of Internal Audit, 
the Chief Risk Officer and the Global Chief Operating Officer without any 
executive director or management present.
Key activities 
An annual work plan is prepared to ensure all areas of significance are 
considered by the committee and that business and reporting requirements 
are met. The committee’s key activities during the year included reviewing 
and discussing:
 – regular and robust assessments of the principal risks facing the Group;
 – key and emerging risks and Group risk appetite breaches;
 – separation planning and governance arrangements surrounding 
the Transaction;
 – annual review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control frameworks;
 – information risk reporting, key risk indicator metrics and remedial actions;
 – compliance reporting and key regulatory updates affecting the Group;
 – a review of the Group’s interactions with global regulators, compliance 
examinations and routine and non-routine regulatory enquiries;
 – an organisational review of the Group’s Risk and compliance functions; and
 – levels of mandatory training in risk and compliance matters, identifying 
and escalating any non-adherence.

Risk control and management framework 
The board reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control frameworks on an annual basis. This 
review is supported by the Group’s independent control functions. Any 
remediating actions identified are reported to the board. 
No significant failings or weaknesses in the Group’s systems of risk 
management or internal control were identified during the year, or when 
examining these systems for NEX following completion of the Transaction. 
The Group complies with FRC guidance.
All commercial and support managers are responsible for the identification, 
management and mitigation of the risks in the areas for which they are 
responsible. Employees are expected to take a prudent approach to the 
management of risk, and to be committed to transparency, escalation of 
issues and continuous self-improvement. Prudent risk management is not 
something that is the province only of certain control functions; it is 
everyone’s responsibility.
The Group’s internal control and risk management systems in relation  
to financial reporting are described on pages 45 and 46.
Risk management
The Group maintains an independent risk management function responsible 
for providing expertise, challenge and analysis of risk-related developments.  
Among the key responsibilities of the Group Risk function are:
 – serving as a central repository for the reporting of risk events, providing 
challenge and analysis of such events and their remediation, and 
presenting such events to the Risk Committee at its standing meetings;
 – assisting with the development and implementation of risk 
management policies and standards;
 – administering a board approved credit matrix for the assignment of 
counterparty credit limits to clients and the monitoring of exposure  
and potential breaches;
 – identifying and reviewing key and emerging risks on a regular basis  
and reporting updates to the Risk Committee at its standing meetings;
 – assisting with the preparation of ICAAPs for EU regulated subsidiaries  
of the Group; and
 – conducting targeted deep-dives of important and emerging risk issues.
Internal control 
The board is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control systems, which management is 
responsible for maintaining, and it does this through the Audit and Risk 
Committees. The principal risks faced by the Group are detailed on   
pages 21 to 23. 
The day-to-day business of the Group is managed through a system of 
financial, operational and compliance controls and monitored by a series 
of risk management systems. Internal controls are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The effectiveness of the 
internal control system is reviewed regularly by the internal audit function.
The Group has investments in a number of joint ventures and associates. 
Internal control procedures for joint ventures and associates rest with the senior 
management of those operations and the Company seeks to monitor such 
investments and exert influence through board representation. The board’s 
review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control in those entities 
is consequently less comprehensive than in its directly-owned subsidiaries.

OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION CONTINUED
Statement of directors’ responsibilities for the Annual Report
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the strategic 
report, the remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare  
the Group’s and Company’s financial statements in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU. Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
 – state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the EU have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the Group and the Company 
keep adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s and the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
remuneration report comply with the Companies Act and, as regards  
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Having taken all the matters considered by the board and brought to 
the attention of the board during the year into account, the directors are 
satisfied that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and it provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group and the Company’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
information on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the FCA’s Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules
The directors are required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules to 
include a management report containing a fair review of the business and a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and the 
Company. The directors of the Company who were in office during the year, 
and up to the date of signing the Annual Report, were Charles Gregson, 
Michael Spencer, Stuart Bridges, Ivan Ritossa, John Sievwright and Robert 
Standing. Each of these directors, whose function is listed in the directors’ 
biographies, confirms to the best of their knowledge that:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 – the management report disclosures which are contained in the strategic 
report include a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position are set out in the strategic 
report. The financial position of the Group, its cash flow, liquidity position, 
facilities and borrowing position are described in the financial review. Notes 
11, 13 and 28 to the financial statements provide further detail on the 
Group’s borrowings and management of financial risks. The strategic report 
includes an analysis of the principal risks facing the Group and the Group’s 
approach to risk management.
After reviewing the Group’s annual budget, liquidity requirements, plans  
and financing arrangements, the directors are satisfied that the Group  
and the Company have adequate resources to continue to operate and 
confirm that the Group and the Company are going concerns. For this  
reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these 
financial statements.
54 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors’ report Financial statements Definitions
Viability statement
In addition to the requirement to consider the appropriateness of preparing 
the Group’s financial statements on a going concern basis, the directors 
have an obligation under the Code to make a statement in the Annual 
Report with regard to the viability of the Group, including explaining how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, the period of time for 
which they have made the assessment and why they consider that period 
to be appropriate.
The Group’s viability assessment has been made over a period of three 
financial years up to 31 March 2020. The directors are satisfied that a 
three-year period is sufficient to enable a reasonable assessment of the 
Group’s viability to be made. In addition, this period is covered by the  
Group’s medium-term plan. The board reviewed the plan in detail, 
challenged assumptions made in the forecasts and assessed the 
attainability of the forward projections.
In making this assessment, the directors have considered a wide range  
of information relating to present and future conditions, including future 
projections of profitability, cash flows and capital resources. They also 
assessed the potential financial and operational impacts, in severe but 
plausible scenarios, of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties.
Based on these assessments, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities  
as they fall due up to 31 March 2020.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report 
is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being information needed by 
the Company’s auditor in connection with preparing its report, of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware.
Each director has taken all the steps that he is obliged to take as a director in 
order to make him aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation 
is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
number of shares according to the share consolidation that occurred. 
Similarly, although the TSR peer group is not as relevant as it was to the ICAP 
business, it was deemed that it was no less challenging to the Group as a 
relative measure and should also be retained for the 2015 and 2016 awards.
Looking forward, we have decided to retain the overarching principle of 
measuring 50% of PSP awards on absolute EPS growth and 50% on relative 
TSR growth, but have amended the targets to remove the influence of an 
inflationary measure on EPS, in line with market practice. We have also 
changed the peer group from a selected basket of companies to the FTSE 
250 index. It is our view that nominating a relevant peer group for NEX from 
publicly traded companies is challenging and the index provides a clear 
comparator for relative performance.
The annual report on remuneration describes the performance versus 
objectives during 2016/17 and how this translates into executive director 
remuneration. This is the second year in which annual bonuses have been 
determined under the directors’ remuneration policy approved in 2015.
This year the report includes a more detailed disclosure section, including 
financial targets. Completion of the sale of the voice broking business 
means that the commercial sensitivity that made publication of targets 
last year imprudent is no longer a restricting factor and, in years of normal 
business activity, the committee will publish targets in the disclosure each 
year going forward.
The performance versus the objectives has been strong in 2016/17 and is 
representative of business performance overall. 
Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present the remuneration report for 2016/17 recommending 
the NEX Group plc remuneration policy for 2017/18 and explaining how we 
applied the current policy in 2016/17 . This policy was approved by ICAP plc 
shareholders in July 2015.
Completion of the sale of our voice broking business in December 2016 
marked a major milestone in the development of the business, allowing it 
to become a financial technology company. The creation of NEX Group plc 
requires that we, as a committee, present a remuneration policy to 
shareholders for approval. Having considered this carefully, we have decided 
to re-present the current policy for approval for a period of one year only. 
The committee considers this policy to be fit for purpose and, given that it 
has been in place for only two years, would prefer to undertake a review of 
executive director pay during the course of 2017/18, as the NEX strategy 
and culture develop and as the position on long term incentives becomes 
clearer. The committee will consult with major shareholders on a new 
three-year policy towards the end of 2017 , with a view to putting that to 
shareholder vote in the 2018 annual general meeting.
The committee also considered awards made under the PSP in 2015 and 
2016, and the performance conditions underpinning them. Having reviewed 
a number of comparative financial models, it became clear that, although 
the start and end points for the EPS measure differed with the voice broking 
business factored out, the growth expectation over the period was largely 
the same. With this in mind, the committee decided not to amend the 
EPS growth performance condition on these awards, but to only include 
the continuing business of NEX Group plc for the measure, and adjust the 
“ Looking forward, we have retained the profit-related 
financial measure in the executive director objectives  
to ensure that focus is retained on revenue generation  
and cost management.”
56 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors’ report Financial statements Definitions
The financial objectives that account for 70% of the bonus outturn had  
two main themes: our growth and protection, which was sub-divided into 
completing the sale of our voice broking business and generating incremental 
revenue from strategic initiatives; and profitability, which was split between 
trading profit growth and creating a new structure for the Group. 
Completion of the sale of the voice broking business was a binary objective 
which carried much less weight than the requirement to generate incremental 
revenue. Revenue generation from strategic initiatives was not as strong as 
we had hoped but this will remain a priority for the business, alongside 
prudent cost management, to drive profits in the future.
Due to completion of the Transaction taking place nine months into the year, 
trading operating profit was based on 12 months of the continuing business 
and nine months of the discontinued business. This was compared to  
12 months of continuing business and nine months of discontinued 
business in 2015/16. The initial design of the Group structure for NEX is 
complete and in the process of being implemented. This structure has 
already begun to produce cost savings. 
The strategic objectives that account for 30% of the bonus outturn also 
had two main themes; risk and control and people and culture.
The risk and control framework has been a focus for the Group for a 
number of years. It is now the view of the committee that the design and 
implementation phases of this work are complete, and that the framework 
is sufficiently well embedded in the business to be considered ‘business as 
usual’. Risk and control will continue to be key priority and will remain under 
constant review to ensure that it is appropriate and fit for purpose, although 
will no longer be measured for the purposes of executive director bonuses.
People and culture was split into themes: the design and delivery of a 
reward framework and of a new corporate brand and culture. In the case of 
the reward framework, the design is complete and is being rolled out to the 
business for the coming year. It is designed to reward strong performance 
and provide an appropriate balance of compensation for the content and 
seniority of each role in the business. The NEX brand was launched on  
30 December 2016 when the Transaction completed and was successfully 
implemented globally. The Company also has a clear view on its culture 
going forward, and the dissemination of this throughout the business  
is ongoing.
Overall, the performance of the executive directors was strong this year 
during a period of significant change, and has resulted in a bonus outturn  
of 78% of the maximum, fractionally higher than in 2016. Both the Group 
Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer have elected to 
defer 100% of the bonus awarded to them into NEX Group plc shares.
The BSMP 2014 matching award did not vest as it failed to meet the 
performance conditions. This was the final year of the BSMP following  
the adoption of the PSP in 2015 and subsequently by NEX.
Looking forward, we have retained the profit-related financial measure in 
the executive director objectives to ensure that focus is retained on revenue 
generation and cost management. In addition to this we are including a 
client-focused objective to the financial measures that rewards attraction 
and retention of clients, and also rewards improved relationships and client 
service. This is a key priority for the Company. The strategic objectives for  
the coming year are based around the communication of the NEX Group 
strategy, both internally and externally, such that all employees can clearly 
articulate that strategy and work by its values. Strategic focus will also be on 
the continued development of the operating model. Significant progress has 
been made during 2016/17 to design and implement the Group structure. 
This highlighted a number of additional areas where cost savings could be 
achieved and it is key that we develop these and work towards the most 
efficient model possible.
The directors’ remuneration policy will be put to a binding vote and the 
remuneration report (other than the part containing the directors’ 
remuneration policy) will be put to an advisory vote at the 2017 annual 
general meeting. We look forward to receiving your support.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
ICAP plc presented the following policy to shareholders at the annual general meeting in July 2015 when it was approved by binding vote. With the 
exception of an amendment to limit the committee’s discretion in respect of the recruitment of a new executive director the policy has remained 
unchanged. This was described in ICAP plc’s 2016 remuneration report. 
Further to the Transaction, the committee is required to seek approval of the directors’ remuneration policy for NEX at the 2017 annual general meeting. 
Given that the current policy has, however, been in place for only two years, the committee has decided to retain the current policy for a further year which, 
if approved, will apply from the date of the 2017 NEX annual general meeting. 
A full review of the policy will be undertaken during 2017 , with a view to seeking shareholder approval for a new directors’ remuneration policy to take 
effect from 1 April 2018. 
Future policy table for executive directors
The table below summarises the directors’ remuneration policy in respect of each component of remuneration for executive directors.
Element of pay
Purpose and link to  
NEX’s strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary Reflects individual 
role and experience.
Set at a level to attract 
the right talent into the 
Group to deliver the 
business strategy. 
Salaries are reviewed annually  
in the context of the total 
remuneration opportunity.  
Factors considered include:
 – size and scope of individual 
responsibilities;
 – skills, experience and 
performance;
 – typical salary levels for 
comparable roles within 
appropriate pay comparators; 
and
 – reward levels and structure 
below the board.
Any increase usually takes effect 
from 1 April. The committee 
may award increases at any other 
time, for example where there 
is a significant change in the 
role or responsibilities of the 
executive director.
Maximum levels of salary have not  
been set by the committee but 
executive director salary increases will 
normally be in line with the wider 
employee population.
Higher increases than the average for 
the wider employee population may be 
awarded in exceptional circumstances, 
at the Remuneration Committee’s 
discretion, including a significant 
increase in scope and/or responsibility 
of the individual’s role, rebalancing of 
fixed and variable pay or to take into 
account any future regulatory changes.
Where an executive director has been 
appointed to the board at a lower than 
typical salary, larger increases may be 
awarded as they develop in the role.
There are no specific 
performance conditions 
attached to salary increases, 
although overall performance 
of the individual and the 
Company will be one of the 
considerations in setting 
salary levels.
Pension Element of remuneration 
to assist employees with 
retirement planning.
Directors are normally enrolled 
in the relevant pension plan 
(if any) for senior managers 
in their country of residence.
The maximum pension contribution is 
equivalent to 5% of salary. Directors may 
opt out of the defined contribution plan 
operated in the UK and instead receive 
an equivalent cash allowance. A bonus 
sacrifice arrangement is also offered. 
Individual arrangements are shown on 
page 64. 
None

Element of pay
Purpose and link to  
NEX’s strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Benefits Element of remuneration 
to provide a competitive 
and cost-effective 
benefits package.
Executive directors are eligible to 
receive certain benefits that vary 
by director and may include (but 
are not limited to) medical, life 
insurance, car and travel benefits 
reflecting the director’s location 
and individual circumstances. 
The current Group Chief Executive 
Officer has the use of a driver, 
in order to recognise the unique 
circumstances of the role and the 
travel requirements involved. In 
certain circumstances our executive 
directors may be accompanied by 
their spouse/partner on business 
trips. This will only be where there 
is a genuine business reason.
The value of actual benefits 
received is shown on page 65.
Where executive directors are 
required to relocate or complete 
an international assignment, or 
perform duties outside their 
home location, the Remuneration 
Committee may offer additional 
expatriate benefits, if considered 
appropriate, or vary benefits 
according to local practice. This may 
include cover for additional taxation 
and support with tax reporting.
Benefits are generally set taking into 
account affordability and local market 
practice for comparable roles. 
The committee has not set a maximum 
limit for benefits. 
The benefit policy and levels are kept 
under review and the committee may 
remove benefits that executive directors 
receive or introduce other benefits if it 
considers it appropriate.
None
Annual bonus The annual bonus plan 
incentivises executive 
directors to achieve the 
Company’s key financial 
metrics and strategic 
objectives, while also 
aligning their interests 
with those of our 
shareholders. 
Deferral of a significant 
proportion of the bonus 
into shares helps to align 
the long-term interests 
of executives with those 
of our shareholders. 
The level of award is determined 
by the Remuneration Committee 
based on performance against 
the relevant performance criteria.
Awards are delivered in a 
combination of cash and shares, 
with at least 50% deferred for at 
least three years into NEX Group plc 
shares under the DSBP. A further 
six-month retention period may 
also be applied on awards under 
the DSBP.
The committee may award dividend 
equivalents in respect of dividends 
declared over the deferral period. 
Dividend equivalent payments 
are made at the end of the deferral 
period in either cash or shares.
The committee may apply malus or 
clawback to annual bonus awards in 
certain exceptional circumstances. 
Further details on malus and 
clawback provisions are provided 
in the notes to the table.
The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 300% of salary.
At least 70% of the annual 
bonus opportunity is assessed 
against financial measures. 
The balance will be subject 
to strategic and/or individual 
objectives.
The committee retains the 
right to adjust the balance of 
the measures on an annual 
basis. The financial element, 
however, will always have a 
greater weighting than the 
strategic/individual element.
Payouts will range from zero 
to 100% of the maximum, 
with 50% of the maximum 
payable for achieving 
‘on-target’ performance.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
Element of pay
Purpose and link to  
NEX’s strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Performance 
Share Plan 
(PSP)
The Group’s long term 
incentive plan is to 
reward sustained 
Company performance 
and the creation of 
shareholder value 
over time.
Annual award of NEX Group plc 
shares subject to performance 
conditions over a period of at least 
three years.
An additional holding period of  
at least two years will apply 
following vesting. 
Participants may receive a payment 
equivalent to the value of dividends 
paid on any vested shares when the 
participant receives those shares 
at the end of the holding period. 
Payment of dividend equivalents 
may be in either cash or shares.
The committee may apply malus 
or clawback to PSP awards. Further 
details on malus and clawback 
provisions are provided in the 
notes to the table.
The maximum PSP opportunity is 
300% of salary.
Performance measures 
include the Company’s 
financial performance and a 
share price-based measure 
which will usually be equally 
weighted. These measures are 
reviewed regularly to ensure 
that they remain appropriate 
to business strategy, are 
sufficiently challenging  
and remain appropriate  
for incentivising executive 
directors. In future, the 
committee may decide that 
it is appropriate to introduce 
additional measures such as 
NEX Group’s key long-term 
strategic objectives. In any 
case, at least 80% of the 
award will continue to 
be based on financial and 
share price-based measures.
Threshold performance 
results in 25% vesting, 
rising to full vesting for 
maximum performance.
Share-
holding 
requirement
To create alignment 
with shareholders 
by encouraging 
longer-term focus.
Executive directors are required to build up over time, and thereafter maintain, a holding in the Company’s 
shares. The minimum shareholding requirement for the Group Chief Executive Officer is 500% of base salary 
and for the other executive directors is 300% of base salary.
Notes to the policy table
Changes since last approved policy
The committee has made two changes to the policy approved by ICAP shareholders in 2015:
 – to remove the ability of the committee to approve compensation that sits outside the policy when hiring a new director; and 
 – to extend the malus and clawback provisions on share awards from five years to seven years. 
Legacy matters
The committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office, notwithstanding that they are not in line with the 
policy set out above, where the terms of the payment were agreed:
 – before this or a prior policy came into effect; or 
 – at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the committee, the payment was not in consideration 
for the individual becoming a director of the Company. 
For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms  
of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. 
In particular, under the 2003 BSMP, a bonus in lieu of dividend is paid on vested but unexercised awards.
Performance conditions
The performance conditions for both the annual bonus and PSP are selected to align directly with our short- and long-term strategy.
The profit before tax and EPS measures under the annual bonus and PSP incentivise the achievement of continuing financial growth, with the TSR measure 
providing a direct link to the creation of shareholder value. We also use strategic measures to focus on the achievement of the key short- and long-term 
strategic objectives of the Company.
Performance targets are set annually by the committee taking into account the board’s business plans and building in an appropriate level of stretch. 
The committee may vary both measures and targets year by year to ensure that they remain fully aligned with our strategy and continue to be reflective 
of the Company’s business plans.
More detail on the annual bonus and PSP measures and targets can be found on pages 70 and 71.
60 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors’ report Financial statements Definitions
Malus and clawback
All variable pay may be subject to malus and clawback in any of the following circumstances, for a period of up to seven years in line with corporate 
governance timeframes:
 – a material misstatement of the Company’s or any other Group member’s audited financial results;
 – a material failure of risk management by the Company, any other Group member or a relevant business unit;
 – misconduct or material error on the part of the participant; or
 – a material downturn in the financial performance of the Company, any other Group member or a relevant business unit (malus only).
Malus and clawback parameters will remain under review in line with regulatory guidance.
Future policy table for the Chairman and non-executive directors
Purpose and link to the Group’s strategy Operation and fee levels
To attract and retain a high-performing 
Chairman and non-executive directors 
with the right level of skills, international 
experience and industry knowledge.
The Chairman receives a fee for the role, as determined by the Remuneration Committee. The Chairman 
is entitled to an additional fee for the chairmanship of the Nomination Committee, but has waived his 
entitlement to this additional fee.
The non-executive directors receive an annual fee in respect of their duties. Further fees may be paid in 
respect of chairmanship of board committees and for the senior independent director. No fees are paid 
for membership of a board committee. Additional fees are paid to non-executive directors who sit on 
the board of the SEF entities and/or any other subsidiary boards due to the additional time commitment 
required for discharging these roles. Non-executive directors’ fees are considered and approved by the 
executive directors and the Chairman.
Fees are set at a level which is considered appropriate to attract and retain the calibre of individuals 
required by the Company. Fees are reviewed regularly against comparable companies and may be 
adjusted from time to time. 
Expenses incurred in the performance of non-executive duties for the Company may be reimbursed 
or paid for directly by the Company, as appropriate. The Chairman is provided with an office and is 
reimbursed for a proportion of the cost of a car and driver to assist with the performance of his duties. 
The current fee levels can be found on page 71.
Recruitment policy
In determining remuneration for new appointments to the board, the committee will apply the following principles:
 – the committee will consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the calibre of the individual, the external market and existing arrangements 
for the Company’s current executive directors, with a view to ensuring that any arrangements offered are in the best interests of the Company and 
shareholders and without paying any more than is necessary; and 
 – the committee will seek to align new executive directors’ remuneration packages with the remuneration policy as set out above. 
Components and approach
Pay on recruitment will be consistent with the usual policy for executive directors, as set out in the policy table. 
Where the new appointment is replacing a previous executive director, salaries, pension and total remuneration opportunity may be higher or lower than 
the previous incumbent dependent on skills and experience. 
Where an executive director is appointed from within the Group, the normal policy of the Company is that any existing arrangements would be honoured 
in line with the original terms and conditions. Similarly, if an executive director is appointed following an acquisition of or merger with another company, 
legacy terms and conditions would be honoured. 
Maximum level of variable pay
The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to a new executive director in respect of their appointment shall be limited to that set out in the 
policy table above for each component of remuneration. This excludes any one-off awards made to compensate the director for awards forfeited from their 
previous employer.
Buy-outs
In order to facilitate recruitment, the committee may make a one-off award to ‘buy out’ incentive awards and any other compensation arrangements that 
a new director has had to forfeit on leaving their previous employer. In doing so, the committee will take into account all relevant factors, including any 
performance conditions attached to the forfeited awards, the likelihood of these conditions being met, the proportion of the vesting/performance period 
remaining and the form of the award (for example cash or shares). Where possible, the forfeited awards will normally be bought out on a like-for-like basis. 
The committee is at all times conscious of the need to pay no more than is necessary, particularly when determining any possible buy-out arrangements.
61 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Governance and directors’ report
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
Contractual terms
The Company’s policy on notice periods is up to 12 months’ notice by the Company or executive director to provide a reasonable balance between 
the need to retain the services of key individuals and the need to limit the liabilities of the Company in the event of the termination of a contract. 
Recruitment of Chairman and non-executive directors
In the event of the appointment of a new Chairman and/or non-executive director, their remuneration framework will be in line with the table set out 
on page 71.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
Executive directors
Key terms relating to NEX’s policy in the event of termination of an executive director’s employment are set out in the table below.
Provision Policy
Notice period Up to 12 months’ notice by the Company or executive director.
Termination payment Contractual entitlement would be limited to salary and benefits (including pension) over the notice period. 
The Company would normally expect executive directors to mitigate any loss on their departure. 
Incentive plans Participation in all incentive plans is non-contractual and at the committee’s discretion. 
Annual bonus
An executive director will not be eligible to receive an annual bonus unless the committee, in its absolute discretion, decides 
otherwise. In determining whether to award a bonus, the committee will assess performance during the financial year and apply 
pro rata as deemed appropriate. It will normally be the case that a proportion of any bonus would continue to be deferred under 
the DSBP (see below). The committee, however, reserves the right to make any such payment in cash with no requirement to 
defer any bonus.
DSBP
Unvested awards will lapse except in certain circumstances (such as ill-health, injury or disability, the participant’s employing 
company ceasing to be a Group member, or any other reason) and, at the committee’s discretion (other than in the case of 
summary dismissal), when deferred awards under the DSBP will vest at the normal time. The number of shares released 
in such circumstances will be determined by the committee in its absolute discretion, taking into account the period until 
cessation of employment. In the case of death, awards will vest after the date of death.
PSP
Unvested awards will lapse except in certain circumstances (such as ill-health, injury or disability, the participant’s employing 
company ceasing to be a Group member, or any other reason) and, at the committee’s discretion (other than in the case of 
summary dismissal), when PSP awards will vest and be released at the normal time. The number of shares released in such 
circumstances will be determined by the committee in its absolute discretion, taking into account the period until cessation  
of employment. In the case of death, awards will vest after the date of death.
If the individual leaves prior to the release of awards but after the end of the vesting period, the awards will continue to be  
released at the end of the holding period, except on the grounds of summary dismissal, in which case they will lapse.
The key termination provisions of the Group’s current executive directors’ contracts are set out below:
Michael Spencer
Michael Spencer’s notice period is 12 months. He is entitled to receive salary and benefits for the duration of his notice period. His contract includes a pay 
in lieu of notice clause which allows the Company to make a payment equal to this amount in lieu of any applicable period of notice. He may be eligible  
to receive a discretionary bonus.
Stuart Bridges
Stuart Bridges’ notice period is 12 months from the Company, six months from the employee. He is entitled to receive salary and benefits for the duration 
of his notice period. He may be eligible to receive a discretionary bonus.
62 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors’ report Financial statements Definitions
Change of control
In the event of a change of control or a voluntary winding up of the Company, DSBP and PSP awards will vest at that time, taking into account,  
unless the board determines otherwise, the extent to which any performance conditions have been met and the time elapsed since the grant date. 
The committee, however, may require or permit individuals to exchange any awards for equivalent awards in the acquiring company. 
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors and the Chairman of the Company have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities. They do not 
have service contracts. The key terms of the appointments are set out in the table below.
Provision Policy
Notice period Non-executive directors and the Chairman are not entitled to compensation on leaving the board, other than fees in respect 
of any notice period. 
There is no notice period, other than in the event of change in control for non-executive directors (excluding the Chairman) 
in which case a three-month notice period will apply.
Availability of documentation
Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group and wider employment conditions
There are consistent overarching principles of remuneration which apply across the Group. 
Given the nature of our business, there is no single structure of remuneration that applies to all employees throughout the Group. A significant element of 
pay, however, is performance-linked, ensuring that all NEX’s employees are focused on delivering strong financial results and achieving our strategic goals. 
For members of the GEMG and other senior executives in the Group, a proportion of remuneration is deferred into Company shares, ensuring long-term 
alignment with the interests of our shareholders. 
The committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group when determining remuneration arrangements for 
executive directors. NEX manages the costs of employment at the corporate level and expects changes in total remuneration for directors to reflect 
changes in the Company’s performance. 
Notwithstanding a change in structure of the overall package for the executive directors, changes in salary are normally aligned to both policy and practice 
for increases for the wider employee base in terms of annual increases, market positioning and adjustments for promotions and changes of role. 
Director remuneration over time is expected to correlate with corporate performance and as such has the potential to be much more volatile than that 
of the wider employee base. 
The Company does not consult directly with employees on the policy but information relating to employee remuneration is provided in regular updates 
to the committee.
Consideration of shareholder views
The committee is committed to ongoing dialogue with shareholders and seeks the view of its largest shareholders when any major changes are being 
made to remuneration policy and arrangements for executive directors. 
Minor amendments
The committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take 
account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for any such amendments.

Additional disclosures in respect of the single total figure of remuneration table
2016/17 annual bonus
The bonus plan was structured to incentivise executive directors to meet corporate objectives of investing to achieve growth and profitability, continuing 
to promote the corporate culture through strong risk-aware leadership and aligning their interests with those of shareholders.
The plan was designed so that progress and achievements in the past 12 months can be recognised and rewarded, with a significant proportion deferred 
for a period of three years to ensure ongoing alignment and positive behaviours.
During 2016/17 the executive directors were measured against the key financial and strategic goals set by the committee at the start of the year. The table 
below shows the content of the goals, the weighting applied to each goal, and the committee’s assessment of the executive directors’ performance and 
level of achievement.
Financial objectives 70%

Growth and protection
Complete the sale of 
IGBB to TP ICAP
20% Binary  
target
100% The sale of IGBB was completed on  
30 December 2016. Completion was  
complex because of the requirements of the 
Competitions and Markets Authority which 
could have significantly delayed completion. 
The management of these requirements 
alongside other complexities means that the 
committee is comfortable applying a 100% 
achievement rating.

38% We have seen incremental revenue growth in 
products launched in the past two years across 
the product group. 
Notable are EBS Direct/eFix and the TriOptima 
group of products.
Significant revenue growth came from the 
CFETS contract.
The target set was to achieve a 7 .5% increase  
in prior year total revenue from new products.

the prior year
40% 100% 106% 110% 63% Reported trading operating profit is 107%

it has been agreed that the work should be

Controls and governance
Design and adopt

governance framework 
for the Group
25% 100% This objective has been fully met with strong monitoring of the control environment and  
the governance in place throughout the process of separating the business resulting in no 
gaps during the separation or after completion of the sale of IGBB.
Overall high-level project monitoring has been established for NEX Markets and NEX 
Optimisation. In addition development categorisation has been reviewed and is likely to 
present opportunities for cost savings in the future. More adaptation is still required for  
the NEX business, but is well underway.
Adapt a framework for  
the Group to manage

information 
risk management
25% 100% The agreed framework has been successfully adapted to deal with the unique challenges  
of information risk management and technology. This is key to the protection of the assets 
utilised by our clients and within the business.
The committee agreed that the controls and governance environment in the business is 
robust and appropriate. While it remains a key ongoing consideration for all parts of the 
business and will continue to develop, it is now sufficiently embedded that it should no  
longer be a formal objective for bonus purposes.
People and culture
Deliver a Group reward 
framework for NEX
25% 80% A reward framework has been produced and delivered that simplifies the offering to 
employees, rewards appropriately and fairly and reflects the achievement of objectives  
and targets that contribute to the long-term success of the Group and behaviours that are 
collaborative and reflect the culture of the business.
Design and launch a 
strong new corporate 
brand and culture for 
NEX
25% 80% The NEX brand was launched on 30 December 2016 on completion of the sale of IGBB.  
The entire business was rebranded globally externally and internally by 3 January 2017 .  
The Company also has clarity on its culture going forward, and the dissemination of this 
throughout the business is ongoing.
Strategic objectives 30% 90%
The Remuneration Committee determined that the targets and achievements in the above table were a fair reflection of performance during the year. 
The bonus payout for both executive directors was 78% of maximum. 
Executive directors are required to defer at least 50% of bonus payments into NEX Group plc shares vesting after three years. In line with the remuneration 
policy approved at the 2015 annual general meeting, no matching awards will be made. For 2016/17 bonus awards both the Group Chief Executive Officer 
and the Group Chief Financial Officer have elected to defer 100% into NEX Group plc shares.
2014 BSMP matching award
The BSMP matching award granted in 2014 under the legacy arrangements was subject to a performance condition based on trading EPS with graduated 
vesting where 10% of the matching award will vest at RPI + 6% per annum, increasing to 100% vesting at RPI + 15% per annum over a three-year period.
The EPS targets were not met at any level, therefore the award did not vest.

Stuart Bridges PSP – conditional share award based on performance 231,776 996,498 25% 100% 31 March 2019
The face value of the awards is based on the average closing price for the five business days following 16 May 2016, being the preliminary announcement 
date of the 2015/16 financial results (£4.2994).
The committee selected a combination of trading EPS and relative TSR as the performance conditions on the basis that it safeguards the progress that has 
been made in the Group’s performance and underpins continuing forward growth in the Group’s earnings and therefore promotes the long-term success  
of the Company.
The performance condition for the 2016 award is based on graduated vesting where 25% of the award will vest at EPS growth of CPI + 20% over the 
three-year period and TSR performance at the median level versus the agreed peer group (as set out in last year’s remuneration report), increasing to 100% 
vesting at EPS growth of CPI + 45% over the three-year period and TSR performance at the upper quartile level versus the agreed peer group. The EPS and 
TSR performance conditions are measured independently and are not contingent on one another.
Payments to past directors
Payments in line with those previously disclosed to ICAP plc shareholders were made in the year.
Payments for loss of office
No payments for loss of office have been made during the year.
Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests
Minimum shareholding guidelines for executive directors have been in place since 2012. 
These shareholdings will be built up over time and, for these purposes, will include vested share awards under long term incentive plans but will not include 
any unvested rights to shares awarded under long term incentive plans or any unexercised options. Any vested shares subject to a holding period under the 
PSP will count towards shareholding guidelines.
Other shares that count towards the guideline include those that are beneficially owned and shares held by the NEX Trust in respect of BSMP basic awards 
and any vested but not exercised BSMP matching and PSP awards.
The minimum shareholding guideline for the Group Chief Executive Officer is 500% of base salary and for other executive directors is 300% of base salary. 
The Group Chief Executive Officer had exceeded his target as at 31 March 2017 , based on the share price at the close of business on that date. The Group 
Chief Financial Officer was appointed in September 2015 and has five years from appointment to reach his target.
The table below details the share interests of the directors in office at 31 March 2017 .

External appointments
The Company recognises the opportunities and benefits to both the Company and executive directors serving as non-executive directors of other 
companies. Executive directors are permitted to take on non-executive directorships with other companies with the approval of the Nomination 
Committee. Any fees arising from such appointments are retained by the individual.

Statement of implementation of the directors’ remuneration policy in the coming year
As stated in the Chairman’s statement, the directors’ remuneration policy for NEX replicates the previous ICAP plc policy which was in place for only two 
years. A full policy review will take place in 2017/18 and a new three-year remuneration policy for the Group will be presented for shareholder approval  
at the 2018 annual general meeting. 
We consider that the proposed remuneration arrangements for 2017/18:
 – reflect the priorities of the business for the year;
 – complement business culture and demonstrate good governance;
 – align with the interests of shareholders; and
 – provide transparency.
Further details are set out below.

Pension and benefits
Both executive directors receive a cash equivalent to the standard 5% of salary contribution to the UK defined contribution plan. The cash equivalent is 
reduced to take account of employers’ national insurance contributions. There will be no material change to benefits.
Annual bonus awards in respect of the 2017/18 financial year
The bonus structure for 2017/18 is consistent with that detailed in the directors’ remuneration policy section of this report.
Annual bonuses will be assessed based on financial performance, represented by growth and protection objectives and profitability objectives accounting 
for 70% of the overall award, and strategic priorities, represented by client focus and people and culture accounting for the remaining 30%.
Further details are set out below.
Maximum 
opportunity for 2017
Group Chief Executive Officer: 300% of base salary

The committee has selected measures to directly support NEX’s strategy.
The 2017 annual bonus will be subject to the following performance measures:

Chairman and non-executive directors’ fees
Following an internal review of non-executive director fees, including a benchmark review, the decision was taken to make a small adjustment for the 
coming year. This is the first change for a number of years, with fees held at the current level for non-executive directors since 2010. The fees for the 
Chairman have also been increased to reflect the extensive time commitment made during and since separation of the business (the Transaction).  
This is the first change since 2012. 
The Nomination Committee chairman’s fee and the SEF non-executive directors fees remain at the current level. There are no fees paid for membership  
of board committees.
The table below shows the non-executive director fee structure as at 1 April 2017 .

* Charles Gregson waived his entitlement to the additional fee for his role as chairman of the Nomination Committee
** Additional fees are paid to non-executive directors who sit on the boards of SEF entities due to the additional time commitment for discharging this role
Support to the committee
The committee is supported by the Group Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Group Head of HR and the Group Company Secretary.
The committee received external advice from Deloitte in relation to matters affecting executive compensation until October 2016. Since October 2016, the 
committee has received external advice from Willis Towers Watson. Both Deloitte and Willis Towers Watson were appointed by the Company. Willis Towers 
Watson was selected from a number of alternatives following a process conducted internally. Until October 2016, Deloitte also provided tax advice to the 
business. The committee is satisfied that the advice received from Deloitte and Willis Towers Watson was independent and objective. The fees in respect 
of the advice provided were £52,829 to Deloitte and £24,550 to Willis Towers Watson.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
Our opinion
In our opinion:
 – NEX Group plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the financial statements) give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the  
year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  
by the European Union;
 – the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise:
 – the consolidated and Company balance sheets as at 31 March 2017;
 – the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
 – the consolidated and Company statements of cash flow for the year then ended;
 – the consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended;
 – the accounting policies; and
 – the notes to the financial statements, which include other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are  
cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and,  
as regards the Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, and applicable law.
Our audit approach
Audit scope
Areas of
focus
Materiality
Overview
Overall Group materiality: £10.0 million which represents 5% of continuing and discontinued profit before tax, acquisition 
and disposal costs and exceptional items.
We conducted an audit of the complete financial information of three financially significant business reporting units 
covering the continuing business and an audit of the income statements of six reporting units covering the discontinued 
business. Additional business reporting units were selected to increase the level of audit evidence for each account 
balance, on which a combination of controls testing and substantive tests of detail were undertaken. Business reporting 
units that are not subject to specific audit procedures are still subject to audit work on entity level controls and Group 
level analytical review procedures over their financial information.
The areas of focus for our audit to which we allocated the greatest amount of our resources and effort were:
 – sale of IGBB;
 – presentation and disclosure of exceptional items;
 – goodwill impairment assessment; and
 – fraud in revenue recognition.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)).
We designed our audit by determining the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are 
inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as areas of 
focus in the table on pages 74 and 75. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of 
all risks identified by our audit.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Sale of IGBB
On 30 December 2016, the Group completed the disposal of the IGBB 
business to Tullett Prebon plc, now renamed TP ICAP plc. 
On the income statement, the profit of IGBB for the period up to the 
disposal, net of tax, has been presented separately on the face of the 
income statement as a discontinued operation.
The gain on disposal of £1.2bn is presented in the income statement as 
part of exceptional items. The measurement of gain on sale of a disposal 
group is inherently complex, particularly when it encompasses a large 
number of entities with material amounts involved.
We reviewed the management analysis for the accounting treatment  
of the disposal and were satisfied that this was appropriate.
We assessed the accuracy and completeness of the IGBB disposal group. 
We also gained comfort over the consideration received and tested the net 
asset reconciliation in relation to the IGBB transaction and determined that 
the gain on disposal was not materially misstated.
We tested the split of reserves between IGBB and NEX and noted that it 
was appropriate.
We assessed the disclosures made in the financial statements and noted 
that they were compliant with the relevant accounting standards. 
Relevant references in the Annual Report, note 5.
Presentation and disclosure of exceptional items
Assessment of the Group’s performance generally focuses on  
trading profit, being operating profit before acquisition and disposal  
costs and exceptional items. 
The gain on sale of IGBB net of costs of sale has been treated as an 
exceptional item. In addition, NEX Group plc incurred various other 
transaction costs, principally the costs of contractors and temporary staff 
which have also been classified as exceptional items. There is a risk that 
costs could be incorrectly classified between the columns of the financial 
statements, with an impact on the disclosed underlying  
business performance.
We understood management’s basis of determining whether or not 
revenue and expenses in relation to transactions fell within the 
classification of exceptional items as described in the accounting policy.
We selected a sample of revenue and expenses that had been identified as 
exceptional items and, based on our understanding of the accounting policy 
and the transaction, formed our own judgement as to whether they were 
appropriately presented and disclosed in exceptional items, with no 
material exceptions noted.
We examined the Group’s disclosure in respect of exceptional items, and 
agreed that the narrative provided appropriately reflected the nature of the 
underlying expenses.
Relevant references in the Annual Report, notes 4 and 5.
Goodwill impairment assessment
This was an area of focus due to the size of the goodwill balance and 
given the judgement required as part of the directors’ assessment of the 
carrying value of the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs), about the 
future results of the business and the discount rate applied to the future 
cash flow forecasts.
We examined the forecasts of future cash flow prepared by management 
by comparing them to the latest board approved budgets. We also tested 
historical budgeting accuracy by comparing current year results with the 
equivalent figures included in the prior year forecast. Our testing did not 
give any indication of impairment.
We assessed the directors’ key assumptions for discount and long-term 
growth rates using our knowledge of the business, future strategy and past 
performance. We compared rates used to past results and external data 
where available. We also performed sensitivity analyses on the key 
assumptions. We found no material exceptions in these tests. 
We also reviewed the disclosures made in relation to goodwill and found 
them to be appropriate.
Relevant references in the Annual Report, note 15.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Fraud in revenue recognition
We focused on the accuracy and timing of the recognition and the 
presentation in the income statement of:
 – transaction and access fees from the NEX Markets business; 
 – fees from the provision of services in the NEX Optimisation  
business; and
 – commissions from the IGBB business.
These revenue streams are dependent on the fulfilment of contractual 
obligations which may involve subjective estimation with regard to stage 
completion and are subject to manual intervention which could result in 
revenue being recognised inappropriately.
We tested the reconciliations between the revenue systems used by the 
Group and its financial ledgers and journal entries posted to revenue 
accounts to help identify any unusual or irregular items. We then performed 
testing over these amounts to ensure that they should be recognised as 
revenue. No exceptions were found in the sample selected.
We evaluated the relevant IT systems and tested the operating 
effectiveness of internal controls over the accuracy and timing of 
commissions and fees recognised in the financial statements.
We also tested the timing of revenue recognition, assessing whether the 
necessary contractual obligations had been fulfilled by taking a sample of 
revenue transactions and agreeing them back to contracts and did not find 
any exceptions.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
Following the sale of the IGBB business during the year the Group reports its operating results and financial position along three business lines, being 
NEX Markets, NEX Optimisation and Other. The results for the year also include nine months of revenue and expenses from the IGBB business disclosed 
as discontinued operations.
In establishing the overall approach to the audit we identified three reporting units across the NEX Markets, NEX Optimisation and Other functions that, in 
our view, required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size. Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were 
performed at a further eight reporting units either due to their size or their risk characteristics.
To audit the results of the discontinued IGBB business we identified six reporting units where we performed an audit of their revenue and expenses in view 
of their size and a further two reporting units where specific procedures were performed on certain balances and transactions.
Where the work was performed by component auditors under our instruction, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit  
work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained to support an opinion on the  
financial statements as a whole. In the current year the Group engagement team visited the UK and US components, being the two most significant 
countries in the Group.
The 19 reporting units accounted for 94% of Group total continuing and discontinued income and 89% of Group total assets.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group 
materiality
£10.0 million (2016: £10.1 million).
How we  
determined it
5% of continuing and discontinued profit before tax, acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
We based materiality on continuing and discontinued profit before tax, acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.  
The acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items are significant and expected to be discrete and non-recurring in  
nature and thus are not considered to be indicative of the underlying performance of the business. The removal of these items 
also mitigates undue volatility in determining our materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £500,000 (2016: £500,000) as well 
as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 54, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material to add or 
to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors 
intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ 
use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group, the Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors’ report. We have nothing to 
report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group 
and the Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report.
 – the statement given by the directors on page 54, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the  
Code, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s and the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and 
the Company acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
 – the section of the Annual Report on pages 44 to 46, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work 
of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report.
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 – the directors’ confirmation on page 55 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code,  
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that  
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
 – the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed  
or mitigated.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
 – the directors’ explanation on page 55 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code,  
as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation  
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only 
consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the 
relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our 
audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.
77 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Governance and directors’ report
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from  
branches not visited by us; or
 – the Company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with  
the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration

In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the corporate governance statement relating to ten further provisions of the Code. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 54, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 – whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed; 
 – the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
 – the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating 
the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for 
us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by  
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications  
for our report. With respect to the strategic report and directors’ report, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable 
legal requirements.

86 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors’ report Financial statements Definitions
BASIS OF PREPARATION
Preparation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the separate financial statements of NEX Group plc have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, 
as issued by the IASB and the interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and their predecessor bodies, and as endorsed by the 
EU and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs. In publishing the parent company financial statements here together 
with the Group financial statements, NEX Group plc has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its 
individual income statement, individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these financial statements. The financial 
statements are prepared in pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and are presented in millions. NEX Group plc is incorporated 
and domiciled in England and Wales. 
The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group and the Company are included at the beginning of the notes to which they relate.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to apply judgements and the use of estimates and assumptions about future conditions. 
Management considers impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation (note 15), investment in joint ventures and associates 
(notes 22 and 23), provisions (note 16), contingent liabilities (note 17), technology development revenue (note 1) and the presentation of exceptional items 
(note 4) to be the areas where increased judgement is required. Further information about key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty, are set out in the relevant notes to the financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based 
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the 
inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based on amounts which differ from those estimates. Revisions 
to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Segmental information and the number of employees analysed by operating segment for the year ended 31 March 2016 have been restated due to a 
change in accounting policy for operating segments (notes 1 and 9(b)). Earnings per share, dividends per share, treasury shares and shares held in the 
employee share trust as at 31 March 2016 have been restated as if the share consolidation had occurred at the beginning of the comparative year (notes 6, 
7 and 26). The consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended 31 March 2016 has been restated to include restricted funds in financing activities 
instead of operating activities (note 12). Matched principal trade receivables and payables as at 31 March 2016 have been restated due to a change in 
accounting policy from trade date accounting to settlement date accounting (notes 5, 18 and 19). All notes to the financial statements have been restated 
for the year ended 31 March 2016 to be on a continuing operations basis, where possible. 
The Company was incorporated on 18 February 2016 and on 15 December 2016 obtained control of the entire share capital of ICAP plc via the Scheme of 
Arrangement. There were no changes in rights or the proportion of control exercised as a result of this transaction. Although the Scheme of Arrangement 
resulted in a change of legal ownership, this was a common control transaction and therefore outside the scope of IFRS3. In substance these financial 
statements reflect the continuation of the pre-existing group headed by ICAP plc and the financial statements have been prepared applying the principles 
of a capital reorganisation.
As a result, the consolidated comparatives presented in these financial statements are the consolidated results of ICAP plc. The prior year consolidated 
balance sheet reflects the share capital structure of ICAP plc. The current year consolidated balance sheet presents the legal change in ownership of the 
Group, including the share capital of NEX Group plc and the reserves arising as a result of the Scheme of Arrangement. The consolidated statement of 
changes in equity on page 84 and the additional disclosures in note 26 explain the impact of the Scheme of Arrangement in more detail. The Company 
comparatives presented in these financial statements are those of NEX Group plc, not ICAP plc. 
Discontinued operations 
On 30 December 2016, the Group completed the disposal of IGBB to TP ICAP. 
The results of the IGBB business have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement as the sale was a single co-
ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business. The assets and liabilities attributable to IGBB were presented as held for sale assets and 
liabilities on the face of the balance sheet as at 31 March 2016 because at that point the disposal met the criteria in IFRS5 for held for sale classification 
since the business was available for sale in its present condition and the sale was highly probable. The assets and liabilities attributable to IGBB are no 
longer presented on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2017 since the Transaction completed during the year. The shares in TP ICAP plc were fully 
transferred to NEX shareholders and are deemed as a distribution through equity.
Presentation of the income statement
The Group maintains a columnar format for the presentation of its consolidated income statement. The columnar format enables the Group to continue its 
practice of improving the understanding of its results by presenting its trading profit. This is the profit measure used to calculate trading EPS (note 6) and is 
considered to be the most appropriate as it better reflects the Group’s trading earnings. Trading profit is reconciled to profit before tax on the face of the 
consolidated income statement, which also includes acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.
The column ‘acquisition and disposal costs’ includes: any gains, losses or other associated costs on the full or partial disposal of investments, associates, joint 
ventures or subsidiaries and costs associated with a business combination that do not constitute fees relating to the arrangement of financing; amortisation 
or impairment of intangible assets arising on consolidation; any re-measurement after initial recognition of deferred contingent consideration which has 
been classified as a liability; and any gains or losses on the revaluation of previous interests. The column may also include items such as gains or losses on 
the settlement of pre-existing relationships with acquired businesses and the re-measurement of liabilities that are above the value of indemnification. 
87 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements
BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED
Items which are both of a non-recurring nature and material are disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Group’s results. These are shown 
as ‘exceptional items’ on the face of the consolidated income statement. For the year ended 31 March 2017 , the gain on disposal of IGBB was presented in 
the column ‘exceptional items’ as opposed to the column ‘acquisition and disposal costs’ given the exceptional nature and size of the disposal.
When the Group has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business component that represents a major line of business or geographic area of operations, it 
classifies such operations as discontinued. The post tax profit or loss of the discontinued operations is shown as a single line on the face of the consolidated 
income statement, separate from the other results of the Group. The consolidated income statement for the comparative periods is restated to show the 
discontinued operations separate from those generated by the continuing operations.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements include the results and net assets of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Group’s share of joint ventures 
and associates.
Subsidiaries
An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Group has control over its strategic, operating and financial policies and intends to hold the investment on a 
long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Group’s activities.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of acquisition is measured at fair value  
of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent  
of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as 
goodwill. If the costs of the acquisition are less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated  
income statement.
Fees associated with an acquisition are expensed as incurred. When the Group increases its investment in an entity resulting in an associate becoming a 
subsidiary, the intangibles related to the acquisition are valued and the elements of those not previously recognised as a share of net assets are recorded  
as revaluation gains realised in the year in other comprehensive income. A change of ownership that does not result in a loss of control is classified as  
an equity transaction, with the difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is recorded and the fair value of the consideration 
received recognised directly in equity.
Where the Group has issued a put option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group derecognises the non-controlling interest and instead 
recognises a contingent deferred consideration liability for the estimated amount likely to be paid to the non-controlling interest on exercise of those 
options. The residual amount, representing the difference between any consideration paid/payable and the non-controlling interest’s share of net assets,  
is recognised in equity. Movements in the estimated liability after initial recognition are recognised within the consolidated income statement. Where the 
Group has a call option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group continues to recognise the non-controlling interest until it is certain that 
the option will be called. At that point the accounting treatment is the same as for a put option.
The results of companies acquired during the year are included in the Group’s results from the effective date of acquisition. The results of companies 
disposed of during the year are included up to the effective date of disposal.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, 
the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. 
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
On consolidation, the accounting policies of Group companies (the Company and its subsidiaries) are consistent with those applied by the Group. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated as part of the consolidation process. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, exercises joint control over its operating and financial 
policies. An interest exists where an investment is held on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Group’s activities. Following 
the adoption of IFRS11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ and IAS28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ on 1 April 2014, investments in joint ventures are 
recognised using the equity method. Under this method, such investments are initially stated at cost, including attributable goodwill, and are adjusted 
thereafter for the post acquisition change in the Group’s share of net assets.
88 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors’ report Financial statements Definitions
Associates
The Group classifies investments in entities over which it has significant influence, but not control, and that are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, as 
associates. Investments in associates are recognised using the equity method. Under this method, such investments are initially stated at cost, including 
attributable goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter for the post acquisition change in the Group’s share of net assets.
Available-for-sale investments
The Group classifies investments in entities which are not subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates as available-for-sale investments. Available-for-sale 
investments are initially recognised at fair value. Available-for-sale investments in equity assets that do not have a quoted market price in an active market 
and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are subsequently recorded at cost less impairment. All other available-for-sale investments are fair valued 
subsequently at each period end.
Foreign currencies
In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the prior month closing exchange rate between the functional currency 
and the foreign currency. At each end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated  
at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement, except for exchange 
differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where these form part of the net investment of an overseas business or are designated as hedges 
of a net investment or cash flow and, therefore, the changes in value resulting from exchange differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive 
income. Non-monetary items carried at historical cost are translated in the balance sheet at the exchange rate on the original transaction date. Non-
monetary items measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate ruling when the fair value was determined. 
On consolidation, the results of businesses with non-pound sterling functional currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at  
the average exchange rates for the year where these approximate to the rate at the date of the transactions. Assets and liabilities of overseas businesses are 
translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Exchange differences arising are 
recognised within other comprehensive income. Cumulative translation differences arising after the transition to IFRSs are taken to the consolidated income 
statement on disposal of the net investment.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a non-pound sterling entity are treated as assets and liabilities of that entity and translated 
into the presentational currency of the Group at the period closing rate. Where applicable, the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising before the date of transition to IFRSs as denominated in the presentational currency of the Group.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group  
at the average exchange rates for the year or at the rate prevailing at the time of the transaction where more appropriate.
Future accounting developments
At 31 March 2017 , the following standards have been issued by the IASB which are not effective for these consolidated financial statements:
 – in July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which will replace IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. NEX expects 
some classification and measurement changes in relation to its available-for-sale investments and some impairment changes in relation to its financial 
assets, but these are not expected to be significant from a Group perspective. The standard will become effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018. NEX intends to adopt IFRS9 for its financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2019. NEX does not expect to restate 
comparatives on initial application of IFRS9 on 1 April 2018 but will provide detailed transitional disclosures in accordance with the amendment 
requirements of IFRS7;
 – in May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, which will replace IAS18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS11 ‘Construction Contracts’ 
and other related interpretations on revenue recognition. Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on NEX’s main revenue 
streams of transaction fees and subscription fees. Efforts will be focused on preparing and sourcing information necessary to comply with the enhanced 
disclosure requirements introduced by IFRS15. The standard will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. NEX intends 
to adopt IFRS15 for its financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2019; and
 – in January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS16 ‘Leases’, which will replace IAS17 ‘Leases’ and other related interpretations on leases. NEX expects an increase in 
both assets and liabilities for transactions currently accounted for as operating leases. The standard will become effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2019. NEX intends to adopt IFRS16 for its financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2020.
The impact on NEX’s financial statements from the adoption of these IFRS standards is currently being assessed and will be disclosed closer to the time  
of the adoption.
89 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements
1. Segmental information
The Group has determined its operating segments based on the management information including trading revenue and trading operating profit reviewed 
on a regular basis by the Company’s board. The Group considers the executive members of the Company’s board to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(CODM). The management information reviewed by the Company’s board changed during the year due to the disposal of IGBB. NEX now has two reportable 
segments: NEX Markets and NEX Optimisation. NEX now also presents a ‘NEX Group and other’ column, which includes the Group’s remaining activities 
that do not meet the definition of reportable segments, and a ‘Hedging impact’ column, which also does not meet the definition of a reportable segment. 
The ‘NEX Group and other’ column includes the activities of Shipping, Argentina, NEX Exchange, certain joint venture and associate investments and 
corporate costs. The ‘Hedging impact’ column shows the effect of hedging which is done centrally. IFRS8 requires entities to present segmental information 
in the same way that the CODM reviews the information when directing resources and managing the business. We believe that the new segmental 
disclosure achieves this more accurately. Segmental information for the year ended 31 March 2016 has been restated due to the change in accounting 
policy for operating segments and to be on a continuing operations basis.
Revenue comprises transaction fees, access fees and technology development fees from its NEX Markets business, and fees from the provision of NEX 
Optimisation services.
NEX Markets 
Transaction fees and access fees: the Group acts as an intermediary for FX and fixed income products through the Group’s electronic platforms. Revenue is 
generated from transaction fees which are dependent on the average trading volumes. The Group also charges fees to use the electronic trading platform 
for access to liquidity in the FX or precious metal markets.
Matched principal business: the Group is involved in a non-advisory capacity as principals in the matched purchase and sale of financial instruments 
between our clients. Revenue is generated from transaction fees and is recognised in full at the time of the commitment by our clients to sell and purchase 
the financial instrument.
Technology development: the Group provides technology development services. Fees from the development of technology are recognised as revenue by 
reference to the stage of completion, including the completion of services provided for post delivery service support. This process requires the exercise of 
significant judgement by management.
NEX Optimisation
The Group receives fees from the sale of financial information and provision of NEX Optimisation services to third parties. These are stated net of VAT, 
rebates and other sales taxes and recognised in revenue on an accruals basis to match the provision of the service.
TriOptima provides risk mitigation solutions for OTC derivatives, primarily through the elimination and reconciliation of outstanding transactions. Traiana 
operates market infrastructure for pre and post trade processing, risk management and regulatory compliance across multiple asset classes. NEX Data 
delivers pricing, analytics and index solutions to financial market participants from information received from NEX Markets and elsewhere. NEX Data 
generates subscription-based fees as well as licensing fees from other index administrators for the use of NEX Data in their indices. Reset is a provider of risk 
mitigation services, reducing basis risk within trading portfolios in interest rate, FX, equity index and inflation derivatives. ENSO delivers data, analytics and 
workflow tools that enable hedge funds and asset managers to more effectively manage their relationships with prime brokers. ENSO provides a complete 
view of an individual hedge fund’s relationships across multiple counterparties, delivering insights on counterparty credit risk, collateral management, 
portfolio financing and treasury. Abide Financial provides regulatory reporting technology services, ensuring market participants are compliant with evolving 
reporting obligations. Abide Financial acts as a reporting hub for EMIR, Approved Reporting Mechanism for MiFID and a Regulatory Reporting Mechanism 
for REMIT.

The Group did not earn more than 10% of its total revenue from any individual client. The Group earned revenue from continuing operations of £57m 
(2015/16: £47m) from entities in the UK, £221m (2015/16: £187m) from entities in the US, £86m (2015/16: £72m) from entities in Sweden and £38m 
(2015/16: £37m) from entities in Singapore. NEX’s regulated companies will meet CRD IV disclosure requirements, to the extent in scope, by disclosing the 
information in their 2016/17 financial statements or on the NEX website.
Continuing revenue from the rendering of services recognised in the year was £530m (2015/16: £460m). Continuing revenue from technology development 
recognised in the year was £13m (2015/16: £nil). The Group used the costs-incurred method to estimate the stage of completion of technology 
development revenue. Progress on technology development projects is on track to date.
The hedging impact relates primarily to NEX Markets.

Contractual arrangements
The Group places reliance on a number of key suppliers to carry out its business and has procedures to ensure that purchasing decisions balance cost 
against other factors, including service quality, global reach and resilience.
The settlement of matched principal and exchange-traded businesses requires access to clearing houses either directly or through third party providers 
of clearing and settlement services. In North America the Group is a member of the FICC through which it clears US Treasury, agency and repo products 
for its client base. In Europe, clearing arrangements for exchange-traded transactions are outsourced to third parties.

On 30 December 2016, the Group completed the disposal of its IGBB business to TP ICAP.
The results of the IGBB business have been presented as discontinued operations as the sale was a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major 
line of business. The assets and liabilities attributable to IGBB were presented as held for sale assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet as at 
31 March 2016. These assets and liabilities were transferred to held for sale at carrying value. The assets and liabilities attributable to IGBB are no longer 
presented on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2017 since the Transaction completed during the year.

sale of £28m plus £18m of reserves relating to IGBB that were recycled to the income statement. The gain on sale of discontinued operations is exempt 
from UK tax.
The Group previously applied trade date accounting but the Group has changed its accounting policy in the year to recognise matched principal receivables 
and payables at the settlement date (as explained in note 18). Matched principal receivables and payables as at 31 March 2016 have been restated as a 
result of the change in accounting policy. Held for sale assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2016 included some of the Group’s matched principal trade 
receivables and payables. The restated 31 March 2016 held for sale trade and other receivables balance is £2,507m and the restated 31 March 2016 held

6. Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to 
ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held. The 
Group also calculates trading EPS (basic and diluted) from the trading profit for the year. The Group believes that this is the most appropriate measurement 
for assessing NEX’s performance since it better reflects the business’s trading earnings.
The diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting share capital in issue for the additional weighted average number of ordinary shares that are likely to be issued 
under various employee share award schemes as at the balance sheet date.
As explained in the basis of preparation accounting policy, the Group’s financial statements reflect the continuation of the pre-existing group headed by 
ICAP plc. As explained in note 26, the number of shares in 2016/17 changed significantly as a result of the share consolidation. The 2016/17 weighted 
average number of shares has been stated as the weighted average number of shares in the period from the date of the share consolidation to the 
balance sheet date. The 2015/16 weighted average number of shares has been restated as if the share consolidation had occurred at the beginning  
of the comparative year.

7. Dividends payable
The Company recognises the final dividend payable only when it has been approved by the shareholders of the Company in a general meeting. The interim 
dividend is recognised when the amount due has been paid.

Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 of 11.5p per ordinary share (2016: 11.5p) 42 42
Total dividend recognised in the year 142 141
The final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2016 was satisfied in full with a cash payment of £100m which was paid to the shareholders of ICAP plc 
prior to the disposal of IGBB. The interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 was satisfied in full with a cash payment of £42m. The interim 
dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 was paid to the shareholders of ICAP plc who were on the register at 9 December 2016. The shares were quoted 
ex-dividend from 8 December 2016.
The directors have proposed a final dividend of 27 .0p per share for the year ended 31 March 2017 . This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at 
the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders. Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end, the total amount payable would be 
£100m. Therefore, subject to shareholders’ approval of the proposed final dividend of 27 .0p per share, including the interim dividend of 11.5p per share, the 
full-year dividend will be 38.5p per share. The full-year dividend of 38.5p per share will be covered 1.1 times (2015/16: 1.1 times) by the trading EPS (basic) 
from continuing and discontinued operations of 42.9p per share (2015/16: 43.4p per share).
The right to receive dividends has been waived in respect of the shares held in employee share trusts.
The 2015/16 final dividend per share and the 2016/17 interim dividend per share have been restated on the basis that the share consolidation occurred at 
the beginning of the comparative year. The proposed current year full-year dividend of 38.5p per share is equivalent to the full-year dividend disclosed in the 
Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016 of 22.0p per share (on a pre-share consolidation basis).
8. Tax
Tax on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years. Tax is charged or credited to the 
consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case  
the tax is also included in other comprehensive income or directly within equity respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of the  
reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting 
purposes and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and intangibles arising on consolidation, 
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right 
and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Calculations of current and deferred tax liability have been based on ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities, management’s assessment of 
legal and professional advice, case law and other relevant guidance. Where the expected tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that 
were recorded initially, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax amounts in the period in which such determination is made.

Continuing deferred tax assets of £9m (2015/16: £9m) have not been recognised in respect of certain trading losses because it is not probable that future 
profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits. The principal movement in deferred tax relates to the ongoing increase of 
accelerated tax allowances on goodwill and a release of amortisation on separately identifiable intangible assets. The movement of Group deferred 
tax balances before offset within countries as at 31 March 2016 has been restated due to a reclassification between categories.

9. Employee information and expense
NEX operates a number of defined contribution pension plans throughout the Group. Payments to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an 
expense in the consolidated income statement as they fall due. Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short-term asset 
or liability.
The Group awards share options and other share-based payments as part of its employee incentive schemes as well as other share-based payment 
transactions. The fair value of services received is measured by the fair value of the shares or share options awarded at the grant date and is charged 
to employee expenses over the period the service is received on a straight-line basis. A corresponding amount is recognised in equity.

The average number of employees for the year ended 31 March 2016 and the number of employees as at 31 March 2016 have been restated due to  
the change in the accounting policy for operating segments in the year (note 1) and to be on a continuing operations basis. The average number of 
employees in discontinued operations up to the date of completion of the Transaction was 2,572 (year ended 31 March 2016: 2,608). The number of 
employees in discontinued operations as at 31 March 2017 was nil (2015/16: 2,587). Employees in discontinued operations were predominantly in the 
global broking business, which was an operating segment as at 31 March 2016 but is no longer an operating segment as at 31 March 2017 due to the 
change in accounting policy for operating segments (note 1).
(c) Share-based payments
The total charge to the consolidated income statement in respect of employee share awards in the year from continuing operations was £4m (2015/16:

The DSBP is a long term incentive plan for the executive directors, GEMG members and certain other senior managers in the Group. These awards are 
delivered as a proportion of the annual bonus deferred into NEX Group plc shares for three years. The awards do not have performance conditions but are 
subject to certain service conditions, malus and clawback. 
The PSP is a long term incentive plan for the executive directors, GEMG members and certain other senior managers in the Group. Recipients are granted 
a number of NEX Group plc shares with a maximum award potential of 300% of salary. These awards are subject to certain service and performance 
conditions, malus and clawback.
The LTIP is a long term incentive plan previously awarded to GEMG members and certain other senior managers in the Group. The 2014 share awards 
consisted of basic and matching awards. Under the basic awards, a certain percentage of the pre-tax bonus was deferred in NEX Group plc shares for three 
years with no performance conditions attached. The matching awards equalled the basic awards but were subject to certain service and performance 
conditions. The 2015 matching award was replaced with a PSP award. Basic LTIP awards were last made to GEMG members in 2015 and to certain other 
senior managers in 2016. From 2017 LTIP basic awards will be replaced with DSBP awards.
More information is provided in the remuneration report on pages 56 to 72.
The total charge to the discontinued income statement in respect of employee share awards in the year was £7m (2015/16: £2m). The current year charge 
predominantly relates to an accelerated charge that was recognised on the disposal of IGBB.
(d) Key management remuneration
Key management consists of the members of the GEMG, including the executive directors of the board. The aggregate remuneration for key management 
from continuing operations was £17m (2015/16: £11m). The executive directors’ remuneration of £6m (2015/16: £5m) is disclosed separately in the 
remuneration report.
A charge of £3m (2015/16: charge of £2m) was recognised in the continuing consolidated income statement relating to share options held by 
key management. 
Retirement benefits accrued to four (2015/16: three) continuing members of the GEMG under defined contribution schemes and during the year 
key management received £0.1m (2015/16: £0.1m) in continuing post retirement benefits.

Interest rate risk exposure
The Group has an exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on both its cash positions and borrowings which it manages through a combination of pound 
sterling, euro and yen debt drawn on fixed and floating rate terms. The Group’s objective is to minimise its interest cost and the impact of interest rate 
volatility on the Group’s consolidated income statement. In addition to debt, the Group’s treasury policies also permit the use of derivatives including 
interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and cross currency swaps to meet these objectives.

The Group has no floating debt other than the RCF, which was undrawn as at 31 March 2017 . A 100 basis-points parallel increase in Libor and Libid rates, 
which the Group considers to be an appropriate sensitivity measure, would decrease net finance costs by £2m in relation to pound sterling cash and by 
£1m in relation to dollar cash. 
At 31 March 2016, £359m of cash and cash equivalents and £81m of debt were presented within held for sale assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
Net finance expense and interest rate risk exposure for the year ended 31 March 2016 have been restated to be on a continuing operations basis.
Company
The Company is not exposed to interest rate movements since it does not hold variable rate cash or debt.
11. Borrowings
Long-term borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of issuance costs incurred. At subsequent reporting dates long-term 
borrowings are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with changes in value recognised through the consolidated income statement. 
Issuance costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
The borrowings note is presented on a continuing basis.

(a) Long-term borrowings continued
The five-year senior notes are presented on the balance sheet at amortised cost, net of fees. To enable the Group to manage the translational exposure 
which arises as a result of the notes being denominated in euros and to meet its risk management objective of minimising both interest cost and the 
impact of interest volatility on its consolidated income statement, the Group entered into a number of cross currency swaps to convert its obligations over 
the life of €250m of the notes from euros to pounds sterling at an FX rate of 1.21. These swap from a fixed effective euro interest rate of 3.20% to a fixed 
pound sterling interest rate of 4.39%. The swaps have been accounted for as a cash flow hedge and as at 31 March 2017 have a fair market value of £7m 
asset (2015/16: £7m liability) and they offset the effect of FX on the notes. The remaining €100m of the notes remain in euros and have been designated 
as a net investment hedge of the Group’s euro-denominated net assets.
The Group’s £300m RCF was undrawn as at 31 March 2017 (2015/16: £110m drawn) resulting in committed headroom of £300m (2015/16: £315m). 
During the year, the RCF’s maturity date was extended by one year to 31 March 2019. The RCF incorporates a $200m swingline facility of which $75m  
is available as a late day fronted solution. The weighted average effective interest rate for the year was 2.1% (2015/16: 2.2%).
The Group’s bank facilities contain a number of customary financial and operational covenants. Included in these, the Company is required to remain as the 
ultimate holding company in the Group. The Group and Company remained in compliance with the terms of all its financial covenants throughout the year 
ended 31 March 2017 .
Fair values of the five-year senior notes repayable 2019 and the retail bond repayable 2018 have been measured using level 1 fair value measurement 
inputs. The fair value measurements of the ten-year senior notes repayable 2023 use level 2 fair value measurement inputs, which are derived from the  
fair values of similar bonds.

For several years, the Group has entered into a series of yen term loans with Tokyo Tanshi Co Limited, borrowing each for a term of up to six months. 
These loans have been refinanced either immediately on maturity or a few days thereafter with similar terms.
Bank overdrafts are for short-term funding and are repayable on demand and are generally repaid within a very short time period.
Short-term borrowings as at 31 March 2016 have been restated to be on a continuing operations basis.

12. Cash
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are subject to insignificant  
risk of change in fair value and are readily convertible into a known amount of cash with less than three months’ maturity.
The Group holds money, and occasionally financial instruments, on behalf of clients (client monies) in accordance with local regulatory rules.  
Since the Group is not beneficially entitled to these amounts, they are excluded from the consolidated balance sheet along with the corresponding  
liabilities to clients.
Restricted funds comprise cash held with a CCP clearing house, or a financial institution providing NEX with access to a CCP, and funds set aside for 
regulatory purposes, but excluding client money. The funds represent cash for which the Group does not have immediate and direct access or for which 
regulatory requirements restrict the use of the cash.

13. Capital and liquidity planning and management
The Group does not seek to take proprietary market risk positions, so does not seek to expose its capital to market risk, and it does not undertake any form 
of maturity transformation so does not seek liquidity risk. Thus the overall approach to the planning and management of the Group’s capital and liquidity  
is to ensure the Group’s solvency, i.e. its continued ability to conduct business, deliver returns to shareholders and support growth and strategic initiatives.
Liquidity
Group
The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as a result of trades executed as matched principal which result in margin and collateral requirements from clearing 
houses, clearing banks and as a result of regulatory rules stipulating the maintenance of certain liquidity buffers. Such requirements can arise up until 
settlement which is typically only for a one- to five-day period.
Liquidity risk occurs primarily in BrokerTec US LLC which is required to deposit margins from time to time with the FICC and its clearing bank. BrokerTec US 
LLC uses its funded cash together with access to the Group’s $200m swingline facility to manage its liquidity requirements. The liquidity requirements of 
the Group have decreased significantly following the disposal of IGBB.
The Group has a centralised approach to the provision of contingency funding for its trading entities. Through the GFC, the board periodically reviews the 
liquidity demands of the Group and the financial resources available to meet these demands. The GFC ensures that the Group, in totality and by subsidiary, 
has sufficient liquidity available in order to provide constant access, even in periods of market stress, to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of 
marketable securities and committed funding lines to enable it to finance its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated 
events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
As at 31 March 2017 , the Group had continuing gross debt of £507m (2015/16: £583m), the maturity analysis of which is set out in note 11, and continuing 
cash and cash equivalents of £321m (2015/16: £157m) (see note 12(c)). Cash held at clearing houses, or a financial institution providing NEX with access to 
a CCP to which the Group has no immediate access in practice, is disclosed as restricted funds in the financial statements (note 12(e)).
The Group invests its cash balances in a range of capital protected instruments including money market deposits, AAA-rated liquidity funds and 
government bonds with the objective of optimising the return, while having regard to counterparty credit risk and liquidity. With the exception of some 
small, local cash management balances, surplus cash is invested with strong institutions holding investment grade ratings.
Company
The Company’s policy is to ensure that it has constant access to an appropriate level of liquidity to enable it to finance its forecast ongoing operations, 
proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms. If the Company has any cash, it is loaned 
intra-Group for further investment. 
Capital management
The Group’s capital strategy is to maintain an efficient and strong capital base which maximises the return to its shareholders, while also maintaining 
flexibility. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt (note 11) and equity, including share capital (note 26), share premium, other reserves (note 27) 
and retained earnings.
The Group seeks to ensure that it has sufficient regulatory capital in each of its eight regulated entities to meet local regulatory requirements. As none of 
the regulated companies in the Group take proprietary positions they do not have an inventory of assets so regulatory capital is mostly covered by cash. 
In general, higher levels of market volatility can result in increased demand for the Group’s services. As the capital requirements in the Group’s regulated 
entities are, however, driven predominantly by the fixed cost base, the impact of changes in volumes on the capital requirement is significantly dampened. 
As such, absent a material acquisition, existing capital resources are viewed as sufficient to operate and to continue to invest in the development of the 
Group’s businesses.

14. Intangible assets arising from development expenditure
Development expenditure on software is recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with the provisions of IAS38 ‘Intangible Assets’. Capitalised 
expenditure is recognised initially at cost and is presented subsequently at cost less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment. Amortisation 
of these assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the asset of three to five 
years. The Group reviews the useful economic lives of these assets on a regular basis.
Development costs are incurred and capitalised when a final development plan (including the specifics of the assets to be developed) is signed off by a 
committee with appropriate delegated authority (including business management boards). As part of the approval process, the committee considers the 
commercial viability and technological feasibility of bringing the asset into use. When a project is abandoned in the development phase, costs are charged 
to the income statement. Prior to this stage, costs incurred in the research phase, including undertaking feasibility studies, are recorded in the income 
statement. Once an internally generated software asset is brought into use, any ongoing related costs are charged to the income statement to the extent 
that they relate to ongoing maintenance of the asset. Where any costs are identified by an appropriately authorised management committee to be an 
enhancement to the original asset, these costs are capitalised and amortised over the remaining expected useful life of the asset.
The Group has an internal threshold for capitalisation of £5,000 for individual assets and £125,000 for software-related projects. The key component of the 
development costs is compensation of employees. Each of the Group’s businesses and the Group’s infrastructure area have their own dedicated IT project 
development teams.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within operating expenses. Amortisation is charged 
against assets from the date at which the asset becomes available for use.

15. Intangible assets arising on consolidation
Since 1 April 2004, intangible assets arising on consolidation include goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets such as client relationships 
and client contracts that arose on business combinations. The amortisation and any impairment is included in the consolidated income statement within 
the column ‘Acquisition and disposal costs’. The Group reviews the performance of the acquired businesses and reassesses the period over which the 
acquired intangible asset is likely to continue to generate cash flows that exceed the carrying value.
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries when the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest and the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree exceeds the amount of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the amount 
of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is greater, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is initially recognised 
at cost and is subsequently held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of investments in joint ventures when the cost of investment exceeds NEX’s share of the net fair value of the joint 
venture’s identifiable assets and liabilities. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is included in ‘Investments in joint ventures’ and is not tested 
separately for impairment. See note 22.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of interests in associates when the cost of investment exceeds NEX’s share of the net fair value of the associate’s 
identifiable assets and liabilities. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included in ‘Interests in associates’ and is not tested separately for 
impairment. See note 23.
Where the Group makes an acquisition and the balances are reported as provisional at the year end, the Group has a measurement period of up to 
12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the provisional amounts where new information becomes available about facts and circumstances 
that existed at the balance sheet date, which could impact the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising on consolidation. The measurement period 
ends as soon as the information required is received.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
(ii) Separately identifiable intangible assets
The Group has recognised separately identified intangible assets on acquisitions where appropriate. These generally include client contracts and client 
relationships. Intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated initially at fair value and are adjusted subsequently for amortisation and any impairment. 
Amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation are recognised in the second column of the consolidated income statement. Where an 
impairment has taken place, the asset is reviewed annually for any reversal of the impairment. Any reversals of impairment are credited to the consolidated 
income statement. All separately identifiable intangible assets have a finite life (excluding goodwill).
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives as follows:
Client relationships 2 – 10 years
Client contracts Period of contract
Other intangible assets Period of contract
A deferred tax liability is recognised against the asset for which the amortisation is non-tax deductible. The liability unwinds over the same period as the 
asset is amortised.
(iii) Impairment
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indicator of impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets 
arising on consolidation are allocated to a cash generating unit (CGU) at acquisition for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest 
level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The identification of CGUs is reviewed where there is a significant change to the 
Group’s segmental reporting structure. Impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU with its carrying amount. The 
carrying amount of a CGU is based on the assets and liabilities of each CGU, including attributable goodwill. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher 
of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use (VIU). VIU is the present value of the expected future cash flows from a CGU.
Where the carrying value of the asset exceeds its VIU, an impairment charge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, and the 
asset is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For goodwill, impairment charges previously recognised are not reversed and impaired 
intangible assets are reviewed annually for reversal of previously recognised impairment.
This process requires the exercise of significant judgement by management; if the estimates made prove to be incorrect or performance does not meet 
expectations which affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.

The Group recognises £1,026m of intangible assets arising on consolidation (2015/16: £826m), with £1,008m relating to goodwill (2015/16: £811m) and 
£18m relating to other intangible assets (2015/16: £15m). The other intangible assets mainly represent client relationships and have varying remaining 
amortisation periods across CGUs. 
The individual CGUs’ goodwill, other intangible assets arising on consolidation and net assets were tested for impairment, which resulted in  
no impairment. 
Additions of £103m relate to the acquisition of ENSO, Abide Financial and e-MID, of which £84m is goodwill and £19m is other intangible assets.

Impairment testing methodology
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined using VIU calculations, which are based on discounting management’s pre-tax cash flow projections  
for the CGU. The pre-tax discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) NEX allocates to investments in the businesses within which  
the CGU operates. A long-term growth rate estimate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term nature of the businesses  
in the CGUs.

Discount rates
The Group’s pre-tax WACC was 8.0% (2015/16: 8.6%). The Group’s WACC is a function of the Group’s cost of equity, derived using a Capital Asset Pricing 
Model (CAPM), and the Group’s cost of debt. The cost of equity estimate depended on inputs in the CAPM reflecting a number of variables including the 
risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated. These inputs are based on the market’s assessment of economic 
variables and management judgement, which are subject to scrutiny by the GFC and the Audit Committee (see page 45). All inputs to the CAPM were 
externally sourced. The CGU-specific WACCs were then derived by adjusting the Group WACC for business-specific risk factors.
Nominal long-term growth rate
The growth rate reflects weighted average real GDP growth and inflation for the countries within which the CGUs operate. The rates are based on the 
International Monetary Fund’s medium-term forecasts as they are deemed to be reliable estimates of likely future trends. The rates applied do not exceed 
the expected growth in the local economy or, for businesses which operate on a global scale, the global GDP. 
Management’s judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU
The cash flow projections for each CGU are based on plans approved by the board. For the 2016/17 annual impairment testing of Abide Financial, ENSO and 
Traiana, management’s cash flow projections for the three years ending 31 March 2020 were used. For all other CGUs, management cash flow projections 
for the year ending 31 March 2018 were used.

(b) Impairment testing of intangible assets arising on consolidation continued
Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date and having assessed sensitivities of the key assumptions, management determined that a reasonably 
possible change in any of those key assumptions noted above would not cause an impairment in any of the CGUs.
16. Provisions
A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, either legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable there will be a 
transfer of economic benefits to settle the obligation. A provision is recognised only where a reliable estimate can be made of the value of the obligation.

17. Contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees
The Group’s contingent liabilities include possible obligations that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence,  
or non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of NEX. Additionally, contingent liabilities also include present 
obligations that have arisen from past events but are not recognised because it is not probable that settlement will require the outflow of economic 
benefits, or because the amount of the obligations cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but  
are disclosed unless the probability of the outflow of the Group’s economic resources is remote. Judgements applied in concluding the appropriateness  
of contingent liabilities disclosure are confirmed after consultation with external counsel and discussion with the Audit Committee.
Contingent liabilities
The Company and its subsidiaries continue to co-operate with the government agencies in Europe and the US relating to their investigations into the setting 
of yen Libor. ICAP plc was dismissed from initial US civil litigation against various yen Libor and euroyen Tibor setting banks. However, the plaintiff in that 
litigation was given permission by the court to add ICAP Europe Limited (IEL) (which was sold to TP ICAP) as a defendant, and an amended complaint doing 
so was filed on 29 February 2016. IEL filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on 16 May 2016 and, following briefing on the motion, oral 
argument took place on 25 October 2016. On 10 March 2017 , the court granted IEL’s motion, and IEL has been dismissed from the lawsuit. It is unclear 
whether plaintiffs will appeal the court’s decision.
On 24 July 2015, a new litigation was filed on behalf of two additional plaintiffs in the same court based on similar allegations. The new litigation includes 
claims against ICAP plc and IEL, both of which have filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and have joined co-defendants’ motion to 
dismiss for failure to state a claim. Oral argument on these motions was heard on 5 May 2016, and on 10 March 2017 , the court granted ICAP plc’s and IEL’s 
motions, thus dismissing both parties from the lawsuit. On 3 April 2017 , plaintiffs filed a notice to commence the appeal process.
Plaintiffs in the Euribor civil litigation named ICAP plc and IEL on 13 August 2015 as parties to that pre-existing litigation. ICAP plc and IEL have joined the 
other defendants in filing motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. On 21 February 2017 , the court granted ICAP 
plc’s and IEL’s motions to dismiss in the Euribor case. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint, which the court denied. 
Barring an appeal or other application by plaintiffs, both parties remain out of the case. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries 
or the litigations and it is not possible to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact on the Group.

17. Contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees continued
Contingent liabilities continued
The Group continues to co-operate with inquiries by the US government agencies into the setting of USD ISDAFIX rates. In 2014, civil lawsuits were filed in 
the US against USD ISDAFIX setting banks, where a subsidiary of the Company was originally named, but was subsequently replaced by ICAP Capital Markets 
LLC (ICM), as a defendant. Those suits have now been consolidated into a single action, which is in the discovery stage. ICM intends to defend these litigation 
claims vigorously. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries or the litigation and it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of 
any potential financial impact on the Group.
From 25 November 2015 through present, ICM has been named as a defendant, along with a number of banks and Tradeweb Markets LLC, in ten civil 
lawsuits relating to the interest rates swaps market. Eight of the lawsuits are class actions by alleged investors in the market, and the other two are single 
plaintiff cases brought by failed competitors. All of the suits make allegations that defendants together colluded to prevent buy side clients from accessing 
the interest rates swaps market on electronic, exchange-like platforms, including the boycott of any platform offering all-to-all trading. The actions 
generally assert claims of violation of antitrust laws and unjust enrichment. The cases have been consolidated and are being managed by the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York. Defendants intend to file a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The consolidated litigation is in 
the early case management stage, and all defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a claim on 4 November 2016. Plaintiffs 
then filed an amended complaint which, among other things, added ICAP SEF (US) LLC and ICAP Global Derivatives Limited (both of which were sold to TP 
ICAP) as defendants. All defendants filed new motions to dismiss on 29 January 2017 . The motions have been fully briefed and oral argument is presently 
scheduled for 2 May 2017 , pending a request by defendants for a two to four week adjournment of such date. Discovery is presently suspended. It is not 
possible to predict the outcome of these litigations or to provide an estimate of any potential liability or financial impact on the Group.
On 16 August 2016, ICAP plc and ICAP Australia Pty Limited (which was sold to TP ICAP), along with a number of banks and two TP ICAP group entities, were 
named as defendants in a purported class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging antitrust, Commodity 
Exchange Act, and common law claims arising out of the alleged manipulation of the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate (BBSW), which plaintiffs 
contend harmed a class of individuals and entities that traded in the US in instruments priced, benchmarked and/or settled based on BBSW between  
1 January 2003 and some indeterminate later time. ICAP plc and ICAP Australia Pty Limited accepted service while preserving the right to challenge the 
court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over the entities. Both defendants, along with other defendants in the case, filed motions to dismiss on 24 February 
2017 . Plaintiffs’ opposition is due 28 April 2017 , and defendants’ reply papers are due 25 May 2017 . It is not possible to predict the outcome of this litigation 
or to provide an estimate of any potential liability or financial impact on the Group.
From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation in relation to a variety of matters, and is also required to provide information to regulators and other 
government agencies as part of informal and formal inquiries or market reviews.
For the sake of clarity, some of the matters described herein may not be the direct responsibility of the Group but may be its responsibility under 
indemnification and/or breach of warranty provisions agreed to by the Group with TP ICAP. The sale by ICAP plc of its global broking business to TP ICAP 
entailed customary warranties given by ICAP plc in the sale and purchase agreement and repeated at completion of the Transaction. Warranty claims are 
subject to customary limitations, including a de minimis and aggregate claims threshold, a cap, and time limits for bringing a claim. In addition to such 
warranties, ICAP plc also provided TP ICAP with indemnities for, among other things, certain known regulatory, litigation and employment claims. It is not 
possible to predict whether any of the matters described herein will give rise to liabilities under the warranties and/or indemnities given in connection with 
the Transaction.
Details of regulatory and other matters that have a provision recognised for them are detailed in note 16.
Contractual commitments 
Operating lease commitments
At the end of the financial year, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases 
which fall due as follows:

As at
31 March
2016

Within one year 18 24
Between one and five years 45 53
After five years 5 11

Operating lease commitments relate to the rental of premises for office space in Asia Pacific, Sweden, the UK and the US. The operating lease 
commitments include onerous lease provisions before estimated receipts under non-cancellable subleases. The operating lease commitments as at  
31 March 2016 include commitments that have since transferred to TP ICAP. 
Guarantees
In the normal course of business certain Group companies enter into guarantees and indemnities to cover clearing and settlement arrangements and/or  
the use of third party services/software. It is not possible to quantify the extent of any potential liabilities, but there are none currently expected to have  
a material impact on the Group’s consolidated results or net assets. As at 31 March 2017 , the Group has given £1,024m (2015/16: £404m) of guarantees  
to counterparties.
113 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements
18. Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently reviewed for recoverability. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in 
payments, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of the future cash flows. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision for doubtful debt, and 
the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within ‘Operating expenses’. When a trade receivable is determined to be 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against ‘Operating expenses’ in the consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial instruments which have a fixed or determinable value. They are recognised at cost, less any provisions  
for impairment in their value.
Fair value through profit or loss assets are designated as such where they meet the conditions of IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’. They are recognised initially at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in the consolidated income 
statement. These assets are usually held for short-term gain, or are financial instruments not designated as hedges. The accounting policy for derivative 
financial instruments is included in note 28.
Matched principal transactions are those where the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity as principal in the commitment to purchase and sell securities 
and other financial instruments through two or more transactions between our clients. Substantially all matched principal receivables and payables (note 
19) settle within a short period of time, usually within three days of the trade date. The Group previously applied trade date accounting but the Group has 
changed its accounting policy in the year to recognise matched principal receivables and payables at the settlement date. Settlement date accounting 
provides more reliable and relevant information due to the change in the Group’s principal business activities after the completion of the Transaction. 
Matched principal trade receivables and payables as at 31 March 2016 have been restated as a result of the change in accounting policy.
Financial instruments not held at fair value are impaired where there is objective evidence that the value may be impaired. The amount of the impairment 
is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of any expected future cash flows, with any impairment being recognised 
in the consolidated income statement. Subsequent recovery of amounts previously impaired are credited to the consolidated income statement.

(a) Credit risk management
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties in respect of its matched principal, exchange-traded and corporate 
treasury operations. The Group does not bear any significant concentration risk to either counterparties or markets.
The credit risk in respect of the NEX Markets (excluding the matched principal business) and the NEX Optimisation businesses is limited to the collection  
of outstanding transaction fees and this is managed proactively by the Group’s accounts receivable function with oversight from the independent credit risk 
function.
The matched principal business involves the Group acting as a counterparty on trades which are undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis.

18. Trade and other receivables continued
(a) Credit risk management continued 
The Group manages its credit risk in these transactions through appropriate policies and procedures in order to mitigate this risk including on-boarding 
requirements, setting appropriate credit limits for all counterparties which are closely monitored by the credit risk team to restrict any potential loss through 
counterparty default. The Group’s matched principal counterparty exposure at any given point throughout the year is split between investment grade 
counterparts (rated BBB-/Baa3 or above) and sub-investment grade counterparts (rated BB+/Ba1 or lower). The Group’s potential stressed counterparty 
credit risk is less than 5% of the Group’s total capital resources.
The credit risk on core cash, cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is monitored on a daily basis. All financial institutions that are transacted 
with for borrowings and deposits are approved by the GFC and internal limits are assigned to each one based on a combination of factors including external 
credit ratings. The majority of cash and cash equivalents are deposited with investment grade-rated financial institutions.
Company
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties. This risk is considered minimal as all counterparties are Group 
companies and the risk of non-payment is viewed as low.
(b) Impairment of other trade receivables
Other trade receivables represent amounts receivable in respect of agency business and information services. All receivables are individually assessed for 
impairment at the reporting date. Management judgement is applied in determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred  
and, if so, the measurement of the impairment allowance. In determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred, judgement  
is exercised in evaluating all relevant information on indicators of impairment, which is not restricted to the consideration of whether payments are 
contractually past due but includes broader consideration of factors indicating deterioration in the financial condition and outlook of clients affecting their 
ability to pay. For those receivables where objective evidence of impairment exists, management determines the size of the allowance required based on  
a range of factors including probability of default and, if defaulted, expectation of recovery. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss 
decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed and the reversal is recognised in the income statement. As at 31 March 2017 , £nil of continuing other trade receivables remain impaired 
(2015/16: £1m). There have been no new impairments during the year. 
Past due but not impaired trade and other receivables are those in respect of which the debtor has failed to make a payment or a partial payment in 
accordance with the contractual terms of the invoice, but there is no major concern over the credit-worthiness of the counterparty, therefore they are  
not impaired. In the prior reporting periods, receivables past a ‘normal settlement date’ were considered past due and were reported on that basis.  
As at 31 March 2017 the following continuing other trade receivables were past due but not impaired.

22. Investments in joint ventures
Investments in joint ventures are recognised using the equity method. Under this method, such investments are initially stated at cost, including 
attributable goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter for the post acquisition change in the Group’s share of net assets.
Investments in joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment under IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. Whenever 
application of IAS39 indicates that an investment may be impaired, the carrying amount of the investment, including attributed goodwill, is tested for 
impairment as a single asset under IAS36, by comparing the carrying amount with its recoverable amount (the higher of VIU and fair value less costs  
to sale).
The Group adopted IFRS11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ and IAS28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ for the financial year beginning 1 April 2014. 
Previously, the Group proportionally consolidated the joint ventures’ results and position of its joint ventures under IAS31. The Group determined that as a 
result of the adoptions of IFRS11 and IAS28 the joint ventures’ results will not be proportionately consolidated in the Group financial statements but will be 
treated under the equity accounting method.

24. Available-for-sale investments
Available-for-sale financial assets are debt and equity non-derivative financial assets and are initially recognised at fair value.
Available-for-sale investments in equity assets that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably 
measured, are subsequently recorded at cost less impairment. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on such financial 
assets, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
All other available-for-sale financial assets are fair valued subsequently at each period end. Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in 
other comprehensive income. When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised in other comprehensive income 
and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative unrealised loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is 
transferred to the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement for an investment in an available-for-sale equity instrument are not reversed through 
the consolidated income statement. Dividends on available-for-sale equity investments are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the 
right to receive payment is established. When an available-for-sale financial asset is derecognised, any cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised 
previously in other comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
These assets are generally expected to be held for the long term and are included in non-current assets. Assets such as shares or seats in exchanges, 
cash-related instruments, and long-term equity investments that do not qualify as associates or joint ventures, are classified as available-for-sale.

25. Property and equipment
Property and equipment is recognised initially at cost including the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset into 
its intended use. Property and equipment is subsequently presented at initial cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in its 
value. It is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life as follows:
Short leasehold property improvements Period of lease
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 – 5 years
The Group reviews its depreciation rates regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances. These rates are determined on consideration of factors 
such as the expected rate of technological development and anticipated usage levels.
When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Group’s foreseeable business requirements, a provision is made on a discounted basis for the expected 
future net cost of the property.

26. Share capital
Ordinary shares are recognised in equity as share capital at their nominal value. The difference between consideration received and the nominal value is 
recognised in the share premium account.
Company shares held in trust in connection with the Group’s employee share schemes are deducted from consolidated shareholders’ equity. Purchases, 
sales and transfers of the Company’s shares are disclosed as changes in the consolidated shareholders’ equity. The assets and liabilities of the trust are 
consolidated in full into the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Treasury shares are recognised in equity and are measured at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any 
difference between the proceeds from the sale and original cost being taken to retained earnings.

to 10p per share;
 – on 29 December 2016, NEX Group plc cancelled and extinguished 499,999 redeemable preference shares; and
 – on 30 December 2016, NEX Group plc undertook a share consolidation, reducing the number of shares in issue from 664,537 ,006 to 379,735,432 and

The merger reserve was created on the merger of Garban and Intercapital in 1999 and also includes goodwill arising before 1 January 1998 written off to 
reserves. The merger reserve related to IGBB and therefore has been derecognised on the disposal of IGBB.
The capital redemption reserve was created as a result of shares cancelled in 1998 and 2005. The capital redemption reserve is a legal reserve relating to 
the previous parent of the Group, ICAP plc, and therefore has been derecognised due to the legal change in ownership of the Group to NEX Group plc. 
The revaluation reserve represents revaluations of available-for-sale investments. The hedging reserve arises from fair value movements of derivative 
financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges on the balance sheet. 
(b) Company reserves
The Company has retained earnings of £1,618m (2015/16: £nil) all of which is all distributable.

28. Currency risk management
The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to FX and interest rate movements. These can include forward FX contracts, 
currency options and cross currency swaps. All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value, adjusted for 
transaction costs. Where derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the 
consolidated income statement, along with transaction costs. Where they do qualify, gains and losses are recognised according to the nature of the hedge 
relationship and the item being hedged. Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
The fair values of the Group’s derivative financial instruments are determined using appropriate valuation techniques from observable data, including 
discounted cash flow analysis, as no active markets with quoted prices exist for the instruments held by the Group.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging 
instrument and, if so, the nature of the exposure being hedged. To qualify for hedge accounting, the terms of the hedge must be documented clearly at 
inception and there must be an expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to 
the hedged risk. Hedge effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge and, if at any point it is concluded that the relationship can no longer be 
expected to remain highly effective in achieving its objective, the accounting for the hedge relationship is terminated.
Fair value hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge an exposure to changes in the fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk that could affect the consolidated income statement. The hedging instrument is recorded 
at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its fair value being taken through the consolidated income statement. For periods in which the hedge is 
shown to be effective, the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Cash flow hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the cash flows 
attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. Gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are determined to be effective. Any remaining ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised 
immediately in the consolidated income statement. On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses relating to the hedging instrument 
that had previously been recognised directly in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss in equity 
remains there and is recognised in the consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised. When a forecast transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is transferred immediately to the consolidated 
income statement.
Net investment hedges: changes in the value of foreign-denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income. The accounting treatment for a net investment hedging instrument, whether it is a derivative financial instrument or a recognised 
asset or liability on the balance sheet, is consistent with the aforementioned treatment for a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses accumulated in other 
comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement on the ultimate disposal of the foreign-denominated investment. The gain  
or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Group
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in pound sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies, principally the dollar. 
Consequently the Group (both continuing and discontinued operations) is exposed to FX risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Group’s 
transactional revenue and the translation of the earnings and net assets of its non-pound sterling operations.
(a) Transactional exposures
The Group’s policy is for all subsidiaries to hedge their material non-functional currency transactional exposures through a combination of forward FX 
contracts and options for up to two years forward. Under this policy, a minimum of 75% of the forecast exposures are hedged for the first six months, 50% 
for the following six months and 25% for the next six months. The majority of these exposures relate to dollar sales arising in pound sterling functional 
currency companies. 
The table below sets out the Group’s outstanding forward FX contracts as at 31 March 2017 which are designated as cash flow hedges.

28. Currency risk management continued 
(b) Balance sheet translational exposures
The Group is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures at the local entity level where the local consolidated balance sheet may contain monetary 
assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency. Where material, it is the Group’s policy to hedge 100% of these 
exposures using a mix of foreign currency swaps and forward FX contracts.
Balance sheet translational exposures also arise on consolidation as a result of the retranslation of the balance sheet of the Group’s non-pound sterling 
operations, principally dollar and euro, into pounds sterling, the Group’s presentational currency. The Group’s general policy is not to actively manage these 
exposures, as active management using instruments with a shorter tenure than the underlying net asset can give rise to a net cash outflow. However,  
from time to time it will use forward FX contracts, cross currency swaps or non-pound sterling denominated borrowings to mitigate these exposures.  
As at 31 March 2017 the Group has $235m of forward FX contracts, €100m of the 2019 five-year senior notes and the €15m 2023 ten-year senior notes, 
designated as hedging instruments against the underlying dollar and euro exposures respectively. As at 31 March 2017 these exposures were $1.2bn 
(2015/16: $1.4bn) and €0.1bn (2015/16: €0.2bn) including intangible assets arising on consolidation, but before $0.2bn (2015/16: $0.2bn) and €0.1bn 
(2015/16: €0.1bn) of hedging.
The table below shows the actual impact on the Group’s equity of movements in the dollar and euro exchange rates due to transactional and translational 
exposures. The table below also discloses the anticipated impact on the Group’s equity of a 10 cent weakening, which the Group considers to be an 
appropriate sensitivity measure, in the dollar and euro in terms of transactional and translational exposure.

(c) Derivative financial instruments
Among other methods, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to implement its FX policy. These include the use of forward FX contracts to hedge 
a portion of its transactional dollar and euro exposures and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the FX and interest rate risks on its senior notes. 
Where these are designated and documented as cash flow hedges in the context of IAS39 and are demonstrated to be effective, mark-to-market gains and 
losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and transferred to the consolidated income statement on derecognition of the underlying 
item being hedged. The table below presents the carrying value of the Group’s derivative financial instruments.

(d) Balance sheet translational exposures
The Company is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures where the balance sheet contains financial assets or liabilities denominated in a currency 
other than pounds sterling. While it is the Group’s policy to hedge 100% of these exposures at Group level, at Company level these exposures can affect the 
Company’s profit after tax.
At 31 March 2017 , the Company had no financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (2015/16: £nil).
