OVERVIEW 
Helical’s core business is 
developing and owning dynamic, 
well located office space in 
London and Manchester and also 
includes a portfolio of logistics 
units along the motorway 
network of England and Wales. 
With intelligent stock selection, 
we aim to maximise returns by 
development and refurbishment 
as well as through significant 
asset management initiatives. 
THE 
LONDON 
MARKET
In our judgement, the London commercial 
property market currently provides the 
best source of potential capital profits 
and we expect this to remain the case for 
the foreseeable future, notwithstanding 
the risks associated with our exit from 
the European Union and other potential 
headwinds.
In order for Helical to generate capital 
profits the Company needs to identify 
those areas where it believes tenant 
demand is, or will become, strong and 
to source opportunities in those areas 
at an appropriate entry price. Using the 
skills, knowledge and expertise gained 
over many years, the Helical team aims 
to deliver attractive and exciting office 
space, in locations with growing 
tenant demand.
The Company has recognised three 
continuing major developments in the 
London office market. First, the growth 
of the London population, which 
exceeded its previous peak during 2015. 
Second, the continuing and rapid 
expansion of the creative industries, 
predominantly in technology and media. 
Third, the migration of occupiers from the 
West End to the City and East London.
London’s population reached 8.7 million 
in 2015, exceeding its previous peak in 
1939, and is forecast to continue growing 
towards 10 million by 2030. Whilst this 
growth will present challenges to London, 
particularly in terms of its infrastructure, 
the opening of the Elizabeth Line 
(Crossrail) at the end of 2018 will assist in 
alleviating these problems. Our properties 
in the City and Tech Belt are all in locations 
that will benefit from this rail link.
Recently published research by CBRE 
noted that the UK is a global leader in the 
creative industries and we have targeted 
these industries with our portfolio. In 
London, companies involved in media, 
advertising and marketing, technology 
and other creative industries comprised 
54% of our new lettings in the year to 
31 March 2017.
The third factor influencing our choice 
of location for our portfolio is the 
migration of occupiers across central 
London to the City and East London. 
The desire to be part of creative hubs, 
surrounded by like-minded individuals, 
located a short travelling distance from 
home is a common theme in discussing 
requirements with tenants. Most 
obviously, those hubs are in the Tech 
Belt from King’s Cross to Whitechapel.
In London, Helical is building up a 
portfolio of multi-tenanted office 
buildings in the Tech Belt locations of 
Farringdon, the Old Street roundabout 
and Whitechapel and also in West 
London from Chiswick to Shepherd’s 
Bush. By owning these “clusters” or 
“villages” of office buildings it has a 
portfolio of assets with multiple lease 
events leading to ongoing asset 
management opportunities.
The Company also seeks to expand its 
profitability by taking on additional 
schemes in Central London either by 
co-investment or by forward selling/
funding them, to allow for the generation 
of profit shares and development 
management fees but with reduced 
balance sheet exposure.

of our new lettings in the year to

THE 
REGIONAL  
MARKET
LOOKING 
FORWARD
Outside London, the Company has 
identified two key areas that contribute 
the potential for capital growth and are 
a source of recurring net rental income 
at good yields.
In Manchester we now have four 
assets (one acquired post year-end) 
with a potential capital value, after all 
refurbishment works and lettings are 
concluded, approaching £100m. Here, 
the occupational and investment market 
continues to strengthen. The city has high 
quality office stock and a diverse occupier 
base which has seen much international 
and institutional investment over the past 
few years. Companies have access to a 
deep and highly skilled talent pool in a 
cost effective location both for the 
employer and the employee. Recent 
research by CBRE identified Manchester 
as the “leading UK creative location 
outside London by some margin” and 
our buildings are designed to attract 
creative occupiers. Annual office take up 
is consistently in excess of 1m sq ft with 
high profile new occupiers coming to the 
city on a frequent basis.
In addition, we have a portfolio of logistics 
units comprising 15% of our investment 
portfolio but which contribute 25% of 
our current contracted rents. This sector 
is characterised by strong occupational 
demand and limited available supply. 
These properties have little obsolescence 
and good prospects of rental growth.
The key areas of focus going forward for 
Helical are London, Manchester offices 
and logistics units. All other assets 
currently held are regarded as non-core 
and we will seek to continue to exit those 
assets as the opportunities to do so arise. 
Our ambition is to have a balanced 
portfolio which generates sufficient 
net rental income to exceed all of our 
recurring costs and provide a surplus 
significantly greater than our annual 
dividend to shareholders. We have an 
ERV on the portfolio, post recent sales, 
of £69m and expect to generate this 
surplus once all of our current asset 
management initiatives are completed. 
We also seek a pipeline of opportunities 
to grow the balance sheet of Helical 
through the creation of development 
profits and capital surpluses.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OVERVIEW
The year to 31 March 2017 has been 
eventful with the real estate sector 
proving resilient against a background 
of both UK and international political 
change. Looking back 12 months it was 
clear that the exceptional growth in 
property values that we experienced 
over the period from 2012 to 2016, as the 
market recovered from the 2008 Global 
Financial Crisis, was coming to an end 
with yields approaching historic lows, 
but with some prospect for growth in 
rental values.
At Helical, we took advantage of the 
strong recovery in property values 
during this period by expanding the 
Company’s business activities, investing in 
development opportunities in London and 
higher yielding regional assets to provide 
a stable flow of rental income. Using the 
proceeds of our 2013 Retail Bond and our 
2014 Convertible Bond, together with 
additional borrowings, we increased 
our property portfolio from £626m at 
31 March 2013 to over £1.2bn, generating 
significant surpluses which have more 
than doubled shareholders’ funds from 
£254m to £517m at 31 March 2017.
During the year we have sought to recycle 
some of the capital created in this period 
into the schemes which we believe will 
continue to support the future growth of 
the Company. We have narrowed the 
focus of the Company to London, offices 
in Manchester and a portfolio of logistics 
units. We expect to complete this process 
during the current year with the sale of the 
remaining non-core assets, being the retail 
properties and regional offices outside of 
Manchester, whilst continuing to work 
through the retirement village programme.
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT In the year under review, the majority 
of our performance has come from the 
assets we own in London, where we have 
increased our weighting to 63% of the 
total portfolio. Sales of regional assets 
since the year end have increased this 
London weighting further to 66%. In the 
investment portfolio we have created 
buildings which reflect the needs of our 
tenants, acknowledging that modern 
lifestyles increasingly merge work and 
leisure needs. We now have a portfolio of 
multi-let, flexible and desirable properties 
which also provide ongoing asset 
management opportunities to add 
value. Our London portfolio remains 
reversionary with further value to be 
created through the completion of our 
redevelopment and refurbishment 
programme, letting vacant space and 
upcoming rent reviews.
We believe that London will continue 
to outperform the rest of the UK over 
the medium and long term and our 
strategy is to continue to increase our 
London holdings.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
The profit before tax for the year to 
31 March 2017 was £41.6m (2016: £114.0m). 
Total Property Return reduced to £79.9m 
(2016: £164.6m) and included growing net 
rents of £47.0m, an increase of 8.3% on 
2016 (£43.4m), and development losses 
of £5.7m (2016: profit of £27.5m) after 
deducting provisions of £12.8m 
(2016: £6.4m). The gain on sale and 
revaluation of the investment portfolio 
contributed £38.6m (2016: £93.7m).
Net finance costs of £21.2m were lower 
than in 2016 (£22.6m) and the Income 
Statement benefited from the shortening 
of the maturity period for the Group’s 
remaining interest rate swaps which led to 
a £0.8m credit (2016: charge of £6.9m) 
arising from the valuation of the Company’s 
derivative financial instruments. The 
revaluation of the Company’s Convertible 
Bond provided a credit of £3.0m 
(2016: £0.5m). Recurring administration 
costs were marginally higher at £10.8m 
(2016: £10.7m). Performance related 
awards were substantially lower at £6.9m 
(2016: £13.3m) with National Insurance 
on these awards of £0.7m (2016: £2.1m).
These results allow the Board to continue 
its progressive dividend policy and to 
recommend to Shareholders a final 
dividend of 6.20p which, together with 
the interim dividend of 2.40p paid in 
December 2016, takes the total dividend 
for the year to 8.60p (2016: 8.17p), 
an overall increase of 5.3%.
PERFORMANCE
We measure our performance at both 
portfolio and Company level, seeking 
to outperform the relevant sector indices 
and our peer group in the medium and 
long term.
EPRA earnings per share fell from 17.1p 
to 0.5p, reflecting growing net rental 
income offset by reduced development 
profits. On a like-for-like basis, the 
investment portfolio increased by 5.2% 
(4.5% including sales and purchases). 
Sales during the year offset this growth in 
values contributing to an overall reduction 
in the portfolio value to £1,205m 
(2016: £1,240m). The unleveraged return 
of our property portfolio, as measured 
by IPD, was 9.4% (2016: 21.7%), compared 
to 4.4% (2016: 11.4%) for the benchmark 
index. These investment gains contributed 
to an increase in EPRA net asset value 
per share, up 3.7% to 473p (2016: 456p).
FINANCE
The Company has expanded its activities 
significantly in recent years, seeking to 
increase shareholder funds through the 
generation and retention of increased net 
rental streams, development profits and 
valuation surpluses. This growth has been 
financed through an increase in secured 
debt borrowed primarily from UK high 
street banks and, since 2013, through the 
use of unsecured debt in the form of a 
Retail Bond and a Convertible Bond. In 
assessing the needs of the business the 
Company is conscious that it needs to 
manage any risks inherent in this 
leveraged approach to growing the 
business. It seeks to do this through the 
use of unsecured debt (24% of total debt), 
by maintaining an appropriate debt 
maturity profile and by hedging its 
interest rate exposure.
The Company uses gearing on a tactical 
basis throughout the property cycle, 
being raised to accentuate property 
performance when property returns are 
judged to materially outperform the cost 
of debt and lowered when seeking to 
reduce exposure to the property cycle.
At 31 March 2017, the Company’s 
see-through loan to value (“LTV”), being 
the ratio of see-through net borrowings 
to the value of the see-through property 
portfolio, was 51%. This metric has varied 
between 45% and 55% in the last five 
years and, subsequent to the year end, 
has fallen below 50% following the 
recent sales of properties in Cardiff 
and Great Yarmouth.
Looking forward, the Company will 
seek to operate within an LTV range 
of 40%-50% for the foreseeable future, 
subject to being able to maximise 
opportunities in the market whilst 
remaining aware of the risks of higher 
levels of gearing.
During the year, the average debt maturity 
reduced to 3.6 years (2016: 4.5 years), 
with no secured loan repayable before 
November 2019, whilst marginally 
increasing the average cost of debt at 
4.3% (2016: 4.2%). The Company has 
a significant level of liquidity with cash 
and unutilised bank facilities of £267m 
(2016: £193m) to fund capital works 
on its portfolio.
BOARD MATTERS
In July 2016, I became CEO of Helical plc 
succeeding Michael Slade who became 
the Company’s Non-Executive Chairman. 
The Board also consists of three 
Executive Directors and five Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Our Executive 
team has an average of over 19 years’ 
experience at Helical and are supported 
by a strong team of property and finance 
professionals and administrative staff.
THE FUTURE
Helical has a dynamic portfolio 
with good upside potential through 
a combination of development, 
refurbishment and significant asset 
management opportunities. We believe 
our concentration on offices and 
mixed use assets in London, offices 
in Manchester and well located logistics 
units will provide capital growth from 
development gains and rising 
income streams.
We have ambition to continue to grow 
the Company and have actively sought 
to add to our development pipeline with 
exciting new schemes, particularly in 
London. Rebalancing the portfolio 
through the sale of non-core assets 
enables us to recycle some of the capital 
we have created in recent years and fully 
pursue those opportunities that we 
have identified.

ANNUAL GROWTH RATE (3 YEARS)
DESCRIPTION
The Investment Property 
Databank (“IPD”) produces 
a number of independent 
benchmarks of property 
returns which are regarded 
as the main industry indices. 
IPD has compared the 
unleveraged performance 
of Helical’s total property 
portfolio against portfolios 
within IPD for the last 20 
years. The Group’s annual 
performance target is to 
exceed the top quartile of 
the IPD database, which it 
has consistently achieved.
PERFORMANCE
Helical’s unleveraged 
performance for the year 
to 31 March 2017 was 9.4% 
(2016: 21.7%) compared to 
the IPD benchmark of 4.4% 
(2016: 11.4%) and upper 
quartile benchmark of 
6.9% (2016: 13.0%).
LINK TO REMUNERATION
Performance Share Plan 
A third of the PSP 
vesting criteria is based 
on performance compared 
with the IPD so these awards 
are directly linked to this 
performance measure.
DESCRIPTION
Our Group’s main objective 
is to maximise growth in net 
asset value which we seek 
to achieve through increases 
in investment portfolio values 
and from retained earnings 
from other property related 
activity. EPRA net asset 
value per share is the 
property industry’s preferred 
measure of the share of net 
assets attributable to each 
share as it includes the fair 
value of net assets on an 
ongoing long-term basis. 
The adjustments to net asset 
value to arrive at this figure 
are shown in note 32 to the 
financial statements.
PERFORMANCE
The diluted net asset value 
per share, excluding trading 
stock surplus, at 31 March 
2017 increased by 6.4% to 
431p (2016: 405p). Including 
the surplus on valuation of 
trading and development 
stock and adjusting for the 
fair value of derivatives and 
deferred taxation, the EPRA 
net asset value per share at 
31 March 2017 increased by 
3.7% to 473p (2016: 456p).
LINK TO REMUNERATION
Director Bonuses
The calculation of the 
Directors’ bonuses under the 
Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 
is based on a model where 
Directors share in the profits 
generated by the Company’s 
property activities. As these 
are the same profits that 
drive increases in EPRA NAV, 
the Directors’ bonus is 
strongly aligned to this 
performance measure.
Performance Share Plan
A third of the Performance 
Share Plan (“PSP”) vesting 
criteria is based on 
compound growth in net 
asset value (“NAV”) over 
three years, so these awards 
are directly linked to this 
performance measure.
We measure our performance  
using a number of financial and 
non-financial key performance  
indicators (“KPIs”).

DESCRIPTION
Total Shareholder Return is 
a measure of the return on 
investment for shareholders. 
It combines share price 
appreciation and dividends 
paid to show the total return 
to the Shareholder expressed 
as an annualised percentage.
PERFORMANCE
The Total Shareholder Return 
in the year to 31 March 2017 
was -18.0% (2016: 1.0%). Over 
five, ten, fifteen, twenty and 
twenty five years Helical’s 
Total Shareholder Return 
exceeded that of the Listed 
Real Estate Sector Index.
LINK TO REMUNERATION
Performance Share Plan 
A third of the PSP vesting 
criteria is based on 
performance against the 
FTSE 350 Super Sector 
Real Estate Index, excluding 
storage companies and 
agencies. These awards are 
therefore directly linked to 
this performance measure.
DESCRIPTION
High levels of staff retention 
remain a key feature of 
Helical’s business. The Group 
retains a highly skilled and 
experienced team. We assess 
our success based on two key 
metrics, the average length 
of service of the Group’s head 
office employees and average 
staff turnover.
PERFORMANCE
The average length of service 
of the Group’s head office 
employees at 31 March 2017 
was eight years and the 
average staff turnover 
was 5.7%. 
LINK TO REMUNERATION
Director Bonuses
Under the rules of the Annual 
Bonus Scheme 2016 a third 
of the bonuses are settled in 
deferred shares, which are 
required to be held for a 
period of three years.
Performance Share Plan
These awards have a three 
year vesting period and the 
Directors are required to hold 
them for a further two years 
after they vest.
We incentivise management to outperform the Group’s competitors 
by setting appropriate levels for performance indicators against which 
rewards are measured. We also design our remuneration packages to 
align management’s interests with shareholders’ aspirations. Key to 
this is the monitoring and reporting against identifiable performance 
targets and benchmarks.

THE BOWER 
OLD STREET EC1
This asset was acquired in November 
2012 for £60.8m in a joint venture with 
Crosstree Real Estate Partners LLP. The 
site is in the heart of an area which has 
become a “creative halo”, a district of 
London which is a hub for technology, 
media and telecommunications companies 
and which is benefiting from substantial 
investment in infrastructure. A planning 
consent has been implemented to increase 
the floor space on the site by 116,000 sq ft, 
to refurbish existing areas and significantly 
upgrade the public realm with the creation 
of a new pedestrian street. 
On 20 January 2016, Helical acquired

In addition to our holdings in the City 
and Tech Belt and West London we have 
one scheme in Covent Garden WC2.
11
DRURY LANE & DRYDEN 
STREET
COVENT GARDEN WC2
The existing buildings, which are in 
office and retail use, sit on an island site 
of approximately 0.5 acres. Approximately 
half of the site, adjacent to Dryden 
Street, sits within the Covent Garden 
Conservation Area. In July 2015, contracts 
were exchanged with Diageo Pension 
Fund (a fund managed by Savills 
Investment Management) for the 
conditional acquisition of the Drury 
Lane site. The contract is conditional on 
the viability of the scheme and Helical 
securing planning consent. A planning 
application for the residential led scheme 
of 68 apartments was submitted in 
August 2015 and resolution to grant 
consent was issued at a planning 
committee in April 2016. A further 
planning consent for an alternative office 
led scheme was submitted in December 
2016 and is currently being considered 
by Westminster City Council.

Our approach to regional investment 
is to acquire assets where occupational 
demand is robust throughout the property 
cycle and the barriers to new supply are high. 
Successfully picking the sectors and assets 
with these attributes will ensure strong cash 
flows and rental growth. In general, yields 
for regional assets are higher than those in 
London and these assets are acquired to 
provide significant cash flow for the Group. 
We anticipate that income will become an 
increasingly important part of total returns 
as yield compression slows and, as such, we 
focus our attention on areas where we believe 
the occupational market remains robust. 
Our regional portfolio contributed 60% of 
our net rental income from tenants in diverse 
sectors and geographical locations. The 
£351m regional portfolio comprises £156m 
of logistics (44% of the regional investment 
portfolio), £95m of offices (27%), £80m retail 
warehousing and in-town retail (23%), mainly 
The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff, which has been 
sold for £55m since year end, and £20m of 
value from ground rents and assignment fees 
from our retirement village development 
programme (6%).

CHURCHGATE AND LEE HOUSE
This asset, comprising 249,000 sq ft of 
multi-let offices, was purchased in March 
2014. Since purchase we have refurbished 
the reception and 75,254 sq ft of office 
space. With the successful letting of the 
1st floor of Lee House and the Sunshine 
Suite (15,536 sq ft), Churchgate and Lee 
House is now 100% occupied. Looking 
forward asset management initiatives still 
exist to drive further rental growth. We will 
continue to refurbish the asset as space 
becomes available through lease events. 
Our regional office investment 
portfolio comprises seven assets 
including four in Manchester and 
others in Crawley, Glasgow and 
Reading. During the year we sold 
three assets in Cobham, Castle 
Donnington and Cheadle for £14. 15m, 
a 6.8% premium to book value.
Manchester is a city with a diverse, 
thriving and growing economy 
which is widely regarded as 
England’s second city and 
the centre of the ‘Northern 
Powerhouse’. The assets we  
hold there are:

DALE HOUSE
Dale House is a 54,000 sq ft office  
building situated in the Northern Quarter 
of Manchester. Following purchase we have 
pursued surrenders across the building. 
We successfully achieved surrenders of 
the top three floors, lower ground and 
basement spaces which amounts to circa 
33,000 sq ft. Refurbishment of these areas 
has commenced with delivery in Q4 2017. 
We have secured a pre-let of the 5th floor 
(7,100 sq ft) and have significant interest in 
the remaining space that is being delivered.

31 BOOTH STREET
This 25,441 sq ft office located in the 
prime city core was acquired in January 
2016 for £4.7m. The building has been 
fully refurbished and was launched to the 
market in March 2017. We have received 
significant occupational interest to date 
and hope to secure our first letting soon.

TRINITY COURT
Trinity Court, purchased in May 2017 for 
£12.9m, is a 47,500 sq ft office building 
situated in the central business district of 
Manchester. The building is currently 100% 
let with secured income until the end 
of 2017 at a passing rent of £26.94 psf. 
The building will be vacated in 2018 and 
a full refurbishment and extension will 
be implemented delivering new office  
space to the market in early 2019.

includes a prime retail asset in 
Cardiff, three retail parks and 
a number of pre-let and/or

THE MORGAN QUARTER
CARDIFF
During the year we continued to 
reposition the asset and strengthen the 
tenant mix. We concluded 12 retail leases 
representing over £400,000 pa in rental 
income which included two tenants 
upsizing within the estate. Negotiations 
with Jack Wills, first started in 2015, for 
them to extend their store finally came 
to fruition in December.
Along with this expansion, we also 
completed all of the planned lease 
renewals and regears with the Hayes 
retailers, Molton Brown, White Stuff 
and Joules. In addition we completed 
the lease renewal with Route One in 
the Morgan Arcade.
Within the Creative Quarter we 
completed six office leases and work 
on Phase Three of the refurbishment 
completed in May 2017 providing 
5,700 sq ft of new space. Since the year 
end this asset has been sold for £55m, 
a net initial yield of 5.9% in line with its 
March 2016 book value.

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 41 Our retirement village portfolio consists of four 
villages. We design each of the villages with an 
active, independent retirement in mind and the 
communities that we create are the ideal place 
to live a social and varied lifestyle. Each private, 
age-exclusive retirement community is centred 
around a residents’ clubhouse, and features 
many amenities including an indoor pool and 
gym, landscaped gardens, bar, restaurant and 
library. With an increasing proportion of the 
UK population over 65 years old, and a severe 
under supply in retirement housing, this sector 
creates significant opportunities for investors 
and developers.

BASIS OF DISCLOSURE 
OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The financial information, tables and 
graphs included in the Financial Review 
are taken from the Group’s financial 
statements which have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). In 
measuring and reporting on the financial 
performance of the Group’s activities, 
the Group uses a number of alternative 
performance measures (“APM’s”) to 
ensure that these financial statements 
reflect such performance on a basis 
consistent with that used by management 
to monitor and assess the Group’s 
property portfolio and to facilitate 
comparisons with other companies in 
the real estate sector.
Since 2010, Helical has held a significant 
proportion of its property assets in joint 
ventures with partners that provide the 
majority of the equity required to 
purchase the assets, whilst relying on the 
Group to provide asset management or 
development expertise. Accounting 
convention requires Helical to account 
under IFRS for our share of the net results 
and net assets of joint ventures in limited 
detail in the income statement and 
balance sheet. In this review and 
elsewhere in this statement, we have 
incorporated the separate components 
of such joint ventures into a more detailed 
“see-through” analysis of our property 
portfolio and debt profile and the 
associated income streams and financing 
costs to assist in providing a more 
comprehensive overview of the Group’s 
activities. This see-through analysis can 
be found in Appendix 1.

stakeholders with the most relevant 
information on the operating performance 
of the underlying property portfolio of 
real estate companies. A key measure of 
a company’s operational performance and 
the extent to which its dividend payments 
to shareholders are underpinned by 
earnings is the level of recurring income 
arising from operational activities. 
Unrealised changes in valuation, gains 
or losses on disposals of properties and 
certain other items do not necessarily 
provide an accurate picture of the 
Company’s underlying operational 
performance and are, therefore, excluded 
from the EPRA performance measures.
Net asset value is a key performance 
measure used in the real estate industry. 
However, net asset value as reported in 
the financial statements under IFRS does 
not provide stakeholders with the most 
relevant information on the fair value of 
the assets and liabilities within an ongoing 
real estate investment company with a 
long-term investment strategy. The 
objective of the EPRA NAV measure is 
to highlight the fair value of net assets 
on an ongoing, long-term basis. Assets 
and liabilities that are not expected to 
crystallise in normal circumstances such 
as the fair value of financial derivatives 
and deferred taxes on property valuation 
surpluses are therefore excluded. 
Similarly, trading properties and 
developments are adjusted to their 
fair value under the EPRA measure.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
The year to 31 March 2017 saw the Group 
deliver continued growth in net rental 
income and a valuation surplus on the 
investment portfolio leading to pre-tax 
profit of £41.6m and an increase in EPRA 
net asset value per share of 3.7%.
The proposed final dividend of 6.20p takes 
the total dividend for the year to 8.60p, 
a 5.3% increase on the previous year. 
With growing rents from our core London 
portfolio, supported by strong income 
streams from the regional portfolio, 
the Company aims to continue to grow 
this dividend.
The Group’s real estate portfolio, including 
its share of assets held in joint ventures, 
reduced to £1,205m (2016: £1,240m) as 
gains from its annual revaluation and 
capital expenditure on the investment 
portfolio and development programme 
were offset by the sale of £199m of assets. 
There were no purchases of new 
investment, trading or development 
assets during the year.
The sale of investment assets during the 
year has resulted in a reduction in the 
Group’s loan to value to 51% (2016: 55%) 
which has been reduced further since the 
year end to 49% on a pro-forma basis 
following the sale of £65m of assets and 
the purchase of one asset for £13m. The 
Group’s debt maturity profile shortened 
to 3.6 years (2016: 4.5 years) and its 
weighted average cost of debt increased 
to 4.3% (2016: 4.2%).
At 31 March 2017, the Group had unutilised 
bank facilities of £158m and £109m of 
cash. The bank facilities are primarily 
available to fund Phase Two of the 
Group’s redevelopment of The Bower, 
London EC1, the construction works at 
Barts Square, London EC1, including the 
last phase of residential, its retirement 
village development programme and 
future potential investment purchases.
TOTAL ACCOUNTING RETURN
The total accounting return is the growth 
in the net asset value of the Company 
plus dividends paid in the year, expressed 
as a percentage of the net asset value at 
the beginning of the period. The metric 
measures the growth in shareholders’ 
funds each year and is expressed as an 
absolute measure.
TOTAL PROPERTY RETURN
We calculate our Total Property Return 
to enable us to assess the aggregate 
of income and capital profits made 
each year from our property activities. 
Our business is primarily aimed at 
producing surpluses in the value of our 
assets through asset management and 
development, with the income side of 
the business seeking to cover our annual 
administration and finance costs.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
The IFRS earnings per share decreased 
from 91.3p to 34.0p and is based on the 
after tax earnings attributable to ordinary 
shareholders divided by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during 
the year. 
On an EPRA basis, earnings per share 
were 0.5p (2016: 17.1p), reflecting the 
Group’s share of net rental income of 
£47.0m (2016: £43.4m) and development 
losses of £5.7m (2016: profits of £27.5m) 
but excluding gains on sale and 
revaluation of investment properties 
of £38.6m (2016: £93.7m).
NET ASSET VALUE
IFRS diluted net asset value per share 
increased from 405p to 431p and is 
a measure of shareholders’ funds divided 
by the number of shares in issue at the 
period end, excluding those held by the 
Company’s Employee Share Ownership 
Plan Trust, adjusted to allow for the effect 
of all dilutive share awards. 
EPRA net asset value per share increased 
by 3.7% to 473p per share (2016: 456p). 
This increase arose principally from a total 
comprehensive income (retained profits) 
of £39.2m (2016: £104.9m) less dividends 
paid of £3.6m (2016: £14.4m) and 
reflecting a reduction in the surplus on 
valuation of the trading and development 
stock to £12.5m (2016: £19.4m).
INCOME STATEMENT
Rental Income and Property Overheads
Gross rental income receivable by 
the Group in respect of wholly owned 
properties increased by 7.3% to £48.8m 
(2016: £45.5m) reflecting the partial 
capture of the investment portfolio’s 
reversionary potential offset by sales 
of assets during the year. In the joint 
ventures, gross rents fell from £1.8m to 
£0.9m. Property overheads in respect 
of wholly owned assets and in respect 
of those assets in joint ventures fell from 
£3.4m to £2.5m. After taking account 
of net rents payable to our profit share 
partners of £0.3m (2016: £0.5m), 
see-through net rents increased by 
8.3% to £47.0m (2016: £43.4m).
Development Profits
The majority of the Group’s development 
activities are carried out on assets held as 
investment properties such as The Bower, 
London EC1 and 25 Charterhouse Square, 
London EC1, schemes funded with third 
parties, or in joint ventures. 
In the year under review the Company 
made progress at its retirement village 
portfolio, increasing sales to £40.0m, 
including the sale of land, (2016: £29.9m)

with profits of £1.8m (2016: £0.6m). In its 
development management role at Barts 
Square, London EC1 and One Creechurch 
Place, London EC3 and in respect of the 
development of the Scottish Power 
headquarters in Glasgow, it earned 
fees of £2.8m. Our retail development 
programme generated net profits of 
£2.3m (2016: loss of £1.8m) as the pre-let 
scheme at Cortonwood was forward 
funded during the year. In total, the 
Group generated development profits 
of £7.1m (2016: £30.7m). 
At the year end we reviewed the book 
value of our land holdings and made 
provisions of £6.3m (2016: £6.4m), 
primarily in respect of the retirement village 
at Great Alne, where forecast costs have 
increased during the year. Net of these 
provisions, a development property profit 
of £0.8m (2016: £24.3m) was recognised.
In the previous year to 31 March 2016, 
profits included a development 
management fee of £23.2m in respect 
of The Bower, London EC1 and £3.7m 
in respect of One Creechurch Place 
and the Scottish Power headquarters.
Share of Results of Joint Ventures
The sale of our retail development at 
Shirley and the termination of the lease 
to the NHS at Barts Square to allow the 
final phase of development to commence 
reduced net rents in our joint ventures 
from £1.3m to £0.8m. No further rents 
are expected in respect of assets 
currently held in joint ventures in the short 
term. At the year end we reviewed the 
book value of our land holdings in the 
joint ventures and made provisions of 
£6.5m against the carrying value of our 
schemes at Hammersmith Town Hall and 
Barts Square. Finance, administration 
and taxation costs and sundry provisions 
against the carrying value of assets 
added a further £0.8m of losses leaving a 
net loss from our joint ventures of £6.5m. 
In the previous year to 31 March 2016, 
gains on the sale or revaluation of the 
investment assets of £43.9m, mainly in 
respect of The Bower, London EC1 and 
Barts Square, London EC1, contributed 
to a total net profit from joint ventures 
for that year of £50.5m. 
Gain on Sale and Revaluation 
of Investment Properties
During the year, we sold 24 investment 
assets for a total of £159m generating 
a net overall profit of £1.4m. In London 
we sold two office buildings at One King 
Street, Hammersmith, W6 and Chart 
House, EC1 for £42.0m at a small net loss 
of £0.3m. In the regions we sold three 
office buildings at Castle Donnington, 
Cheadle and Cobham for £14.2m at a 
profit of £0.7m after costs. We sold six 
retail assets during the period, being a 
shop in Leicester and five retail parks in 
Ellesmere Port, Harrogate, Huddersfield, 
Scarborough and Stockport for a 
combined £44.1m at a net loss of £2.9m. 
From our logistics portfolio we sold 13 
assets for £58.5m at a net profit of £3.8m.
The valuation of our investment portfolio 
continued to reflect the benefit of our 
refurbishment activities in London where 
we generated an increase of 9.1% overall 
and 9.8% on a like-for-like basis. The 
regions contributed a loss of 1.3% overall 
and 2.1 % on a like-for-like basis. In total, 
the investment portfolio showed a 
valuation increase of 4.5%, or 5.2% 
on a like-for-like basis.
The total impact on our results of the gain 
on sale and revaluation of our investment 
portfolio, including in joint ventures, was 
a net gain of £38.6m (2016: £93.7m). 
Administration Costs
Administration costs, before performance 
related awards, increased marginally from 
£10.7m to £10.8m. 
Performance related share awards 
and bonus payments, before 
National Insurance costs, were £6.9m 
(2016: £13.3m). Of this amount, the £1.7m 
(2016: £6.7m) charge for share awards 
under the Performance Share Plan is 
expensed through the Income Statement 
but added back to Shareholders’ Funds 
through the Statement of Changes in 
Equity. In addition, National Insurance 
of £0.7m (2016: £2.1m) has been charged 
in the year.

Finance Costs, Finance Income and

Interest payable on secured bank loans 
including our share of loans on assets 
held in joint ventures, but before 
capitalised interest, increased to £24.7m 
(2016: £23.9m). Interest payable in 
respect of the unsecured Retail and 
Convertible Bonds was £8.8m 
(2016: £8.8m). The movement in medium 
and long-term interest rate projections 
during the year, offset by the shortening 
maturity period of the Group’s financial 
instruments, contributed to a credit of 
£0.8m (2016: charge of £6.9m) on their 
mark-to-market valuation. Capitalised 
interest increased from £4.9m to £7.9m 
as development schemes progressed. 
Total finance costs, including joint 
ventures, reduced from £27.8m to 
£25.6m. Finance income earned was 
£4.4m (2016: £5.1m).
Taxation
Helical pays corporation tax on its 
UK sourced net rental income, trading 
and development profits and realised 
chargeable gains, after offset of 
administration and finance costs. 
The deferred tax charge for the year is 
principally derived from the revaluation 
surpluses recognised in the year offset 
by the recognition of tax losses which 
the Group believes will be utilised against 
profits in the foreseeable future.

Secured Debt
The Group arranges its secured 
investment and development facilities 
to suit its business needs as follows:
• Investment facilities  
We have £190m of revolving credit 
facilities which enable the Group to 
acquire, refurbish, reposition and hold 
significant parts of our investment 
portfolio. We have used these facilities 
to finance our regional portfolio. Our 
London investment assets are primarily 
held in £383m of term loan secured 
facilities which, where appropriate, 
allow us to finance refurbishment 
projects including the redevelopment 
of The Tower at The Bower, Old Street, 
London EC1. The value of the Group’s 
properties secured in these facilities 
at 31 March 2017 was £983m (31 March 
2016: £945m) with a corresponding 
loan to value of 47% (2016: 54%). 
The average maturity of the Group’s 
investment facilities at 31 March 2017 
was 4.1 years (2016: 5.0 years) with 
a weighted average interest rate of 
4.3% (2016: 3.8%). 
• Development facilities  
These facilities finance the construction 
of the retirement villages at Durrants 
Village, Faygate; Maudslay Park, 
Great Alne; Millbrook Village, Exeter; 
and the fourth phase of Bramshott 
Place, Liphook. The average maturity 
of the Group’s development facilities 
at 31 March 2017 was 3.4 years 
(2016: 4.4 years) with a weighted 
average interest rate of 3.7% 
(2016: 3.8%).
• Joint venture facilities  
We hold a number of investment 
and development properties in joint 
venture with third parties and include 
in our reported figures our share, in 
proportion to our economic interest, 
of the debt associated with each asset. 
The average maturity of the Group‘s 
share of bank facilities in joint ventures 
at 31 March 2017 was 2.7 years 
(2016: 3.7 years) with a weighted 
average interest rate of 3.4% 
(2016: 3.4%).
Unsecured Debt
The Group’s unsecured debt, 
including the Convertible Bond at its 
mark-to-market valuation, is £179.8m 
(2016: £182.7m) as follows:
• Retail Bond 
In June 2013, the Group raised £80m 
from the issue of an unsecured Retail 
Bond with a 6.00% coupon. This bond 
is repayable in June 2020.
Debt and Financial Risk
In seeking to finance Helical’s expansion 
in recent years, the Group has used a 
combination of new secured facilities, 
whose purpose and terms reflect the 
nature of the assets charged to the 
lenders, and unsecured bonds, which have 
provided the firepower to acquire many 
of the assets which have contributed to 
the recent growth in Shareholders’ Funds. 
The composition of the Group’s debt 
structure has significantly changed since 
31 March 2013 with unsecured debt 
now representing 24% of debt drawn 
at 31 March 2017.
In total, Helical’s outstanding debt at 
31 March 2017 of £737m (2016: £778m) 
had an average maturity of 3.6 years 
(2016: 4.5 years) and a weighted interest 
cost of 4.3% (2016: 4.2%).

repayable in June 2019, or, subject to 
certain conditions, convertible at the 
option of the bond holders into ordinary 
shares, unless a cash settlement option 
is exercised by the Company. The initial 
conversion price has been set at 
£4.9694 per share, representing a 35% 
premium above the price on the day of 
the issue and a premium of 59% above 
the Company’s EPRA net asset value 
per share at 31 March 2014. The value 
of the Bond at 31 March 2017, as 
determined by the listed market price, 
was £99.8m (2016: £102.7m). 
• Short-term working capital facilities 
These facilities provide access to 
additional working capital for the Group.

At 31 March 2017, the Group had £651.4m 
(2016: £635.5m) of fixed rate debt with 
an average effective interest rate of 4.2% 
(2016: 4.2%) and £29.3m (2016: £107.1m) 
of floating rate debt with an average 
effective interest rate, excluding 
commitment fees, of 3.0% (2016: 3.9%). 
In addition, the Group had £3.3m of 
interest rate caps at an average of 0.75% 
(2016: £157m at 4.0%). In our joint 
ventures, the Group’s share of fixed rate 
debt was £nil (2016: £nil) and £55.9m 
(2016: £35.3m) of floating rate debt with 
an effective rate of 3.4% (2016: 3.4%) with 
interest rate caps set at 1.5% plus margin 
on £61.8m and 0.5% plus margin on 
£56.9m (2016: £nil).
Interest Cover
In assessing the results of the Group 
for each financial year, Helical considers 
its interest cover as a measure of its 
performance and its ability to finance 
its annual interest payments from its net 
operating income, before revaluation 
gains or losses on the investment 
portfolio and net realisable provisions 
on the trading and development stock. 
In the year to 31 March 2017, this interest 
cover was 2.6 times (2016: 5.4 times).

INVESTMENT PROPERTY 
ACCOUNTING TREATMENT 
International Accounting Standard 
40 - Investment Property requires that 
accrued operating lease income assets 
should be shown separately and 
deducted from the fair value of the 
investment properties in the Statement 
of Financial Position. This accounting 
treatment had not been applied at 
31 March 2016 but has been adopted for 
the period ended 31 March 2017. A prior 
year adjustment has been made to ensure 
consistency of comparative information, 
clarity and transparency.
The effect of the adjustment on the 
relevant financial statement line items 
for the year ended 31 March 2016 is 
detailed in note 35.

Risk management starts at Board level where 
the Directors set the overall risk appetite of the 
Group and the risk management strategies. 
Helical’s management runs the business within 
these guidelines and part of its role is to act within 
these strategies and to report to the Board on 
how they are being operated.
The Group’s risk appetite and risk management 
strategies are continually assessed by the Board 
to ensure that they are appropriate and consistent 
with the Group’s overall strategy and with external 
market conditions. The effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management strategy is reviewed 
regularly by the Audit and Risk Committee and 
by the full Board.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk within 
the business. However, the small size of the team 
and our flat management structure allows the 
Executive Directors to have close contact with all 
aspects of the business and allows them to ensure 
that the identification and management of risks 
and opportunities is part of the mindset of all 
decision makers at Helical.
PRINCIPAL RISKS  
REVIEW
Risk is an integral part of any group’s business activities 
and Helical’s ability to identify, assess, monitor and 
manage each risk to which it is exposed is fundamental 
to its financial stability, current and future financial 
performance and reputation. As well as seeing changes 
in our internal and external environment as potential 
risks, we also see them as being opportunities which 
can drive performance.

HELICAL PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 VIABILITY STATEMENT 
The Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group for a period of five years to 
March 2022, being the period for which 
the Board regularly reviews forecasts and 
which encompasses the lifetime of the 
Group’s major development projects. 
The Board does consider the future 
performance of the Group beyond the 
five years but a longer timeframe involves 
less certainty over the forecasting 
assumptions.
The viability of the Group is reviewed 
throughout the year and through multiple 
channels, detailed below:
• The strategic direction of the Group is 
established by the Board once a year 
and is captured in the Business Plan 
which forms the basis of the detailed 
budgets and actions for the year;
• The Board reviews the principal risks of 
the Group twice a year, reassessing the 
severity of each risk and determining 
the Group’s proposed response;
• The five year forecasts for the Group 
are updated and reviewed by the 
Board on a quarterly basis; and
• Management reviews the short-term 
(three-four months) cash requirements 
of the Group on a weekly basis and 
cash balances and movements are 
monitored daily.
In making their assessment, the Board 
considers the principal risks and then 
assesses the potential impacts in severe, 
but plausible, downside scenarios 
together with the likely effectiveness of 
mitigating actions that the Group would 
have at its disposal. 
The most relevant risks and the potential 
impact of them on the viability of the 
Group are considered to be:
• A significant reduction in the fair value 
of the Group’s property portfolio, 
which could result in the Group 
breaching loan covenants and being 
required to repay a proportion of 
borrowings;
• A lack of demand from tenants as the 
Group’s development properties near 
practical completion, which could 
reduce the Group’s levels of rental 
income and profitability; and
• An inability to maintain sufficient levels 
of rental income, which could present a 
short-term liquidity risk for the Group.
The Group subjected the cashflow 
forecasts to sensitivity analysis in which 
it assessed the impact of significant 
reductions to the property portfolio fair 
value and associated rental income on 
the Group’s loan covenants. Management 
also modelled the rental income profile of 
the Group, taking into account expected 
changes to leases and contracted rents, 
comparing expected income with the 
loan covenant requirements in order to 
determine points of potential pressure.
Based on the outcomes of the procedures 
outlined above and other matters 
considered by the Board, it has a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the five year period of their assessment.
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 55 OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS
STRATEGIC 
RISKS 
Strategic risks are external risks that could prevent the Group delivering its strategy. These risks principally impact our 
decision to purchase or exit from a property asset.
The Group’s 
strategy is 
inconsistent 
with the market
Risk description
Changing market conditions could hinder 
the Group’s ability to buy and sell properties 
envisioned in its strategy. The location, size 
and mix of properties in the Helical portfolio 
determine the impact of the risk.
If the Group’s chosen markets underperform, 
the impact on the Group’s liquidity, investment 
property revaluations and rental income 
is greater.
The Group carries out significant development 
projects over several years and is therefore 
exposed to fluctuations in the market over time.
Mitigation/action
Management constantly monitors the market and makes changes 
to the Group’s strategy in light of market shifts.
The Group’s management is highly experienced and has a strong 
track record of understanding the property market.
Due to the Group’s small management team, changes in strategy 
can be implemented quickly.
Management carefully reviews the risk profile of individual developments 
and in some cases builds properties in several phases to minimise the 
exposure to reduced demand for particular asset classes or geographical 
locations over time. The Group limits the number of speculative 
developments it does on its own balance sheet.
Property values 
decline/reduced 
tenant demand 
for space
Risk description
The property portfolio is at risk of revaluation 
falls through changes in market conditions, 
including under-performing sectors or 
locations, lack of tenant demand or general 
economic uncertainty. 
Mitigation/action
The Group’s property portfolio is diverse in asset type, location and tenant 
industries, reducing over-exposure to one sector. Management reviews 
external data, seeks the advice of industry experts and monitors the 
performance of individual assets and sectors in order to dispose of 
non-performing assets and rebalance the portfolio for the changing market.
Political risk Risk description
There is a risk that regulatory and tax changes 
could adversely affect the market in which the 
Group operates and changes in legislation could 
lead to delays in receiving planning permission.
This risk has increased significantly following 
the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the 
European Union in June 2016.
Mitigation/action
Management seeks advice from experts to ensure continued 
monitoring of upcoming regulatory and tax changes and to understand 
the potential impact on the Group. It maintains good relationships 
with planning consultants and local authorities.
FINANCIAL 
RISKS
Financial risks are those that could prevent the Group from funding its chosen strategy, both in the long and short term.
Availability of 
bank borrowing 
and cash 
resources
Risk description
The inability to roll over existing facilities 
or take out new borrowing would impact 
on the Group’s ability to maintain its current 
portfolio and purchase new properties. The 
Group may forego opportunities if it does 
not maintain sufficient cash to take advantage 
of them as they arise.
Mitigation/action
The Group maintains a good relationship with many established lending 
institutions and borrowings are spread across a number of these.
Funding requirements are reviewed weekly by management, who ensure 
that the maturity dates of borrowings are spread over several years.
Management monitors the cash levels of the Group on a daily basis and 
maintains sufficient levels of cash resources and undrawn committed 
bank facilities to fund opportunities as they arise.
Breach of 
loan and bond 
covenants
Risk description
If the Group breaches debt covenants, lending 
institutions may require the early repayment 
of borrowings.
Mitigation/action
Covenants are closely monitored throughout the year. Management 
carries out sensitivity analysis to assess the likelihood of future breaches 
based on significant changes in property values or rental income.
Increase in cost 
of borrowing
Risk description
The Group is at risk of increased interest 
rates on unhedged borrowings.
Mitigation/action
The Group hedges the interest rates on the majority of its borrowings, 
effectively fixing the rates over several years.
The principal risks faced by the Group, 
and the steps taken by the Group to mitigate 
these risks, are as follows: 
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 56
PRINCIPAL RISKS REVIEW 
CONTINUED OPERATIONAL 
RISKS
Operational risks are internal risks that could prevent the Group from delivery its strategy.
Employment 
and retention 
of key 
personnel
Risk description
The Group’s continued success is reliant on 
its management and staff and successful 
relationships with its joint venture partners.
Mitigation/action
The senior management team is very experienced and the average 
length of service is high. The Nominations Committee and Board 
regularly review succession planning issues and remuneration is 
set to attract and retain high calibre staff.
The Group has well established relationships with joint venture partners.
Inability to 
asset manage, 
develop and let 
property assets
Risk description
The Group relies on external parties to 
support it in asset managing, developing 
and letting its properties, including planning 
consultants, contractors, architects, project 
managers, marketing agencies, lawyers 
and managing agents.
Mitigation/action
The Group has a highly experienced team managing its properties. It 
seeks to maintain excellent relationships with its specialist professional 
advisors. Management actively monitors these parties to ensure they 
are delivering the required quality on time.
Health and 
Safety/Bribery 
and corruption 
risk
Risk description
The nature of the Group’s operations and 
markets expose it to potential health and 
safety and bribery and corruption risks. 
Mitigation/action
The Group reviews and updates its Health and Safety policy regularly 
and it is approved by the Board annually. The Group engages an 
external health and safety consultant to review contractor contracts 
prior to appointment to ensure they have appropriate policies and 
procedures in place, then monitors the adherence to policies 
throughout the project.
The Executive Committee reviews the report by the external consultant 
every month and the Board reviews them at every scheduled meeting. 
The internal asset managers carry out regular site visits.
The Group’s anti-bribery and whistleblowing policies are reviewed 
and updated annually and projects with greater exposure to bribery 
and corruption are monitored closely. The Group avoids doing business 
in high risk territories.
All employees are required to complete an online anti-bribery 
and corruption course and to submit details of corporate hospitality 
and gifts received.
Disruption to 
the business 
from failure 
of Information 
Technology 
systems 
Risk description
The Group relies on Information Technology 
to perform effectively. Failure would 
adversely affect the Group’s operations. 
Commercially sensitive information is 
electronically stored by the Group. Theft 
of this information could adversely impact 
the Group’s commercial advantage and 
result in penalties where the information 
is protected by law. 
Mitigation/action
The Group engages and actively manages external Information 
Technology experts to ensure the systems operate effectively 
and that we respond to the evolving I.T. security environment. 
This includes regular off-site backups and a comprehensive 
disaster recovery process.
The external provider also ensures the system is secure and this 
is subject to routine testing. 
REPUTATIONAL 
RISKS
Reputational risks are those that could affect the Group in all aspects of its strategy.
Poor 
management 
of stakeholder 
relations
Risk description
The Group risks suffering from reputational 
damage resulting in a loss of credibility with 
key stakeholders including Shareholders, 
analysts, banking institutions, contractors, 
managing agents, tenants, property 
purchasers/sellers and employees.
Mitigation/action
The Group believes that by successfully delivering its strategy 
and mitigating its strategic, financial and operational risks its good 
reputation will be protected.
The Group regularly reviews its strategy and risks to ensure it is 
acting in the interests of its stakeholders.
The Group maintains a strong relationship with investors and analysts 
through regular meetings.
The Group has a formal approval procedure for all press releases 
and public announcements.
A Group Disclosure Policy and Share Dealing Code, Policy & Procedures 
have been circulated to all staff in accordance with the EU Market 
Abuse Regulation (MAR).
Modern Slavery 
and Human 
Trafficking
Risk description
The Group would attract criticism and negative 
publicity were any instances of “modern 
slavery” identified within its supply chain.
Mitigation/action
Our Modern Slavery Act statement, which is prominently displayed 
on our website, gives details of our policy and our approach.

HELICAL PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Helical implements responsible environmental 
and social practices across its direct business, 
via partners, contractors and suppliers and 
through its joint venture activities.
An endorsement of Helical’s commitment to managing 
environmental and social impacts is its continued 
listing in the FTSE4Good Index. The FTSE4Good 
Index measures the performance of companies that 
meet globally recognised Corporate Responsibility 
standards and facilitates investment in those 
companies. Maintaining listed status on this Index 
remains a key priority for Helical, and informs the 
evolving approach to Corporate Responsibility 
and Sustainability. 
The benefits of managing environmental and social 
impacts include an increased ability to secure planning 
consent, improved marketability of assets to prospective 
tenants, reduced operating costs of assets, mitigating 
the risk of future legislation and regulation, and 
enhanced corporate reputation.
MANAGING CORPORATE 
RESPONSIBILITY
Each year Helical reviews and updates  
its environmental management system, 
which has been in place since 2003.  
The environmental management system, 
is available on the Company website and 
key elements of the system include:
• “Environment” and “Corporate 
Responsibility” policies which set out 
the Group’s high-level commitment 
across a number of impact areas. 
These are reviewed annually at Board 
level and are implemented by the 
senior management team;
• Annual (and ongoing) performance 
targets to enable Helical to focus  
its efforts throughout the year  
on measurable, and achievable 
performance goals; 
• Key Performance Measures to help 
Helical monitor progress towards these 
targets and to ensure they can report 
in line with investor disclosure 
requirements, notably FTSE4Good; 
• Checklists to assist in applying 
minimum sustainability requirements 
across its development activities. 
Helical has developed a sustainability 
project management checklist to 
ensure that sustainability issues  
are incorporated into all decisions 
throughout the development lifecycle. 
In addition, an Environmental Impact 
Checklist is issued to individual 
contractors in order to address 
corporate goals at the construction 
stage; and
• Effective use of internal audit and 
review through quarterly meetings  
of key Helical personnel, external 
Corporate Responsibility advisors 
and principal managing agents to 
ensure effective delivery of the 
objectives and targets.
The management system has been 
designed specifically to reflect the 
flexibility of Helical’s business model.  
It also reflects the key role that Helical’s 
partners play in delivering enhanced 
sustainability outcomes in all its business 
ventures, be they developments/
refurbishments or in the management  
of individual multi-let assets.
We comment overleaf on some of the 
highlights across our four key areas.

PEOPLE
Helical has a small core team, working 
closely with trusted partners in multiple 
disciplines. Our success is built on the 
skills of our staff so finding, developing, 
rewarding and retaining our people is a 
key element of our corporate strategy. 
As at 31 March 2017, Helical had 30 
permanent and three temporary employees 
(9.1% of the staff) based at the Group’s 
head office in London. In addition, there 
were two employees in the Polish subsidiary 
and three employees of the retirement 
village companies. The majority of the 
staff working at the retirement villages 
were transferred to the external company 
responsible for the day to day management 
of the sites during the year.
The information set out below is  
in respect of the head office only. 
Gender diversity of the Board and  
the Company as at 31 March 2017  
is set out in the charts to the left. 
Helical continues to enforce its equal 
opportunities, harassment and sexual 
discrimination policies. We also continue 
to monitor compliance with its anti-
bribery and whistle blowing policies. 
There have been no incidents to report 
against these policies to date.
A high level of staff retention remains 
a key feature of the business. Staff 
turnover is low at 5.7% (representing 
two permanent employees leaving in the 
year). Helical has retained a highly skilled 
and experienced team and the table 
below shows a breakdown of staff by 
length of service:
Total number 
of staff as at 
31 March

service 
(years)
Executive Directors 4 19.5
Executives 15 5.7
All employees 30 8.0
THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF 
SERVICE OF OUR PEOPLE  
IS 8 YEARS.
Helical’s staff retention levels not 
only reflect competitive remuneration 
and benefits packages but also its 
commitment to enhancing the 
professional and personal skills of its 
team by supporting employee training 
and development, by means of training 
courses, seminars and mentoring.
As in previous years, Helical continues 
to evaluate training needs in line with 
business objectives. Collectively, our 
people spent 1,148 hours on training and 
development during the year, an average 
of 5.3 days per employee. 
There are no human rights issues of which 
the Board is aware that are considered 
relevant to the Group. 
As Helical operates with a small team, 
our ability to establish excellent long-term 
relationships with our advisers, agents 
and other suppliers is very important. 
As part of this, fair treatment of suppliers 
remains a key priority for Helical and 
the Group’s policy is to settle all agreed 
liabilities within the terms established 
with them. 
COLLECTIVELY, OUR PEOPLE 
SPENT 1,148 HOURS ON 
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 
DURING THE YEAR.
ENVIRONMENT
The Group’s corporate commitments 
to environmental issues are outlined in 
the Group’s Environmental Policy which 
can be found on the Company’s website. 
The policy details Helical’s commitments 
across a range of impact areas and its 
development and property management 
activities. The Group sets itself targets 
to guide its environmental responsibilities, 
including resource use and waste 
production, pollution, biodiversity, timber 
sourcing, tenant engagement, flood risk 
and sustainable design and construction. 
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 60 Full details of the Group’s performance 
against the targets during the year is 
available in the Corporate Responsibilities 
section of the Company’s website, but a 
selection of highlights are presented below:
• Due to changes in the portfolio over the 
year, it is difficult to provide meaningful 
overall like-for-like statistics. However, 
of the properties that can be compared:
 – The Shepherds Building, London W14, 
has shown an increase in energy 
consumption of 6%, which can be 
partially attributed to the ongoing 
major essential repairs to the lifts. 
Water consumption increased by 24% 
with the addition of new showers in the 
common parts last year and varying 
usage based on occupancy levels. 
 – The Hub, Glasgow, has shown an 
8% increase in gas consumption 
attributable to increased occupancy 
levels (although a decrease of 8% in 
electricity consumption has also been 
achieved) and a 54% decrease in water 
consumption, which is principally a 
result of works to faulty toilet cisterns. 
 – Churchgate & Lee House, Manchester, 
has shown a small decrease in 
electricity consumption compared 
with last year, but increases of 11% for 
gas and 34% for water are principally 
attributed to increased occupancy.
 – The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff, has 
shown a 15% decrease in electricity 
consumption through implementing 
a successful awareness raising 
programme for staff regarding the role 
they can play in reducing costs and 
lessening environmental impact. 
• The Group continues to offer recycling 
facilities at the larger of its managed 
assets. Where data is available Helical 
comfortably exceeded its ongoing 
target of a recycling rate of at least 
35% at most properties with over 80% 
of waste generated being recycled at 
The Loom, London E1, 211 Old Street, 
London EC1, The Hub, Glasgow, and 
Churchgate & Lee House, Manchester.
• In line with the mandatory requirement 
for reporting its greenhouse gas 
emissions, Helical provides a separate 
disclosure in this report below.
GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG)  
EMISSIONS REPORTING 
For the reporting year to 31 March 2017 
the 2014 UK Government’s Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting has been 
followed. Greenhouse gas emissions are 
reported using the following parameters 
to determine what is included within the 
reporting boundaries.
• Scope 1 - direct emissions includes any 
gas data for landlord controlled parts 
and fuel use for Group owned vehicles. 
Fugitive emissions from air conditioning 
are included where it is Helical’s 
responsibility within the managed 
portfolio, when the data is available. 
• Scope 2 - indirect energy emissions 
includes purchased electricity 
throughout the Group’s operations 
within landlord controlled parts. 
Electricity used in refurbishment 
projects has been recorded separately 
where appropriate. In the majority 
of cases the electricity consumed is 
recorded for the individual properties 
as part of the data collection for the 
management of common parts, and 
contractors have been required to 
collect project specific data. 
The table below highlights that 
overall GHG emissions have increased 
by 27% year on year. The reason for this 
is primarily due to an increase in tenant 
occupation at a number of the larger 
multi-let properties, which has also 
increased the common parts 
consumption. Data for last year has 
been restated due to metering and 
billing issues at a number of properties, 
in particular Churchgate & Lee House, 
Manchester, and Leighton Buzzard. 
For Scope 1 this represents an increase 
of 226 tonnes and for Scope 2 an increase 
of 469 tonnes.
Due to the changing portfolio, the 
like-for-like GHG emissions are only 
reported for a small number of 
properties (seven properties for electricity 
and three properties for gas). Although 
consumption overall for the portfolio has 
increased, the like-for-like performance 
across the assessed properties has 
reduced by 8%. This is due in part to 
improved energy efficiency, light fittings 
and a greater awareness of responsibilities 
regarding personal impact on 
consumption.
Only three multi-let office buildings and 
one shopping centre can report on carbon 
intensity. At Churchgate & Lee House, 
Manchester, The Hub, Glasgow, and 
The Shepherds Building, London W14, 
the average carbon intensity equates to 
0.11 tCO
2
e/m
2
, whilst The Morgan Quarter, 
Cardiff, has a carbon intensity of

with last year’s performance.

Total all scopes 3,673 4,637 1,654 1,526
The specific target set by Helical is to reduce energy consumption by 2% pa in the principal managed assets. 
As discussed earlier in this section of the report, year on year performance is variable across the portfolio and 
complicated by the changing nature of the portfolio through acquisition and divestment, increasing occupancy 
and ongoing refurbishment of the component assets. Like-for-like has seen an improvement of 8% on the 2016 
baseline performance achieving the 2% reduced energy consumption target.

CHARITABLE, COMMUNITY  
AND SOCIAL INITIATIVES 
Helical takes a strong interest in 
charitable, community and social issues. 
As a group, we recognise that the 
buildings that we own and develop have 
an impact on the local environment and 
the communities that live and work there 
and we believe that engagement with 
those communities is an important part 
of our activities. Community engagement 
is an on-going concern throughout the 
development process, from planning until 
development completion and operation. 
Over the past year Helical has set up 
social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn 
and Instagram in order to communicate 
more effectively with our tenants and 
other stakeholders. A quarterly online 
newsletter, City Life, has also been 
introduced which circulates articles 
on the Group’s projects, occupiers and 
contributing partners. These can all be 
accessed through the Helical website.
As part of our commitment to the regions 
in which we operate, we regularly support 
community initiatives. Some examples 
from the year to 31 March 2017 include:
• The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff, team 
worked with Cardiff Pride last summer 
to provide a hub for the LGBT 
community for a week in the run up 
to the Pride Festival. They have also 
been shortlisted for a Cardiff Life 
Award in the Property category;
• A number of charity fundraising events 
have been held at The Shepherds 
Building, London W14, over the last 12 
months, many of which tie into high-
profile national charity campaigns (for 
example the MacMillan baking event, 
Wear It Pink Day and Children in Need);
HEALTH & SAFETY
Helical has a corporate culture that is 
committed to the prevention of injuries 
and ill health to its employees or other 
people that may be affected by its 
activities. The Group’s Health & Safety 
policy reflects this commitment. The 
Board of Directors and senior executives 
are responsible for implementing this 
policy and they look to ensure that health 
and safety considerations are always 
given priority in planning and in 
day-to-day activities. 
The Group’s Health & Safety Policy was 
last reviewed and updated in February 
2017 to reflect the latest legislative and 
regulatory developments. Training of 
Helical staff in the updated Health 
and Safety Policy and supporting 
CDM requirements has been undertaken 
during the reporting year. The Group’s 
Health & Safety policy can be found on 
the Company’s website and a summary 
of performance for the 18 active sites 
is below.
Helical has delivered over two million 
hours of construction during the year with 
no fatalities or major accidents and only 
seven RIDDOR reportable incidents. 
Overall Health and Safety performance 
using Lost Time Accident Frequency Rate 
is a 61% improvement over last year. The 
majority of Helical projects are managed 
by principal contractors holding OHSAS 
18001 certification and that maintain 
100% Construction Skills Certification 
Scheme (CSCS) accreditation for all full 
time and subcontracted staff.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 62 • At Churchgate & Lee House, 
Manchester, the team attended a local 
conference linked to Manchester 
Metropolitan University about coffee 
cup recycling and litter prevention and 
invited tenants along to join. We have 
also held several events for our tenants 
that have involved partnerships 
with local businesses, organisations 
and musicians;
• Helical continues to be a member 
of The Aldgate Partnership (“TAP”), 
formed in 2014 to help drive a powerful 
agenda for change. Membership of the 
Group currently includes landowners, 
commercial occupiers, and developers. 
TAP works in partnership with its 
members to develop Aldgate as  
‘One Location’, delivering a range of 
interventions to support community 
development and develop a premier 
business hub with high quality public 
realm and environment that produces  
a safe, convenient and inspiring 
destination for all employees,  
residents and visitors;
• During the year Helical staff raised  
funds for numerous charities, most 
particularly LandAid, the property 
industry’s charity. LandAid works with 
young disadvantaged people in the 
UK who are living on the streets, or 
who are at severe risk of homelessness, 
to provide them with accommodation 
and training as well as working to tackle 
the root causes of homelessness. Seven 
members of Helical’s staff participated in 
the 10k LandAid Run and five employees 
took part in “LandAid Day” (touring 
around London raising over £17,000 
in donations from local businesses). 
One Helical staff member participated  
in the “Source to Sea” - a non-stop

Thames to the sea stretching 237 miles, 
averaging more than 33 miles per runner 
and raising over £9,000 for LandAid;
• Helical has been a sponsor of the 
Property Race Day every year since  
it started in 2006, raising funds for  
a number of national charities;
• Alongside the Group’s formal 
charitable activities, Helical employees 
raise funds for charities on a personal 
basis and, where appropriate, the 
Group will make donations to help  
the staff reach their fundraising 
goals; and
• To help encourage young people to 
enter the property industry, for the  
last ten years Helical has held a work 
experience event comprising a 
two-day intensive introductory 
programme into London Real Estate 
run by Helical’s Chief Executive with 
support from the senior members of 
the Property team. The package is 
available to 8-10 students studying 
either a BA or Masters in Real Estate  
or equivalent qualification.
WE RECOGNISE THAT THE 
BUILDINGS WE OWN AND 
DEVELOP HAVE AN IMPACT ON 
THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND 
THE COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE 
AND WORK THERE AND WE 
BELIEVE THAT ENGAGEMENT 
WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES 
IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF 
OUR ACTIVITIES.
FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS 
AND OPPORTUNITIES 
Helical recognises that changing social and 
environmental factors need to be taken 
into account when considering our broad 
business strategies, as these may give rise 
to opportunities to be exploited or risks to 
be mitigated. Such factors include:
• The uncertainties surrounding future 
changes to environmental and social 
legislation and potential changes to 
labour markets following the UK’s 
decision to leave the European Union;
• The implications for the property 
sector of global agreements to tackle 
climate change and more local actions 
that may be taken to tackle specific 
environmental issues (for example 
measures to reduce air pollution in 
city centres); and
• Broader technological and social 
changes that may impact on our 
tenants, our partners and the wider 
communities where our properties 
are sited.
As a group, we keep such matters under 
review and act as necessary to ensure 
that we meet our obligations.

TENURE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
I am pleased to be able to address 
Shareholders for the first time as Chairman 
of Helical. After leading the Company 
as Chief Executive for 32 years I was 
delighted the Board selected Gerald Kaye 
to be my successor and am confident 
he will lead the Company with distinction 
for many years. 
The Company has had a good year 
despite an uncertain background 
following the decision to leave the 
European Union. The rationalisation of 
the portfolio leaves the Company with 
a focused portfolio balanced between 
a London investment and development 
programme providing both capital and 
rental growth opportunities and a high 
yielding regional investment portfolio. 
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD
The composition of the Board is discussed 
in greater detail in the Nominations 
Committee Report on pages 76 to 77. 
Following the changes implemented at 
the 2016 AGM, the Board consists of a 
Non-Executive Chairman, four Executive 
Directors and five independent Non-
Executive Directors, a balance which 
satisfies governance requirements for 
a FTSE 350 Company, notwithstanding 
that we are currently outside of that index. 
There are no changes proposed at the 
AGM on the 13 July 2017 and none are 
anticipated before 2019. Good governance 
is reflected in the contribution that a 
diverse Board offers and the Company 
will seek to make further progress in this 
area in future years. 
BOARD DECISIONS
Much of the year was taken up in 
discussion of the changing economic 
and political environment and outlook 
for our markets, against a background of 
the decision to leave the European Union 
and other geopolitical factors. In addition, 
the Board meeting agendas during the 
year contained many issues including:
• A review of the Group’s corporate, 
property and financial strategy; 
• A complete review of the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 and the 
introduction of new policies on 
diversity and slavery;
• Consideration and approval of significant 
property transactions; and,
• Completion of the changes to the 
composition of the Board as outlined  
on page 76.
It has been another good year at Helical with a 
reshaping of the Board completed, equity recycled 
through the sale of almost £200m of assets and 
the Company’s activities streamlined. We have 
also sought to strengthen our compliance with 
Corporate Governance requirements.

CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW ANNUAL STRATEGY REVIEW 
In March 2017, the Board considered 
the Executive Directors’ Annual Strategy 
Review of the business, examining the 
economic, geopolitical, societal and 
environmental risks affecting the business. 
This review reaffirmed the Company’s 
principal objective of combining 
investment and development activity 
to ensure maximum shareholder returns 
whilst managing risks appropriately. 
BOARD EVALUATION 
For the first time, the Board Evaluation 
was undertaken by an external advisor 
and the results of this review are outlined 
in the Governance Review on pages 72 
to 75. I am pleased to report that the 
overall findings noted that Helical has 
an effective Board with many strengths. 
Recognising that some improvements 
can be made, the Governance Review 
also notes the actions to be taken during 
the year to 31 March 2018 and I will 
be reporting on these in the 2018 
Annual Report. 
BOARD COMMITTEES
The work of the Nominations, 
Remuneration and Audit and Risk 
Committees are discussed in detail in 
their individual reports on pages 76 to 97. 
With regard to remuneration and in the 
light of increasing shareholder scrutiny 
of this area I note that Shareholders 
approved the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy at the 2016 AGM with 97% in favour 
and no changes are being proposed at 
the 2017 AGM.
INVESTOR RELATIONS
We have an extensive programme 
of meetings and presentations with 
shareholders throughout the year with 
the majority of these taking place in the 
periods following our annual and half 
year results. 
The Chief Executive, Gerald Kaye, 
and the Finance Director, Tim Murphy, 
attended the majority of these meetings 
during the year with the remaining 
Executive Directors, Duncan Walker and 
Matthew Bonning-Snook, also attending 
as appropriate. The Senior Independent 
Director, Richard Gillingwater, attended 
a small number of meetings. Richard 
Gillingwater and I are available to meet 
Shareholders if they wish to discuss any 
matters with us. 
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow 
Non-Executive Directors, Gerald Kaye and 
his Executive team, the senior property 
professionals, finance team and all the 
staff for their hard work during the year. 
The following pages describe in greater 
detail our governance structure and the 
work of the Board and its Committees.

BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES
The main purpose of the Board is to create 
and deliver the long-term success of the 
Group and returns for its Shareholders. 
The Board is collectively responsible for 
providing the entrepreneurial leadership 
of the Group within a framework of 
controls and reporting structures which 
assist the Group in pursuing its strategic 
aims and business objectives. The Board 
sets the Group’s strategic aims, ensures 
that the necessary financial and human 
resources are in place for the Group to 
meet its objectives and also reviews 
management performance. The Board 
sets the Group’s values and standards and 
ensures that the Group’s obligations to its 
Shareholders and others are understood 
and met.
All Directors take decisions objectively 
in the interests of the Group. As part 
of their roles as members of the Board, 
Non-Executive Directors constructively 
challenge and help develop proposals 
on strategy and the risk appetite of the 
Group. Non-Executive Directors scrutinise 
the performance of management in 
meeting agreed goals and objectives and 
monitor the reporting of performance. 
They satisfy themselves on the integrity 
of financial information and that financial 
controls and systems of risk management 
are robust and defensible. They are 
responsible for determining appropriate 
levels of remuneration for the Executive 
Directors and have a prime role in 
appointing and, where necessary, 
removing Executive Directors. In 
conjunction with the Nominations 
Committee, the Board considers 
succession planning of Board members 
and senior management. In addition 
to Boardroom discussions, the Chairman 
maintains contact with other Non-
Executive Directors by telephone and 
at least annually, will hold meetings with 
the Non-Executive Directors without 
the Executive Directors present. Richard 
Gillingwater (Senior Independent 
Director) holds meetings of the 
independent Non-Executive Directors 
separately from the rest of the Board at 
least once a year to ensure that any issues 
may be discussed without the presence 
of a non-independent Director.
The Board has a schedule of matters 
specifically reserved to it for decision. 
The Board controls the business but 
delegates day-to-day responsibility to 
the executive management. An Executive 
Committee, comprising all the Executive 
Directors, meets regularly to discuss the 
development of strategy, to review and 
implement proposed transactions, to 
review policies and procedures (including 
health and safety), to monitor budget and 
financial performance and to assess risk. 
The full Board reviews all minutes of 
proceedings at Executive Committee 
meetings and receives reports from the 
Executive Committee Chairman at every 
Board meeting. 
However, there are a number of matters 
which are required to be or, in the interests 
of the Group, should only be, decided by 
the Board as a whole. A summary of the 
schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board is set out below:

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 71 During the year under review we 
have sought to strengthen further 
our compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 (“Governance 
Code”/“Code”) and are aware of the 
changes reflected in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016, which will be 
fully effective for the year to 31 March 
2018. We have also sought to reflect 
the recommendations of the Financial 
Reporting Council in their note on 
‘Developments in Corporate Governance 
and Stewardship 2016’, issued in 
January 2017.
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD AND 
ALIGNMENT TO CORPORATE STRATEGY
The Code requires a Board and its 
committees to have an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the 
Company to enable them to discharge 
their duties and responsibilities effectively 
and in line with its corporate strategy. 
Helical operates with a strong 
management team of senior decision 
makers backed up by a finance team and 
other support staff. The Group is keen to 
promote exceptional talent to Board level 
at the earliest opportunity to expose such 
individuals to the broader issues facing 
the business, encourage their long-term 
commitment to the Group and provide 
for future succession.
Provision B.1.2 of the Code notes 
that companies such as Helical, which 
are below the FTSE350, are required 
to have at least two independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Following the 
changes to the Board at the 2016 AGM, 
the Board comprises the Chairman, four 
Executive Directors and five independent 
Non-Executive Directors, a balance 
in line with the Code’s requirement 
for FTSE 350 companies.
The Chairman is Michael Slade, former 
Chief Executive of Helical, who was 
re-elected as a Director and assumed his 
new role as Chairman at the 2016 AGM 
with 85% of votes cast by Shareholders 
in favour of his re-election. In advance of 
these changes, the Company consulted 
with Shareholders and proceeded with 
the indicated approval of a significant 
majority. However, as noted in last year’s 
Annual Report, Michael Slade is not 
considered to have been independent 
on his appointment as required by the 
Governance Code. As a consequence, 
the Board has ensured that there are 
safeguards in place to counter any 
concerns regarding his independence 
status. In particular, he does not chair 
the Nominations Committee, although 
he is a member of that Committee, 
and is not a member of the Audit and 
Risk or Remuneration Committees. 
Furthermore, the Board Evaluation 
process is run by Richard Gillingwater, 
the Company’s Senior Independent 
Director. Notwithstanding this, the 
Board considers Michael Slade to be of 
independent character and judgement. In 
assessing his contribution to the business, 
the other members of the Board consider 
Michael Slade to be a valuable asset to 
the Company, providing almost 50 years 
of experience in the real estate sector.
The independent Non-Executive 
Directors are Richard Gillingwater 
(Senior Independent Director), Susan 
Clayton, Richard Cotton, Richard Grant 
and Michael O’Donnell. Between them 
the Non-Executive team provide a 
current FTSE 100 Chairman, an Executive 
Director of CBRE (the leading advisor 
on commercial property and real estate 
matters), a former head of UK Real Estate 
at J P Morgan Cazenove, the current 
Finance Director at Cadogan Estates 
(a real estate family owned trust owning 
a substantial part of West London) and 
a private equity corporate advisor with 
residential and retirement living 
experience.
In the Board’s view, the Board and its 
Committees have the appropriate balance 
of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the real estate sector, the 
listed environment, financial accounting 
and the Company to discharge their 
respective duties effectively as required 
by the Code.
CULTURE OF THE COMPANY
In July 2016, the Financial Reporting 
Council (“FRC”) issued a report entitled 
‘Corporate Culture and the Role of 
Boards’. During the year under review 
the Company has started to reflect the 
recommendations of the report in its 
governance structures and culture, with 
greater engagement and involvement 
of Board members and employees in 
identifying, documenting and targeting 
its strategic aims and objectives. In 
particular, senior property professionals 
below Board level regularly make 
presentations to the Board on assets 
they are responsible for. In addition, 
in considering the Company’s Annual 
Strategy Review, the Executive Directors 
met with and discussed the views of the 
senior management of Helical and 
incorporated their views in the final 
Strategy Report. In taking this action the 
Company is seeking to reflect the main 
aims of the FRC report which are to:
• Connect purpose and strategy to culture;
• Align values and incentives; and
• Assess, measure and report on the 
Company’s culture.
The Company will consider how it can 
adopt the recommendations of the report 
during the year to 31 March 2018 and will 
report back to Shareholders on its impact 
in the Annual Report 2018.
THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
CODE 2014 (THE “CODE”)
The Board is accountable to the 
Group’s Shareholders for good corporate 
governance and we believe in applying 
the highest principles of corporate 
governance. We have complied 
throughout the year with the principles as 
set out in the section of the Code headed 
“The Main Principles of the Code” and, 
except where stated above in relation to 
Michael Slade, and in respect of sending 
out the Notice of the AGM and related 
papers to shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the meeting (where they were 
sent out 18 days before the 2016 AGM), 
have complied with the provisions of the 
Code throughout the year under review.
At Helical we believe that robust corporate governance 
is of fundamental importance in delivering for 
shareholders the long-term success of the Company 
through the effective, entrepreneurial and prudent 
management of the Company.

GOVERNANCE REVIEW ANNUAL EVALUATION OF THE BOARD
Since the Company is not in the FTSE 350, 
the Code does not require our annual 
Board evaluation to be externally 
facilitated every three years. However, 
following the changes to the Board in 
2016, it was proposed that the 2017 Board 
evaluation would be carried out externally 
to ensure that the Group’s Board and 
governance process is highly effective 
in carrying out its responsibilities. In 
January 2017, we retained SA Associates, 
an executive search and board evaluation 
services firm, to undertake a full external 
evaluation, which involved:
• An initial briefing on the future strategy 
of the Company from the Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director and the 
Chief Executive;
• The observation of Board meetings 
and Committee meetings;
• Distribution of a short, focussed 
questionnaire to each Board member;
• Conducting one-to-one interviews; and,
• Reviewing governance documents and 
Board meeting agendas and minutes.
The key areas for consideration 
were: Board composition, roles and 
responsibilities, Board culture, dynamics, 
teamwork and leadership, Board 
processes, reporting and agendas, 
overall Board effectiveness, strategy 
input and relationship between Board 
and management.
The evaluation report by SA Associates 
was presented for discussion at the March 
Board meeting. The overall findings noted 
that Helical has an effective Board with a 
positive dynamic and a good platform to 
challenge and support. The following key 
strengths and development opportunities 
were identified:
Key Strengths
• The new Chairman and Chief Executive 
have settled well into their respective 
roles;
• The relationships between Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors is strong;
• The Board applies good governance 
practices across the business;
• Discussion of strategic issues, including 
consideration of the annual Strategy 
Review, receive suitable discussion 
time; and,
• Health and safety issues receive 
appropriate focus.
Development Opportunities
• Time allocated to discussion of a 
broader Corporate Strategy could 
be increased;
• Elevating the importance of discussion 
of risks facing the business; and,
• Talent development and succession 
throughout the Company could receive 
more focus.
Actions for 2017-18
At the March 2017 Board meeting, 
the Board discussed and agreed the 
following actions:
• The introduction of a Strategy Day 
for the whole Board, incorporating 
external speakers;
• The reallocation of the primary 
responsibility for risk from the Executive 
Committee to a renamed Audit and 
Risk Committee; and,
• Greater exposure for those below 
Board level to the full Board.
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
The Nominations Committee Report 
which describes the work of the 
Committee, is on pages 76 to 77.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
which describes the work of the 
Committee and discloses the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy and Annual Report 
on Remuneration, is on pages 80 to 97.
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE
The Audit and Risk Committee Chairman 
is Richard Grant, the Finance Director of 
Cadogan Estates Limited and a former 
partner of PWC. As a result, the Board 
considers that he has recent and relevant 
financial experience as required by the 
Code. The report of the Chairman of the 
Audit and Risk Committee describing the 
issues considered by the Committee in the 
year under review is on pages 78 and 79.
Risk Management and Internal Controls
The Board is responsible for maintaining 
a sound system of internal control to 
safeguard shareholders’ investment 
and the Group’s assets. Such a system 
is designed to manage, but cannot 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. There are inherent 
limitations in any control system and, 
accordingly, even the most effective 
system can provide only reasonable, and 
not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The key features of the Group’s system 
of internal control are as follows:
• Clearly defined organisational 
responsibilities and limits of authority. 
The day-to-day involvement of the 
Executive Directors in the running 
of the business ensures that these 
responsibilities and limits are adhered to;
• Financial controls and review 
procedures;
• Financial information systems including 
cash flow, profit and capital expenditure 
forecasts. The Board receives regular 
and comprehensive reports on the 
day-to-day running of the business;
• An Audit and Risk Committee which 
meets with the Auditors and deals with 
any significant internal control matters. 
In the year under review the Audit and 
Risk Committee met with the Auditors 
on two occasions; and
• The Board is responsible for the 
management of the Group’s risk profile 
which is reviewed by the Audit and Risk 
Committee during the year. An analysis 
of the Group’s principal risks can be 
found on pages 54 to 57.
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 73 VIABILITY AND GOING CONCERN
The Company’s Viability Statement is 
included on page 55 within the Principal 
Risks Review of the Strategic Report.
The Directors have reviewed the current 
and projected financial position of the 
Group making reasonable assumptions 
about future trading performance.
The key areas of sensitivity are:
• Timing and value of property sales;
• Availability of loan finance and related 
cash flows;
• Future property valuations and their 
impact on covenants and potential 
loan repayments;
• Committed future expenditure;
• Future rental income; and
• Receipt, amount and timing 
of development profits.
The forecast cash flows have been 
sensitised to reflect those cash inflows 
which are less certain and to take account 
of a potential deterioration of property 
valuations. In addition, the forecasts have 
been subject to sensitivity analysis in 
which the impact of significant reductions 
to the fair value of the property portfolio 
and associated rental income on the 
Group’s loan covenants was assessed. 
From their review, the Directors believe 
that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue to be operational as a going 
concern for the foreseeable future.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGS
At the 2016 Annual General Meeting, 
held on the 25 July 2016, all the Directors, 
with the exception of Michael Slade 
(discussed below), were re-elected 
with over 98% of the votes cast in favour 
of their re-election. The two resolutions 
relating to the re-appointment and 
remuneration of the Auditors also 
received over 98% of the votes cast 
in favour. The resolution to renew the 
Company’s Remuneration Policy received 
a vote in favour of over 97%, whilst the 
resolution to approve amendments to 
the rules of the Company’s Annual Bonus 
Scheme were approved by over 98%. 
The non-binding vote in respect of the 
approval of the Company’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report received a vote in 
favour of over 84% (see below). All the 
remaining resolutions were approved 
with votes cast in favour by between 
94% and 100%.
The re-election of Michael Slade received 
a vote in favour of 84.5% with 15.5% 
against. In addition, shares representing 
2.1% of the Company’s shareholders 
withheld their vote on this resolution. 
We believe that these votes provide 
strong support for Michael Slade’s 
Chairmanship of the Company whilst 
recognising some Shareholder concern 
regarding his lack of independence 
on appointment.
The resolution to approve the Company’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report (“DRR”) 
also received 84.5% of votes cast in 
favour with 15.5% against and, again, 
2.1% of Shareholders withholding their 
vote on the resolution. Engagement 
with shareholder representative bodies 
suggests that the overall quantum of 
remuneration remains a concern for them. 
We were, however, pleased to note the 
strong support for the Company’s 
renewal of its Remuneration Policy 
(97%) and the changes to the rules of 
the Annual Bonus Scheme (98%).
At the 2017 Annual General Meeting to be 
held on the 13 July 2017, the Company will 
be seeking re-election of all the current 
Board members, consideration of the 
Annual Report to 31 March 2017 and 
approval of the final dividend to be paid 
on 21 July 2017, the re-appointment of and 
authorisation to set the remuneration of 
the Company’s auditors, the approval of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
a number of regular technical resolutions.
ATTENDANCE AT BOARD AND 
COMMITTEE MEETINGS DURING 
THE YEAR
Seven scheduled meetings of the 
Board were held during the year ended 
31 March 2017. In addition, several 
unscheduled meetings were arranged

GOVERNANCE REVIEW
CONTINUED The Board is supplied in a timely manner 
with information in a form and of a quality 
appropriate to enable it to discharge its 
duties and its Directors are free to seek 
any further information they consider 
necessary. The Directors have access 
to the services of a Company Secretary 
who is responsible for advising the Board 
on all governance matters and ensuring 
compliance with Board procedures and 
applicable laws and regulations. Under 
the direction of the Chairman, the 
Company Secretary’s responsibilities 
include ensuring good information flows 
within the Board and its Committees 
and between senior management and 
Non-Executive Directors, as well as 
facilitating induction of new Directors and 
assisting with professional development 
as required. The Board ensures that 
Directors have access to independent 
professional advice at the Group’s 
expense where they judge it necessary 
to discharge their responsibilities as 
Directors. Training is available for all 
Directors as necessary.
ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Directors value the views of the 
Company’s Shareholders and recognise 
their interest in the Group’s strategy and 
performance, Board membership and 
quality of management. They hold regular 
meetings with, and give presentations to, 
the Company’s institutional Shareholders 
to discuss the Group’s results and 
objectives. The Directors regularly meet, 
with the help of the Company’s brokers, 
institutions that do not currently hold

the Company’s objectives. Gerald Kaye, 
as Chief Executive, attended all of the 
meetings during the year and he is usually 
accompanied by at least one of the other 
Executive Directors.
The Senior Independent Director, Richard 
Gillingwater, met with a small number of 
shareholders and was available to meet 
with other Shareholders throughout the 
year under review and will hold meetings 
with Shareholders whenever requested in 
order to ensure sufficient understanding 
of any issues and concerns they may have.
The AGM is used to communicate 
with investors and they are encouraged 
to participate. The Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and members of 
the Audit and Risk, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees will attend 
the AGM and will be available to answer 
questions. Separate resolutions are 
proposed on each issue in order that 
they can be given proper consideration 
and there is a separate resolution to 
consider the Annual Report and accounts. 
All proxy votes are counted and the level 
of proxies lodged on each resolution will 
be indicated after it has been dealt with 
by a show of hands.
The Directors receive regular reports 
from sector analysts and investor relations 
advisors on how the Group is viewed by its 
Shareholders. The Group communicates 
with all Shareholders through the issue 
of regular press releases and through 
its website at www.helical.co.uk.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,  
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the role of the Nominations Committee, and my primary 
responsibility as its Chairman, is to ensure that the Company 
is headed by an effective Board which is collectively 
responsible for the long-term success of the Company.
RICHARD GILLINGWATER CBE 
SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
Care is taken to ensure that appointees 
have enough time available to devote to 
the job on appointment. To enable the 
Board to identify any potential conflicts 
of interest and ensure that Directors will 
continue to have sufficient time available 
to devote to the Company, Directors are 
required to inform the Board of any 
changes to their other significant 
commitments. In February 2017, Susan 
Clayton informed the Board that she had 
been appointed Chairman of Barwood 
Property Fund, which is to launch this 
year. In April 2017, Mike Slade informed 
the Board that he had been appointed 
Chairman of The Royal Marsden Cancer 
Charity’s Clinical Care and Research 
Centre Appeal. The Board is satisfied 
that both Directors will continue to have 
sufficient time to devote to their roles.
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD
Several Board changes, together with 
details of the recruitment process for 
the new appointments, were set out in 
last year’s report and I am pleased that 
Shareholders voted in support of the 
Committee’s recommendations to 
approve those changes at the 2016 
AGM. The refreshed Board consists 
of a Non-Executive Chairman, four 
Executive Directors and five independent 
Non-Executive Directors. This provides 
a strong balance of entrepreneurial 
leadership and a talented executive 
team, supported by committees with an 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the 
Company to be able to constructively 
challenge and assist the executive team 
in achieving its objectives. No further 
changes have been made to the 
composition of the Board during the year.

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT SUCCESSION PLANNING
By strengthening our Board evaluation 
process in employing an external assessor 
the Company has sought to improve its 
processes with regard to succession at all 
levels. The issue of who should succeed 
the previous Chief Executive and the 
balance of the Board with regard to the 
number of independent Non-Executive 
Directors compared to Executive 
Directors has been settled for the 
foreseeable future. The focus of the 
Committee and future Board evaluation 
processes will now be on ensuring there 
is a pipeline of potential future senior 
executives, both for below and at Board 
level. In considering these matters, the 
Board will seek to reflect a greater 
diversity at Board and senior 
management level whilst ensuring that 
the Company has the requisite balance 
of skills to ensure its long-term success.
BOARD EVALUATION
As detailed in the Governance Review 
on pages 72 to 75, the Board retained 
an external assessor, SA Associates, to 
undertake a full evaluation of the Board 
and governance process in January 2017. 
At the March 2017 meeting, the 
Committee and Executive Directors 
discussed the recommendations made 
in the evaluation report in detail.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Board believes that the requirements 
of Code Provision B.7.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code should 
be fulfilled. This provision requires all 
directors of FTSE350 companies to 
be subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders. Whilst the Company is 
not in the FTSE350, the Board has chosen 
to comply with this provision as it accepts 
that shareholders should annually have 
the right to vote on each Director’s 
election or re-election to the Board.
At the Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 13 July 2017, the following resolutions 
relating to the appointment of Directors 
are being proposed:
• The re-election of Mike Slade as 
Non-Executive Chairman;
• The re-election, as Executive Directors, 
of Gerald Kaye, Tim Murphy, Matthew 
Bonning-Snook and Duncan Walker; and
• The re-election, as Non-Executive 
Directors, of Susan Clayton, Richard 
Cotton, Richard Gillingwater, Richard 
Grant and Michael O’Donnell.
The Nominations Committee confirms 
to Shareholders that, following the annual 
formal performance evaluation and taking 
into account their qualifications and 
experience, these Directors continue to be 
effective and demonstrate commitment 
to their roles. Biographical details of the 
Directors are given on pages 70 and 71.
I trust that Shareholders will support 
the Committee and vote in favour of 
these resolutions.

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 77 The Committee endorses the principles 
set out in the FRC Guidance on Audit 
and Risk Committees. The Board has 
formal and transparent arrangements 
for considering how it applies the Group’s 
financial reporting and internal control 
principles and for maintaining an 
appropriate relationship with its auditors. 
Whilst all Directors have a duty to act in 
the interests of the Group, this Committee 
has a particular role, acting independently 
from the Executive Directors, to ensure 
that the interests of Shareholders are 
properly protected in relation to 
financial reporting and internal control. 
Appointments to the Committee are 
made by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nominations 
Committee in consultation with the 
Audit and Risk Committee members.
THE WORK OF THE AUDIT AND RISK 
COMMITTEE IN THE YEAR
The Committee met five times during 
the year and a record of attendance at 
these meetings is shown on page 74. It is 
common practice at Helical for Audit and 
Risk Committee meetings to be attended 
by all Board members, whether or not 
they are members of the Committee, 
so that their contribution to the matters 
discussed may be obtained.
In conjunction with the Board, the 
Audit and Risk Committee reviewed 
the following matters during the year:
• Risk and internal controls;
• The financial statements of the Group 
and the announcement of the annual 
results to 31 March 2016 and the interim 
statement on the half year results to 
30 September 2016;
• The Annual Report for the year to 
31 March 2016 to ensure it is fair, 
balanced and understandable;
• The performance of the external 
auditors and their programme of work; 
• The re-appointment of the Group’s 
external auditor; 
• The external auditors’ independence 
and the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditor; and
• The consideration of the requirement 
for an internal audit function.
The Audit and Risk Committee met the 
external auditor on two occasions to 
discuss matters arising from the annual 
and interim audits.
Other matters formally reviewed and 
discussed by the Committee during 
the year included:
• Review of company policies including 
those relating to anti-bribery and the 
Modern Slavery Act; 
• The Company’s whistleblowing 
procedures to ensure that they remain 
effective. Under the Company’s 
Whistleblowing Policy, employees 
and workers within the Group may 
raise concerns about malpractice 
or misconduct in confidence, either 
internally or outside of the Company 
to the independent audit partner; and
• Review of IT risk and business 
continuity planning.
In discharging its responsibilities in 
connection with the preparation of the 
financial statements for the year to 
31 March 2017, the Committee is responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the 
Group’s accounting policies, assumptions, 
judgements and estimates as applied by 
the executive management to the 
financial statements. During this review 
the following significant issues were 
considered:
• Internal Controls The Committee 
annually reviews the need for an internal 
audit function and recently reaffirmed 
its stance that, in view of the small scale 
and simplicity of the business, it does not 
consider that an internal audit function 
would be effective. However, 
periodically, the Committee asks the 
Group’s auditors to review its internal 
controls and their most recent report 
was presented to the Committee in April 
2015. Grant Thornton’s “Report on the 
Design and Operating Effectiveness of 
Internal Controls of Helical plc” provided 
a review of the Group’s control 
environment and internal controls.  
Neither this report nor the Audit and 
Risk Committee’s review highlighted any  
material weaknesses in the design and 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems 
and controls.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,  
During the year the responsibilities of the 
Audit Committee were broadened to include 
Risk. This formalised the Committee’s 
mandate to oversee the Group’s identification, 
monitoring and mitigation of risk.

HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 78
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT • Property Valuation The valuation of 
the Group’s investment and trading 
and development portfolio is a key area 
of judgement in preparing the annual 
and half yearly financial statements and 
reports. For this reason the fair value 
of the Group’s investment portfolio is 
determined by independent third party 
experts who are familiar with the markets 
in which the Group operates and have 
suitable professional qualifications.
The Group’s trading and development 
stock is accounted for in the financial 
statements at the lower of cost and  
net realisable value. Accordingly, the 
Committee reviews the assumptions 
made in considering whether an asset 
should be written down to its net 
realisable value, if lower than cost. In 
addition, the Committee reviews those 
instances where stock is considered to 
have a fair value above its current book 
value. The surplus of fair value above 
book value is not included in the Group’s 
Balance Sheet, nor is any movement 
reflected in the Income Statement. 
However, in accordance with the best 
practice recommendations of the 
European Public Real Estate 
Association, the surplus is included in 
the calculation of the EPRA Net Asset 
Value per share at each reporting date. 
The fair value calculation of the trading 
and development stock is reviewed by  
a suitably qualified independent third 
party valuer. 
In order to assist the Audit and Risk 
Committee in considering the valuations, 
the fair values of the investment, trading 
and development property portfolios 
are reviewed and approved by the 
Property Valuations Committee which 
is chaired by Susan Clayton, FRICS, an 
independent Non-Executive Director.
• Revenue Recognition Revenue 
recognition is a presumed significant  
risk under International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) and where 
the Group enters into complex 
transactions, judgment must be applied 
in determining when, and to what extent, 
revenue should be recognised. For 
material transactions, technical papers 
are presented to the Committee by 
Management and the Committee also 
requests that the Group’s external 
auditors review and report on these 
judgments. The Committee assesses 
the appropriateness of the proposed 
revenue recognition for each transaction 
and these are discussed between the 
external auditor and myself.
In addition to the significant issues 
discussed above, the Committee also 
considered, and concluded upon, the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern and the estimates and judgements 
discussed in note 37 to these accounts.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE 
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
During the year, the Audit and Risk 
Committee reviewed Grant Thornton UK 
LLP’s fees, effectiveness and whether the 
agreed audit plan had been fulfilled and 
the reasons for any variation from the plan.
The Audit and Risk Committee also 
considered their robustness and the 
degree to which they were able to assess 
key accounting and audit judgements 
and the content of their reports. This 
was performed through reviewing their 
reports and meeting with them to discuss 
their audit approach and findings. 
In addition, the Committee was notified 
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
that they had carried out a review of 
Grant Thornton UK LLP and the work 
they performed in conducting the audit 
of Helical’s 31 March 2016 results. 
The FRC assessed that Grant Thornton’s 
audit procedures in respect of investment 
property valuations could be significantly 
improved. Grant Thornton subsequently 
agreed the changes it would make in its 
approach with the FRC to address the 
shortcomings in their audit work 
identified in the FRC report. 
The Committee took the results of this 
review seriously and met with Grant 
Thornton and management in advance 
of the 2017 audit to discuss their revised 
approach and then, at the conclusion of 
the audit process, to satisfy itself that 
these changes had been appropriately 
implemented.
As a result of their review the Committee 
concluded that the audit process was 
effective.
AUDIT INDEPENDENCE
The Audit and Risk Committee considers 
the external auditor to be independent. 
The Committee’s policy is not to award 
non-audit services where the outcome 
of the work is relevant to a future audit 
judgement or that could impact the 
independence or objectivity of the audit 
firm. This policy is designed to ensure that 
the Group receives the most appropriate 
advice without compromising the 
independence of the Auditor. As part 
of this policy prior approval of non-audit 
services that exceed £20,000 is required. 
During the year, the following non-audit 
fees were paid to Grant Thornton UK LLP:
• £45,750 for the review of the 
Half Year Results;
• £6,000 for the review of the Performance 
Share Plan and Directors’ Bonus Scheme;
• £4,311 for advisory services in relation 
to the Group’s Polish operations, carried 
out by a separate team to the audit and 
the work was not relied upon by the 
audit team in reaching their opinion; and
• £13,440 for local taxation compliance 
work in the Netherlands.
The Committee considered all the 
services to be appropriate and that they 
did not impact the audit independence.
AUDITOR ROTATION
The Audit and Risk Committee has 
reviewed the EU guidance for mandatory 
auditor rotation, which has now 
been adopted into UK law. Under this 
legislation, Grant Thornton are required 
to rotate from the audit after the 
31 March 2020 year end. 
After considering this legislation, best 
practice guidance and the Group’s 
strategic position, the Committee has 
determined to carry out a tender process 
in 2018 with the aim of having a new firm 
in place to report on the 31 March 2019 
year end. Given their period of tenure 
as the incumbent auditor, Grant Thornton 
will not be included in this process. 
The proposed timeline for the tender 
process is set out below:
January 
2018
• Meet with a selection of audit 
firms to assess their proposed 
team and credentials. 
February  
2018
• Select a shortlist of firms  
and issue them the formal 
invitation to tender. 
• Provide detailed information 
and arrange for the firms 
to meet with management.
March 
2018
• Receive and evaluate the 
tender documents and 
presentations. 
• Audit and Risk Committee to 
submit their recommendation 
for Board approval. 
April/May 
2018
• Arrange for the new firm to 
shadow Grant Thornton’s audit 
of the 31 March 2018 year end.
July 2018 • Seek shareholder approval 
at the 2018 AGM of the 
formal appointment of the 
new auditor.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
At the Annual General Meeting to 
be held on 13 July 2017 the following 
resolutions relating to the Auditor 
are being proposed: 
• The re-appointment of Grant Thornton 
UK LLP as Independent Auditor; and
• To authorise the Directors to set the 
remuneration of the Independent Auditor.
I hope that Shareholders will support 
the Committee and vote in favour of 
these resolutions.

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 79 DEAR SHAREHOLDER, 
I am pleased to present the Remuneration 
Committee’s Report on Directors’ 
remuneration for the year to 31 March 
2017. This report has been approved 
by the Board of Helical plc.
This Directors’ Remuneration Report 
has been divided into the following 
three sections:
• This Annual Statement;
• Remuneration Policy Report, which sets 
out the Group’s shareholder approved 
policy on the remuneration of Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors; and,
• Annual Report on Remuneration, which 
discloses how the remuneration policy 
was implemented in the year ended 
31 March 2017 and how the policy 
will be operated in the year ending 
31 March 2018.
Following the changes made to the 
remuneration policy last year to reflect 
the reshaping of the Board and the 
Committee’s desire to simplify and reduce 
variable pay quantum and introduce 
additional shareholder protections, the 
Committee remains committed to its 
overall approach to Executive Directors’ 
remuneration of:
• Maintaining fixed remuneration packages 
below the median level of its peers; and,
• Aligning variable incentive-based bonus 
and share schemes with the long-term 
success of the Company and the 
interests of its Shareholders.
As such, no changes will be made to the 
remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM.
WORK OF THE COMMITTEE 
DURING THE YEAR
The Committee met five times during 
the year and a record of attendance at 
these meetings is shown on page 74.
In the year to 31 March 2017, the 
Committee completed its review of 
its remuneration policy in the light of 
the 2016 reshaping of the Board, the 
Executive Bonus Plan 2011 reaching the 
end of its shareholder approved life at 
the end of the previous financial period 
and a desire to acknowledge sensitivities 
surrounding executive pay. At the 2016 
AGM, shareholders approved an amended 
Helical Annual Bonus Scheme 2016, 
which removed potential additional bonus 
awards of 300% of salary in 2017 and 
2022 which would have been available 
under the previous scheme, and 
introduced additional shareholder 
protections and an updated Remuneration 
Policy. In addition, the Committee 
considered a number of other matters 
during the financial year as follows:
• New service contracts were introduced 
for all Executive Directors, which 
included a reduction in notice periods 
from 12 to six months. These contracts 
came into effect on 25 July 2016;
• The bonuses payable under the terms 
of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 
for the year to 31 March 2016 were 
finalised. Two thirds of these bonuses 
were paid in cash in June 2016, and one 
third in deferred shares to be held for 
a minimum of three years;
• The final bonuses payable in 
accordance with the terms of the 
Executive Bonus Plan 2011 were paid in 
June 2016 for the year to 31 March 2016;
• The three year performance conditions 
in respect of the share awards granted in 
2013 under the Performance Share Plan 
2004 were considered. The performance 
conditions were fully satisfied and, 
therefore, 100% of shares vested;
• The terms of unvested PSP awards 
held by Michael Slade were amended 
to reduce the awards to reflect the 
proportion of the vesting period served 
as an Executive Director;
• The Committee resolved in June 2016 to 
make an award of shares under the terms 
of the 2014 Performance Share Plan 
which is expected to vest in June 2019, 
subject to performance conditions; 
• Changes to the basic salaries of the 
Executive Directors, as noted below, 
were approved; and
• The fees paid to the Chairman were 
reviewed in March 2017 and no increase 
was awarded. For completeness,

performance periods.
PERFORMANCE
As noted in the Strategic Report on 
pages 2 to 63, the Group has delivered 
an increase in EPRA net assets per share 
of 3.7% (2016: 18.4%) in the year under 
review with a CAGR over the three years 
to 31 March 2017 of 14.8% (2016: 20.0%). 
The Group’s total portfolio return, as 
reported by IPD was 9.4% (2016: 21.7%). 
Pre-tax profits of the Group, before 
performance related awards, were 
£49m (2016: £129m).
REWARD
Basic Salaries
In the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report 
I reported on changes to the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy which were approved 
by shareholders at the 2016 AGM. Included 
in these changes was an indication that 
Gerald Kaye’s salary would be increased to 
£515,000, a level £20,800 below that of his 
predecessor. In addition, Duncan Walker’s 
salary would be increased to that of 
Matthew Bonning-Snook. It was noted that 
both increases would be implemented over 
a two year period with the final increase 
effective from 1 April 2017 and would be 
subject to the satisfactory performance 
of the two Directors in that period. In 
March 2017, the Remuneration Committee 
reviewed the performance of both Gerald 
Kaye and Duncan Walker and was satisfied 
that the final increases to the targeted 
salary levels should be implemented 
with effect from 1 April 2017. It is expected 
that future increases will be linked to RPI. 
The salaries of Matthew Bonning-Snook 
and Tim Murphy were increased by 3.1%, 
reflecting RPI to 31 March 2017. The salaries 
of all other staff were also reviewed and 
increased by an average of 6.7%. All 
increases were effective from 1 April 2017.
Annual Bonus Scheme 2016
Subsequent to the year end, and in 
accordance with the rules of the Helical 
Annual Bonus Scheme 2016, cash and 
deferred shares have been approved for 
inclusion in the financial statements for 
the year to 31 March 2017. For the relevant 
participants, these are 50% of what would 
have been payable under the Annual 
Bonus Scheme 2012, should its final year 
have been implemented. Details of these 
annual bonus awards are disclosed in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance Share Plan 2014
Share awards made in 2014 under the 
terms of the 2014 Performance Share Plan 
(“PSP”) were subject to three performance 
conditions over the three years to 31 March 
2017. One third of the awards were based 
on absolute net asset value performance, 
the second third of the awards were based 
on a comparison of the Group’s portfolio 
return to the IPD Total Return index and 
the final third of the awards were based 
on a comparison of the Group’s Total 
Shareholder Return to a basket of 
companies in the Real Estate Super Sector. 
The performance criteria were measured 
at the end of the three year period and 
both of the net asset value and IPD 
conditions were met in full. The TSR 
conditions were not met and consequently 
66.7% of the awards are expected to vest 
in July 2017.
Remuneration Policy for the Year  
to 31 March 2018
The Committee is committed to ensuring 
that its remuneration policy remains 
aligned to the long-term interests of 
shareholders - incentivising management 
to increase total returns and growing net 
asset value per share - whilst ensuring 
that an appropriate balance is maintained 
between the targets set for management 
and the risk profile of the Group. The 
Committee believes it has struck the 
right balance between fixed annual 
remuneration and an incentive structure 
with challenging targets which seek to 
reward outperformance with a mixture 
of cash-based bonus payments and 
longer term share awards. 
Further details of the proposed 
implementation of the remuneration 
policy for the year to 31 March 2018 
can be found on pages 92 to 94. 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
The Company’s Remuneration Policy was 
approved at the 2016 AGM with over 97% 
of shareholders voting in favour of the 
new arrangements. We are not proposing 
any changes this year but, for reference 
purposes only, include the full policy 
for shareholders on pages 82 to 86. 
At the 2017 AGM to be held on 13 July 
2017, a resolution in respect of the 
Annual Statement and Annual Report 
on Remuneration for the year to 31 March 
2017 is being proposed. I trust that 
shareholders will support the Committee 
and vote in favour of this resolution.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 81 The Report of the Remuneration Committee has been 
prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (the “Regulations”). The Company’s 
remuneration policy follows the principles and guidelines 
of the Listing Rules and the UK Corporate Governance 
Code as they relate to directors’ remuneration.
The Company’s Remuneration Policy Report was approved 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 
25 July 2016 for a maximum period of three years. No 
changes are proposed for the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
This section of the Remuneration Report sets out the 
remuneration policy of the Group. The Committee believes 
that the policy continues to support the Group’s strategy 
and is aligned with Shareholders’ interests. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
Helical’s approach to the remuneration of its Executive 
Directors is to provide a basic remuneration package below 
the median level of its peers within the listed real estate sector 
(the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index, excluding 
storage companies, agencies and companies run by external 
investment managers) combined with an incentive based bonus 
and share scheme structure aligned with the interests of its 
shareholders. The majority of performance based awards 
are judged on the absolute performance of the Group through 
its profitability and growth in net asset value per share. The 
remaining awards are judged on the relative performance of 
the Group’s real estate portfolio and its total shareholder return 
against appropriate industry benchmarks. Remuneration within 
the real estate sector is monitored and reviewed regularly to 
ensure that the Group’s positioning of its remuneration remains 
in line with these objectives. In addition to this external view, 
the Committee also monitors the remuneration levels of senior 
management below Board level and the remuneration of other 
employees to ensure that these are taken into account in 
determining the remuneration of Executive Directors. It also 
considers environmental, social, governance and risk issues.
In determining such policy, the Committee takes into account 
all factors which it deems necessary. The objective of the 
remuneration policy is to ensure that Executive Directors and 
senior management are provided with appropriate incentives 
to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and 
responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions 
to the success of the Group. Within the terms of the agreed policy 
the Committee shall determine, for the Executive Directors:
• The total individual remuneration packages of each Executive 
Director including, where appropriate, basic salaries, bonuses, 
share awards, and other benefits;
• Targets and hurdles for any performance related remuneration 
schemes; and,
• Service agreements incorporating termination payments 
and compensation commitments.

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 83 HOW EMPLOYEE PAY IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT  
AND COMPARED TO THE REMUNERATION POLICY  
OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
All permanent employees of the Group, including Executive 
Directors, receive a basic remuneration package including  
basic salary, private medical cover, permanent health insurance, 
life assurance and membership of the Share Incentive Plan.  
In addition, Directors and senior management are entitled to  
the use of company cars or the payment of a car allowance  
and a car fuel allowance. There is no Group pension scheme  
for Directors and no contributions are payable into Directors’ 
own pension schemes. For all permanent employees below 
Board level, the Company pays pension contributions of either 
7.5% or 10.0% into either a Group Pension Scheme or individual 
employees’ own pension scheme. Whilst employees below 
Board level are not entitled to participate in the Annual Bonus 
Scheme, discretionary bonuses are paid to employees on  
an individual basis depending on their performance and 
contribution. The Performance Share Plan is available to 
all employees but is primarily utilised to incentivise 
Executive Directors and senior management. An HMRC  
approved Share Option Scheme is available for the Committee 
to grant options to those who do not receive awards under  
the Performance Share Plan. Consequently, Directors are  
not granted awards under this scheme. In determining  
executive remuneration, the Committee considers the overall 
remuneration of all the Group’s employees and, other than in 
exceptional circumstances, seeks to award increases in salaries 
at levels below those made to other staff and within its own 
guidelines. The remaining remuneration is weighted towards 
performance related awards. The Committee does not  
consult with its employees when drawing up the Group’s 
remuneration policy.
PERFORMANCE METRICS
The performance metrics used in the Annual Bonus Scheme 
and the Long Term Incentives Plan are aligned with the Group’s 
Key Performance Indicators, discussed on pages 20 to 21.
The Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 is a profit sharing model 
which takes the results of the Company, including valuation 
movements on its property portfolio, and, after charging all 
finance costs, non-performance related administration costs 
and a charge for the use of the Group’s equity (initially set at 
7% but subject to regular review), allocates the net results into 
a profit pool for payment to participants with maximum limits, 
deferral, clawback and other shareholder protections. The 
scheme is open to all Executive Directors.
Long-term incentives, awarded in accordance with the rules of 
the 2014 PSP, are subject to an absolute net asset value growth 
test, a relative performance metric based on the performance of 
the Group’s property portfolio compared to an IPD index and a 
relative performance metric based on Total Shareholder Return.
RECRUITMENT POLICY
In considering the structure of the Board, the balance between Executive Directors and independent Non-Executive Directors 
and the skills, knowledge and experience required to ensure the Board functions in accordance with the Group’s objectives, the 
Committee will seek to apply the following principles in relation to the remuneration of new directors, whether by internal promotion 
or external appointment:
Element Policy
Salary The salary of newly appointed Executive Directors would reflect the individual’s experience and skills, and 
be targeted below the median of appropriate sector comparables, taking into account internal comparisons. 
On initial appointment, salaries would generally be set at a level lower than benchmarked for that role to 
allow for pay increases to market levels subject to satisfactory progress and contribution.
Benefits Benefits would be as are currently provided and periodically reviewed, being car or car allowance, 
car fuel allowance, private medical cover, permanent health insurance and life assurance.
Pension There is no Group pension scheme for Directors and no contributions are payable to Directors’ own 
pension schemes.
Annual bonus Annual bonus arrangements under the terms of the 2016 Annual Bonus Scheme will be made in accordance 
with the terms of that scheme, with the Committee retaining the right to pro-rata any bonus payable in respect 
of the year of appointment.
Long-term incentives Annual awards under the terms of the 2014 PSP will be made in accordance with the terms of that Plan.
Share Incentive Plan In line with that of existing Executive Directors.
Buy-out awards Should it be deemed necessary to compensate a new director for loss of bonus or incentives from a previous 
employer, the Committee may structure the remuneration of such director to buy-out any such bonus or 
incentives on a like-for-like basis in respect of currency (ie cash versus shares), timing and performance targets. 
Where possible such buy-out will be structured within the Company’s existing incentive arrangements but 
the Committee has the discretion to implement the exemption under rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules.
Non-Executive Directors Newly appointed Non-Executive Directors will be paid fees at a level consistent with existing Non-Executive 
Directors. Fees would be paid pro-rata in the year of appointment.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED LEAVER POLICY
On termination of employment each Director may be entitled to 
a payment in lieu of notice of basic salary and other contractual 
entitlements ie provision of a car, health and life insurance etc. 
The Group may make payments in lieu of notice as one lump 
sum or in instalments, at its own discretion. If the Group chooses 
to pay in instalments the Director is obliged to seek alternative 
income over the relevant period and to disclose the amount to 
the Group. Instalment payments will be reduced by any 
alternative income.
Under the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016, participants shall not 
normally be entitled to receive any distribution under the 
scheme following cessation and shall immediately cease to have 
any interests, benefits, rights and/or entitlements under the 
scheme howsoever arising on the date of such cessation except 
where good leaver status applies (ie death; injury, disability; 
redundancy; retirement; sale or transfer of employing company 
or business outside of the Group or any other reason permitted 
by the Committee). For good leavers, individuals would cease 
to accrue future amounts into the Bonus Award Pool although 
would continue to receive deferred share awards and any 
remaining amounts held in the Bonus Award Pool for a period 
of two years after cessation.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director 
under the Group’s share plans will be determined based on the 
relevant plan rules. For awards granted under the 2014 PSP, 
awards held by good leavers will vest on the normal vesting date 
subject to performance conditions and time pro-rating, unless 
the Committee determines that awards should vest at cessation 
and/or time pro-rating should not apply.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by a Letter of 
Appointment and their remuneration is determined by the 
Board. Current Letters of Appointment, setting out the terms 
of appointment, operate from 1 April 2015 or, if later, the date 
of appointment. The appointment of Non-Executive Directors 
is terminable on three months’ notice. Non-Executive Directors 
are not eligible to participate in any new share awards made 
under the terms of the Group’s bonus or share award schemes. 
In exceptional circumstances, where an Executive Director 
becomes a Non-Executive Director eg Michael Slade becoming 
Chairman in 2016, ongoing participation in awards previously 
made in bonus and share schemes will be subject to the rules 
of those schemes and will be subject to the discretion of 
the Committee.

SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
Directors will not normally be permitted to sell shares received 
through the 2014 PSP, other than to meet taxation (and national 
insurance contributions) liabilities, for at least two years and until 
they own shares to the value of 300% (increased from 200%) 
of basic salary for Executive Directors and 100% of salary for 
other Senior Management.
ALIGNMENT WITH SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS
The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential 
gains that may be made by Executives (Directors and those 
below Board level) through the 2014 PSP and other incentive 
arrangements currently in place. It has concluded that the 
share of the increase in the value of the Group (measured as 
the increase in the net asset value, before incentives, plus cash 
returned as dividends to shareholders) that could accrue to all 
Executives through the Group’s long and short-term incentive 
and bonus plans at the point at which the maximum awards vest 
over the term of the plans might be of the order of 20%. At this 
point, in absolute terms, the Group will have increased its triple 
net asset value by at least 15% pa with the Group’s relative 
performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD and Total 
Shareholder Return, over each three year period.
REWARD SCENARIOS
The charts below show how the composition of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration packages varies at three performance 
levels, namely, at minimum (ie fixed pay), target (assumed to 
be 50% of the maximum incentive levels) and maximum levels, 
under the policy set out in the table overleaf.
The chart is based on:
• Salary levels effective 1 April 2017;
• An approximated annual value of benefits (no pension 
is provided);
• A 300% of salary maximum annual bonus for the CEO 
and other directors and 200% for the Finance Director 
(with target assumed to be 50% of the maximum);
• A 300% of salary award under the 2014 PSP in line with 
the normal maximum award (with target assumed to be 
50% of the maximum); and
• No share price appreciation in respect of deferred bonus 
and PSP awards has been assumed.

HELICAL ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME 2016
The Helical Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 was approved by 
shareholders at the 2016 AGM. This scheme provides annual 
cash bonuses based on the performance of the Group’s 
property portfolio and is aligned with shareholders’ interests 
through a profit sharing model, with appropriate hurdles and 
shareholder protections (including deferral and clawback). Total 
2016 Bonus Scheme bonuses have been accrued in the financial 
statements for the year to 31 March 2017 and the cash element 
will be payable in June 2017. 
The main features of the 2016 Bonus Scheme as applied to the 
year to 31 March 2017 were as follows:
• The scheme participants were Gerald Kaye, Tim Murphy, 
Matthew Bonning-Snook and Duncan Walker. Former Director, 
Jack Pitman, remained eligible for a bonus in respect of the 
bonus pool carried forward from 31 March 2015 in the Annual 
Bonus Scheme 2012; 
• The Bonus Pool carried forward at 31 March 2016 in respect 
of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 was rolled into the Annual 
Bonus Scheme 2016. The Bonus Pool transferred to the new 
scheme of £24.0m was reduced by £10.5m as the result of 
additional shareholder protections introduced into the 
new scheme;
• All property assets held during the year were allocated to 
the ‘Profit Pool’;
• Investment assets were included at valuation as at 31 March 
2016 with subsequent valuation movements increasing or 
decreasing the size of the Profit Pool. Development assets 
were also included at valuation as at 31 March 2016 with 
subsequent valuation movements increasing or decreasing 
the size of the Profit Pool;
• Development profits, development management fees, 
net rents, other income and profits/losses on the sale 
of property assets were allocated to the Profit Pool; and,
• Profits in the Profit Pool were eligible for the award of 
bonuses once they were sufficient to exceed the recovery 
of all related finance costs, a charge for the use of the 
Company’s equity at an initial rate of 7% (reviewed regularly 
to reflect any changes in the risk profile of the Company’s 
activities), the Group’s total administrative costs (excluding 
performance related remuneration) and any unallocated losses 
from the previous three financial years.
SHAREHOLDER PROTECTIONS 
• No more than 10% of profits were available to participants for 
distribution (“Bonus Award Pool”) at the end of the relevant 
financial year;
• The distribution of the Bonus Award Pools to participants  
was restricted to 200% of salary for Tim Murphy and 300% for 
each of the other scheme participants. Any excess is deferred 
and carried forward to the subsequent year to form part 
of the Bonus Award Pool for up to a maximum of the next 
two years;
• Two thirds of any payment is to be paid in cash in June 2017 and 
one third is deferred for three years into Helical plc shares; and
• Other shareholder protections as noted on page 93 in respect 
of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016.

in accordance with the terms of the 2004 PSP, had increased by 22.2% pa. During this three year period the total return of Helical’s 
property portfolio, as determined by IPD, was 22.0% compared to the upper quantile of the IPD Benchmark which showed a return 
of 15.7%. Therefore, 100% of the shares vested. The share price used to calculate the expected value at vesting for the 2013 PSP 
awards was 398.75p (based on the average share price over the three months to 31 March 2016). The actual share prices at vesting

PAYMENTS TO FORMER DIRECTORS - DEPARTURE OF JACK PITMAN 
Jack Pitman stepped down from the Board on 13 February 2015 and ceased employment on 31 March 2015. No payments in respect 
of salary and car allowance were made after 31 March 2015 although in line with his termination arrangements, Jack Pitman’s Group 
health insurance continued until the end of the policy in October 2015. 
In respect of his incentives, it was determined by the Remuneration Committee that Jack Pitman should be treated as a Good 
Leaver for the purposes of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 and his outstanding PSP awards. 
In accordance with his Good Leaver status, he ceased to accrue future amounts under the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 from 
cessation of his employment but was entitled to his share of the balance remaining in that scheme at 31 March 2015 for a further 
two years in line with the plan rules, subject to offset of future losses and clawback. Any final payment under the terms of this 
scheme is expected to be paid in June 2017 and will be disclosed in the 2018 Annual Report. 
The 2013 PSP (granted under the 2004 PSP) vested in full. The value of this award, pro-rated for time, was £943,795. The 2014 PSP 
award (granted under the 2014 PSP) is expected to vest in July 2017 and its estimated value, based on the average share price over 
the three months to 31 March 2017 of 303.17p and the expected vesting of 66% of the shares originally awarded and time pro-rated,  
is £183,000. No further payments are to be made to Jack Pitman in respect of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 or the Performance 
Share Plan 2014 other than those referred to above.

THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2018
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ BASIC ANNUAL SALARY 
AND BENEFITS-IN-KIND 
The basic package of salary and benefits is designed to match 
the experience and responsibilities of each Director and is 
reviewed annually to ensure that it is consistent with and 
appropriate to their responsibilities and expectations. The Group 
does not provide any separate pension provision for Executive 
Directors and expects individuals to provide for their retirement 
through their basic salaries and incentive payments. Executive 
Directors’ basic annual salaries at 31 March 2017 and increases 
from 1 April 2017 are as follows:

Matthew Bonning-Snook 388,600 12,000 400,600
Duncan Walker 357,000 43,600 400,600
The Committee’s policy in respect of basic salaries is that 
they should be reviewed annually and increased to reflect an 
appropriate level of inflation (being linked to the Retail Price 
Index) or greater to reflect increases in the scale, scope or 
responsibility of their roles or to allow recently appointed 
Executives to move to market norms as their experience and 
contributions increase. 
Consistent with the disclosure set out on page 97 of last year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report surrounding Gerald Kaye’s 
promotion to Chief Executive, and reflecting the Committee’s 
positive assessment of personal performance over this period, 
the Committee determined that it was appropriate to award 
the second stage of his two-year salary adjustment from 
1 April 2017. As such, Gerald Kaye’s basic salary was increased 
from £475,000 to £515,000 pa from 1 April 2017 as planned. 
The adjusted salary remains £20,800 below that of the 
previous Chief Executive’s salary. 
Also consistent with the disclosures set out in last year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, the second stage of Duncan 
Walker’s basic salary increase to reflect his increased 
responsibilities was approved following the Committee’s positive 
assessment of personal performance. As such, Duncan Walker’s 
basic salary was increased from £357,000 to £400,600 on 
1 April 2017 (the same level as Matthew Bonning-Snook). 
Following completion of these planned changes, subsequent 
increases for all Executive Directors are expected to be limited 
to inflationary increases each year.
In addition to these two changes, the Committee has 
determined that the basic salaries for the remaining two 
Executive Directors should increase by 3.1%, being the increase 
in RPI to 31 March 2017, from 1 April 2017, compared to an 
average 6.7% awarded to other employees. 
BENEFITS-IN-KIND 
Benefits-in-kind provided to Executive Directors comprise the 
provision of a company car or car allowance, car fuel, private 
medical cover, permanent health insurance, life insurance and 
participation in the Company’s Share Incentive Plan. There is 
no Group pension scheme for Directors and no contributions 
will be paid by the Group to the Directors’ own pension schemes. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ FEES
No increases to Non-Executive Directors’ annual fees were 
awarded from 1 April 2017. Current fees are as follows:

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED ANNUAL BONUSES
HELICAL ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME 2016
Gerald Kaye, Tim Murphy, Matthew Bonning-Snook and Duncan 
Walker will participate in the Helical Annual Bonus Scheme 2016, 
which was approved by Shareholders at the 2016 AGM. This 
scheme provides annual bonuses based on the performance of 
the Group’s property portfolio and is aligned with shareholders’ 
interests through a profit sharing model, with appropriate hurdles 
and shareholder protections (including deferral and clawback). 
The main features of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 
as applied to the year to 31 March 2018, are as follows:
• All property assets held at 1 April 2017 will be included 
in the Profit Pool;
• Investment assets will be included at valuation as at 31 March 
2017 with subsequent valuation movements increasing or 
decreasing the size of the Profit Pool. Development assets will 
be included at valuation as at 31 March 2017 with subsequent 
valuation movements increasing or decreasing the size of 
the Profit Pool;
• Development profits, development management fees, net 
rents, other income and profits/losses on the sale of property 
assets will be allocated to the Profit Pool; and,
• Profits in the Profit Pool will be eligible for the award of 
bonuses once they are sufficient to exceed the recovery of 
all related finance costs, a charge for the use of the Company’s 
equity at a rate of 7% (reviewed regularly to reflect any 
changes in the risk profile of the Company’s activities), and 
the Group’s total administrative costs (excluding performance 
related remuneration).
SHAREHOLDER PROTECTIONS 
• No more than 10% of profits will be available to participants 
for distribution (“Bonus Award Pool”) at the end of the relevant 
financial year;
• The distribution of the Bonus Award Pool to participants will 
be restricted in any financial year to 300% of salary (200% for 
Tim Murphy). Any excess is deferred and carried forward to 
the subsequent year to form part of the Bonus Award Pool 
for the subsequent two year(s);
• A maximum of 6.5 times the aggregate Executive Director 
salary pool may be carried forward to form part of the Bonus 
Award Pool for the subsequent year;
• A maximum of two thirds of any payment is made in cash 
after the relevant financial year end and a minimum of one 
third is deferred for three years into Helical plc shares;
• No payments will be made where the Company has not 
generated a profit (amounts will be deferred until a profit 
is generated). In addition, the Remuneration Committee 
will retain discretion to increase the deferred share amount 
(up to 100% of the payment) or not to make a payment at 
all (with any amounts reverting back to the Company rather 
than remaining in the Bonus Award Pool) where it is 
considered appropriate to do so;
• Net losses will be carried forward for offset against future 
net profits. Carry forward of losses will be for a minimum 
of two years, subject to extension at the request of the 
Remuneration Committee;
• The scheme operates a clawback provision whereby amounts 
deferred, amounts held in Bonus Award Pools or the net of tax 
amounts paid may be recovered in the event of a misstatement 
of results, an error being made in assessing the calculation of 
Bonus Award Pools or in the event of gross misconduct; and,
• The share of any increase in value of the Company (measured 
as the increase in net asset value plus cash returned as 
dividends) that could accrue to all Executives through the 
Group’s long and short-term incentive and bonus plans at 
maximum vesting/payouts during the lifetime of the plans 
will continue to be no more than 20%.
OTHER MATTERS
• Awards may be satisfied through shares purchased in the 
market or by new issue or treasury shares. Where new issue 
or treasury shares are used, the standard 5% in ten year 
dilution limit will apply; and
• On a change of control of the Company, any amounts accrued 
over the financial year up to the relevant date, and any 
amounts held within the Bonus Award Pools will be paid out, 
subject to a cap on those awards of 600% of basic salary, 
and any deferred shares would vest immediately.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN 2014
It is anticipated that long-term incentives will be granted to 
all Executive Directors and senior management in June 2017 
in the form of nil cost options awarded under the terms of 
the 2014 PSP Scheme. For Executive Directors the awards 
will be granted at 300% of base salary as at 31 March 2017. 
Awards will normally vest no earlier than the third anniversary 
of their grant to the extent that the applicable performance 
conditions (see below) have been satisfied and the participant 
is still employed by the Group. Once exercisable, awards will 
remain capable of exercise for a period of normally no more 
than six months.
Performance conditions for the awards to be granted in 2017 
will be equally weighted and measured over the three years 
to 31 March 2020 as follows:

Share awards will lapse in full where:
• Net asset value per share (having added back dividends) 
does not increase over the three year performance period; or
• The gross return falls below the IPD median, the growth in 
triple net asset value is below 7.5% pa and relative TSR is below 
median over the three year period.
OTHER REMUNERATION MATTERS 
SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE AND TOTAL  
SHAREHOLDER RETURN 
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2017 was

in the three, eight and ten years to 31 March 2017 compared to

EIGHT YEARS TO 31 MARCH 2017 
The base position at 31 March 2009, from which subsequent 
performance is measured as required by the Regulations, 
is the nearest accounting period end to the bottom of the 
last property cycle. Helical’s share price at that date was 
287.50 per share, a small premium to the EPRA net asset value 
per share of 286.00p per share. The Company’s share price, at 
that stage, had not fallen as much as the average of the FTSE 
350 Super-Sector Real Estate Index and remained at a premium 
until 2012. The subsequent performance of the Company’s 
TSR reflects the relatively higher base position of Helical’s 
share price.
TEN YEARS TO 31 MARCH 2017 
The ten years to 31 March 2017 covers the end of the previous 
property cycle, the impact of the Financial Crisis of 2008 and 
the subsequent economic recovery and the impact of the 
decision of the UK to leave the European Union in June 2016. 
The graph below shows that Helical’s share price remained at 
a premium to NAV per share until 2012, following which it fell 
to a low of 164.00p before recovering and growing to 474.75p 
at 31 December 2015. Since then the share price has fallen to a 
low of 230.00p before increasing to 313.25p at 31 March 2017.

CONTINUED ADVISORS TO THE COMMITTEE
The Committee consults the Chief Executive and Finance Director about its proposals and has access to professional advice 
from independent remuneration consultants to help it determine appropriate remuneration arrangements. During the year the 
Committee reviewed the provision of remuneration advice by the consultants and appointed FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP 
(FIT) to replace New Bridge Street (NBS) in February 2017. Terms of reference for the remuneration consultants, which provided 
no other services to the Company, are available from the Company Secretary on request. Fees paid to FIT from appointment to

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Group’s corporate governance policies, compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and Going Concern statement 
are set out in the Governance Review on pages 72 to 75.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Under the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), Directors are subject 
to a statutory duty to avoid a situation where they have, or can 
have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the interests of the Company. As is permissible 
under the Act, the Company’s Articles of Association allow the 
Board to consider, and if it sees fit, to authorise situations where 
a Director has an interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, 
with the interests of the Company. Directors are required to 
notify the Company of any conflict or potential conflict of 
interest under an established procedure and any conflicts 
or potential conflicts are noted at each Board meeting.
DIRECTORS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY
The Company maintains Directors and Officers Liability 
Insurance. To the extent permitted by UK Law, the Company 
also indemnifies the Directors against claims made against them 
as a consequence of the execution of their duties as Directors 
of the Company. 
POLITICAL DONATIONS
The Company’s policy with regard to political donations is to 
ensure that shareholder approval is sought before making any 
such payments. No shareholder approval has been sought and, 
accordingly, the Company made no political donations in the 
year to 31 March 2017. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CAPITALISED INTEREST 
AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE SCHEMES
The information required in respect of financial instruments, 
as required by Schedule 7 of the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 is shown in note 34.
Interest capitalised on the Group property portfolio is shown 
in notes 14 and 19. Long-term incentive schemes are explained 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 80 to 97. 
CHANGE OF CONTROL 
Certain agreements between the Company or its subsidiaries 
and entities including lending banks, joint venture partners 
and development partners contain termination rights to take

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 99 The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Strategic Report, Governance and the Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have to prepare the financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and 
profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements and the Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that:
• so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Auditors 
are aware of that information.
The Directors consider the Annual Report and the financial 
statements, taken as a whole, provides the information necessary 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and 
strategy and is fair, balanced and understandable.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Annual Report including the Strategic Report, includes 
a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT AUDIT RISK HOW WE RESPONDED TO THE RISK
Revenue recognition
The risk: The revenue cycle includes fraudulent transactions.
Under International Standard on Auditing (UK and Ireland) 
240 ‘The auditor’s responsibilities relating to fraud in an audit 
of financial statements’, there is a presumed risk that revenue 
may be misstated owing to the improper recognition of 
revenue. The group has complex contracts for which the 
timing and quantum of revenue recognition require the 
exercise of management judgement.
Dependent upon the nature of the contract, this risk applies to 
development property profit, share of results of joint ventures 
and net gain on sale and revaluation of investment properties. 
We therefore identified revenue recognition as a risk requiring 
special audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• evaluating the Group’s revenue recognition policies to 
confirm that they comply with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
and have been applied consistently;
• agreeing, on a sample basis, net rental income to managing 
agents’ reports and the underlying lease agreements;
• testing all investment property and residential unit sales 
and profits in retirement villages, and development 
property sales and profits on a sample basis, to completion 
statements and proceeds received; and 
• assessing the appropriateness of judgements exercised 
by management in respect of complex contracts.
The Group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition 
is shown in note 37 and related disclosures regarding 
revenues and profits are included in notes 2,3,4,5 and 18. 
The Audit and Risk Committee identified revenue recognition 
as a significant issue in its report on pages 78 and 79, where 
the Committee also described the action that it has taken 
to address this issue. 
Our findings: Based on our audit work, we are satisfied, 
that the judgements made, and assumptions used by 
management in determining the revenue recognised, 
were balanced and supported by the evidence obtained 
from our testing.
OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
IS UNMODIFIED
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 
2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
WHO WE ARE REPORTING TO
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
Helical plc’s financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2017 comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated 
and Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated and 
Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the 
related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
• Overall group materiality: £12.7m, which represents 1% 
of the Group’s total assets;
• In addition, we applied lower materiality of £2m, to all income 
statement items above operating profit excluding share of joint 
ventures’ gain or loss on investment properties, net gain on 
sale and revaluation of investment properties and impairment 
of available for sale investments, based on 5% of profit before 
tax for the year;
• We performed full scope audit procedures at all material 
locations; and
• Key audit risks were identified as revenue recognition and 
investment property valuation.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISK
In arriving at our opinions set out in this report, we highlight 
the following risks that, in our judgement, had the greatest 
effect on our audit: 
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 102
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF HELICAL PLC AUDIT RISK HOW WE RESPONDED TO THE RISK
Investment property valuation
The risk: Investment properties with a fair value of £1,003m 
are not valued appropriately.
Investment property is held at fair value under International 
Accounting Standard (IAS) 40. The fair value of all of the 
Group’s investment properties is determined based on 
level 3 fair value inputs as defined by IFRS 13 ‘Fair value 
measurement’, which means that the inputs used in valuing 
investment properties are unobservable and are therefore 
subject to estimation. In determining a property’s valuation 
the valuers take into account property specific information 
such as the current tenancy agreements and rental income. 
They apply assumptions for yields and estimated market 
rent, which are influenced by prevailing market yields and 
comparable market transactions, to arrive at the final 
valuation. For developments classified as investment 
properties, the residual appraisal method is used, by 
estimating the fair value of the completed project less 
estimated costs to complete. We therefore identified 
investment property valuation as a risk requiring special 
audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• examining the qualifications and experience of the Group’s 
independent external valuers and whether the basis of 
their valuations was consistent with the RICS “red book” 
as required by IAS 40; 
• evaluating evidence of the reliability of valuation estimations 
by comparing the historical trend of investment property 
sales with the related carrying values; 
• obtaining the information provided by management 
to the independent valuers to confirm it was consistent 
with information obtained during our audit; 
• analysis of year on year valuation movements including 
discussion of any outliers with both management and 
the independent valuers; 
• benchmarking, for outlier properties identified by the 
analysis above, valuation yields used in the external 
valuations to yields for comparable published market data 
and seeking further corroboration for those that fall outside 
a pre-determined range; 
• discussions with the independent valuers used to 
understand, and assess the appropriateness of the 
estimates, assumptions and valuation methodology 
used; and 
• ensuring that valuations are reviewed and approved 
by the Valuations Committee through review of minutes 
and discussions with the Chair of the Committee.
The Group’s accounting policy on investment properties 
is shown in note 37 and related disclosures are included 
in note 14. The Audit and Risk Committee identified 
investment property valuation as a significant issue in 
its report on pages 78 and 79, where the Committee also 
described the action that it has taken to address this issue.
Our findings: We were satisfied that:
• investment property valuations were made by suitably 
qualified independent valuers using information provided 
by management that is consistent with information 
obtained during our audit; and 
• the judgements made, and assumptions used by, the 
valuers in determining the investment property valuations 
were balanced and supported by the evidence obtained 
from our testing. 
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 103 OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN OVERVIEW 
OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of that work. 
We determined materiality for the audit of the Group financial 
statements as a whole to be £12.7m, which is 1% of the Group’s 
total assets (1% of the Group’s net assets in the year ended 
31 March 2016). We concluded that determining materiality 
based on the Group’s total assets most appropriately reflects 
the ownership and valuation of investment properties of interest 
to the users of the financial statements, which is a key area 
of audit focus. 
In addition, we applied lower materiality of £2m to all 
consolidated income statement items above operating profit 
excluding share of joint ventures’ gain or loss on investment 
properties, net gain on sale and revaluation of investment 
properties and impairment of available for sale investments, 
based on 5% of the Group’s profit before tax for the year. 
We believe misstatement of these specific income statement 
items of a lesser amount than materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole could reasonably be expected to 
influence the Company’s members’ assessment of the financial 
performance of the Group. We also apply a lower level 
of specific materiality for certain areas such as Directors’ 
remuneration and related party transactions. 
We use a different level of materiality, performance materiality, 
to drive the extent of our testing and this was set at 75% of 
financial statement materiality for the audit of the Group 
financial statements. 
We determined the threshold at which we will communicate 
misstatements to the Audit and Risk Committee to be £625,000 
(except that all misstatements of Directors’ remuneration and 
related party transactions are communicated). In addition 
we communicate misstatements below that threshold that, 
in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
A description of the generic scope of an audit of financial 
statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (ISAs) (UK and Ireland). Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the “Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit” 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with those Ethical Standards.
In order to address the audit risks described above, as identified 
during our planning procedures, we performed a full scope audit 
of the financial statements of the Parent Company, Helical plc, 
and of the financial information of all the Group’s operations. 
For Group reporting purposes a group materiality is adopted for 
all subsidiary entities within the Group, unless there are specific 
reasons for adopting an entity materiality, for example where 
a subsidiary is partially owned by a third party. There are no 
separate Group components subject to audit by auditors 
other than the Group audit team.

the Directors. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT 
BY EXCEPTION
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or

matters that were communicated to the Audit and Risk 
Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
We have nothing to report in respect of any of the above matters.

to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation in the Annual Report that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about 
whether they have considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
• the Directors’ explanation in the Annual Report as to how they 
have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions. 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

What we are responsible for:
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

instruments. The measurement bases and principal accounting policies of the Group are set out in note 37. These accounting

Factors that may Affect Future Tax Charges
The tax charge is expected to be less than the full rate in future years, primarily due to the Group continuing to claim allowances 
in respect of eligible expenditure on investment properties.

Deferred tax (liability)/asset (11,825) (5,768) 1,104 1,334
Under IAS 12, deferred tax provisions are made for the tax that would potentially be payable on the realisation of investment 
properties and other assets at book value. Other timing differences include deferred tax assets arising from the recognition of 
the fair value of derivative financial instruments and future tax relief available to the Group from capital allowances and when 
share awards vest. A debit of £2,062,000 (2016: £3,002,000) in respect of future tax relief for share awards has been recognised 
in reserves in accordance with IAS 12.
The Group contains entities with tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised. The total unrecognised losses amount 
to approximately £10,621,000 (2016: £9,026,000). A deferred tax asset has not been recognised because the entities in which 
the losses have been generated either do not have forecast taxable profits or the losses have restrictions whereby their utilisation 
is considered to be unlikely.
If upon sale of the investment properties the Group retained all the capital allowances, the deferred tax provision in respect 
of capital allowances of £2,969,000 (2016: £1,946,000) would be released and further capital allowances of £31,390,000 
(2016: £20,340,000) would be available to reduce future tax liabilities.
The net deferred tax asset in respect of other timing differences arises from tax relief available to the Group on the mark-to-market 
valuation of financial instruments, the future vesting of share awards and other timing differences.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. This is a different basis to the net asset per share calculations which 
are based on the number of shares at the year end. Shares held by the Helical Employees’ Share Ownership Plan Trust (the “ESOP”), 
which has waived its entitlement to receive dividends, are treated as cancelled for the purpose of this calculation.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares 
and the post tax effect of dividends on the assumed exercise of all dilutive options.
The EPRA earnings per share is calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the best practice recommendations of the European 
Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”).
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

Interest capitalised in respect of the refurbishment of investment properties is included in investment properties to the extent 
of £10,972,000 (2016: £6,571,000).
Investment properties with a total fair value of £993,900,000 (2016: £945,400,000) were held as security against borrowings.
All of the Group’s properties are level 3, as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 March 2017 
and there were no transfers between levels during the year. Level 3 inputs used in valuing the properties are those which are 
unobservable, as opposed to level 1 (inputs from quoted prices) and level 2 (observable inputs either directly, ie as prices, or 
indirectly, ie derived from prices).
Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances 
that caused the transfer. 
Valuation Methodology
The fair value of the Group’s investment property as at 31 March 2017 was determined by independent external valuers at that date, 
except for investment properties valued by the Directors. The valuations are in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation - Professional Standards (“The Red Book”) and the International Valuation Standards and were arrived 
at by reference to market transactions for similar properties. Fair values for investment properties are calculated using the present 
value income approach. The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile and yields as discussed below. 
A key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date. These determine the cash flow profile 
of the property for a number of years. The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental values to current market rent at the 
time of the next rent review (where a typical lease allows only for upward adjustment) and as leases expire and are replaced by new 
leases. The current market level of rent is assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions 
and negotiations. The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account 
other input assumptions such as vacancies and costs, generates the market value of the property. The equivalent yield applied is 
assessed by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes into account, amongst other things, any risks 
associated with the rent uplift assumptions.
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense 
check and to compare against market transactions for similar properties. The valuation output, along with inputs and assumptions, 
are reviewed to ensure these are in line with what a market participant would use when pricing each asset.
The reversionary yield is the return received from an asset once the estimated rental value has been captured on today’s 
assessment of market value.
There are interrelationships between all the inputs as they are determined by market conditions. The existence of an increase 
in more than one input would be to magnify the input on the valuation. The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the 
interrelationship of two inputs in opposite directions.
Details of the investment portfolio yields can be found on page 46 and in Appendix 5 of this report.
The graph below illustrates the sensitivity of the value of the investment portfolio to the reversionary yield.

*  Under the Barts Square joint venture agreement the Group is entitled to varying returns dependent upon the performance of the development. Whilst the Group holds a 
33.35% equity share in the Barts Square group, it has accounted for its share at 43.8% at the current and prior year end to reflect its expected economic interest in the joint 
venture. In the prior year, this had changed from the 33.35% interest shown at 31 March 2015, and resulted in a gain of £6,341,000 being recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the year to 31 March 2016 to reflect the Group’s increased share in the opening net assets of the joint venture.
The Directors’ valuation of trading and development stock shows a surplus of £7,500,000 (2016: £7,000,000) above book value.
Dividends of £1,580,000 were received from joint venture companies during the year (2016: £82,569,000). The joint venture 
companies are private companies, therefore no quoted market prices are available for their shares.
In the year ended 31 March 2016, Old Street Holdings LP sold its investments in 207 Old Street Unit Trust, 211 Old Street Unit Trust, 
Old Street Retail Unit Trust and City Road Jersey Limited. The Group purchased the trust capital of 207 Old Street Unit Trust and 
211 Old Street Unit Trust from Old Street Holdings LP.
In the year ended 31 March 2016, Barts Two Limited sold its investment in Barts Two Investment Property Limited.
The cost of the Company’s investment in joint ventures was £15,000 (2016: £15,000). 
The Group has one material joint venture (2016: three). The full results and position of these joint ventures are set out overleaf, 
of which we have included our share in the above table.

Significant Judgements and Estimates
There are a number of companies which are accounted for as joint ventures where the Group has an equity interest of less than 
50%. This typically occurs where the Group’s joint venture partner is providing a greater share of finance into the Company, with 
the Group contributing a greater share towards the day to day management of the underlying project. In these cases neither party 
has control over the entity and therefore it is considered appropriate to account for our interest as a joint venture.
Under the Barts Square joint venture agreement the Group is entitled to varying returns dependent upon the performance of 
the development. Whilst the Group holds a 33.35% legal share in the Barts Square group, it has accounted for its share at 43.8% 
to reflect its expected economic interest in the joint venture. 
This changed in the year to 31 March 2016 from the 33.35% interest shown at 31 March 2015, and resulted in a gain of £6,341,000 
being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement to reflect the Group’s increased share in the opening net assets of the 
joint venture.
Under the Creechurch joint venture arrangement, whilst the Group holds a legal share of 10% of Creechurch Place Limited, a third 
party acquired the right to step in to take 20% of the Group’s share of the effective economic interest, ie 2%. Therefore, the Group 
changed the share of joint venture that it accounted for from 10% to 8%.

The year on year changes in fixed borrowing rates are the result of stepped increases/decreases in interest rate swaps rates. 
Floating rate borrowings bear interest at rates based on LIBOR.
At 31 March 2017 the Company had no interest rate swaps (2016: a £30,000,000 and £20,300,000 interest rate swap, both 
at 4.070% and expiring in July 2019 and October 2017 respectively). During the year two interest rate swaps were novated to a 
subsidiary company of Helical plc. Interest is fixed on the Retail Bond and Convertible Bond as shown above, with the remaining 
borrowings being at floating rates.
In addition to the above, the Group has a £50,000,000 interest rate swap at 1.865% starting in January 2020 and expiring in 
June 2026.
In addition to the fixed rates, borrowings are also hedged by the following financial instruments:

Capital Management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
• to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and,
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure. It manages the capital structure and makes 
adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to 
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. Capital is defined as being issued share capital, share premium, 
retained earnings, revaluation reserve and other reserves (2017: £509,419,000, 2016: £473,243,000). The Group continually 
monitors its gearing level to ensure that it is appropriate. Gearing decreased from 137% to 111% in the year as the Group took 
advantage of favourable debt market conditions.
The deferred shares were issued on 23 December 2004 to those Shareholders electing to receive a dividend, rather than a capital 
repayment or further shares in the Company, as part of the Return of Cash approved by Shareholders on 20 December 2004. 
The deferred shares carry no voting rights and have no right to a dividend or capital payment in the event of a winding up of 
the Company.
The Company’s Articles of Association give the Company irrevocable authority to purchase all or any of the deferred shares 
for a maximum aggregate total of 1 penny for all deferred shares in issue on the date of such purchase.
27. SHARE OPTIONS
At 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 there were no unexercised options over new ordinary 1p shares in the Company. No options 
over purchased ordinary 1p shares held by the ESOP had been granted to Directors and employees under the Company’s share 
option schemes (31 March 2016: none).

The Group provides share-based payments to employees in the form of performance share plan (PSP) awards and a share incentive 
plan. The Company uses a combination of the Black-Scholes and stochastic valuation models and the resulting value is amortised 
through the Consolidated Income Statement over the vesting period of the share-based payments.

The fair value of the awards made in the year to 31 March 2017 was £4,391,000 (2016: £5,802,000).
The inputs into the Black-Scholes and stochastic models of valuation of the PSP awards made in the year to 31 March 2017 
were as follows:

Risk free rate 0.40% 0.79% 1.24%

The Group recognised a charge of £1,672,000 (2016: £6,666,000) during the year in relation to share-based payments.
Volatility is measured by calculating the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of share price movements for the period prior 
to the date of grant which is commensurate with the remaining length of the performance period.
At the balance sheet date there were no exercisable awards.
29. OWN SHARES HELD
Following approval at the 1997 Annual General Meeting the Company established the Helical Employees’ Share Ownership Plan 
Trust (the ‘‘ESOP”) to be used as part of the remuneration arrangements for employees. The purpose of the ESOP is to facilitate and 
encourage the ownership of shares by or for the benefit of employees by the acquisition and distribution of shares in the Company.
The ESOP purchases shares in the Company to satisfy the Company’s obligations under its Share Option Scheme and Performance 
Share Plan. For this purpose, 254,000 shares (2016: 4,488,000) in the Company were purchased during the year at a cost of 
£944,000 (2016: £18,857,000).
At 31 March 2017 the ESOP held 1,262,000 ordinary shares in Helical plc (2016: 3,901,000).
At 31 March 2017 options over nil (2016: nil) ordinary shares in Helical plc had been granted through the ESOP. At 31 March 2017 
awards over 4,744,000 (2016: 6,558,000) ordinary shares in Helical plc, made under the terms of the Performance Share Plan, 
were outstanding.
30. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company has entered into cross guarantees in respect of the banking facilities of its subsidiaries. These are not considered 
to have a material value.
There were no other contingent liabilities at 31 March 2017 for the Group or the Company (2016: £nil).
31. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
The Group has a commitment of £69,830,000 (2016: £17,209,000) in relation to construction contracts, which are due 
to be completed in the period to June 2018.

The Convertible Bond has been designated at fair value through the profit or loss. The change in fair value of the Convertible Bond 
is wholly attributable to changes in market conditions. If Bondholders do not exercise their conversion right, the obligation is settled 
by a cash payment of £100,000,000. The difference between the carrying amount of £99,774,000 and this settlement amount is 
an additional liability of £226,000.

The carrying value of trade and other payables and borrowings is not deemed to be materially different from the fair value. 
Financial liabilities are stated in accordance with IAS 32.
The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale 
assets, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and those designated on initial recognition.
Interest rate swaps, caps and floors are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the 
applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
IFRS 13 categorises financial assets and liabilities as being valued in three hierarchical levels:
• Level 1: values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2: values are derived from observing market data; and
• Level 3: values cannot be derived from observable market data.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as below:
Level 1 Convertible Bond (note 24)
Level 2 Derivative financial instruments (note 34)
Level 3 Available-for-sale investment (note 20)

(13,981) (14,955) (2,551) (7,134)
The Group’s movement in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments in the year was a gain of £789,000 (2016: loss of 
£6,860,000) due to interest rate caps and swaps. In accordance with IAS 39, the convertible bond is split into a loan and derivative 
element in the Company Balance Sheet. On initial recognition the derivative element had a value of £8,190,000. At 31 March 2017, 
the derivative element had a value of £2,551,000 (2016: £7,134,000) with a corresponding gain of £4,583,000 (2016: £2,048,000) 
recognised in the Income Statement. The Company’s interest rate swaps were novated to a subsidiary company during the year 
(2016: gain of £1,898,000).
Credit Risk
Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk the 
Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and 
other factors.
As at 31 March 2017 the Group had total credit risk exposure excluding cash of £73,260,000, all of which is loans and receivables. 
The cash is held with reputable banking institutions and in client accounts with solicitors and managing agents and therefore credit 
risk is considered low.
All other debtors are deemed to be recoverable.
All Company debtors are considered to be fully recoverable.
The Group is not reliant on any major customer for its ability to continue as a going concern.
For further information on trade and other receivables, see note 21.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity and funding risks, related processes and policies are overseen by management.
The Group manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business needs, tax, capital or regulatory considerations, 
if applicable, and through numerous sources of finance in order to maintain flexibility. Management monitors the Group’s net 
liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows. The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held 
with major regulated financial institutions and the Directors regularly monitor the financial institutions that the Group uses to 
ensure its exposure to liquidity risk is minimised.
For further information on debt facilities, see notes 24 and 25.
The maturity profile of the Group’s contracted financial liabilities is as follows:

Total contracted liabilities 813,906 912,418 646,310 723,307
At 31 March 2017 the Group had £141,918,000 (2016: £83,641,000) of undrawn borrowing facilities, £16,847,000 
(2016: £105,865,000) of uncharged property assets and cash balances of £99,262,000 (2016: £74,670,000). The above contracted 
liabilities assume that no loans are extended beyond their current facility expiry date. Management believe that these facilities, 
together with anticipated sales and the renewal of some of these loan facilities, mean that the Group can meet its contracted 
liabilities as they fall due.
Market Risk
The Group is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange movements, the market value 
of the investments and accrued development profits. The Group actively monitors these exposures.
Interest Rate Risk
It is the Group’s policy and practice to minimise interest rate cash flow exposures on long-term financing. The Group does this 
by using a number of derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. The purpose of these 
derivatives is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Group’s sources of finance. The Group does not use financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
Details of financing and financial instruments can be found in note 25.
In the year to 31 March 2017, if interest rates had moved by 0.5%, this would have resulted in the following movement to net profits 
and equity due to movements in interest charges and mark-to-market valuations of derivatives.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Due to its operations in Poland and its investment in a non-UK based property developer, the Group has exposure to exchange 
movements on foreign currencies. Management monitors its exposure to risks associated with foreign currency exchange risk 
and reviews any requirements to act to minimise these risks.
In the year to 31 March 2017 the Group made foreign exchange losses of £3,000 (2016: gains of £100,000) resulting from 
movements in foreign exchange rates during the year affecting its assets and liabilities related to its overseas operations.

35. INVESTMENT PROPERTY ACCOUNTING RESTATEMENT
International Accounting Standard 40 - Investment Property requires that accrued operating lease income assets should be shown 
separately and deducted from the fair value of the investment properties in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This accounting 
treatment had not been applied at 31 March 2016 but has been adopted for the year ended 31 March 2017. A prior year adjustment 
has been made to ensure consistency of comparative information, clarity and transparency.
The effect of the adjustment on the relevant financial statement line items for the year ended 31 March 2016 is as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 37. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of Helical plc (the “Company”) and all of its subsidiary undertakings (together the 
“Group”) drawn up to 31 March 2017. Subsidiary undertakings are entities for which the Group is exposed to variable returns and has 
the ability to control those returns. Subsidiaries are accounted for under the purchase method and are held in the Company balance 
sheet at cost and reviewed annually for impairment.
Joint Ventures are entities whose economic activities are controlled jointly by the Group and by other ventures independent of the 
Group, where both parties are exposed to variable returns but neither has control over those returns. They are accounted for using 
the equity method of accounting, whereby the Group’s share of profit after tax in the Joint Venture is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement and the Group’s share of the Joint Venture’s net assets are incorporated in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.
The Company’s cost of investment in Joint Ventures less any provision for permanent impairment loss is shown in the 
Company Balance Sheet.
Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence but which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between 
subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 
of the asset transferred.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is also the functional currency of the parent company.
Going Concern
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Governance Review on page 74.
Revenue Recognition
Rental income - rental income receivable is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Any incentive for lessees to enter into a lease agreement and any costs associated with entering into the lease are spread over 
the same period.
Sale of goods - assets, such as trading properties, development sites and completed developments, are regarded as sold upon 
the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the purchaser, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. This occurs on 
exchange of unconditional contracts for the sale of the site, on satisfaction of any and all conditions on a conditional contract for 
the sale of the site or on completion of the contract on a conditional sale where those conditions are satisfied at completion. 
Measurements of revenue arising from the sale of such assets are derived from the fair value of the consideration received in 
accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Construction contracts - where an asset is constructed under a specific contract with a purchaser (a “pre-sold development”) 
the initial sale of the site to that purchaser is recognised as a sale of goods in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue, where the sale of 
the land is not conditional on the construction of the buildings and is not reversible in the event that the building is not constructed. 
The construction element of the contract is treated, for the purposes of revenue recognition, as a construction contract in 
accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts. Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion which is typically 
determined by reference to project appraisals, normally supported by independent valuation certificates provided by quantity 
surveyors. The Company’s principal other responsibility on pre-sold developments is the identification of and agreement of terms 
with potential tenants of the completed building(s). The revenue recognition of this additional component of the funding 
agreements is considered separately to reflect the substance of the transaction as the rendering of services, in accordance with 
IAS 18 Revenue. The amount of revenue recognised is determined by reference to the percentage of the building(s) that are let.
Property advisory/development management services - where the Group provides these services to the third party property site 
owner the Group recognises income over the period these services are provided and in accordance with the specific terms of the 
contract. If the amount and payment of the consideration for these services are contingent upon a future event (such as sale of the 
property) and if the fair value of the consideration can be reliably estimated, the Group recognises this income as its services are 
performed, discounting for time and risk if appropriate.
Investment income - revenue in respect of investment and other income represents investment income, fees and commissions 
earned on an accruals basis and the fair value of the consideration received/receivable on investments held for the short-term. 
Dividends are recognised when the Shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established. Interest income is accrued on 
a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.
Deferred income - money received in advance of the provision of goods or services is held in the balance sheet until the income 
can be recognised in the Income Statement.
Share-based Payments
The Group provides share-based payments in the form of performance share plan awards and a share incentive plan. These 
payments are discussed in greater detail in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 80 to 97. The fair value of share-based 
payments related to employees’ service are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the related instrument at the grant 
date. The Group uses a combination of the Black-Scholes and stochastic valuation models and the resulting value is amortised 
through the Consolidated Income Statement (“Income Statement”) over the vesting period of the share-based payments.
For the performance share plan and share incentive plan awards, where non-market conditions apply, the expense is allocated, 
over the vesting period, to the Income Statement based on the best available estimate of the number of awards that are expected 
to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of awards expected to vest differs from 
previous estimates.
The amount charged to the Income Statement is credited to the Retained Earnings reserve.
Depreciation
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, depreciation is not provided for on freehold investment properties or on leasehold 
investment properties. The Group does not own the freehold land and buildings which it occupies. Costs incurred in respect of 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 132 leasehold improvements to the Group’s head office at 5 Hanover Square, London W1S 1HQ are capitalised and held as short-term 
leasehold improvements. Leasehold improvements, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any recognised impairment loss. Residual values are reassessed annually.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the 
straight-line method, on the following basis:
Short leasehold improvements - 10% or length of lease, if shorter 
Plant and equipment  - 25%
Taxation
The taxation charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. The charge for current taxation is based on the 
results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Tax payable upon realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is 
recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible timing differences can be utilised. 
The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences of the manner in which the Group expects, 
at the balance sheet date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the timing differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in 
a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
The deferred tax asset relating to share based payment awards reflects the estimated value of tax relief available on the vesting 
of the awards at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. It is recognised in the Income 
Statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with 
in equity.
The Group recognises a deferred tax liability for all taxable timing differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
a) the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the timing difference; and,
b) it is probable that the timing difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s Shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period 
in which dividends are approved.
Investment Properties
Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held for long-term rental income and for capital 
appreciation. Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, including associated transaction costs, and subsequently at fair 
value adjusted for the carrying value of lease incentive and letting cost receivables. These fair values are based on market values as 
determined by professionally qualified external valuers or are determined by the Directors of the Group based on their knowledge 
of the property. In accordance with IAS 40, investment properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised finance 
lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are recognised as gains or losses on revaluation 
in the Income Statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties 
including integral plant.
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property is treated as investment property 
in accordance with IAS 40.
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property, the property remains 
an investment property measured at fair value and is not reclassified. Interest is capitalised before tax relief until the date of 
practical completion.
Details of the valuation of investment properties can be found in note 14.
Land, Developments and Trading Properties
Land, developments and trading properties held for sale are inventory and are included in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs 
to completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Gross borrowing costs associated with expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are 
capitalised. The interest capitalised is either based on the interest paid (where a project has a specific loan) or calculated using 
the Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings (where there are no specific borrowings for the project). Interest is capitalised

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 37. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Investments
Available-for-sale investments are revalued to fair value at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value 
are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that losses are attributable to impairment below 
historic cost, in which case they are recognised in the Income Statement. Upon disposal, accumulated fair value adjustments are 
included in the Income Statement.
Held for Sale Investments
Investments are defined as held for sale when the Group intends to sell the investment and if sale is highly probable. Such held 
for sale investments are measured at the lower of their carrying amounts immediately prior to their classification as held for sale 
and their fair value less costs to sell.
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost as reduced 
by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, 
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits with banks, cash held at solicitors, cash in blocked accounts and 
other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade and Other Payables
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowing and Borrowing Costs
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and the Group’s retail bond are initially recorded at fair value, net of finance and other 
costs yet to be amortised in accordance with IAS 39. Embedded derivatives contained within the borrowing agreements are treated 
in accordance with IAS 39, which includes consideration of whether embedded derivatives require bifurcation. The retail bond and 
bank loans are held at amortised cost.
Convertible bonds are designated as fair value through the profit and loss and so are presented on the Balance Sheet at fair value, 
with all gains and losses, including the write-off of issuance costs, recognised in the Income Statement. The interest charge in 
respect of the coupon rate on the bonds has been recognised within finance costs on an accruals basis.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of new developments and investment properties are 
added to the costs of such properties until the date of completion of the development or investment. After initial recognition 
borrowings are carried at amortised cost. 
Gains or losses on extinguishing debt are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they occur.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and forward foreign currency contracts in 
order to manage the risks arising from its activities. Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently remeasured 
to fair value based on market prices, estimated future cash flows and forward rates as appropriate. Any change in the fair value of 
such derivatives is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
A derivative property asset is recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Group has contractually assigned an existing purchase 
contract. A derivative property asset is initially recorded at its fair value and is remeasured at each reporting period date to its fair 
value, which is based upon the future contracted cash flow discounted for both time and risk. Any change in fair value is recognised 
in the Income Statement as a development profit.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial 
asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, 
discharged, cancelled or expires.
Further information on the categorisation of financial instruments can be found in note 34.
Leases
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
In accordance with IAS 40, finance leases of investment property are accounted for as finance leases and recognised as an asset 
and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments. The investment property asset is included in the Balance Sheet at fair 
value, gross of the recognised finance lease liability. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so 
as to achieve a constant financing rate.
In accordance with IAS 17, operating leases receipts and payments are spread on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease.
Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that 
are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from 
those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise. Exchange 
differences on non-monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to the extent that they relate to 
a gain or loss on that non-monetary item which is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, otherwise such gains 
and losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
HELICAL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 134 The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation 
of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. On disposal of a foreign operation 
the cumulative translation differences (including, if applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the Income 
Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Net Asset Values Per Share
Net asset values per share have been calculated in accordance with the best practice recommendations of the European 
Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”).
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the best practice recommendations of EPRA.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust
Shares held in the Helical Bar Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (“ESOP”) are shown as a deduction in arriving at equity funds 
on consolidation. Assets, liabilities and reserves of the ESOP are included in the statutory headings to which they relate. Purchases 
and sales of own shares increase or decrease the book value of “Own shares held” in the Balance Sheet. At each period end the 
Group assesses and recognises the value of “Own shares held” with reference to the expected cash proceeds and accounts for 
any difference as a reserves transfer.
Use of Estimates and Judgements
To be able to prepare accounts according to the accounting principles, management must make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the assets and liabilities and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the financial statements. These estimates are based 
on historical experience and other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors believe are reasonable under the 
particular circumstances. The results of these considerations form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may significantly impact the Group’s earnings 
and financial position are:
Estimates
• Recognition of share-based payments which is dependent upon the estimated number of performance share plan awards that 
will vest at the end of the periods based on future forecast performance and employee retention (note 28). The 2014 award is an 
actual figure therefore the estimation is around 2015 and 2016 vesting percentages. As at March 2017, the estimated vesting 
percentage for 2015 was 42.57% and for 2016 was 33.33%. These have been sensitised for a range of reasonably possible vesting 
outcomes. If it was estimated that nil% of the remaining shares were expected to vest it would result in a credit to the Consolidated 
Income Statement of £1.8m and if it was estimated that 100% were expected to vest it would result in a £2.8m additional charge. A 
10% variation in the estimated vesting % would result in a £0.5m charge/credit recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
• Determination of the most appropriate percentage interest at which to recognise our share of joint ventures, where our economic 
interest can differ to our ownership interest (see note 18). Under the Barts Square joint venture agreement the Group is entitled 
to varying returns dependent upon the performance of the development. Whilst the Group holds a 33.35% legal share in the 
Barts Square group, it has accounted for its share at 43.8% to reflect its expected economic interest in the joint venture. There 
are several estimates that contribute to this expected economic interest, the most sensitive of which is the estimated sales price 
of the residential units. If the estimated sales prices were 15% lower, the Group’s economic interest would fall to 42.0% (with a net 
asset decrease of £0.9m) whilst an increase of 15% would result in a 48.4% economic interest (with a net asset increase of £2.2m).
• Valuation of investment properties. The sensitivity of these valuations to changes in the reversionary yield is included 
in note 14; 
• The net realisable value of land and development properties contain subjective assumptions including the results of future planning 
decisions, future construction costs and future sales values and timings (note 19). We do not consider the range of reasonably 
possible outcomes for changes in estimated cost or sales price would result in a material impact to net realisable value; and
• Determination of the stage of completion of development management projects which impact the amount of development 
management revenue. There are no changes in assumptions for which the reasonably possible outcomes would have a material 
impact on the revenue recognised in the year.
Judgements
• Calculation and assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, where it has been assumed that sufficient taxable profits 
will be available in future periods to allow all of the assets to be recovered (note 10);
• An assessment of the most suitable accounting treatment for convertible bonds (note 24);
• Consideration of the nature of joint arrangements. In the context of IFRS 10, this involves consideration of where the control lies 
and whether either party has the power to vary its returns from the arrangements. In particular, significant judgement is exercised 
where the shareholding of the Group is not 50% (note 18); 
• Consideration of whether an investment property purchase that has exchanged but not completed should be recognised as 
investment property under IAS 40. The judgement lies in assessing whether the exchange is unconditional, in which case it is 
recognised (note 14); and
• Recognition of development management project revenue, where payment for these services is triggered by a future event 
(sale or letting of the property).

HELICAL PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 140 SEE-THROUGH ANAL YSIS
Helical holds a significant proportion of its property assets in joint ventures with partners that provide the majority of the equity 
required to purchase the assets, whilst relying on the Group to provide asset management or development expertise. Accounting 
convention requires Helical to account under IFRS for our share of the net results and net assets of joint ventures in limited detail 
in the income statement and balance sheet. Net asset value per share, a key performance measure used in the real estate industry, 
as reported in the financial statements under IFRS, does not provide shareholders with the most relevant information on the fair 
value of assets and liabilities within an ongoing real estate company with a long-term investment strategy.
This analysis incorporates the separate components of the results of the consolidated subsidiaries and Helical’s share of its 
joint ventures’ results into a “see-through” analysis of our property portfolio, debt profile and the associated income streams

There were no new investment property purchases during the year. The majority of the expenditure on the existing portfolio 
was made on the London portfolio (80%) and the Manchester offices (7%). Similarly, 94% of the capitalised interest is in London 
and 6% is in Manchester offices. Capitalised interest is calculated in accordance with IAS 23 Borrowing Costs.
Tenant lease incentives are calculated in accordance with IAS 17 Leases. The debtor balances recognised by the Group have 
increased by £9.4m due to developments being completed and let during the year. The majority of the increase relates to 
The Bower, London EC1 (c. £6m) and C-Space, London EC1 (c. 2.7m).

UNSOLICITED INVESTMENT ADVICE - WARNING TO SHAREHOLDERS
Many companies have become aware that their Shareholders have 
received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based “brokers” 
who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out 
to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can 
be very persistent and extremely persuasive. It is not just the novice 
investor who has been duped in this way; many of the victims had been 
successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be 
very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount 
or offers of free reports into the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
