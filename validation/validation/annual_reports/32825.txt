Additional  
Information Our performance in 2017 is our strongest on 
record. Glencore’s balance sheet has never been 
stronger and our investment case, underpinned 
by our leading marketing and industrial asset 
businesses, has never been better 
Capitalising on a strong  
operating environment
After an encouraging end to 2016, 
which saw commodities recover  
from cycle lows, positive momentum 
continued through 2017, resulting  
in prolonged outperformance of 
Glencore’s key commodities versus 
the broader markets. Concerns of 
tightening financial conditions in 
China during the second quarter 
proved to be short-lived, with 
commodities rallying once again 
through the second half of the year.
Strong economic performance 
in both major developing and 
developed markets has underpinned 
supportive commodity demand 
conditions. The electric vehicle 
upheaval continues to unfold, with 
the scale of market penetration  
and investment, by battery and 
automotive manufacturers and 
infrastructure players, adjusting 
progressively upwards. This provides 
an additional dimension of future 
demand growth for a number of our 
key commodities. Early signals of 
inflation and higher interest rates  
also bode well for commodities  
as an asset class.
Chinese supply-side reform, aided by 
consistent environmental policy and 
compliance, positively affected a 
number of commodities during  
2017, including thermal coal, zinc 
and aluminium. 
Going forward, those commodities 
where primary market balances are 
in deficit or trending towards deficit, 
such as zinc, copper, nickel and 
thermal coal should see positive  
price divergence versus potentially 
oversupplied markets.
Delivering sector-leading  
returns for shareholders
In 2017, Glencore outperformed  
all its UK-listed major diversified 
mining peers, with shares up 41%. 
Our balance sheet is robust,  
and our investment case is  
increasingly compelling. 
Financial performance was strong 
in 2017, with Adjusted EBITDA of 
$14.8 billion, up 44% and net income 
attributable to equity holders 
increasing to $5.8 billion, from 
$1.4 billion in 2016, reflecting healthy 
commodity prices and the continued 
robust earnings contribution from  
our highly cash generative Marketing 
and Industrial businesses.
Marketing resilient again
Marketing Adjusted EBIT was 
$3.0 billion in 2017, 3% higher  
than 2016, reflecting the benefits  
of continued supportive market 
conditions, volume growth in key 
market segments and a positive end 
to the year, eclipsing the $2.8 billion 
guidance provided during the 
Investor Update in early December. 
Metals & Minerals and Energy 
Products both delivered strong 
contributions while Agricultural 
Products posted a resilient 
performance when compared to 
many peers. Marketing has again 
proven its ability to generate 
consistently solid earnings with high 
cash conversion, taking into account 
its low fixed capital requirements.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
04
Glencore Annual Report 2017 Looking ahead, while we maintain 
our long-term Marketing Adjusted 
EBIT guidance range of $2.2 to 
$3.2 billion, a continuation of recent 
healthy marketing conditions would 
suggest a 2018 performance in the 
upper half of the range.
Industrial margin expansion 
through higher prices and relentless 
cost focus
Industrial Adjusted EBITDA of 
$1 1.5 billion in 2017 was 60%  
higher than 2016. Our asset  
portfolio continued to deliver overall 
competitive all-in unit costs which, 
despite some minor production 
challenges during the year, allowed 
the Company to capitalise on healthy 
commodity prices and generate 
higher Adjusted EBITDA mining 
margins of 38% and 41% respectively 
in our Metals and Energy operations.
Energy and mobility transformation 
forecast to unlock material new 
sources of commodity demand
Commodity differentiation is 
increasingly important, and 
Glencore’s commodity mix 
is becoming less dependent 
on demand generated by  
infrastructure related investment 
in developing markets.
Accelerating electric vehicle adoption 
requires an energy and mobility 
transformation that is forecast to 
unlock material new sources of 
demand for the enabling underlying 
commodities including copper,  
nickel and cobalt.
We recently commissioned an 
independent study to gauge the 
potential incremental demand  
for these commodities under the 
Electric Vehicles Initiative scenario 
of 30 % electric vehicle market share 
by 2030. The findings suggest an 
additional 4.1Mt of copper, 1.1Mt  
of nickel and 314kt of cobalt supply 
will be required by 2030. 
These potentially significant new 
demand sources offer compelling 
fundamentals, particularly when 
coupled with persistent 
supply challenges. 
Automaker investment in EVs:       
$90 billion and counting
The rate at which automotive and 
battery companies have scaled up 
electric vehicle investment plans 
speaks to our opportunity as a 
supplier of key metals. 
Global automaker investments now 
total more than $90 billion, with at 
least $19 billion attributed to the U.S., 
$21 billion to China and $52 billion  
to Germany. Volkswagen alone  
plans to spend $40 billion by 2030  
to build electrified versions of over 
300 models. Chinese automakers are 
ramping up focus on the EV story, 
while a number have announced 
investment partnerships with the 
likes of Ford, VW and General Motors.
Our resource base is well positioned 
to supply into this likely energy and 
mobility evolution, particularly given 
our anticipated strong production 
growth in copper (25%) nickel (30%) 
and cobalt (133%) over the next  
three years.

in more detail on page 12.

Additional  
Information Conviction to create value  
through partnerships, M&A  
and organic reinvestment
Over the past 15 months, in our 
constant drive to create long-term 
value for shareholders, we continued 
to leverage our trading and  
strategic relationships to source  
and structure both acquisitions  
and disposals, including:
• Acquisition of 49% of Rio Tinto’s 
Hunter Valley Operations (thermal 
coal) with Yancoal retaining 51%, 
gaining access to sizeable high 
quality energy coal resources and 
marketing rights (pending)
• Sale of 51% of non-U.S. petroleum 
products storage and logistics 
business to HNA (sale of smaller  
U.S. portion pending)
• Creation of BaseCore Metals 
alongside Ontario Teachers’ 
Pension Plan, a growth vehicle  
for base metal streams, royalties 
and commercial opportunities
• Sale of our African zinc assets 
to Trevali for mix of cash and 
shares, thereby accelerating the 
development of a mid-size zinc 
growth vehicle with Glencore 
retaining 25% equity participation 
and offtake agreements
• Acquisition of Chevron’s South 
African and Botswana mid/down-
stream oil business (pending)
• Acquisition of majority of voting 
class shares in Volcan, gaining 
exposure/access to a premier 
zinc district and potential asset/
marketing synergies
• Acquisition of remaining 31% 
interest in Mutanda copper
• Increased Rosneft oil offtake, 
alongside equity partnership 
structure with the QIA
Additionally, we have an attractive 
suite of organic growth options across 
the portfolio. Key existing projects 
neared completion in 2017, including 
Katanga (copper/cobalt – now in 
commissioning), Mopani (copper – 
commissioning late 2018) and 
Koniambo (nickel, Line 2 in 
commissioning). 
A suite of low-cost, low-risk 
brownfield opportunities were 
approved or progressed during  
2017, including Integrated Nickel 
Operations (nickel), Zhairem (zinc), 
Katanga acid plant and cobalt circuit 
debottlenecking (copper/cobalt), 
Mutanda cobalt reclaim (copper), 
United Wambo Open Cut (coal)  
and Mt Owen extension (coal).
$2.9 billion shareholder distribution 
Consistent with new distribution 
policy and reflecting strong cash 
generation in 2017, we have declared 
a distribution of $2.9 billion ($0.20 per 
share) in respect of 2017 cash flows, 
to be paid in two equal instalments 
in 2018. 
This payment comprises a fixed         
$1 billion pay-out in respect of 
Marketing activities and a variable 
component of $1.9 billion, 
representing c.36% of Industrial  
asset free cash flow compared  
to our policy minimum of 25%. 
Corporate governance  
and sustainability
Our ambition to integrate 
sustainability throughout our 
business remains a key strategic 
priority for the Group and reflects  
our commitment to operate 
transparently and responsibly.  
It also encompasses our desire to 
protect the wellbeing of our people, 
our host communities and the 
natural environment, while sharing 
lasting benefits with the regions 
where we work and society  
as a whole.
Sadly, we recorded nine fatalities  
at our operations in 2017. Our goal 
remains zero fatalities and there is 
unrelenting focus on ensuring leading 
practice at all our operations.
Progress during 2017 included the 
publication of our commitment to 
preventing the occurrence of Modern 
Slavery and human trafficking within 
our operations and supply chains,  
the release of our 2016 Sustainability 
report, as well as updated reports on 
Payments to Governments and our 
Climate Change Considerations paper.

We were delighted to appoint 
Ms Gill Marcus to the Board as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director, 
with effect from 1 January 2018.  
Gill was Governor of the South African 
Reserve Bank from November 2009 
to November 2014, and her long 
record of public service coupled  
with her finance experience, geo-
political insights and non-executive 
board experience will be a great 
benefit to us.
Due to sustained low levels of 
liquidity and the general ability  
and preference for prospective 
investors to access Glencore’s  
primary exchange, we sought  
to delist from Hong Kong, which  
took effect in January 2018.
Looking forward
We look ahead with confidence, 
noting the synchronised global 
economic growth, supportive 
commodity fundamentals and  
the emerging electric vehicle  
story. We believe our unrivalled 
positioning in “Tier 1” commodities 
and “Tier 1” assets will continue

Additional  
Information Our market drivers
We are dependent upon the supply of and demand for our commodities
Key market drivers Impact on our industry
Future commodity supply
• The pro-cyclical nature of mining investment means  
that new mines are usually approved when 
commodity prices are higher
• Given the long development time frames required  
to bring new mine supply on line, the timing as to 
when this appears in the economic cycle is difficult  
to predict and could appear at low points in the 
economic cycle, creating excess supply in the market
• Over-investment creates oversupply and with it a prolonged 
period of low commodity prices
• Although commodity prices have increased significantly  
from the lows seen in early 2016, the experience of the last 
economic cycle has provided investor pressure on companies 
to be more cautious about investing in new supply
• Balancing a finite, declining resource base with the need  
to grow to meet expected future demand is an inherent 
challenge for companies in the resource sector
Demand for the  
commodities we produce
• The industrialisation and urbanisation of developing 
economies over the last decade has driven significant 
growth in commodity demand 
• China’s rapid growth over this period now means  
that it accounts for up to half of global demand for  
most commodities
• As developing economies mature, the commodities  
that drive their growth change
• Increased levels of industrialisation and urbanisation  
suggest demand growth rates for commodities may  
be lower in the future
• Negative demand could generate excess supply along  
with lower commodity prices
• Early-cycle commodities such as iron ore, coking coal and 
cement may become less important as demand patterns  
shift in favour of mid and late cycle commodities such  
as copper, zinc, cobalt, nickel, thermal coal and  
agricultural products
Energy and emissions 
transformation
• Momentum to decarbonise the global economy  
is gathering pace as nations increasingly coordinate 
efforts aimed at minimising emissions of carbon 
dioxide to achieve climate change goals and  
transition the world to a low-carbon economy
• This transition is likely to increase the cost for fossil fuels, 
impose levies for emissions and increase costs for monitoring 
and reporting and to reduce demand for fossil fuels
• Third parties, including potential or actual investors,  
may also introduce policies adverse to Glencore due  
to our interest in fossil fuels, particularly coal
• Technological advances are making renewable energy  
sources more competitive with fossil fuels and are likely  
to displace them over the longer run. In particular, many 
analysts believe that demand for coal may reduce sooner  
than previously expected
10
Glencore Annual Report 2017 How we are responding
• Our disciplined approach to capital 
allocation attempts to ensure that  
supply and demand forces retain  
a level of balance
• Given the unpredictability of costs, risks

• With the expectation that the global 
economy will continue to progress towards 
a consumption based economy and 
therefore, commodity demand growth will 
be focused in the higher-end, fast growing 
consumer sectors, our diverse commodity 
portfolio, supplying this demand, is well 
placed to benefit from this transition
• We are a major producer of the 
commodities that underpin the current 
battery chemistry and infrastructure 
initiatives that are expected to power 
electric vehicles and energy storage  
systems and this new source of demand
• We continuously assess the risks and  
opportunities presented by decarbonisation 
of energy and mobility across our product 
and operational portfolio
• As a major producer and consumer of fossil 
fuels, we recognise our responsibility to 
understand and manage our greenhouse 
gas emissions, and support the global 
transition to a low-carbon economy
• Widespread adoption of electric vehicles 
and energy storage systems will create 
material new sources of demand for 
enabling commodities

Glencore Annual Report 2017 The energy and mobility 
transformation currently 
underway is unlocking 
material new sources 
of demand for enabling 
commodities such as 
copper, nickel and cobalt 
The emergence of  
electric vehicles (EVs)  
is set to transform the 
mobility space due to a 
combination of factors:
Environmental considerations 
Momentum to decarbonise the 
economy is gathering pace as nations 
increasingly coordinate efforts on this 
transition. Bloomberg New Energy 
Finance forecasts investment in zero 
carbon energy at c.$8.7 trillion by 
2040, with an estimated 530 million 
electric vehicles on the road.
Political mandate
A growing consensus, highlighted  
by the Paris Accord and the Electric 
Vehicle Initiative (EVI), is seeking to 
coordinate national and regional 
policies towards a low carbon future. 
Specifically on transportation, the  
EVI is a multi-government policy 
forum comprising 16 major global 
economies. The initiative seeks to 
facilitate the global deployment  
of 20 million EVs by 2020. A further 
campaign announced in 2017,  
led by China, targets at least 30% 
new electric vehicle sales by 2030, 
collectively across all EVI countries.
Technological progress
Rapid advances in technology are 
emerging across the EV supply chain, 
from power generation and storage 
to charging and vehicles. 
With technological progress  
comes cost efficiencies, enhanced 
performance and ultimately  
products that can compete with 
traditional internal combustion 
engine (ICE) alternatives. 
Industry commentators now expect 
the total cost of ownership (TCO) for 
EVs to reach parity with ICE vehicles 
in the early part of the next decade

Perspectives towards 2035”, prepared

Consumer experience
While the EV story is clearly in  
its early days, existing EV models  
and those under development are  
already demonstrating performance 
comparable to, or exceeding, 
equivalent ICEs. 
Average EV range, acceleration and 
speed are increasing while targeted 
charging times and TCO are rapidly 
decreasing; all enhancing the 
consumer experience.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Potential supply
Glencore is well-positioned to supply  
into the energy and mobility evolution 
On the cusp of  
mainstream EV roll-out
The rate at which automotive and 
battery companies have scaled up 
electric vehicle investment plans 
speaks to our opportunity as a 
supplier of key metals. 
Global automaker investment now 
totals over $90 billion, with at least 
$19 billion attributed to the U.S., 
$21 billion to China and $52 billion 
to Germany. 
Volkswagen alone plans to  
spend $40 billion by 2030 to  
build electrified versions of over  
300 models. Chinese automakers 
are ramping up focus on the  
EV story, while a number  
have announced investment 
partnerships with the likes  
of Ford, VW and General Motors. 
Global planned and existing  
battery cell production capacity 
amounts to over 300GWh, which 
compares to Tesla’s Gigafactory 
target capacity of 35GWh. China 
accounts for approximately  
two-thirds of the total.
How much metal is required?
To illustrate the demand  
potential for a number of our key 
commodities, we commissioned 
CRU to model the metal 
requirements across the supply 
chain to achieve the EVI target  
of 30% EV market share by 2030.
Unsurprisingly the forecast metal 
requirements are significant,  
as early as 2020.
An additional c.4.1Mt of copper  
(18% of 2017 supply), c.1.1Mt of 
nickel (55% of 2017 supply) and 
314kt of cobalt (332% of 2017 
supply) will be required to  
enable 30M EV sales by 2030. 
.
Our commodities are crucial  
to the electric vehicle (EV) story
The energy and mobility 
transformation currently underway  
is forecast to unlock material new 
sources of demand for enabling 
underlying commodities including 
copper, nickel and cobalt.
We are uniquely positioned with  
our commodity mix, having strong

Market insight  
and customer 
understanding
Our global scale and 
presence in more than 
90 commodities across 
50 countries gives 
us extensive market 
knowledge and  
insight to help us fully 
understand the needs  
of our customers.
Anticipating supply  
and demand
Our integrated marketing 
and industrial businesses 
work side-by-side to give  
us presence across the 
entire supply chain, 
delivering in-depth 
knowledge of physical 
market supply and 
demand dynamics and  
an ability to rapidly adjust 
to market conditions.
Creating opportunities
The significant scale of 
both our own production 
and the volumes secured 
from third parties allows  
us to create margin 
opportunities from our 
ability to supply the exact 
commodities the market 
needs through processing 
and/or blending and 
optimisation of qualities.
Generating revenue
We generate revenues  
as a fee-like income  
from physical asset 
handling and arbitrage,  
as well as blending and 
optimisation opportunities. 
Our use of hedging 
instruments results in 
profitability being largely 
determined by these 
activities rather than by 
absolute price movements.
Arbitrage 
opportunities
Many of the physical 
commodity markets in  
which we operate are 
fragmented or periodically 
volatile. This can result in 
arbitrage: price discrepancies 
between the prices for  
the same commodities  
in different geographic 
locations or time periods. 
Other factors with arbitrage 
opportunities include freight 
and product quality.
A supportive strategy
Our Marketing Business supports the 
creation of incremental value from  
a pool of allocated capital through 
critical mass, blending, storage  
and arbitrage opportunities.
Our presence at every stage of the 
value chain allows us to leverage  
our scale and diversity.
How we manage risk 
We mitigate credit risks through 
application of measures including 
credit insurance, letters of credit, 
security arrangements and bank  
or corporate guarantees.
We manage market exposure by 
reducing price risks arising from timing 
differences to acceptably low levels.
Our policies/procedures seek to 
ensure we comply with applicable 
sanctions, laws and regulations.

20
Glencore Annual Report 2017 We believe that by being 
a better operator with a 
reputation for doing things the 
right way, we will be seen by 
our stakeholders as a partner 
of choice. We are achieving this 
through taking an approach 
of continuous improvement. 
This approach is delivered 
through our health and safety 
programmes, advancing our 
environmental performance, 
respecting human rights and 
by developing, maintaining 
and strengthening our 
relationships with all 
of our stakeholders.
We recognise that a robust 
and sufficiently flexible 
balance sheet contributes  
to the delivery of sustainable, 
long-term shareholder returns 
and ensures that Glencore 
is well placed to withstand 
the cyclical nature of the 
natural resource industry. 
We aim to increase returns 
on capital and cash flows 
while targeting a maximum 
2x Net debt/Adjusted 
EBITDA ratio throughout 
the cycle. We aim to only 
deploy capital when strict 
and clearly defined financial 
criteria, relating to returns 
and payback, can be met.
Our major industrial assets 
are mainly long-life and 
low-cost, reflecting our 
substantial investment into 
existing assets as well as our 
appetite, capabilities and 
belief in some commodities 
and geographies where 
our peers are not materially 
present. Our industrial assets 
provide a consistent source 
of volumes for our marketing 
operations, which are 
supplemented by third party 
production. Our marketing 
activities use their scale 
and capabilities to extract 
additional margin throughout 
our business model and 
provide a superior service to 
our customers and a reliable 
supply of quality product. 
We seek to increase the value 
of our business by improving 
the competitiveness of our 
assets through an ongoing 
focus on cost management 
and logistical capabilities, 
including operating safely 
and efficiently. We take a 
disciplined approach towards 
all of our assets and will 
divest when another operator 
places greater value on 
them, or curtail production in 
response to oversupply when 
it makes sense to do so.

Performance in 2017
Industrial 
Increased Adjusted EBITDA mining 
margins of 38% and 41% respectively 
in our metals and energy operations 
reflect the benefit of higher prices that 
more than offset modest inflationary 
and cost pressures as well as the 
optimisation of cost structures and 
efficiencies over the past two years.
Marketing  
Achieved c.$3.0 billion Adjusted 
EBIT across our marketing business, 
underlining both supportive market 
conditions during the year as well as 
upside to a positive commodity cycle.
Supply 
Continued our disciplined approach 
to supply. Partial restart of idled 
zinc production planned for 2018. 
The balance of this capacity will 
be restarted at the right time.
Performance in 2017
Conservatively repositioned  
Revised capital structure and credit 
profile managed through targeting a 
maximum 2x Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA 
through the cycle, augmented by an 
upper Net debt cap of c.$16 billion.
Year-end Net debt and FFO/Net debt 
were $10.7 billion and 108.3% respectively.
Conviction to create value  
Targeted bolt-on acquisitions, low-
cost/risk organic growth and recycling 
of capital enabled capital efficient 
growth in compelling commodities.
Bonds  
Issued $2.1 billion of bonds with maturities 
of 5 and 10 years. Post-2018 maturities 
capped at c.$3 billion in any one year.
Credit rating  
Credit rating upgraded to Baa2 
(stable) by Moody’s and BBB 
(positive outlook) by Standard & 
Poor’s in line with lower leverage.
Credit facility  
Revolving credit facility refinanced 
and resized to reflect reduced funding 
needs. Committed available liquidity 
of c,$12.9 billion at year end covers 
more than 3 years of bond maturities.
Performance in 2017
SafeWork programme  
Continued to progress our SafeWork 
programme, an initiative that focuses on 
eliminating fatalities and serious injuries.
Regrettably, there were nine fatalities 
from nine incidents during the year. 
We continue to work towards the 
elimination of fatalities from our 
business. More positively, our TRIFR 
and LTIFR improved by 24% and 27% 
respectively compared to 2016.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 We have been a member of the 
International Council on Mining & 
Metals since 2014. We endorse its 
sustainable development framework 
principles and are an active member 
of its working groups.
We strongly support transparency in 
the redistribution and reinvestment 
of the payments we make to local 
and national governments. We are 
active participants in the Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). 
We comply with the EU Accounting 
and Transparency Directives; in line 
with those provisions, we publish 
separate annual reports detailing 
material payments made to 
governments, broken down  
by country and project. 
As part of our commitment to 
responsible product stewardship, we 
follow the UN globally harmonised 
system for classification and labelling 
of chemicals (GHS), the EU REACH 
regulations on the registration, 
evaluation, authorisation and 
restriction of chemicals, and the 
London Bullion Market Association 
(LBMA) Responsible Gold guidance. 
Where appropriate, we participate  
in the REACH consortia related  
to the materials we produce; these 
include the consortia for zinc, 
cadmium, sulphuric acid, lead  
and precious metals.
We submit annual reports to  
the CDP climate change and  
water programmes.
Risk management and assurance
The identification, assessment  
and mitigation of risk determines  
our approach to sustainability 
management. All of our assets  
apply our risk management 
framework and its supporting 
guidelines. We align our framework 
with international standards and it 
provides a harmonised approach 
to managing our health, safety, 
environment, community, human 
rights and reputational risks, as well 
as those linked to the management 
of financial and legal issues.
Our assets use the framework to 
identify hazards, particularly those 
with potentially major or catastrophic 
consequences, and to develop plans 
to address and eliminate, or mitigate, 
the related risks. For each of the 
identified catastrophic hazards we 
have implemented a standardised 
approach to identifying and 
understanding their causes 
and controls.

Information Materiality assessment
We focus the reporting of our 
sustainability performance and 
progress on topics identified as being 
material to Glencore’s development, 
performance, position and/or future 
prospects. Every two years, we 
undertake a materiality assessment 
to establish the material topics for  
our sustainability strategy review  
and sustainability reporting – these 
topics have the potential to have  
the greatest impact on Glencore’s 
business activities.
In line with the GRI guidance 
on materiality, our materiality 
assessment involves a group-wide 
Our internal HSEC assurance 
programme has a primary focus  
on our systematic management of 
the catastrophic hazards and their 
relevant controls and critical controls. 
Senior subject matter experts 
participate in the assurance 
programme; our Board receives 
reports on its findings, which are 
actively followed up and verified.  
The assurance programme is 
contributing to improving standards 
and performance group-wide. 
Stakeholder engagement
We engage with all relevant 
stakeholder groups to build 
meaningful relationships and 
understand their expectations and 
aspirations. Through recognising the 
importance of open and transparent 
engagement, we are able to 
minimise our negative societal 
impact, optimise the value we  
bring to local communities, and 
maintain our licence to operate. 
The geographies and markets in 
which we operate are extremely 
complex and we conduct dialogues 
on local, national, regional and 
international levels. As a result, we 
engage on a broad variety of topics 
with a wide range of stakeholders 
with diverse interests and opinions.
Where appropriate, we take an 
informed and constructive role in 
public policy development processes. 
For example, we are working with 
policy makers directly and through 
trade associations, on issues related 
to clean energy, carbon reporting and 
carbon pricing, recognising that 
governments and industry must  
work together to establish policy 
frameworks that deliver the optimal 
balance of social, environmental and 
economic considerations appropriate 
for individual nations. 
review of material topics at global 
and local levels. It also includes 
information that reflects our 
understanding of the issues that 
affect our business and the natural 
resources sector, our regulatory 
requirements and the topics raised 
during engagement with our people 
and external stakeholders including 
local communities, investors, the 
media, governments and NGOs.
We consider a topic material if senior 
management determines that it  
may significantly affect our business 
operations or have a significant 
impact on any of our stakeholders.
We need constructive relationships  
with our stakeholders to optimise our 
business. We listen to and work with 
others, to explore the challenges  
we face as a business.
Our stakeholders include our employees 
and contractors, host communities,  
civil society, unions, governments, 
business partners, non-governmental 
organisations, investors and the media. 
We reach out to them on local, national, 
regional and international levels.
We engage with all stakeholder groups 
to build meaningful relationships and 
understand their expectations and 
aspirations. This minimises any potential 
negative societal impact, optimises the 
value we bring to local communities, 
and maintains our licence to operate. 
We hold regular face-to-face meetings, 
conference calls and participate 
in multi-stakeholder discussions. 
We participate in roundtables with 
government and other industry 
representatives to discuss new policies 
as well as amendments to existing 
legislation. We hold transparent 
negotiations with union officials to 
discuss wage and benefit agreements. 
Our employees receive regular briefings 
on health and safety matters. Many of 
our assets hold regular open days, when 
local community members can visit 
our sites and interact with our 
operational teams.
These activities are complementary; 
together, they form part of our response 
to global business issues and help us  
to identify the issues that are of most 
importance to our stakeholders.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Workplace health and safety
The health and safety of our people 
is our top priority. Our ambition is to 
become a health and safety leader, 
and to create a workplace without 
fatalities, injuries or occupational 
diseases. We take a proactive, 
preventative approach towards 
health and safety. Our aim is to 
establish a positive safety culture  
that supports all of our employees 
and contractors being empowered  
to have the authority to stop work  
if they consider a workplace or 
situation unsafe. We believe that all 
occupational fatalities, diseases and 
injuries are preventable. 
An important tool in improving  
safety at our operations has been  
the recording of high potential  
risk incidents (HPRIs). 
The reporting of HPRIs represents a 
positive part of our strategy to reduce 
fatalities and, as such, we do not 
target a reduction in this metric. 
During 2017, 78% of our recorded 
HPRIs related to six hazards (mobile 
equipment: 30%; ground/strata 
failure: 13%; lifting and cranage: 9%; 
working at heights: 8%; energy 
isolation: 7% and fire and explosions: 
4%). For each of these hazards, we 
have developed protocols that detail 
the actions necessary to identify and 
Our progress in 2017
Catastrophic hazard management
We are committed to ensuring  
the safety and wellbeing of our 
people and the communities and 
environment around us. Catastrophic 
events that take place in the natural 
resource sector can have disastrous 
impacts on workers, communities, 
the environment and corporate 
reputation, as well as having 
substantial financial cost. We are 
actively identifying, monitoring and 
mitigating the catastrophic hazards 
within our business. The Board 
receives regular updates on this  
area and actively encourages an 
approach of ongoing improvement.

Information Climate change 
The impact on our business
As a significant producer of energy 
products and a significant energy 
consumer we are aware that energy 
is a key input and cost to our business 
as well as being a material source 
of our carbon emissions. We are 
working to mitigate the physical 
impacts of climate change where we 
can and consider resource efficiency 
when making operational decisions. 
Wherever we operate, we seek 
to optimise our energy and 
carbon footprint.
We recognise the global climate 
change science as laid out by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change and acknowledge the global 
climate change goals outlined in  
the United Nations Convention on 
Climate Change Paris Agreement. 
Following the broad consensus 
reached by nation states, we 
anticipate a global shift towards a 
lower-carbon economy, supported  
by appropriate policies and bringing 
significant economic changes. 
We believe the implementation  
of measures by national and intra-
national governments, as well as 
public sentiment, will continue to 
drive public policy developments 
and programmes to restrict global 
greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). 
This is likely to affect our business  
and represents both risks and 
opportunities that our company 
needs to manage. We support a 
least-cost pathway to achieving 
climate change goals that considers 
the cost and consequences of all 
available policy options and does not 
hinder socio-economic development.
Addressing climate change  
across our business 
To address the impacts, opportunities 
and risks relating to climate change 
within our business, we have 
established an internal cross-
functional and cross-commodity 
working group, led by our Chairman 
with Board oversight to consider 
and examine climate change issues. 
mitigate their associated risk. 
The reported HPRIs also help us to 
identify the activities that we need to 
prioritise in order to advance further 
our safety performance.
We are encouraging our workforce 
to recognise the need to record and 
report HPRIs through the promotion 
of a risk-based safety culture.
It is with deep regret that we have 
not met our goal of zero fatalities. In 
2017, nine people lost their lives at our 
operations, compared to 16 during 
2016. All loss of life is unacceptable 
and we are determined to eliminate 
fatalities across our Group. 
Our lost time injury frequency rate 
(LTIFR) reflects the total number of 
LTIs per million hours worked and 
does not include restricted work 
injuries or fatalities. Our LTIFR are 
recorded when an employee or 
contractor is unable to work following 
an incident; days recorded begin on 
the first rostered shift that the worker 
is absent after the day of the injury. 
In 2017, our LTIFR was 1.02 per million 
hours worked (2016: 1.40 including 
and 1.22 excluding Glencore 
Agriculture) and reflects the 
continuing progress we are making 
to embed a culture of safety at all  
our assets. We are progressing well 
against our long-term goal of 
reducing employee and contractor 
lost-time injuries by 50% by the end 
of 2020 against a 2015 figure of 1.34. 
The total recordable injury frequency 
rate (TRIFR) is the sum of fatalities, 
lost time injuries, restricted work 
injuries and medical treatment 
injuries per million hours worked. 
The metric represents all injuries that 
require medical treatment beyond 
first aid. We are on track to meet the 
progressive improvement required 
to achieve our long-term goal of 
achieving a 50% reduction in  
TRIFR by the end of 2020, using our 
2014 TRIFR of 5.02 as the baseline. 
Our 2017 TRIFR of 3.09 is a 38% 
improvement against the 
2014 baseline.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 The working group is overseeing 
the ongoing integration of carbon 
emissions and energy into our annual 
business planning process and the 
mapping to 2020 of our forward 
projected energy and carbon 
footprint. This work is feeding into 
a detailed review of our carbon 
emissions and energy profile. It 
includes an assessment of potential 
mitigation and abatement projects, 
and underpins the basis of our 
internal Marginal Abatement Cost 
Curve (MACC).
In mid-2017, the work undertaken by 
our climate change working group 
resulted in Glencore establishing an 
initial group-wide carbon emission-
intensity reduction target of at least 
5% on 2016 levels by 2020, measured 
in terms of tonnes of greenhouse 
gases emitted per tonne of copper 
equivalent industrial production 
(tGHG/tCu). 
In line with our expectations, our 2017 
energy emission intensity increased 
marginally compared with 2016,  
from 4.75tGHG/tCu to 4.78tGHG/tCu. 
This slight increase reflects energy 
use relating to pre-stripping activity  
and construction work for future 
production improvements. 
The small increase in 2017 was 
anticipated when our 2020 target 
was established. Structural carbon 
intensity improvements are planned 
for 2018 to 2020. Our 2018 carbon 
budget process showed that we are 
on track to meet our 2020 target as 
we progress towards higher energy 
efficiency levels and carbon-efficient 
operational changes.
How we are taking action
We use renewable energy sources 
where possible; renewable sources 
deliver 13.5% of our total energy 
needs (2016: 14% excluding Glencore 
Agriculture). In Australia, we use  
coal seam gas from our mines to 
supplement power generation at a 
number of our assets and have flares 
installed at those underground coal 
mines with the necessary supply  
and concentration of methane.

We play an active role in engaging 
with governments and other 
interested stakeholders to develop 
strategies for reducing the impact of 
climate change. We actively support 
the development of low emission 
technologies and some renewable 
energy sources.
We are investing in a number of low 
carbon energy projects that address 
direct and indirect emissions from 
our operations. They include 
treatment of fugitive emissions from 
coal processing and ventilation air 
methane and the large-scale CCS 
coal energy demonstration project 
(feasibility stage) in Australia 
(described on page 32).
Reporting on our emissions
We divide CO
2
 emissions reporting 
into three different scopes, in line 
with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 
and measure both the direct  
and indirect emissions generated  
by the industrial activities, entities  
and facilities where we have 
operational control.
During 2017, we emitted 21.6 million 
tonnes CO
2
e of Scope 1 (direct 
emissions) from our consumed fuel. 
This figure includes emissions from 
reductants used in our metallurgical 
smelters. It also includes CO
2
e  
of methane emissions from our 
operations, which is around 36% 
of our Scope 1 emissions. The 
reduction in Scope 1 emissions  
is mainly due to lower coal seam 
emissions at our Australian  
coal operations.
In 2017, we emitted 1 1.9 million 
tonnes CO
2
 of Scope 2 location-based 
(indirect emissions) which applied 
appropriate country-by-country  
grid emission factors to all of our 
purchased electricity, regardless  
of specific renewable electricity 
contracts. Our Scope 2 reduction  
was mainly due to the closure of  
our Alumina operations in early 2016, 
as well as some energy efficiency 
gains at our ferroalloys smelters.

The International Energy Agency has 
identified CCS as a vital technology  
if the world is to meet its greenhouse 
gas reduction targets. 
Since 2009, Glencore has participated 
in a number of Australian low-emission  
technology projects. 
One of these is the Integrated  
Surat Basin CCS project, which was  
established in 2010 to demonstrate  
the effectiveness of CCS technology  
in the region. 
The purpose of the study is to  
deliver an integrated CCS project 
incorporating carbon capture, 
transport and sequestration to 
establish a basis for permitting of  
long-term CO
2
 storage in a suitable 
location in Queensland. 
This study will provide a framework  
for a genuine best practice model  
to deliver a viable commercial 
approach to reducing CO
2
 emissions  
in Queensland and elsewhere in 
Australia, reducing Australia’s overall 
carbon footprint and benefiting all 
emitters of CO
2
 requiring storage.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Financial Stability Board’s Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) 
We support the recently published 
recommendations of the Financial 
Stability Board’s TCFD. The TCFD has 
developed a voluntary framework for 
the reporting of climate-related 
financial risk disclosures for use  
by lenders, insurers, investors and 
other stakeholders. 
We welcome the opportunity  
to engage with our stakeholders  
on climate change matters and 
report on our progress against the  
Aiming for A initiative. During 2017, 
we produced the second edition of 
our Climate Change Considerations 
for our Business publication. This 
publication analyses the robustness 
of our portfolio against climate-
related scenarios and provides  
an assessment of the risks and 
opportunities available to Glencore  
in a low-carbon economy.
In response to the guidance 
produced by the TCFD, we have 
provided a cross-reference table  
on page 32. The table references  
the sections in this report and  
other publications that meet the  
guidance of the TCFD.
Water and effluents
Water is an essential component of 
our business activities. We recognise 
that water is a shared and finite 
resource and we are conscious of  
the increasing concerns of our local 
stakeholders and other local water 
users regarding ongoing availability  
of water, security of access and the 
potential for impacts on water supply. 
We are committed to managing  
our impact on water resources 
responsibly. We prioritise efficient 
water use, water reuse/recycling, 
responsible waste water disposal  
and maintaining any equipment that 
may pose a hazard to water quality. 
We engage with local water users to 
avoid material adverse impacts on 
the quality and quantity of local 
water sources or compromising  
their access to water.
In 2017, we withdrew 924 million m
3
 
of water (2016: 971 million m
3
 or 
829 million m
3
 excluding Glencore 
Agriculture). The like-for-like increase 
is mainly due to two assets increasing 
their dewatering efforts as their 
operational profiles reached 
groundwater aquifers and all assets 
aligning with our revised water 
reporting requirements.
We are an active member of the 
International Council on Mining & 
Metals (ICMM)’s water management 
working group and participated  
in the development of its Position 
Statement on Water Stewardship. 
During 2017, our internal water 
working group finalised our water 
management guideline in line with 
the ICMM’s position statement on 
water and water management 
framework. Furthermore we 
completed our high-risk site 
assessments related to water and  
set up a process for the internal 
sharing of best water-related 
practices. In 2017, we harmonised  
our water metrics to align with the 
Water Accounting Framework (WAF) 
of the Minerals Council of Australia. 
Going forward, we will pilot the 
ICMM’s catchment-based approach 
to water management during the 
first half of 2018. Catchment-based 
water management is a 
comprehensive, systematic approach 
to identifying, evaluating and 
responding to local water-related 
risks through the lifecycle of an asset 
as well as capturing an asset’s impact 
on other local water users. 
We publicly report to the CDP Water 
Disclosure programme.

Information Community engagement and  
social commitment compliance 
The communities surrounding  
our operations are our neighbours, 
employees, business partners  
and future workforce. Through our 
commitment to two-way dialogue 
with our local communities, we aim 
to secure a broad base of support  
for our activities. We aim to foster 
sustainable growth where we 
operate. We work with communities 
to deliver socio-economic 
development through investment  
in infrastructure, procurement,  
health and education projects.
We contribute to society throughout 
our value chain, via employment, 
procurement, enterprise 
development, infrastructure and 
social investment programmes. 
Our community development 
programmes are an integral part  
of our community and stakeholder 
engagement strategies. We design 
our programmes to help reduce 
dependency on our operations, 
encourage self-reliance and 
contribute to sustainable growth  
in our host regions. In 2017,  
we spent $90 million on these 
programmes (2016: $84 million).
Human rights and  
grievance mechanisms
We prioritise respect for human  
rights everywhere that we operate. 
We uphold the human rights of our 
people and our local communities, 
including vulnerable groups such  
as women, children, indigenous 
people and victims of conflict.
Respect for human rights is 
enshrined in Glencore’s Code of 
Conduct, which lays out the essential 
requirements for our people and 
stems from our values. It also 
Waste and air emissions
Our operations emit emissions such 
as sulphur dioxide (SO
2
), dust and 
nitrogen oxide as well as generate 
waste, which can affect the 
environment and nearby 
communities. We monitor all material 
emissions and continuously look for 
ways to reduce those that pollute the 
air around us. Wherever we operate, 
we comply with relevant regulatory 
limits and/or international standards 
for air emissions regarding SO
2
.  
Our open cut operations emit dust 
from excavation and movement of 
material. We monitor dust levels at 
affected communities and minimise 
dust in a number of ways.
Our metal and coal assets generate 
tailings, which are stored in purpose-
built tailings storage facilities. We 
continuously monitor our tailings 
facilities for integrity and structural 
stability. Flooding and seismic activity 
are the main natural phenomena 
that may affect them. We have an 
ongoing assurance programme  
that specifically focuses on our 
tailings facilities. 
Our assets continually review their 
waste management procedures  
and identify opportunities for 
improvement, to minimise the  
impact of the waste we produce.
The increase in waste produced 
during 2017 was primarily due to 
increased stripping ratios at a 
number of assets and the reopening 
of an Australian coal operation.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 explicitly aligns our security 
procedures with the United Nations 
Voluntary Principles on Security and 
Human Rights (Voluntary Principles). 
We also endorse the Voluntary 
Principles within our public Group 
Human Rights Policy.
As a member of the Voluntary 
Principles Initiative, we are working 
with the member governments, 
companies and NGOs to develop 
further our approach towards human 
rights. We have implemented the 
Voluntary Principles at our assets  
with a high risk of human rights 
breaches since 2013.
Our Group Human Rights Policy 
applies to all Glencore operations  
and offices over which we have 
operational control. The policy 
requires our operations to identify 
and assess risks of human rights 
breaches as part of our general  
risk assessment processes, which 
include baseline and impact studies 
at existing operations and due  
diligence on new operations  
and business partners.
Assets conduct regular human  
rights training for their workforce.  
This covers general human rights 
awareness during day-to-day 
activities for our wider workforce,  
as well as focused Voluntary 
Principles training for our security 
employees and contractors.
At operations with a relatively high 
risk of breaches of security-related, 
human rights, we require our own 
employees and private security 
contractors to undergo specific 
training on human rights, aligned 
with the Voluntary Principles. Where 
possible, we also provide awareness-
raising sessions on the Voluntary 
Principles to public security forces 
deployed on our concessions.
All our operations are required to 
have in place grievance mechanisms 
that are accessible, accountable and 
fair, and that enable our stakeholders 
to raise concerns without fear of 
recrimination. We align our grievance 
mechanisms with the requirements 
of the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights.
As a member of the Voluntary 
Principles Initiative, we are working 
with the member governments, 
companies and NGOs to further 
develop our approach towards 
human rights.
During 2017, we received  
1,063 complaints from the 
communities living around our 
operations. The majority of the 
complaints received related to three 
assets, Chad E&P, Mount Isa Mines 
and Pasar, and concerned impacts 
from construction works (Chad) and 
emissions (Mount Isa and Pasar). 
Further details of such will be set  
out in our Sustainability Report.  
We take all complaints seriously  
and continuously look for new ways 
to minimise our impacts.
Product stewardship
Our products are vital to today’s 
society, creating devices used daily, all 
over the world. Our goal is to provide 
competitively priced commodities 
that meet our customers’ needs and 
contribute to global society, while 
addressing any associated health, 
societal and environmental risks.
We work with experts, industry 
consortia and our peers to study  
the properties and impacts of our 
products throughout their lifecycles, 
to spread understanding of our 
products. We engage with a broad 
range of stakeholders, including civil 
society, governments and our 
customers, to promote responsible 
commodity sourcing. In 2017, 
Glencore did not produce, process  
or market any ‘conflict minerals’ 
originating from the conflict areas  
as defined under the Dodd-Frank  
Act (tin, tungsten, tantalum  
and gold from the DRC and  
adjoining countries).

Additional  
Information Not only do we have a diversified 
portfolio of commodities and 
services, our presence in 90 
marketing offices and 150 assets in 
more than 50 countries means our 
people are varied, too. In our Baar 
corporate office, we employ people 
from 54 different nationalities, with 
the gender balance approaching 
40% female. Details of senior 
management diversity is set out  
on page 90.
Our people
We are proud of our people and our 
shared commitment to who we are, 
what we do and to continuously 
improving the impact of our actions. 
We recognise that our presence can 
bring significant economic benefits 
to our operating countries and the 
communities living near to our assets. 
Where possible, we employ  
locally and our training and skills-
development programmes support 
this ambition. Reflecting the diversity 
of our business and workforce, we 
tailor our training programmes to 
meet the skills needed in the 
communities that support our assets. 
The success of our business is reliant 
on attracting and retaining the  
best people at every level. We offer 
regular assessments of skill levels  
and competence, with the aim of 
identifying good performance, talent 
and potential, and offering suitable 
rewards, development opportunities, 
and support. 
We periodically review the skills of  
our current workforce against future 
business requirements and take the 
necessary steps to match available 
talent against our current and  
future requirements. When 
appropriate, employees receive 
training and skills development  
to support their advancement. 
During the year, a number of our 
regional businesses were recognised 
for their efforts to develop and 
support their employees:
• our Australian copper business 
received industry awards 
recognising its outstanding 
achievement in vocational 
education and training 
• our Canadian Raglan nickel mine 
was recognised by the Conseil du 
Patronat of Quebec for high rates 
of job retention. This is particularly 
pleasing considering the harsh 
operating environment in the  
far north of Canada 
Our global rate of turnover was  
9%; similar to that experienced  
in 2016 (10%).
Union relations
We recognise and uphold the rights 
of our workforce to a safe workplace 
and collective representation and 
freedom of association. We are 
committed to working honestly  
and openly with labour unions  
at all of our locations and treating  
all employees with respect.
While several of our assets 
successfully engaged in labour 
re-negotiations during 2017, there 
were various instances where labour 
disputes occurred. Although where 
we find ourselves in dispute with our 
labour force or a part of it we usually 
can find an acceptable solution 
through negotiation, occasionally  
a situation can be challenging. 
Our people
Our employees and contractors  
are fundamental to our success.
At Glencore, our people are at the 
heart of everything we do. We foster 
an environment where our different 
backgrounds, cultures and beliefs  
are supported and encouraged. We 
recognise that diversity brings new 
ideas, innovation and different ways 
of working and that mutual respect 
leads to a driven workforce, 
dedicated to our common goals.
We respect and implement relevant 
local regulations and the International 
Labour Organization Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights  
at Work.
Diversity
Reflecting the wide geographic 
footprint of our workplaces, diversity 
is at the core of Glencore’s approach 
to its people. Our diversity policy 
promotes a diverse and inclusive 
workforce. We have established 
guiding principles to improve 
gender balance, encourage and 
support diversity and to prevent 
discrimination of gender or any 
other diverse attribute. Our principles 
support increased diversity awareness 
throughout our business. 
Group-wide, we employ  
12,037 women, which is 14%  
of our employees.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 At CEZ, a zinc refinery in Canada, 
owned by the Noranda Income Fund 
(NIF) and in which Glencore has a 
25% stake and operates, members of 
the United Steelworkers Union (USW) 
went on strike in February. The labour 
dispute resulted from the NIF’s cost 
reduction initiatives to adjust to 
market terms after the conclusion of 
a 15-year term where the NIF enjoyed 
the advantage of fixed processing 
fees. In November, the 371 members 
of the USW voted in favour of a  
new six-year collective agreement. 
The agreement was a compromise 
between the NIF’s need to restructure 
its cost base and the USW’s goal  
of keeping its members’ pension 
benefits unchanged.
During 2017, in Australia, we 
negotiated new enterprise 
agreements (EAs) with local 
Construction, Forestry, Mining and 
Energy Union (CFMEU) lodges  
at 13 of our coal operations. At our 
Oaky North mine we have been 
negotiating with the CFMEU on a 
new agreement for nearly three years. 
In early 2018, following an extended 
labour dispute, we reached an 
in-principle agreement with national, 
state and local CFMEU leaders; 
regrettably Oaky North’s union 
members voted against the 
proposed agreement that would 
have resulted in a return to work.  
The in-principle agreed EA positions 
the mine for a successful future. 
Wellbeing
Our entire workforce shares 
responsibility for creating, fostering 
and maintaining a culture of safe 
work. Our goal is a trained, competent 
and motivated workforce. We actively 
promote and support health and 
wellness programmes for all of our 
workers. Additionally, confidential  
and voluntary counselling services  
are made available to our employees 
and their dependents to help  
resolve both personal and work-
related problems. 
Our progress in 2017
During the year, we continued 
to advance the perception of our 
employer brand. We took steps 
to improve the consistency of our 
employee communications, to 
address transparently public  
concerns and to engage actively  
with interested stakeholders. 
Together, these efforts are reinforcing 
Glencore’s position as an employer  
of choice in the main markets in 
which we operate.
Our Fundamental Values
Our objectives and policies towards 
our people reflect our values:
Safety
Our first priority in the workplace is  
to protect the health and well-being 
of all our people. We take a proactive 
approach to health and safety; our 
goal is continuous improvement in 
the prevention of occupational 
disease and injuries
Entrepreneurialism
Our approach fosters the highest 
level of professionalism, personal 
ownership and entrepreneurial spirit 
in all our people while never 
compromising on their safety  
and well-being. This is important  
to our success and the superior 
returns we aim to achieve for all  
our stakeholders.
Simplicity
We aim to achieve our key 
deliverables efficiently as a path  
to industry-leading returns, while 
maintaining a clear focus on 
excellence, quality, sustainability  
and continuous improvement  
in everything we do.
Responsibility
We recognise that our work can  
have an impact on our society and 
the environment. We care about  
our performance in relation to 
environmental protection, human 
rights, and health and safety.
Openness
We value open relationships and 
communication based on integrity, 
co-operation, transparency and 
mutual benefit, with our people,  
our customers, our suppliers, 
governments and society in general.

Compliance
Glencore’s success is founded on a 
reputation, built over many years,  
as being an honest and reliable  
business partner. By upholding our 
commitment to ethical business 
practices, we seek to maintain this 
reputation and meet our long-term 
objectives through being regarded  
as a business partner of choice.
Our Approach
We seek to maintain a culture of 
ethical behaviour and compliance 
throughout the Group, rather than 
simply performing the minimum 
required by laws and regulations. 
We will not knowingly assist any  
third party in breaching the law, or 
participate in any criminal, fraudulent 
or corrupt practice in any country.
To support this, we have 
implemented a Group compliance 
programme that includes a range  
of policies, procedures, guidelines, 
training and monitoring. 
Our permanent and temporary 
employees, directors and officers (as 
well as contractors, where they are 
under a relevant contractual 
obligation) must comply with our 
compliance policies, procedures and 
guidelines that apply to their work,  
in addition to complying with 
applicable laws and regulations. 
When we enter into joint ventures 
where we are not the operator, we 
seek to influence our partners to 
adopt similar policies to ours.
Group Policy Framework
Our policy framework encompasses 
our values, Code of Conduct and 
policies, procedures and guidelines 
on various compliance topics 
including anti-corruption, sanctions, 
anti-money laundering, the 
prevention of fraud, market abuse, 
the prevention of the facilitation of 
tax evasion, anti-trust, data protection 
and conflict of interest. This 
framework reflects our commitment 
to uphold good business practices 
and to meet or exceed applicable 
laws and external requirements.  
We emphasise their importance  
in our business activities, including 
recruitment, induction, supplier 
briefings and external engagement 
activities. Training and awareness on 
our policies, procedures and 
guidelines, as well as strong 
leadership, are critical components  
of our compliance programme.  
They ensure our employees 
understand the behaviour expected 
of them and provide guidance on 
how they can identify and practically 
approach legal and ethical dilemmas 
in their daily work lives.
Compliance officers are full time 
compliance employees who provide 
dedicated compliance support to the 
business. Compliance coordinators, 
guided by the Group compliance 
team, take on the role in addition to 
their primary role. They support our 
employees in day-to-day business 
considerations, particularly those 
seeking advice on ethical, lawful 
behaviour or policy implementation. 
The Group currently has 
1 1 1 compliance officers and 
coordinators. Employees may access 
the telephone, email and postal 
contact details of our compliance 
officers and coordinators via the 
Group intranet, their local intranet 
and notice boards. 
Employees can access the 
compliance policies, procedures and 
guidelines through various channels, 
including via the compliance team, 
the Group intranet or local intranet of 
the specific asset at which they work. 
Our managers and supervisors are 
responsible for ensuring employees 
understand and comply with the 
policies and procedures. We monitor 
and test their implementation on  
a regular basis. Employees and 
contractors who have access to a 
work computer must confirm their 
awareness and understanding  
of our compliance requirements 
electronically every year. Certain 
assets implement their own policies 
and procedures in addition to those 
of the Group. These are designed to 
address specific local requirements, 
while being consistent with our  
policy framework.
In accordance with our Code of 
Conduct, anybody working for 
Glencore who breaches the law, the 
Code of Conduct, or other policies or 
procedures may face disciplinary 
action including dismissal. In 2017, 
Glencore dismissed 284 employees 
(2016: 318 and 2015: 523) for 
breaching the Code of Conduct.  
The dismissals predominantly related 
to failures to follow safety instructions 
or policies, or misappropriation of 
company property.
The Group Business Ethics 
Committee (BEC)
The BEC comprises Glencore’s CEO, 
senior management and members  
of the compliance team, as well as 
external counsel. The BEC considers 
compliance issues relevant to the 
Group and reviews and approves our 
policies, procedures and guidelines. 
The BEC reports to the Audit 
Committee. The policies, procedures 
and guidelines approved by the BEC 
are implemented by our compliance 
team. The BEC meets two times per 
year and its sub-committee meets 
four times per year to consider in 
more detail matters addressed  
by the BEC. 
38
Glencore Annual Report 2017 Training and Awareness
Our employees receive induction 
sessions and ongoing training on a 
range of compliance issues. In 2017, 
31,737 employees and contractors 
(2016: 29,569) completed our Code of 
Conduct e-learning, which includes 
guidance on raising concerns. In 
addition, 22,872 (2016: 20,1 19) 
completed e-learning training on our 
global anti-corruption policy, which 
includes guidance on giving and 
receiving gifts and entertainment. 
The target audience of the Code of 
Conduct e-Learning is employees 
with regular access to a work 
computer and the training on 
anti-corruption targets those whose 
function may require them to interact 
with third parties. For those 
employees who do not have regular 
access to a work computer, we 
provide training in other ways 
including induction sessions, pre-shift 
general training and toolbox talks. In 
addition, compliance officers and 
coordinators conduct face-to-face 
training for relevant employees to 
raise awareness about compliance 
risks related to their functions and to 
train them on Glencore’s compliance 
policies and procedures. 
Monitoring
As part of the Group compliance 
programme, we conduct monitoring 
to test and verify compliance with  
the Group policies, procedures and 
guidelines and with the laws and 
regulations applicable to Glencore’s 
marketing and industrial activities. 
This entails performing periodic and 
ad hoc testing reviews in accordance 
with the corporate testing and 
monitoring plans, analysing 
documents and procedures and, 
in the case of findings, collaborating 
with the relevant marketing office or 
industrial operation to determine 
the most appropriate course of 
action, including any required 
corrective action.
Bribery and corruption
Glencore’s Global Anti-Corruption 
Policy is available on the Group 
website. It contains our clear position 
on bribery and corruption: the 
offering, paying, authorising,  
soliciting or accepting of bribes is 
unacceptable. We conduct analysis 
for corruption risks within our 
businesses and seek to address these 
risks through policies and procedures, 
training and awareness raising, 
monitoring and controls.
Glencore is a member of the 
Partnering Against Corruption 
Initiative (PACI). Members collaborate 
on collective action and share leading 
practice in organisational compliance. 
The initiative is based on a 
commitment to zero tolerance on 
bribery and implementation of 
practical and effective anticorruption 
programmes. We are also an 
associate member of the Maritime 
Anti-Corruption Network (MACN).
The Group has also implemented the 
Third Party Due Diligence Procedures 
which seek to ensure that our third 
party relationships are in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations 
and the Global Anti-Corruption Policy. 
The procedures set out a process 
whereby circumstances that may 
pose a corruption risk are reviewed, 
addressed and taken into 
consideration when deciding 
whether and on which conditions  
to proceed with a third party 
relationship, particularly 
intermediaries, joint-ventures and 
service providers on a risk basis. 
Sanctions
Glencore is committed to respecting, 
upholding and complying with all 
sanctions applicable to our business 
and to all transactions in which we 
engage, regardless of our role or 
location. The applicability and scope 
of the applicable sanctions can differ 
per transaction, jurisdiction and other 
factors. The Glencore Global 
Sanctions Policy sets our approach  
to sanctions and how we seek to 
comply with applicable sanctions 
and appropriately manage sanctions 
risk. The Glencore Sanctions 
Procedures outline the steps and 
procedures we take to ensure 
compliance with the Global 
Sanctions Policy.
Prevention of Facilitation  
of Tax Evasion
The Group does not tolerate tax 
evasion of any kind, including 
facilitation of tax evasion by any 
person employed or contracted to 
the Group or acting on its behalf  
and has procedures which seek to 
prevent any such facilitation.
Reporting Misconduct
If one of our people encounters a 
situation that appears to breach our 
policy framework that individual 
must raise this promptly with his or 
her immediate supervisor or 
manager. Alternatively, the individual 
may raise the concern with another 
appropriate manager, compliance 
officer or coordinator, or a member  
of the BEC. If a concern remains

Definition
Adjusted EBIT/EBITDA provide insight into our  
overall business performance (a combination  
of cost management, seizing market opportunities 
and growth), and are the corresponding flow  
drivers towards our objective of achieving industry-
leading returns. 
Adjusted EBIT is the net result of revenue less cost of 
goods sold and selling and administrative expenses, 
plus share of income from associates and joint 
ventures, dividend income and the attributable share 
of Adjusted EBIT of relevant material associates and 
joint ventures, which are accounted for internally by 
means of proportionate consolidation, excluding 
Significant items, Adjusted EBITDA consists of 
Adjusted EBIT plus depreciation and amortisation, 
including the related Proportionate adjustments. 
2017 performance
Adjusted EBITDA was $14,762 million and Adjusted 
EBIT was $8,552 million, increases of 44% and 118% 
respectively compared to 2016, primarily driven by 
higher commodity prices. 
Market sentiment and commodity prices continued 
to improve over 2017 following the cyclical lows 
reached over H1 2016. The positive impact of the 
higher prices on Adjusted EBITDA was somewhat 
tempered by moderate cost inflation and the effects 
of a weaker US dollar against most producer 
country currencies.

Funds from operations (FFO) is a measure that reflects 
our ability to generate cash for investment, debt 
servicing and distributions to shareholders. 
It comprises cash provided by operating activities 
before working capital changes, less tax and net 
interest payments plus dividends received, related 
Proportionate adjustments and Significant items, 
mainly comprising movements in coal related 
mark-to-market items.
2017 performance
FFO of $11.6 billion was 49% up on 2016, reflecting the 
improved Adjusted EBITDA noted above and a tax 
payments cycle reflective of last year’s lower earnings.

Definition
Net funding/Net debt demonstrates how our debt is 
being managed and is an important factor in ensuring 
we maintain an investment grade rating status and 
a competitive cost of capital. 
Net debt is defined as total current and non-current 
borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, readily 
marketable inventories and related Proportionate 
adjustments. The net debt assumed in the Volcan 
acquisition (completed mid-November 2017) has also 
been adjusted to provide a more consistent and 
comparative analysis, but mostly to reflect the Group’s 
relatively low 23.3% economic ownership (compared 
to its 63.0% voting interest) in this still fully ring-fenced 
listed entity, with its standalone, independent and 
separate capital structure. The relationship of FFO 
to net debt is an indication of our financial flexibility  
and strength. 
2017 performance
Net funding as at 31 December 2017 increased by 
$279 million to $32,898 million, whereas net debt (net 
funding less readily marketable inventories) decreased 
by $4,853 million over the year to $10,673 million. 
The latter measurement reflecting the increase in 
readily marketable inventories ($5,132 million of the 
working capital outflow of $5,245 million) over the 
year due to a combination of increased commodity 
prices and further investments into the strengthening 
commodity market environment.
FFO to Net debt more than doubled to 108.3% in line 
with higher FFO and lower Net debt over the period.

2017 performance
We are saddened to report that in 2017 nine people 
lost their lives at our operations (2016: 16 people).  
All loss of life is unacceptable and we are determined 
to eliminate fatalities across our Group.
Our TRIFR is 3.09 per million hours worked, an 
improvement over 4.05 recorded in 2016. We remain 
on track to meet our long-term TRIFR goal of a 50% 
reduction by 2020 using our 2014 TRIFR of 5.02 as

Definition
Our CO2 emissions reporting is separated into  
Scope 1 and Scope 2 – location-based emissions. 
Scope 1 includes emissions from combustion in 
owned or controlled boilers, furnaces and vehicles/ 
vessels and coal seam emissions.
Scope 2 – location-based emissions applies the  
grid emission factor to all our purchased electricity, 
regardless of specific renewable electricity contracts. 
We monitor and report both the direct and  
indirect emissions generated by the industrial 
activities, entities and facilities where we have 
operational control.
2017 performance
During 2017, we emitted 21.6 million tonnes CO2e  
of Scope 1 (direct emissions). The improvement over 
2016 is mainly as a result of lower coal seam emissions 
in our Australian coal operations. 
We emitted 11.9 million tonnes CO2 of Scope 2 – 
location based (indirect emissions). The small 
reduction in Scope 2 emissions was caused by the 
closure of Sherwin Alumina and some energy 
efficiency gains in our Ferroalloys smelters.

in the regions where we operate. 
Funds are set aside to support initiatives that benefit 
communities and local sustainable development.  
We also make in-kind contributions, such as 
equipment and management. We support 
programmes for community development,  
enterprise and job creation, health, education  
and the environment.
2017 performance
In 2017, the funds we made available for  
community investments were $90 million, an  
increase on the amount invested in 2016 ($84 million). 
Our community development programmes are an 
integral part of our community and stakeholder 
engagement strategies and our investments 
supported various initiatives in all of our  
operating regions.

Additional  
Information Principal risks 
and uncertainties
Glencore is exposed to a variety of risks that can have an impact on our 
business and prospects, future performance, financial position, liquidity, 
asset values, growth potential, sustainable development and reputation
Therefore, risk management is one of the key responsibilities of the  
Board and its Audit and HSEC Committees. Our principal risks and 
uncertainties – whether under our control or not – are highly dynamic  
and our assessment and our responses to them are critical to our future 
business and prospects
Our risk management framework 
identifies and manages risk in a way 
that is supportive of our strategic 
priorities of opportunistically 
deploying capital, while protecting 
our future financial security and 
flexibility. Our approach towards  
risk management is framed by our 
ongoing understanding of the risks 
that we are exposed to, our risk 
appetite and how these risks  
change over time. 
The Board assesses and approves our 
overall risk appetite, monitors our risk 
exposure and sets the Group-wide 
limits, which are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. This process is 
supported by the Audit and HSEC 
Committees, whose roles include 
evaluating and monitoring the risks 
inherent in their respective areas as 
described on pages 92–93. The 
current assessment of our principal 
risks, according to exposure and 
impact, is detailed on the following 
pages. In accordance with UK 
Financial Reporting Council guidance, 
we define a principal risk as a risk 
or combination of risks that can 
seriously affect the performance, 
future prospects or reputation of 
Glencore. These include those risks 
which would threaten the business 
model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity of the Group. We look at 
risk appetite from the context of 
severity of the consequences  
should the risk materialise, factors 
influencing the risk and the 
Company’s ability to mitigate it.  
In compiling this assessment we have 
indicated the impact and likelihood 
of these risks in comparison with 
a year ago in the chart below.
The commentary on the risks in this 
section should be read in conjunction 
with the explanatory text under 
Understanding the information  
on risks which is set out on the 
following page.
The natural diversification of  
our portfolio of commodities, 
geographies, currencies, assets and 
liabilities is a source of mitigation for 
some of the risks we face. In addition, 
through our governance processes 
and our proactive management 
approach we seek to mitigate, where 
possible, the impacts of certain risks 
should they materialise. In particular:
• our liquidity risk management 
policy requires us to maintain 
(via a $3 billion minimum 
prescribed level) sufficient cash 
and cash equivalents and other 
sources of committed funding 
available to meet anticipated and 
unanticipated funding needs
• making use of credit enhancement 
products, such as letters of credit, 
insurance policies and bank 
guarantees and imposing limits  
on open accounts extended
• our management of marketing risk, 
including daily analysis of Group 
value at risk (VaR)
2017 developments
The following remain the leading 
risks (i.e. those posing the greatest 
potential threat) which the 
Group faces:
1.  Reduction in commodity prices: 
there has been a general rise in 
commodity prices over the past 
18 months. Notwithstanding these 
firmer price conditions, we remain 
mindful that underlying markets 
can be volatile and we continue to 
focus on the partially controllable 
element of the margin equation –  
costs. Any significant downturn  
in the current commodity price 
environment, especially in zinc, 
copper or coal, would have a 
severe drag on our financial 
performance. As a result, this 
continues to be the Group’s 
foremost risk.
2.  Fluctuations in supply of, or 
demand for commodities: the 
depression of commodity prices 
reflects the actual, perceived  
or prospective increases in  
supply of commodities and/or  
reductions in demand.
3.  Fluctuations in currency exchange 
rates: the rise in commodity prices 
noted above is associated with a 
generally weaker U.S. dollar versus 
producer country currencies. 
Although strong producer 
currencies are generally detrimental 
over the short term to our locally 
denominated operating costs, this 
can be outweighed by stronger 
42
Glencore Annual Report 2017 world economic conditions  
and the associated increases in 
commodity prices that may derive 
from this. Additionally, currency 
rates can change for political and 
economic reasons unlinked to the 
commodities markets, which could 
result in a mismatched impact of 
pricing and currency movements 
resulting in income volatility. 
4.  Health, safety, environment 
including catastrophic hazards: 
a serious failure in safety, health 
and environmental management 
could result in an operational 
emergency or catastrophe, injuries 
or fatalities and a negative impact 
on our corporate reputation. 
In particular, catastrophic  
hazards such as tailings leakages 
and collapses of pit walls or 
underground tunnels represent 
significant unquantifiable risks  
for resources companies. During 
2017, the HSEC Committee 
continued to concentrate on  
the management and mitigation  
of the Group’s catastrophic  
hazards – see page 100.
5.  Liquidity risk: while our net debt 
has further reduced in 2017, we 
remain cognisant that access to 
credit is vital and that debt  
markets can be volatile. 
Changes in risk exposure 
and analysis
As a result of the strong economic 
growth momentum seen over the 
past 18 months and the repositioning 
of our balance sheet and reduction in 
the cost and capex structures of our 
portfolio, the probability of liquidity 
risk and counterparty credit and 
performance exposures materialising 
has reduced. Climate change 
initiatives continue to be at the 
forefront during 2017. Many countries 
began to implement their 
commitments to address climate 
change, e.g. through announcing 
limits on the number of petrol/diesel 
cars to be produced or imposing 
production limits on certain 
industries. These events have led to 
an increase, compared to 2016, both 
in the probability of risk exposure and 
its impact related to emissions and 
climate change. 
In reassessing our risk analysis, we 
have concluded that: cyber should 
now be a stand-alone risk; sourcing, 
freight, storage infrastructure and 
logistics related risks no longer merit 
inclusion as a separate risk; and we 
have combined development and 
operating risks and cost control as 
Operating and cost risks as they are 
largely inter-related.

Information Principal risks 
and uncertainties
continued
There are many risks and uncertainties which have the 
potential to significantly impact our business, including 
competitive, economic, political, legal, regulatory, social, 
business and financial risk. The order in which these risks  
and uncertainties appear does not necessarily reflect the 
likelihood of their occurrence or the relative magnitude  
of their potential material adverse effect on our business.
We have sought to provide examples of specific risks. 
However, in every case these do not attempt to be an 
exhaustive list. These principal risks and uncertainties should 
be considered in connection with any forward looking 
statements in this document as explained on page 220.
Identifying, quantifying and managing risk is complex and 
challenging. Although it is our policy to identify and, where 
appropriate and practical, actively manage risk, our policies 
and procedures may not adequately identify, monitor and 
quantify all risks.
This section describes our attempts to manage, balance or 
offset risk. Risk is, however, by its very nature uncertain and 
inevitably events may lead to our policies and procedures not 
having a material mitigating effect on the negative impacts  
of the occurrence of a particular event. Our scenario planning 
and stress testing may accordingly prove to be optimistic, 
particularly in situations where material negative events  
occur in close proximity. Since many risks are connected,  
our analysis should be read against all risks to which it may  
be relevant. 
In this section, we have sought to update our explanations, 
reflecting our current outlook. Mostly this entails emphasising 
certain risks more strongly than other risks rather than the 
elimination of, or creation of, risks. Certain investors may also 
be familiar with the risk factors that are published in the 
Group debt or equity prospectuses or listing documents. 
These provide in part some differing descriptions of our 
principal risks. A recent example is available on our website  
at: http://www.glencore.com/who-we-are/governance 
Understanding the information on risks
In addition, more information on our risks is available in the 
relevant sections of our website. 
To provide for concise text:
• where we hold minority interests in certain businesses, 
although these entities are not generally subsidiaries, the 
interests are mostly taken as being referred to in analysing 
these risks, and “business” refers to these and any business  
of the Group
• where we refer to natural hazards, events of nature or similar 
phraseology we are referring to matters such as earthquake, 
flood, severe weather and other natural phenomena
• where we refer to “mitigation” we do not intend to suggest 
that we eliminate the risk, but rather it shows the Group’s 
attempt to reduce or manage the risk. Our mitigation of risks 
will usually include the taking out of insurance where it is 
customary and economic to do so
• this section should be read as a whole – often commentary 
in one section is relevant to other risks
• “commodity/ies” will usually refer to those commodities 
which the Group produces or sells
• “law” includes regulation of any type
• “risk” includes uncertainty and hazard and together with 
“material adverse effect on the business” should be

Longer-term viability 
In accordance with the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Board has assessed the 
prospects of the Group’s viability over 
the four-year period from 1 January 
2018. This period is consistent with 
the Group’s established annual 
business planning and forecasting 
processes and cycle which is subject 
to review and approval each year  
by the Board. The four-year plan 
considers Glencore’s Adjusted 
EBITDA, Capital expenditure, Funds 
from operations (FFO) and Net debt, 
and the key financial ratios of Net 
debt to Adjusted EBITDA and FFO  
to Net debt over the forecasted  
years and incorporates stress tests  
to simulate the potential impacts  
of exposure to the Group’s principal  
risks and uncertainties.
These scenarios included:
• a prolonged downturn in the price 
and demand of commodities most 
impacting Glencore’s operations
• foreign exchange movements to 
which the Group is exposed as a 
result of its global operations
• consideration of the potential 
impact of adverse movements in 
macro-economic assumptions and 
their effect on certain key financial 
KPIs and ratios which could 
increase the Group’s access  
to or cost of funding
The scenarios were assessed taking 
into account current risk appetite and 
any mitigating actions Glencore could 
take, as required, in response to the 
potential realisation of any of the 
stressed scenarios.
Based on the results of the related 
analysis, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the four-year period 
of this assessment. They also believe 
that the review period of four years  
is appropriate having regard to the 
Group’s business model, strategy, 
principal risks and uncertainties, 
and viability.

Reductions in commodity prices Risk movement in 2017: Stable
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Low. Outside of the inherent risk of commodity prices on unmined reserves/
resources, flat price exposure on extracted or trading related positions is to be hedged.
The revenue and earnings of substantial 
parts of our industrial activities and, to a 
lesser extent, our marketing activities, are 
dependent upon prevailing commodity 
prices. Commodity prices are influenced by 
a number of external factors, including the 
supply of and demand for commodities, 
speculative activities by market participants, 
global political and economic conditions, 
related industry cycles and production costs 
in major producing countries. 
A significant downturn in the price of 
commodities generally results in a decline 
in our profitability and could potentially result 
in impairment and balance sheet constraints. 
It is especially harmful to profitability in the 
industrial activities, which are more directly 
exposed to price risk due to the higher level 
of fixed costs. 
The dependence of the Group (especially our 
industrial business) on commodity prices, 
make this the Group’s foremost risk. See the 
Chief Executive Officer’s review on page 4 
and the financial review on page 52.
Any economic developments, particularly 
impacting China and other fast growing 
countries, could lead to reductions in 
demand for, and consequently prices 
of, commodities.
Diversification of our portfolio of commodities, 
geographies, currencies, assets and liabilities. 
Government policy decisions can be very 
important, e.g. in reducing the demand for  
coal or increasing its pricing (via carbon taxes) –  
see Emissions and climate change below.  
New or improved energy production or 
technologies can also reduce the demand  
for some commodities such as coal.
Also see our longer-term viability analysis above 
and the business review on page 60.

Fluctuations in the supply of, or demand for, the commodities in which we operate Risk movement in 2017: Stable
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Low. Although an inherent risk in the extractive and marketing industries,  
we seek to ensure this risk is minimised through scale of operations and diversity of product. 
We are dependent on the expected volumes 
of supply or demand for commodities 
which can vary for many reasons, such  
as competitor supply policies, changes  
in resource availability, government policies 
and regulation, costs of production, global 
and regional economic conditions, demand 
in end markets for products in which the 
commodities are used. These also include 
technological developments, e.g. commodity 
substitutions, fluctuations in global 
production capacity, global and regional 
weather conditions, natural disasters and 
diseases, all of which impact global markets 
and demand for commodities. Furthermore, 
changes in expected supply and demand 
conditions impact the expected future  
prices (and thus the price curve) of  
each commodity. 
Future demand for certain commodities 
might decline (fossil fuels), whereas others 
might increase (such as copper, cobalt, and 
nickel for their use in electric vehicles and 
batteries), taking into consideration the 
“greening” of the global economy. 
This risk is currently prevalent in various 
commodities, such as steel, coal and oil. 
In particular, many analysts believe that 
demand for coal will reduce sooner than 
previously expected due to significant cost 
reductions in renewable capacity and greater 
efficiencies from coal power plants. 
Also see Emissions and climate 
change below.
Market price responses to such changes 
are neither instantaneous nor perfectly 
calibrated nor can the sustained 
implementation of such policies be certain.
Diversification of our portfolio of commodities, 
geographies, currencies, assets and liabilities.
Making sure we are prepared for the shift in 
commodity demand by putting a special focus 
on the parts of the business that will potentially 
grow with the anticipated increase of electric 
vehicles and battery production and closely 
monitor fossil fuel (particularly thermal 
coal) demands.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates Risk movement in 2017: Stable
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Low. Where possible foreign exchange exposure to non operating foreign exchange 
risk are to be hedged.
The vast majority of our transactions are 
denominated in U.S. dollars, while operating 
costs are spread across many different 
countries, the currencies of which fluctuate 
against the U.S. dollar. A depreciation in the 
value of the U.S. dollar against one or more  
of these currencies will result in an increase  
in the cost base of the relevant operations  
in U.S. dollar terms. 
The main currency exchange rate exposure 
is through our industrial assets, as a large 
proportion of the costs incurred by these 
operations is denominated in the currency  
of the country in which each asset is located.  
The largest of these exposures are to the 
currencies listed on page 61.
Currency fluctuations tend to move in 
symmetry with those in commodity prices 
and supply and demand fundamentals as 
noted above, such that decreases in 
commodity prices are generally associated 
with increases in the U.S. dollar relative to 
local producer currencies and vice versa. 
If this occurs then it is detrimental to us 
through higher equivalent U.S. dollar 
operating costs at the relevant operations. 
This negative, however, would usually be 
offset to some extent by the increases 
in commodity prices which had caused 
this change.
In respect of commodity purchase and sale 
transactions denominated in currencies other 
than U.S. dollars, the Group’s policy is usually to 
hedge the specific future commitment through 
a forward exchange contract. From time to time, 
the Group may hedge a portion of its currency 
exposures and requirements in an attempt 
to limit any adverse effect of exchange 
rate fluctuations.

Geopolitical risk including social unrest Risk movement in 2017: Stable
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: High. We operate in countries with less developed political regimes. To be 
considered a truly diversified commodities group, operations in these jurisdictions are required.
We operate and own assets in a large 
number of geographic regions and countries, 
some of which are categorised as developing, 
complex or having unstable political or social 
climates. As a result, we are exposed to a 
wide range of political, economic, regulatory, 
social and tax environments. The Group 
transacts business in locations where  
it is exposed to a risk of overt or effective 
expropriation – resource nationalism 
continues to be a challenging issue in  
many countries. Our operations may also  
be affected by political and economic 
instability, including terrorism, civil disorder, 
violent crime, war and social unrest. 
Increased scrutiny by governments and 
tax authorities in pursuit of perceived 
aggressive tax structuring by multinational 
companies has elevated potential tax 
exposures for the Group. 
Policies or laws in the countries in which we 
do business may change in a manner that 
may be adverse for us, even those with  
stable political environments e.g. many 
governments have sought additional sources 
of revenue by increasing rates of taxation, 
royalties or resource rent taxes.
We have no control over changes to policies, 
laws and taxes.
The OECD tax reporting initiative on Base 
Erosion and Profit Sharing (BEPS) is now 
effective and in 2018 the Group will report for 
the first time with regard to the 2017 tax year.
The continued operation of our existing 
assets and future plans are in part dependent 
upon broad support, our ‘‘social licence to 
operate’’, and a healthy relationship with the 
respective local communities – see further 
Community Relations and Skills availability 
and retention concerning workforce disputes.
The Group’s industrial assets are diversified 
across various countries. Also, the Group 
continues to actively engage with governmental 
authorities in light of upcoming changes  
and developments in legislation and 
enforcement policies. 
See map on page 3 which sets out our global 
operational footprint.
In 2017, we also published our second Payments 
to Governments report. This detailed total 
government contributions in 2016 of around 
$4 billion. We also continue to be an active 
member of the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI).

Laws, regulations, enforcement, permits and licences to operate Risk movement in 2017: Stable
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Medium. The Group maintains programmes which seek to ensure that we comply 
with or exceed the laws and external requirements applicable to our operations and products. 
However, some of our industrial activities are located in countries that are categorised as 
developing, complex or having political or social climates and/or where corruption is generally 
understood to exist.
We are exposed to extensive laws including 
those relating to bribery and corruption, 
sanctions, taxation, anti-trust, financial 
markets regulation, environmental protection, 
use of hazardous substances, product  
safety and dangerous goods regulations, 
development of natural resources, licences 
over resources, exploration, production and 
post-closure reclamation, employment of 
labour and occupational health and safety 
standards and preservation. The terms 
attaching to any permit or licence to operate 
may also be onerous and obtaining these  
and other approvals, which may be revoked, 
can be particularly onerous to comply with. 
Furthermore, in certain countries title to land 
and rights and permits in respect of resources 
are not always clear or may be challenged.
The legal system and dispute resolution 
mechanisms in some countries may be 
uncertain so that we may be unable to 
enforce our understanding of our rights. 
Successful lawsuits based upon damage 
resulting from operations could lead to the 
imposition of substantial penalties, the 
cessation of operations, compensation  
and remedial and/or preventative orders. 
Moreover, the costs associated with legal 
compliance, including regulatory permits,  
are substantial and increasing. Any changes 
to these laws or their more stringent 
enforcement or restrictive interpretation 
could cause additional significant 
expenditure to be incurred or cause 
suspensions of operations and delays in the 
development of industrial assets. Failure to 
obtain or renew a necessary permit or the 
occurrence of other disputes could mean 
that we would be unable to proceed with the 
development or continued operation of an 
asset and/or impede our ability to develop 
new industrial properties. 
As a diversified sourcing, marketing and 
distribution company conducting complex 
transactions globally, we are exposed to the 
risks of fraud, corruption, sanctions breaches 
and other unlawful activities both internally 
and externally. Our marketing operations are 
large in scale, which may make fraudulent  
or accidental transactions difficult to detect. 
In addition, some of our industrial activities 
are located in countries, such as the DRC, 
where corruption is generally understood to 
exist. Corruption and sanctions risks remain  
highly relevant for businesses operating in 
international markets as shown by recent 
regulatory enforcement actions both inside 
and outside the resources sector.
Since 2007 the Group has had various 
business dealings with entities associated 
with Dan Gertler in connection with its 
copper assets in the DRC. In December 2017 
the United States government designated 
Dan Gertler and affiliated companies as 
Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs), 
thereby imposing blocking sanctions on 
them and companies owned 50% or more  
by them, under Executive Order 13818, titled 
“Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in 
Serious Human Rights Abuses or Corruption”. 
The Group has pre-existing contractual 
obligations to make royalty and pas-de-porte 
payments in respect of KCC and Mutanda to 
certain of these companies which pre-date 
the SDN designation and which arose  
when the companies acquired rights from 
Gecamines. The Group has not made any 
payment to the companies since the SDN 
designation. The Group is still considering 
how best to mitigate its risks in relation  
to these obligations.
In January 2018, the DRC parliament  
adopted a revised Mining Code. This  
includes significant increases in royalties, 
taxes, government ownership requirements 
and repatriation restrictions and terminates 
retroactively the 10-year stability clause that 
exists in the current Mining Code. If the 
revised Mining Code is promulgated and 
implemented in this form, it would have  
a significant impact on the investments  
of the Group in the DRC and their value.
During the year, a restatement of past 
financial statements at Katanga Mining 
Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, was 
required and the Ontario Securities 
Commission is investigating various matters 
relating to Katanga (see pages 92 and 97).
As KCC (Katanga’s 75% held main operating 
subsidiary) did not rectify a capital deficiency 
by 31 December 2017 as required by DRC 
corporate laws, an interested party may 
commence legal action before DRC judicial 
authorities. Katanga continues to assess 
options to address the capital deficiency 
including options which may partially 
adversely impact its entitlement to KCC’s 
future cash flows.
We seek to ensure full compliance through our 
commitment to complying with or exceeding 
the laws and external requirements applicable  
to our operations and products and through 
monitoring of legislative requirements, 
engagement with government and regulators, 
and compliance with the terms of permits and 
licences. We keep informed of new regulations 
and legal requirements. We seek to manage the 
risk of breaching applicable laws and external 
requirements through our policy framework 
which is described on page 91. However,  
there can be no assurance that such policies, 
procedures and controls will adequately protect 
the Group against fraud, corruption, sanctions 
breaches or other unlawful activities.

Liquidity risk Risk movement in 2017: Decrease
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Low. It is the Group’s policy to operate a BBB rating or above balance sheet and  
to ensure a minimum level of cash or committed funding is available at any given time.
Our failure to access funds (liquidity) would 
severely limit our ability to engage in 
desired activities. 
Liquidity risk is the risk that we are unable to 
meet our payment obligations when due, or 
are unable, on an ongoing basis, to borrow 
funds in the market at an acceptable price to 
fund our commitments. While we adjust our 
minimum internal liquidity threshold from 
time to time in response to changes in 
market conditions, this minimum internal 
liquidity target may be breached due to 
circumstances we are unable to control,  
such as general market disruptions, sharp 
movements in commodity prices or an 
operational problem that affects our 
suppliers, customers or ourselves.
 
A lack of liquidity may mean that we will  
not have sufficient funds available for our 
marketing and industrial activities, both of 
which employ substantial amounts of capital. 
If we do not have funds available for these 
activities then they will decrease. 
Note 25 details our financial and capital risk 
management including liquidity risk. 
The Financial Review on page 52 sets out the 
Group’s Net Funding and Net Debt in 2017, 
which are both currently within our targets. We 
also issued during the year the following bonds 
with applicable coupon and redemption dates: 
$500 million 3% 2022, $500 million 3.875%  
2027 and $1.0 billion 4% 2027. 
While we have delevered and repositioned 
the Group’s balance sheet in the past two years, 
we remain cognisant that access to credit is vital 
and that market conditions can change rapidly.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had available 
undrawn committed credit facilities and cash 
amounting to $12.9 billion (31 December 2016: 
$16.7 billion), comfortably ahead of our $3 billion  
minimum prescribed level. 
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s latest 
assessments for the Company’s investment 
grade credit are BBB (positive outlook) and  
Baa2 (stable) respectively.

Counterparty credit and performance Risk movement in 2017: Decrease
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Low. Where possible, credit exposure are to be covered through  
credit mitigation products. 
Financial assets consisting principally 
of receivables and advances, derivative 
instruments and long-term advances and 
loans can expose us to concentrations 
of credit risk.
Furthermore, we are subject to non-
performance risk by our suppliers, customers 
and hedging counterparties, in particular  
via our marketing activities.
Non-performance by suppliers, customers 
and hedging counterparties may occur and 
cause losses in a range of situations, such as:
• a significant increase in commodity prices 
resulting in suppliers being unwilling 
to honour their contractual commitments 
to sell commodities at pre-agreed prices
• a significant reduction in commodity  
prices resulting in customers being 
unwilling or unable to honour their 
contractual commitments to purchase 
commodities at pre-agreed prices
• suppliers subject to prepayment or hedging 
counterparties may find themselves unable 
to honour their contractual obligations  
due to financial distress or other reasons
We monitor the credit quality of our 
counterparties and seek to reduce the risk of 
customer non-performance by requiring credit 
support from creditworthy financial institutions 
including making extensive use of credit 
enhancement products, such as letters of credit, 
bank guarantees and insurance policies. Specific 
credit risk policy rules apply to open account  
risk with an established threshold for referral 
of credit positions by departments to central 
management. In addition, note 25 details our 
financial and capital risk management approach.

Operating and cost risks Risk movement in 2017: Stable
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Low. It is the Company’s strategic objective to focus on cost control  
and operating efficiencies. 
Our industrial activities are subject to 
numerous risks and hazards normally 
associated with the initiation, development, 
operation and/or expansion of natural 
resource projects, many of which are beyond 
our control. These include unanticipated 
variations in grade and other geological 
problems (so that anticipated or stated 
reserves, may not conform to expectations). 
Other examples include natural hazards, 
processing problems, technical malfunctions, 
unavailability of materials and equipment, 
unreliability and/or constraints of 
infrastructure, industrial accidents, labour 
force challenges, disasters, protests, force 
majeure factors, cost overruns, delays in 
permitting or other regulatory matters, 
vandalism and crime. 
The development and operating of assets 
may lead to future upward revisions in 
estimated costs, delays or other operational 
difficulties or damage to properties or 
facilities. This may cause production to be 
reduced or to cease and may further result  
in a decrease in production, personal injury  
or death, third party damage or loss or 
require greater infrastructure spending.  
Also, the realisation of these risks could 
require significant and additional capital  
and operating expenditures.
Some of the Group’s interests in industrial 
assets do not constitute controlling stakes. 
Although the Group has various structures 
in place which seek to protect its position 
where it does not exercise control, these 
other shareholders may have interests or 
goals that are inconsistent with ours. They 
may take action contrary to the Group’s 
interests or be unable or unwilling to fulfil 
their obligations. 
Infrastructure availability remains a key risk,  
e.g. availability of continuous high-voltage 
power to our copper operations in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo. We are 
continuing to seek long-term power  
solutions via the Inga dam refurbishment. 
Development and operating risks and  
hazards are managed through our continuous 
development status evaluation and reporting 
processes and ongoing assessment, reporting 
and communication of the risks that affect our 
operations along with updates to the risk register. 
We publish quarterly our production results 
and annually our assessment of reserves and 
resources based on available drilling and other 
data sources. Conversion of resources to reserves 
and, eventually, reserves to production is an 
ongoing process that takes into account 
technical and operational challenges, economics 
of the particular commodities concerned and 
the impact on the communities in which 
we operate.
Local cost control measures are complemented 
by global procurement that leverages our  
scale to seek to achieve favourable terms 
on high-consumption materials such as fuel, 
explosives and tyres.
Details of the significant impairments recorded 
during the year are contained in note 5. 
Deterioration in the price outlook or operating 
difficulties may result in additional impairments.

Cyber risk Risk movement in 2017: New principal risk
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Low. Where possible, cyber exposures are to be mitigated through proactive 
monitoring and routing test to confirm security of systems.
A cyber security breach, incident or failure 
of Glencore’s IT systems could disrupt our 
businesses, result in the disclosure of 
confidential information, damage our 
reputation and create significant financial 
and legal exposures.
Although Glencore invests heavily to monitor, 
maintain and regularly upgrade its systems, 
processes and networks, absolute security  
is not possible.
Cyber risks for firms have increased 
significantly in recent years owing in part  
to the proliferation of new technologies,  
the use of the internet and the increasing 
degree of connectivity, telecommunications 
technologies and major increase in 
cyber-crime. 
Our activities depend on technology for 
industrial production, efficient operations, 
environmental management, health  
and safety, communications, transaction 
processing and risk management.  
We see the increasing convergence of IT and  
OT (Operational Technology) networks that 
will create new risks and demand additional 
management time and focus. We also 
depend on third parties in long supply chains 
that are exposed to the same cyber risks  
but which are largely outside our control. 
We have invested in global IT security platforms 
in order to seek to proactively monitor and 
manage our cyber risks. We conduct routine 
third party penetration tests to confirm the 
security of our systems. Our designated IT 
Security Council sets the global cyber security 
strategy, conducts regular risk assessments  
and designs targeted cyber security packages 
that seek to thwart emerging malware, virus, 
vulnerabilities etc. Our incident response team 
is established and responsible to respond in the 
event of any major cyber incident. We conduct 
ongoing training of our employees in order to 
raise the awareness of cyber security threats.

Emissions and climate change Risk movement in 2017: Increase
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: High. Our business involves mining and consuming fossil fuels along  
with processing minerals which inevitably entails emitting harmful emissions. 
Our global presence exposes us to a number 
of jurisdictions in which regulations have 
been or are being considered to reduce 
emissions. The likely effect of these changes 
will be to increase the cost for fossil fuels, 
impose levies for emissions and increase 
costs for monitoring and reporting and to 
reduce demand for fossil fuels. Third parties, 
including potential or actual investors,  
may also introduce policies adverse to the 
Company due to its interest in fossil fuels. 
A number of national governments have 
already introduced, or are contemplating  
the introduction of regulatory responses to 
greenhouse gas emissions. This includes 
countries where we have assets such as 
Australia, Canada and Chile, as well as 
customer markets such as China, India 
and Europe. 
Many countries are also pledging to stop 
using fossil fuels (specifically coal) in power 
generation, e.g. in 2017 25 countries and 
regions including the UK, France and Mexico 
undertook to do so by 2030.
As a result of these factors, some other 
market participants and analysts have a 
more bearish view (some strongly so) in 
relation to coal and oil and believe that many 
fossil fuel assets could become “stranded”, 
i.e. no longer capable of operating for an 
economic return with the capital invested 
being irretrievably lost.
We are one of the major producers of key 
metals (including copper, cobalt, nickel) that 
are currently essential for electric vehicles and 
the transition to a low carbon economy, 
although technological change may over 
time reduce their requirement.
Through our sustainability programme, we strive 
to ensure emissions and climate change issues 
are identified, understood and monitored 
in order to meet international best practice 
standards and ensure regulatory compliance. 
We seek to ensure that there is a balanced 
debate with regard to the ongoing use 
of fossil fuels.
During 2017, we published our second Climate 
Change Considerations for our Business which 
sets out information about how our business 
operates, our position on climate change and 
how we are managing the opportunities  
and challenges of climate change across 
our business. 
In order to understand and plan for the effects  
of climate change on our business, we are 
seeking to provide a framework for identifying, 
understanding and, ultimately, managing (to the 
extent possible) climate-related challenges and 
opportunities facing our portfolio. This covers in 
particular government policy, energy costs, 
physical impacts, stakeholder perceptions,  
and market impacts.

Community relations and human rights Risk movement in 2017: Stable
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Low. It is our policy to ensure we proactively engage with local communities  
to maintain our social licence to operate. 
The continued success of our existing 
operations and our future projects are in  
part dependent upon broad support and  
a healthy relationship with the respective 
local communities.
A perception that we are not respecting or 
advancing the interests of the communities 
in which we operate, could have a negative 
impact on our ‘‘social licence to operate’’, our 
ability to secure access to new resources and 
our financial performance. The consequences 
of negative community reaction could also 
have a material adverse impact on the cost, 
profitability, ability to finance or even the 
viability of an operation and the safety  
and security of our workforce and assets. 
Such events could lead to disputes with 
governments, with local communities  
or any other stakeholders, and give rise to 
reputational damage. Even in cases where  
no adverse action is actually taken, the 
uncertainty associated with this instability 
could negatively impact the perceived value  
of our assets.
We believe that the best way to manage these 
vital relationships is to adhere to the principles of 
open dialogue and cooperation. In doing so, we 
engage with local communities to demonstrate 
our operations’ contribution to socio-economic 
development and seek to ensure that 
appropriate measures are taken to prevent or 
mitigate possible adverse impacts on the 
communities, along with the regular reporting as 
outlined on our website at: www.glencore.com/
sustainability/community-and-human-rights.
Some of our mine sites are in remote locations 
where they are a – or the – key employer in the 
region. Inevitably, every mine will reach a point  
of depletion where it is no longer economic  
to operate and must be closed in an orderly 
fashion. We are working with all stakeholders 
at our mine sites to operate for as long as it is 
economically viable to do so, and to prepare 
long-term plans that provide for a gradual 
transition to the end of mine life.

Skills availability and retention Risk movement in 2017: Stable
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Low. It is a key strategic objective of the Company to maintain positive employee 
relationships and to attract and retain skilled workers.
The maintenance of positive employee and 
union relations and the ability to attract and 
retain skilled workers, including senior 
management, are key to our success. This 
attraction and retention of highly qualified  
and skilled personnel can be challenging, 
especially, but not only, in locations 
experiencing political or civil unrest, or in 
which they may be exposed to other 
hazardous conditions. 
Many employees, especially at the Group’s 
industrial activities, are represented by labour 
unions under various collective labour 
agreements. Their employing company may 
not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate its 
collective labour agreements when they 
expire and may face tougher negotiations or 
higher wage demands than would be the 
case for non-unionised labour. In addition, 
existing labour agreements may not prevent 
a strike or work stoppage.
We understand that one of the key factors in our 
success is a good and trustworthy relationship 
with our people. This priority is reflected in the 
principles of our sustainability programme  
and related guidance, which require regular, 
open, fair and respectful communication,  
zero tolerance for human rights violations, fair 
remuneration and, above all, a safe working 
environment, as outlined on our website at: 
www.glencore.com/careers/Our-culture and 
in our People section on page www.glencore.
com/sustainability/our-people.
Various union strike action has occurred at 
several of our operations during the year 
e.g. Coal Australia. Group companies seek 
negotiated outcomes with employee 
representatives, based on reasonableness  
and fairness, however unfortunately and 
occasionally strike action can occur.

Health, safety, environment, including potential catastrophes Risk movement in 2017: Stable
Link to strategic priorities
 
Risk appetite: Low. It is our policy to ensure we comply with or exceed the health, safety and 
environmental laws and external requirements applicable to our operations and products. 
Our operations are subject to health,  
safety and environmental laws along with 
compliance with our corporate sustainability 
framework. The processes and chemicals 
used in extraction and production methods, 
as well as transport and storage, may impose 
environmental hazards. A serious failure 
in these areas could lead to an emergency 
or catastrophe at a site, which could result 
in injuries or fatalities and also impact 
production and our corporate reputation. 
The storage of tailings at our industrial assets 
and the storage and transport of oil are 
material examples of these risks.
Environmental (including those associated 
with particular environmental hazards) and 
health and safety laws may result in increased 
costs or, in the event of non-compliance or 
incidents causing injury or death or other 
damage at or to our facilities or surrounding 
areas may result in significant losses, 
including those arising from (1) interruptions 
in production, litigation and imposition 
of penalties and sanctions and (2) having 
licences and permits withdrawn or 
suspended or being forced to undertake 
extensive remedial clean-up action or to pay 
for government-ordered remedial clean-up 
actions. In each case, liability may arise where 
the hazards have been caused by any 
previous or subsequent owners or operators 
of the property, by any past or present owners 
of adjacent properties, or by third parties.
We regret, we recorded nine fatalities at our 
operations from nine separate incidents.
Our approach to sustainability and our 
expectations of our workers and our business 
partners are outlined in our sustainability 
framework. This underpins our approach towards 
social, environmental, safety and compliance 
indicators, providing clear guidance on the 
standards we expect all our operations to achieve. 
Through the reporting function within the 
programme, our Board and senior management 
receive regular updates and have a detailed 
oversight on how our business is performing 
across all of the sustainability indicators.  
We monitor catastrophic risks, in particular,  
across our portfolio and operate emergency 
response programmes.
Compliance with international and local 
regulations and standards are top priorities. 
We remain focused on the significant risks facing 
our industry arising from operational catastrophes 
such as the examples of tailings dam collapses in 
Canada and Brazil and the coal mine explosions 
experienced in the last five years. We seek to learn 
from these events, and proactively assess our 
exposure to similar incidents and implement 
measures to avoid these. 
Considerable ongoing investment continues  
in the Group’s SafeWork health and 
safety programme.

The APMs are used to improve  
the comparability of information 
between reporting periods and 
segments and to aid in the 
understanding of the activities taking 
place across the Group by adjusting 
for Significant items, aggregating  
or disaggregating (notably in the  
case of relevant material Associates 
accounted for on an equity basis) 
certain IFRS measures. APMs are also 
used to approximate the underlying 
operating cash flow generation of the 
operations (Adjusted EBITDA). 
Significant items (see reconciliation 
below) are items of income and 
expense which, due to their variable 
financial impact or the expected 
infrequency of the events giving rise 
to them, are separated for internal 
reporting and analysis of 
Glencore’s results. 
Alternative performance measures 
are denoted by the symbol ◊ and are 
further defined and reconciled to the

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Financial results
Net income attributable to equity 
holders increased from $1,379 million 
in 2016 to $5,777 million in 2017 and 
EPS increased from $0.10 per share  
to $0.41 per share, driven by the 
factors discussed below.
Adjusted EBITDA was $14,762 million 
and Adjusted EBIT was $8,552 
million, increases of 44% and 1 18% 
respectively compared to 2016, 
primarily driven by higher commodity 
prices. Market sentiment and 
commodity prices continued to 
improve over 2017, following the 
cyclical lows seen in early 2016. 
Notable year over year average price 
increases were cobalt (108%), zinc 
(38%), coal (GC Newc. 34%) and 
copper (27%). The positive impact of 
the higher prices on Adjusted EBITDA 
was somewhat tempered by upward 
trending, albeit until now, relatively 
moderate cost inflation and the 
effects of a weaker U.S. dollar against 
most producer country currencies, 
including average year-over-year 
declines against the South African

rand (9%), Kazakh tenge (5%) and

EBITDA mining margins were robust 
at 38% and 41% in our metals and 
energy operations, up respectively 
from 33% and 32% in 2016.
Marketing Adjusted EBITDA  
and EBIT increased by 5% and  
3% to $3,224 million and 
$3,012 million respectively:
• Metals and minerals Adjusted 
Marketing EBIT was up 28% over 
2016, with strong contributions from 
most commodity departments, 
reflecting the improved physical 
commodity market conditions and 
solid growth in volumes handled, 
particularly copper, cobalt, zinc  
and ferroalloys. 
• Energy products Adjusted 
Marketing EBIT was up 9% 
compared to 2016, with healthy 
contributions from both oil and 
coal. The oil result was augmented 
by a substantial volume increase 
during the year, notably crude, 
up 33%.
• Like-for-like, Agricultural products 
Adjusted Marketing EBIT was down 
26% compared to 2016, but up 7% 
at the Adjusted EBITDA level, due 
to a higher depreciation charge in 
2017. This was an overall satisfactory 
result, given the general industry 
margin pressures, following a 
succession of global bumper crops. 
Following the sale of a 50% interest 
in December 2016, Adjusted EBIT, 
on a reported basis, was down 63% 
compared to 2016.
Industrial Adjusted EBITDA increased 
by 60% to $1 1,538 million (Adjusted 
EBIT was $5,540 million, compared  
to $1,01 1 million in 2016). As noted 
above, the increase was primarily 
driven by stronger average year-over-
year commodity prices, offset by 
volume related impacts (including 
temporary industrial action, acid 
supply and weather related factors), 
moderate cost inflation and adverse 
foreign currency impacts, given the 
generally weaker U.S. dollar against 
the vast majority of local currencies  
in our key operating jurisdictions.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Significant items
Significant items are items of income 
and expense which, due to their 
variable financial impact or the 
expected infrequency of the events 
giving rise to them, are separated  
for internal reporting and analysis  
of Glencore’s results to provide  
a better understanding and 
comparative basis of the underlying 
financial performance. 
In 2017, Glencore recognised a net 
$269 million gain (2016: net expenses 
of $613 million) in significant items, 
including $187 million of income tax 
related expense items mainly related 
to the substantial reductions in U.S. 
corporate income tax rates. The net 
gain comprises primarily:
• Income of $225 million (2016: 
$225 million expense) relating to 
the accounting period matching 
of certain coal derivative positions 
open at 31 December 2016 and 
subsequently fully settled during 
2017. These positions related 
to portfolio risk management/
hedging activities initiated in 
Q2 2016 to manage forward 
sales price exposure, relating 
to future coal production. The 
transactions were not able to be 
designated as hedging instruments 
under IFRS, which would have 
allowed for the deferment of any 
income statement effect until 
performance of the underlying 
future sale transactions. The fair 
value movements were offset 
against revenue in the segment 
information as the related sales  
(of production) were realised. 
• A $6 million expense  
(2016: $132 million) representing 
Glencore’s share of significant 
expenses recognised directly by our 
associates, primarily impairment 
charges recognised within Century.
• Gain on disposals and investments 
of $1,309 million (2016: $2,370 
million) see note 3. In 2017, the gain 
primarily relates to the disposal 
of Zinc Africa ($232 million), an 
oil storage business (HG Storage, 
$674 million) and a royalty portfolio 
($210 million). In 2016, the balance 
is primarily comprised of gains on 
disposals of $430 million related  
to GRail and $1,848 million related 
to Glencore Agri.
• Other expenses – net $594 million 
(2016: $1,923 million) see notes 4 
and 5. Balance primarily comprises:
 – impairments of $628 million 
(2016: $1,268 million). 2017 
impairments related mainly to 
Chad oil ($278 million), Cameroon 
oil ($81 million) and junior loans 
extended to a coal terminal 
facility ($149 million). These 
impairments were partially offset 
by a reversal of $243 million 
related to the Equatorial Guinea 
oil operations. 2016 impairments 
related primarily to Chad oil  
($622 million), Equatorial Guinea 
oil operations ($31 1 million), 
Cerrejón coal (recognised 
within share of income from 
associates, $345 million) and 
various coal shipping investments 
($61 million).
 – $290 million (2016: $121 million) 
of mark-to-market gains on 
investments held for trading.
 – $80 million (2016: $70 million)  
of net foreign exchange losses.
 – $75 million (2016: $92 million) 
relating to certain legal matters. 
The 2017 balance is a cost 
estimate for potential settlement 
of claims brought against the 
Group related to an operation 
disposed in 2005. The 2016 
amount relates to expenses 
incurred to settle a compliance 
matter in respect of a U.S. 
biofuels program in the years 
201 1/12.
 – $78 million (2016: $Nil) relating to 
the cumulative effect of certain 
accounting issues that resulted 
in Katanga, an 86.3% controlled 
subsidiary listed on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange, restating its 
2014, 2015 and 2016 results. 
The cumulative effect has been 
corrected in Glencore’s 2017 
financial statements. Had the 
Group’s results been restated, 
income before taxes for the year 
ended 2016 would have been 
lower by $10 million.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs were $1,451 million 
in 2017, compared to $1,533 million 
incurred during the comparable 
reporting period. Interest expense 
in 2017 was $1,619 million, a 4% 
decrease from $1,688 million in 2016, 
owing mainly to the repayment of 
higher margin debt. Interest income 
in 2017 was $168 million, consistent 
with the prior year.
Income taxes
An income tax expense of 
$1,759 million was recognised during 
2017, compared to an income tax 
expense of $638 million in 2016. 
Adjusting for a net $187 million 
(2016: $276 million) of income tax 
expense related to significant  
items – $30 million (2016: $19 million) 
due to currency translation effects 
and a net $157 million of income tax 
arising primarily from the substantial 
reduction in US tax rates, following 
the announced US tax reform, the 
2017 pre-significant items income tax 
expense was $1,572 million (2016: 
$362 million). The 2017 effective tax 
rate, pre-significant items, was 30.3%, 
consistent with a calculated effective 
tax rate of 32.4% in 2016.
Assets, leverage and working capital 
Total assets were $135,593 million as 
at 31 December 2017, compared to 
$124,600 million as at 31 December 
2016, a period over which, current 
assets increased from $43,412 million 
to $49,726 million, due to increases  
in inventories, primarily as a result of 
commodity price increases, notably 
in our metals and minerals segment. 
Non-current assets increased from 
$81,188 million to $85,867 million, 
primarily due to the acquisition of 
Volcan, as outlined in note 24 of the 
financial statements.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 The reconciliation in the table  
above is the method by which 
management reviews movements  
in net funding and net debt and 
comprises key movements in cash 
and any significant non-cash 
movements on net funding items. 
Excluding $704 million of net debt 
assumed in the Volcan acquisition 
(completed mid-November 2017),  
net funding as at 31 December 2017 
increased by $279 million to  
$32,898 million, whereas net  
debt (net funding less readily 
marketable inventories) decreased  
by $4,853 million over the year to 
$10,673 million. The Volcan assumed 
debt has been adjusted/excluded 
to provide a more consistent and 
comparative analysis, but mostly 
to reflect the Group’s relatively 
low 23.3% economic ownership 
(compared to its 63.0% voting 
interest) in this still fully ring-fenced 
listed entity, with its standalone, 
independent and separate capital 
structure. The cash outlay in respect 
of the 2017 share purchase is included 
in acquisition of subsidiaries above.  
It is the Group’s current intention 
to internally report on/treat this 
investment in accordance with  
equity accounting principles, in 
parallel with full consolidation  
for IFRS reporting purposes.
The net funding movement reflects 
the increase in readily marketable 
inventories ($5,132 million of the net 
working capital outflow of $5,073 
million) over the year, primarily due to 
the substantially higher commodity 
prices, but also to proactive seizing  
of further short-term capital 
deployment opportunities in  
the buoyant commodity market 
environment. It is contextually 
noteworthy, given the earnings 
enhancing controllable inventory 
build, that funds from operations 
significantly exceeded (nearly  
double) the $3,898 million of net 
capital expenditure, $342 million  
of net acquisitions of subsidiaries  
and investments, $561 million  
of acquisitions of non-controlling 
interests in subsidiaries (African 
copper) and payment of $1,175 million 
of dividends to shareholders and 
non-controlling interests. 
The ratio of Net debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA improved to 0.72 times in 
2017 from 1.51 times in 2016, and the 
ratio of FFO to Net debt improved to 
108.3% in 2017 from 50.0% in 2016.
Business and investment 
acquisitions and disposals
Net outflows from business 
acquisitions and divestures was  
$903 million, compared to an  
inflow on disposals of $5,944 million 
in 2016. The net outflow in 2017  
is primarily due to the acquisition  
of an additional interest in Volcan  
($653 million), the acquisition of the 
remaining 31% interest of Mutanda 
not previously owned ($524 million), 
an increase in our interest in Katanga 
to 86.3% from 75.3% ($38 million) 
and a $300 million investment in 
Yancoal. These are offset by disposals 
and ongoing smaller stake retentions 
in HG Storage ($502 million), Zinc 
Africa ($222 million) and BaseCore 
Metals ($150 million). The 2016 net 
inflow from divestitures resulted 
primarily from the disposal of a 50% 
interest in Glencore Agri. See note 24 
for further explanations.
Liquidity and funding activities
In 2017, the following significant 
financing activities took place:
• In May 2017, Glencore signed  
new one-year revolving credit 
facilities for a total amount of 
$7,335 million, refinancing the 
$7,700 million one-year revolving 
credit facilities signed in February 
2016. Funds drawn under the 
facilities bear interest at U.S.$ LIBOR 
plus a margin of 40 basis points. 
Glencore also voluntarily reduced 
the medium term facility size from 
$6,800 million to $5,425 million and 
extended its maturity by 24 months 
to 2022. As at 31 December 2017, 
the facilities comprise:
 – a $7,335 million one year 
revolving credit facility with a 
12 month term-out borrower’s 
option (to May 2019) and a 
12-month extension option; and 
 – a $5,425 million medium-term 
revolving credit facility  
(to May 2022).
• In March 2017, issued a 10 year 
$1,000 million, 4% coupon bond.
• In October, issued a 5 year  
$500 million, 3% coupon bond  
and a 10 year $500 million,  
3.875% coupon bond.
As at 31 December 2017, Glencore 
had available committed undrawn 
credit facilities and cash amounting 
to $12.9 billion.

Credit ratings
In light of the Group’s extensive 
funding activities, maintaining 
investment grade credit rating status 
is a financial priority. The Group’s 
credit ratings are currently Baa2 
(stable) from Moody’s and BBB 
(positive outlook) from Standard & 
Poor’s. Glencore’s publicly stated 
objective, as part of its overall 
financial policy package, is to seek 
and maintain strong Baa/BBB credit 
ratings from Moody’s and Standard & 
Poor’s respectively. In support thereof, 
Glencore targets a maximum 2x Net 
debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio through 
the cycle.
Value at risk
One of the tools used by Glencore to 
monitor and limit its primary market 
risk exposure, namely commodity 
price risk related to its physical 
marketing activities, is the use of  
a value at risk (VaR) computation.  
VaR is a risk measurement technique 
which estimates the potential loss 
that could occur on risk positions as  
a result of movements in risk factors 
over a specified time horizon, given a 
specific level of confidence. The VaR 
methodology is a statistically defined, 
probability based approach that 
takes into account market volatilities, 
as well as risk diversification by 
recognising offsetting positions and 
correlations between commodities 
and markets. In this way, risks can  
be measured consistently across all 
markets and commodities and risk 
measures can be aggregated  
to derive a single risk value.
Glencore has set a consolidated  
VaR limit (1 day 95%) of $100 million 
representing some 0.2% of equity.  
In Q2 2016, this limit was technically 
breached for 1 day by $1 million  
as the VaR calculation did not 
account for the future physical coal 
production that was economically 
hedged with the corresponding 
derivatives captured and reported on. 
If such underlying hedged exposure 
had been included in the VaR 
calculation, the actual VaR number 
would have been substantially lower, 
with no resulting technical breach. 
This hedge book has now fully rolled 
off, as noted above. Glencore uses a 
VaR approach based on Monte Carlo 
simulations and is either a one day  
or one week time horizon computed 
at a 95% confidence level with a 
weighted data history.
Average market risk VaR (1 day 95%) 
during 2017 was $25 million, 
representing less than 0.1% of equity. 
Average equivalent VaR during 2016 
was $42 million.
Distributions
The directors have recommended a 
2017 financial year cash distribution 
of $0.20 per share amounting to 
$2.9 billion, excluding any distribution 
on own shares and ignoring any 
attribution of shares which may  
take place prior to the record dates. 
Payment will be effected as a 
$0.10 per share distribution in May 
2018 (see below) and a $0.10 per 
share distribution in September 2018 
(in accordance with the Company’s 
announcement on the 2018 
Distribution timetable also made 
on 21 February 2018).
The distribution is proposed to  
be effected as a reduction of the  
capital contribution reserves of the 
Company. As such, this distribution 
would be exempt from Swiss 
withholding tax. As at 31 December 
2017, Glencore plc had CHF 37 billion 
of such capital contribution reserves 
in its statutory accounts. The 
distribution is subject to shareholders’ 
approval at its AGM on 2 May 2018.
The distribution is ordinarily paid  
in US dollars. Shareholders on the 
Jersey register may elect to receive 
the distribution in sterling, euros or 
Swiss francs, the exchange rates  
of which will be determined by 
reference to the rates applicable  
to the US dollar as stated above. 
Shareholders on the Johannesburg 
register will receive their distribution 
in South African rand. Further details 
on distribution payments, together 
with currency election and 
distribution mandate forms, are 
available from the Group’s website 
(www.glencore.com) or from the 
Company’s Registrars.

Adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 billion was $2.7 billion (36%) 
over 2016. Marketing and Industrial activities each 
contributed strongly to the year-over-year growth, 
with a 28% and 37% increase, respectively. 
These strong results were fuelled by solid underlying 
global economic growth, which combined with overall 
industry capital discipline and generally muted production 
growth, resulted in commodity markets tightening 
over the year, with a corresponding increase in prices 
and premiums. Such market conditions, together 
with continued Industrial cost and productivity focus, 
contributed to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA mining 
margin from 33% to 38%, while increased marketing 
base metals’ volumes aided the segment’s overall 
strong performance improvement compared to 2016.

Highlights
Base metals’ prices continued their 
positive momentum from the second 
half of 2016, into and through 2017. 
Indeed, year-end prices for most of 
the selected commodities in the 
table above were considerably higher 
than the annual averages, with 
copper around $7,200/t, zinc at 
$3,300/t, nickel at $12,700/t and 
equivalent cobalt at $34/lb. LME 
stocks of copper, zinc, nickel and lead 
all reduced over the year. Market 
concerns related to heightened 
Chinese economic risks proved 
short-lived, and by year end, a level of 
consensus had emerged that growth 
in both developed and emerging 
markets was more sustainable.
Reflecting these improved 
fundamental physical commodity 
market conditions, with solid growth 
in volumes handled, particularly 
copper, cobalt, zinc and ferroalloys, 
Marketing’s Adjusted EBIT was  
$2.0 billion, up 28% compared 
to 2016.

Supply contraction in 2017 
In 2017, the copper price averaged 
$6,173/t, increasing 27% year-over-
year. The rally was most apparent in 
the second half, with a 2017 high of 
$7,254/t in late December marking 
levels last seen in early 2014. Over  
the year, synchronised global growth 
fuelled healthy demand in major 
copper consuming regions. Mine 
supply challenges continued to 
exceed market expectations, resulting 
in a c.2% contraction in mined 
volumes year-on-year, the first  
decline in over 15 years.
Copper scrap flows played an 
important role in the first half of  
the year, as higher prices triggered 
the release of stockpiled scrap into 
the market and contributed to a 
short period of apparent demand 
weakness. Combined with misplaced

YoY increase in Chinese

Non-China supply increase in 2017 
In 2017, the zinc price recorded  
a 38% year-over-year increase, 
benefiting from the combination  
of synchronised global growth,  
strong orders from the steel industry 
and continuing tightness in the 
concentrate market, which 
progressively spread to the metal 
market during the course of the year. 
Despite the higher prices, for a range 
of reasons, China did not contribute 
to any mine supply growth, which 
meant that the 9% (~650kt) increase 
in concentrate supply from the  
Rest of the World was comfortably 
absorbed by the market. 2017 
Chinese mine production dropped  
by 8.6% (~300kt). The environmental 
drive in China continued to put 
pressure on extractive industries, 
limiting domestic zinc mine  
output. In response, Chinese zinc 
concentrates imports rose by 21.9% 
(~140kt), despite the lower spot TC 
levels ($38/dmt in 2017 vs $102/dmt 
in 2016).
fears of tightening financial 
conditions in China, this resulted in a 
temporary pullback in the price rally. 
Copper scrap inventory reverted to 
normalised levels by mid-year, with 
drawdowns in copper units across 
the value chain through to year-end.
Looking ahead, global supply is 
expected to be impacted by ageing 
assets, limited sector reinvestment,  
a diminished project pipeline and 
elevated risk of mine disruptions. 
With global economic growth 
pointing to healthy demand, the 
copper market is likely to remain  
in substantial supply deficit, which,  
if it occurs, will in turn result in  
further inventory drawdowns.
The emerging battery and electric 
vehicle trend adds further uplift to 
the demand outlook and attractive 
fundamentals. Copper and cobalt are 
expected to play important roles 
across the value chain of the energy 
and mobility evolution, from power 
generation and distribution, to energy 
storage and vehicles.
During 2017, Glencore commissioned 
CRU to model the metal requirements 
to realise the Electric Vehicle Initiative 
target of 30 million electric vehicle 
sales by 2030. CRU forecast that  
4.1Mt of copper (18% of 2016 supply), 
1.1Mt of nickel (56% of 2016 supply) 
and 314kt of cobalt (314% of 2016 
supply) will be required annually by 
2030. As early as 2020, forecast EV 
related metal demand becomes 
material, requiring an additional 
c.390kt of copper and c.24kt of 
cobalt. In 2017, the pricing impact/
expectation of this new demand 
dynamic was clearly evident in cobalt, 
with the spot price rallying 130% 
through the year.

Solid demand increases in 
stainless and non-stainless 
steels, plus emerging  
battery demand 
10%
Estimated demand growth in 2017 
5%
Estimated output growth 
In 2017, a record supply deficit was 
evident in the nickel market, as strong 
synchronised demand growth across 
all regions and industry segments 
offset supply gains. Such positive 
fundamentals, backed by strong 
physical activity and significant draws 
in global inventory, drove nickel 
premiums to record highs. 
Growth in global stainless steel –  
the dominant driver of nickel 
demand – is estimated at 6%,  
fuelled by a 9% increase in 300-series 
stainless. Positive developments  
in non-stainless further supported 
demand growth, including orders 
from the oil and gas industry and  
a solid upswing in the European 
automotive market, while nickel 
demand from the battery sector 
accelerated through 2017, with 
annual growth estimated at 30%. 
Overall we estimate primary nickel 
demand in 2017 of >2.2Mt, 
representing a 10% increase on 2016. 
Price-induced closures, production 
issues and general supply disruptions 
prompted widespread under-
performance in non-nickel pig iron 
supply. This was nevertheless offset 
by the ramp up of Indonesian NPI 
capacity and the acceleration of 
Chinese NPI supply through year  
end. While Indonesia’s reversal of  
a ban on ore exports incited fears  
of unconstrained ore availability, 
boosting Chinese NPI supply growth, 
actual shipments were c.5Mt wet ore 
for the year. 
Global nickel output in 2017 is 
estimated at <2.1Mt, marking  
a 5% increase on 2016, which masks 
a 2% decline in non-NPI supply. 
Consequently, the nickel market 
remained in material supply deficit 
for a second year running, enabling 
global stocks to draw down quickly 
despite headline LME inventory 
suggesting otherwise. Even with  
a conservative forecast for 2018 
demand, the outlook is for continued 
sizeable deficits and further draws in 
primary nickel stocks. Forecast supply 
increases are based on Indonesia 
exporting more nickel units in ore  
or NPI, with production elsewhere 
expected to be flat or fall.
On the metal front, Chinese 
production was down by 0.7% in 
2017 (~40kt). With local stocks already 
at low levels, Chinese consumers 
resorted to higher metal imports, up 
59.3% year-on-year. 2017 Chinese zinc 
metal imports were a record 676kt. 
Both LME and SHFE zinc stocks 
continued to draw down; LME stocks 
fell to 182kt at December 2017  
(2016: 428kt), while SHFE stocks  
more than halved to 69kt at 
December 2017 (2016: 153kt). 
The lead supply trend is similar, 
recording a year-over-year price 
increase of 24%. Spot TCs are also  
at a historical low, at $26/dmt  
in 2017 (2016: $1 19/dmt). 
Going forward, higher prices will 
incentivise higher concentrate 
production, easing TCs in the mid-
term and eventually resulting in 
higher metal production. However, 
the environmental constraints  
in China and the slower than 
anticipated pace of mine restarts  
(or new mines) means that the 
current zinc tightness may remain for 
some time. As there is also a time lag 
before concentrates units convert into 
metal units, we expect the current 
strong pricing environment to be 
supported in the near to mid-term.

6%
Estimated stainless steel  
market growth 
The 2017 chrome market was 
characterised by large demand 
swings and volatile pricing for  
both chrome ore and ferrochrome. 
The year started with a series of 
environmental and price-driven 
Chinese stainless steel mill closures, 
which temporarily impacted chrome 
demand. This reversed in the second 
half when global stainless steel melts 
reached record volumes, partly 
through the commissioning of a new 
major Indonesian project. Overall, 
global stainless steel production and 
ferrochrome demand are estimated 
to have grown 6% and 7% 
respectively in 2017.
Carbon steel market fundamentals 
continued to improve throughout 
2017, resulting in increased demand 
for manganese units, which 
supported manganese ore and  
alloy prices globally.
Vanadium demand continued  
to strengthen across product 
applications. Ongoing Chinese 
commitment to reducing pollution 
levels resulted in a reduction of local 
vanadium output, lower exports and 
an increased drawdown of stock.  
This boosted vanadium prices  
by 50% in H2 2017.

YoY increase in iron ore spot price 
index (62% CFR North China) 
In 2017, we believe iron ore  
prices decoupled from iron ore 
fundamentals, by following steel 
margins instead. Iron ore split further 
into different market segments: the 
price of low grade iron ore continued 
to decrease throughout the year, 
while higher grades benefited from 
improving steel markets, hence 
overall prices remained at fairly high 
levels. Discounts for lower grade and 
high silica cargoes have now reached 
a level that is starting to elicit a supply 
response. For 2018, while overall 
supply of iron ore may increase, we 
could see a decrease in low grade 
cargoes exported to China.

Unprecedented supply-side events in 
China shaped the aluminium market

aluminium and its raw material

Shutdown of illegal capacities and 
winter production cuts in China 
demonstrated the government’s 
willingness to enforce its 
environmental policies.
The alumina market was balanced  
in 2017 but supply-side concerns as  
a result of the winter production cuts 
caused large scale stockpiling and 
“panic buying” in China during Q4. 
Prices rallied to a 10-year high of 
$480/t FOB Australia in November. 
The average H2 2017 price was 45% 
higher than the same period last year.
Meanwhile, metal prices showed 
more modest gains, with the average 
H2 2017 LME 3-Month price 24% 
higher than H2 2016. Divergent 
sentiment about the scale of 
reductions undertaken by Chinese 
producers led to a brief drop in 
December 2017, but the price 
recovered, ending the year at 
$2,268/t.

South American production above excludes Volcan Compania Minera. Owing to the 
recent timing of the share tender in Q4 2017 (Glencore now has 63% of the voting 
shares and a 23% overall economic interest), management is in preliminary stages  
of reviewing the operations and the associated reporting framework. Therefore 
production data has been excluded, which currently provides a more consistent 
comparative analysis.

Operating highlights
Copper assets
Own sourced copper production of 
1,309,700 tonnes was 1 16,100 tonnes 
(8%) lower than in 2016, reflecting  
the Ernest Henry minority sale in  
Q4 2016, end of life production 
declines at Alumbrera and various 
temporary effects including lower 
throughput at Mutanda (due to 
constrained supply of sulphuric acid) 
and smelter maintenance at Mount 
Isa. Q4 production of 363,200 tonnes 
was 59,600 tonnes (20%) higher than 
in Q3, reflecting the resolution of such 
temporary impacts.
African copper
Own sourced copper production of 
238,700 tonnes was 15,700 tonnes 
(6%) lower than in 2016, reflecting 
throughput restrictions at Mutanda, 
initially related to unusually wet 
weather, and in Q3, due to an 
interruption in sulphuric acid supply 
Antamina
Glencore’s share of copper 
production was 142,600 tonnes, in 
line with 2016, and the share of zinc 
production was 128,100 tonnes, an 
increase of 61,300 tonnes (92%) on 
2016, reflecting the higher proportion 
of copper/zinc ores being mined,  
and the inherent nature of the 
Antamina deposit.
Other South America
Own sourced copper production of 
323,400 tonnes was 65,400 tonnes 
(17%) down on 2016, mainly relating 
to Alumbrera as it nears end of life. 
Antapaccay mined and processed  
on average lower grades for the year, 
but performed strongly in Q4 as the 
mine sequenced to a new phase of 
production with higher grades.
from Mopani, resulting from its power 
supply constraints. Mutanda’s Q4 own 
sourced production of 51,500 tonnes 
was in line with historical 
performance levels.
Cobalt production of 23,900 tonnes 
was broadly in line with 2016.
Katanga commissioned phase 1  
of its new whole ore leach processing 
project in December 2017, with  
2,200 tonnes of copper cathode 
produced by the end of December. 
Prior to such commissioning, 2,700 
tonnes of copper in concentrates 
were produced and sold, originating 
from the KITD Tailings project.
Collahuasi
Glencore’s share of copper 
production was 230,500 tonnes, up 
7,600 tonnes (3%) on 2016, mainly 
reflecting marginally improved ore 
grades and consistently strong  
milling performance.
70
Glencore Annual Report 2017 Australia
Own sourced copper production of 
230,500 tonnes was 28,500 tonnes 
(1 1%) lower than in 2016, reflecting 
the sale of a minority stake in the 
Ernest Henry mine in late 2016 and 
smelter maintenance in Q3 2017.  
Q4 production post-maintenance 
was substantially stronger.
Custom metallurgical assets
Copper cathode production of 
526,800 tonnes was 37,700 tonnes 
(8%) higher than in 2016, mainly 
reflecting Pasar’s expansion project. 
Copper anode production of 535,700 
tonnes was within 3% of 2016 levels.
Zinc assets
Own sourced zinc production of 
1,090,200 tonnes was in line with 
2016, as the step-up in Antamina zinc 
production noted above was offset 
by the disposals of the African 
mines to Trevali Mining, and lower 
production, as expected, at Mount Isa.
Kazzinc
Own sourced zinc production of 
210,500 tonnes was 22,900 tonnes 
(12%) higher than in 2016, reflecting 
the increased mix of processing some 
site work-in-process, compared to 
third party material. Production 
including third party material was 
316,800 tonnes, up 4%, reflecting 
various process improvements.
Own sourced lead production of 
57,600 tonnes was 1,600 tonnes (3%) 
lower than in 2016. Total lead 
production including third party feed 
was 151,000 tonnes, in line with the 
comparable period.
Own sourced copper production of 
49,700 tonnes was 4,200 tonnes (8%) 
lower than in 2016, due to a planned 
smelter shutdown in Q3 2017.
Own sourced gold production of 
585,000 ounces was 64,000 ounces 
(12%) higher than in 2016, reflecting 
stronger grades and recoveries  
at Vasilkovsky plus initial gold 
production from the Dolinnoe mine.
Australia
Zinc production of 436,000 tonnes 
was 52,400 tonnes (1 1%) down 
on 2016 and lead production of  
156,400 tonnes was 29,000 tonnes 
(16%) down, reflecting general mine 
planning changes at Mount Isa and 
the impact of no longer processing 
Black Star ore.
North America 
The Canadian mines produced 
123,700 tonnes of zinc, down  
6,400 tonnes (5%) on 2016, reflecting 
expected variability in mined volumes 
and head grades as both operations 
reach end of life.
Other Zinc
The South American assets produced 
99,800 tonnes of zinc, in line with 
2016. Lead production of 54,800 
tonnes was 12,400 tonnes (29%) up 
on 2016, mainly relating to stronger 
production at Aguilar in Argentina.
The African assets produced 92,100 
tonnes of zinc and 3,700 tonnes of 
lead up to 31 August 2017, at which 
point they were sold to Trevali Mining.
European custom metallurgical assets
Zinc production of 788,000 tonnes 
was in line with 2016. Lead 
production of 193,800 tonnes was 
22,800 tonnes (1 1%) lower, reflecting 
more complex feeds than previously 
being processed.
Nickel assets
Own sourced nickel production of 
109,100 tonnes was 6,000 tonnes (5%) 
down on 2016, owing to changes in 
the use of third party versus own 
sourced feeds in the INO circuit, 
partly offset by a strengthening 
operational performance 
at Koniambo.
Integrated Nickel Operations (INO)
Own sourced nickel production of 
57,500 tonnes was 8,700 tonnes (13%) 
down on 2016, mainly due to a higher 
proportion of third party feeds in the 
production mix, as noted above.  
Total production including third-party 
feeds was 87,100 tonnes, down 7%  
on 2016.
Murrin Murrin
Own sourced nickel production of 
34,100 tonnes was 1,200 tonnes (3%) 
lower than in 2016, mainly reflecting 
the maintenance shut in H1 2017.
Koniambo
Production of 17,500 tonnes was 
3,900 tonnes (29%) higher than in 
2016, reflecting efforts to steadily 
improve the plant’s operating 
performance towards capacity 
expectation levels. The DC furnace 2 
rebuild is complete with first  
metal tapped in December 2017. 
A progressive testing and ramp-up 
process will continue in the  
coming months.
Ferroalloys assets 
Ferrochrome
Attributable ferrochrome production 
of 1,531,000 tonnes was in line with 
2016. Quarter on quarter changes 
were largely driven by timing of 
furnace refurbishments.
Platinum Group Metals (PGM)
Mototolo’s concentrate production 
was temporarily suspended from 
August to December 2017, while 
strengthening of the tailings dam  
was carried out. Glencore’s share  
of production at 72,000 ounces  
was therefore down ~30% on  
2016. Normal operations have 
since resumed.
A further 2,000 ounces were 
reclaimed from a PGM recovery plant 
at Eastern Chrome Mines, mainly in 
Q4 2017. Steady-state operations from 
such activities are expected to yield 
~10,000 ounces per year.
Vanadium
Production of 20.9 million pounds 
was in line with 2016.

Highlights
Energy Products Adjusted EBITDA of $4.7 billion  
was $2.2 billion (89%) up on 2016. Both periods were 
constrained somewhat by the corporate risk management 
decision in Q2 2016 to economically hedge a portion of 
future coal sales, effectively “locking in” H1 2016 pricing, 
resulting in an “opportunity cost” of $380 million (2016: 
$980 million) realised in 2017. All the affected tonnes had 
rolled off by year-end. Adjusting for this hedging impact, 
2017 Adjusted EBITDA was up 60% over the prior year. 
Much of this increase was due to higher realised coal 
prices, with benchmark thermal coal averages up around 
30 – 35% year over year. Marketing also contributed to the 
increase, aided by higher oil volumes and supportive coal 
market conditions.
In August 2017, Glencore reached an agreement with 
Yancoal to acquire a 49% JV interest in the Hunter Valley 
Operations coal business in New South Wales, which  
is expected to complete in H1 2018, subject to 
regulatory approvals.

Marketing highlights
Seaborne coal prices continued their 
momentum from 2016, as Chinese 
policy restrictions were maintained to 
limit/cap supply to support targeted 
domestic coal price bands. After a 
relatively prolonged period of range-
bound prices, from mid-year,  
oil prices began to meaningfully 
increase, with OPEC and non-OPEC 
cuts, gradually reducing inventories 
and improving sentiment 
all contributing.
As a result of these positive market 
developments and a meaningful 
increase in oil volumes marketed, 
2017 Marketing Adjusted EBIT  
of $990 million was up 9% year 
over year.

Thermal coal
3.7%
Seaborne thermal coal demand 
growth in 2017 
35%
YoY increase in Newcastle index price
Global seaborne thermal coal 
demand grew >30Mt or 3.7% during 
2017, largely in the Pacific and Indian 
Ocean markets. Korean and Chinese 
demand growth dominated among 
broad-based demand increases 
across Asia, where increased coal use 
for power generation and industrial 
applications was supported by its 
relatively low cost as a fuel supply. 
Growth of the Chinese economy 
supported total electricity and 
thermal power generation demand 
growth of 5.7% and 4.6% respectively 
year over year. Combined with 
production limitations, associated 
with ongoing improvements  
Chinese domestic supply 
restrictions led to increased 
demand for imported coal
to domestic mines’ safety and 
production controls, the increased 
power demand contributed to 
Chinese domestic coal supply 
shortages, supporting prices and 
increased import coal demand. 
Hydro electricity generation shortfalls 
in parts of Europe and strong 
demand for electricity in Turkey 
contributed to increased thermal  
coal demand in the Atlantic.
On the supply side, Cyclone Debbie 
and strikes curtailed Australian 
supply, while weather also impacted 
Colombia, with thermal coal export 
volumes declining from both origins 
during 2017. While higher prices 
attracted additional supply from the 
USA, Russia and Indonesia, overall the 
short term supply response struggled 
to keep up, with strong demand 
during the second half of 2017. 
To date, such supply response has 
typically been in low energy and/or 
high sulphur products, but this  
could change in the future. In the 
longer term, price volatility and 
environmental concerns continue  
to limit investment in new supply 
capacity. At the end of December 
2017, market index prices for 
Newcastle, API4 and API2 closed 
respectively 7%, 9% and 10% higher 
than end December 2016, returning 
to levels last seen briefly in November 
2016, and prior to that, in April 2012.
22%
YoY increase in Brent crude price
During the first half of 2017, oil prices 
were largely range bound, with  
Brent capped around $55 per barrel. 
By mid-year the benchmark slipped 
to $45 per barrel as market sentiment 
weakened, amidst events that 
increased concerns about oversupply 
and global inventories remaining 
stubbornly high. However, by the 
third quarter, high OPEC compliance 
with its production cuts was evident, 
and forecasters, encouraged by 
synchronous GDP growth in most 
global markets, predicted strong oil 
demand growth. Inventories started 
to draw down meaningfully, which 
led to renewed optimism that 
expectations on the oil market 
rebalancing within the coming year 
would be fulfilled, providing the 
impetus for higher oil prices in  
the second half of 2017.
OPEC cuts and renewed 
optimism about global 
growth supported  
higher prices
Oil
74
Glencore Annual Report 2017 Further support came from 
geopolitical events and supply 
disruptions, with outages in Libya, 
Iraq, the North Sea, Canada, and 
mounting concerns about Venezuela 
production declines. The steady 
increase in short-cycle US and other 
non-OPEC production coming on  
line was less influential in capping oil 
price gains, as speculator net length 
increased rapidly to historically high 
levels, driving the price of Brent up to 
$67 per barrel at the end of the year. 
The Brent curve shifted decisively into 
backwardation midway through the 
year, and by year end, the WTI curve 
followed suit. Refinery margins were 
generally healthy for most of 2017,  
in part supported by the impact of 
some unexpected capacity losses in 
Europe and the US. In shipping, the 
tanker freight market remained 
lacklustre and struggled to perform 
as fleet expansion continued to 
outpace scrapping of tanker tonnage.
Industrial activities
Highlights
Energy Products’ Adjusted EBITDA  
of $3.6 billion was up $2.1 billion year 
over year. As noted above, a portion 
of this relates to the roll off of the 
economic hedges during 2017, but 
the far greater part reflects the 
improved price environment, partially 
offset by lower tonnes resulting 
primarily from industrial action and 
some inflationary cost pressures.  
The Adjusted EBITDA mining margin, 
pre economic hedges, increased 
from 32% to 41%.

Operating highlights
Coal assets
Coal production of 121 million tonnes 
was 3% down on 2016, as reductions 
associated with industrial action and 
adverse weather events, were mostly 
offset by productivity improvements 
and Glencore’s higher equity share  
in certain mines.
Australian coking
Production of 6.1 million tonnes was 
0.8 million tonnes (15%) higher than 
in 2016, mainly related to the restart 
of the Integra mine.
Australian thermal and semi-soft
Production of 60.6 million tonnes  
was 1.7 million tonnes (3%) down  
on 2016, as higher equity ownership 
of the Newlands and Collinsville 
mines, expected ramp-ups (notably 
Rolleston) and production efficiencies 
across the board were offset by 
planned mine closures and the 
impact of industrial action.
South African thermal
Production of 28.7 million tonnes  
was in line with 2016, as improved 
operating performances at the main 
mine complexes were offset by 
planned closures of smaller mines.
Prodeco
Production of 14.6 million tonnes was 
2.7 million tonnes (16%) lower than  
in 2016, initially due to the impact  
of severe wet weather and later,  
as a result of a geotechnical event,  
with productivity adversely affected 
by the necessary workarounds.
Cerrejón
Glencore’s share of production at 
10.6 million tonnes was in line with 
2016, as the easement of some 
restrictions related to dust emissions 
in 2016, was offset by the disruption 
caused by unusually heavy rainfall.
Oil assets
Glencore’s oil entitlement interest  
of 5.1 million barrels was 1.4 million 
barrels (33%) lower than in 2016, 
reflecting expected reductions in a 
period of inactive field development 
in a low oil price environment. Drilling 
in Chad recommenced in H2 2017 
with a single-rig campaign, which  
is expected to offset natural field 
declines in Equatorial Guinea.

Highlights
At the end of 2016, we completed the sale of 50% of the 
Agricultural products business. The resulting joint venture 
has been presented on a proportionate consolidation  
basis in this analysis, hence the apparent year over year 
reductions reflecting the changed ownership interest. 
Underlying performance was within expectations  
in a difficult trading environment, characterised by  
relatively low prices and volatility, which limited  
arbitrage opportunities.
Portfolio changes reflected the addition of a sugarcane 
mill in Brazil, adding 50% to crushed volumes, and  
the sale of our farming assets in Ukraine.

Marketing highlights
The grain and oilseed markets were 
again well supplied, low priced and 
lacked volatility, which in turn limited 
arbitrage opportunities. Despite 
a brief U.S. weather concern in late 
June, impacting primarily spring 
wheat, which proved to be less 
significant than initially thought, 
global crops were problem free with 
Russia, Australia (basis late 2016 
harvest carried over) and Brazil all 
recording historically high production. 
Global grain marketing performed 
well in the environment and whilst 
oilseed marketing results were 
satisfactory, they fell short of 2016. 
Record exports in Russia and 
Australia were beneficial for the grain 
handling and marketing businesses 
in both countries. In Canada, the 
Viterra handling business faced 
challenges, particularly in the second 
half. Reluctant selling by farmers in 
the face of excess handling capacity 
pressured margins. The disruption 
of the pulses trade into India, due  
to government intervention in 
support of local producers, was also  
a negative for Canadian exports.

Operating highlights
Soft seed processing margins in  
both the EU and Canada were below 
expectations. In the EU, the rape seed 
deficit was filled by imports, which 
was of some benefit to the coastal 
facilities but not to facilities, such as 
ours, located inland. The lifting of 
tariffs on imported biodiesel into  
the EU depressed biodiesel margins 
towards the end of the year. In 
Argentina our performance was 
satisfactory, but we endured periods 
of crush margin weakness. Our sugar 
milling performance, including the 
Unialco mill acquired in February 
2017, was also satisfactory, despite 
weaker sugar prices in H2 2017.  
The economic environment in Brazil 
continues to provide challenges for 
our wheat milling business, with 
processing volumes down 7% year 
over year reflective of reduced 
domestic demand. We continued  
our progressive exit from farming 
with the sale of our remaining 
Ukrainian farming assets in H2 2017.

Information Chairman’s introduction
Dear shareholders
I am pleased to present our corporate 
governance report for 2017.
Following the down-cycle challenges 
of 2015–16, the past year has been 
one of consolidation and renewal.
Our wide-ranging portfolio of assets 
together with our leading marketing 
business are unique in the industry. 
Even at the low point in the most 
recent downturn, the Group’s 
annualised Adjusted EBITDA  
was circa $8 billion (H2 2015 and  
H1 2016), supported by the generally 
more stable Marketing earnings. 
Shareholders will of course note the 
comparative figure of $14.8 billion for 
2017, reflecting both stronger pricing 
across the industrial portfolio and  
our strongest performance from 
Marketing since 2008. 
During the last year we have grown 
the business through delivery of 
major brownfield capital projects and 
corporate transactions on both the 
buy-side and sell-side, including:
• considerable progress in the 
Katanga (copper/cobalt),  
Mopani (copper) and Koniambo 
(nickel) projects
• BaseCore Metals streams and 
royalties joint venture with  
Ontario Teachers 
• agreed the formation of a joint 
venture with Yancoal for the  
Hunter Valley Coal Operations 
• acquisition of the majority  
of voting shares in Peruvian zinc 
miner Volcan 
• contribution of a portfolio of 
petroleum storage and logistics 
assets to an arrangement  
with HNA
Safety remains a top priority for  
the Board. We are committed to 
achieving our goal of zero fatalities. 
We offer our condolences to the 
families of the nine people who  
lost their lives while working at our 
operations last year. The HSEC 
Committee has met with the 
management of all the operations 
where the fatalities occurred to 
review the incidents and ensure  
that appropriate actions are taken  
to prevent recurrence.
Our numerous and wide-ranging 
asset base provides unique 
challenges. However, during every 
year in which I have served on your 
Board, I have seen considerable 
efforts to tackle legacy issues from 
some previous underinvestment and 
a continuous and significant record 
of improvement.
We continue to invest in our 
considerable and committed 
workforce and will seek over  
time to widen our reporting on 
people matters.
While the business has performed well, we are  
constantly reminded of the importance of governance, 
compliance and sustainability issues. We have refreshed 
and strengthened the Board with the appointments  
of Martin Gilbert and Gill Marcus
84
Glencore Annual Report 2017 While the business has performed 
well, we are constantly reminded  
of the importance of governance, 
compliance and sustainability issues, 
not least by some adverse media  
and NGO reports.
The Board has overseen the 
Company’s response to Katanga’s 
accounting restatement. This has 
been an important area of focus for 
us in the past few months, as detailed 
further on pages 92 and 97.
We continue to refresh the Board. 
Over the past twelve months we have 
been pleased to welcome two new 
Directors. Gill Marcus has led an 
exemplary career of public service  
to South Africa, which culminated in 
her five year tenure as head of the 
Reserve Bank of South Africa. Martin 
Gilbert is one of Europe’s leading 
asset management entrepreneurs 
and is now co-CEO of Standard Life 
Aberdeen plc. Further details of their 
experience is on page 82.
Also during the year, Bill Macaulay 
stepped down from the Board. 
He had been a Director since the 
Company’s IPO in May 201 1 and  
has been a strong and consistent 
contributor to board debate and  
I would like to thank him again for  
his valuable contribution to Glencore.
In tax, we have seen, previously 
through the EITI standards and 
latterly through the EU Directive  
on mandatory reporting for listed 
companies on payments to 
governments, a welcome move to 
transparency with regard to the tax 
position of corporates in the resources 
sector. Our relevant disclosures are 
referred to on page 106. As the 
OECD’s base erosion and profit 
shifting project moves into the 
implementation stage, we are now 
complying with the reporting 
requests of member countries.
Following the endorsement of the 
“Aiming for A” shareholder resolution 
at our 2016 AGM, last year we 
welcomed the launch of the 
recommendations of the Taskforce 
on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure (TCFD). We have stated 
publicly our support for the TCFD,  
and details of our progress in 
identifying and addressing the risks 
and opportunities resulting from 
climate change for our business  
are included in this report and the 
upcoming 2017 Sustainability Report.
We face many challenging situations 
at our operations, as we work to 
extract resources safely, profitably  
and responsibly, to mitigate our 
environmental impact and support 
our host communities. We recognise 
the value of multi-stakeholder 
dialogue in addressing these complex 
situations through shared learnings 
and expertise. 
This year we have participated in a 
number of such initiatives, including 
those focused on management of 
security, development of guidance on 
human rights for the commodities 
trading sector, and addressing the 
challenges associated with the cobalt 
value chain. Looking ahead, we seek 
to continue to strengthen our 
engagement in these platforms,  
and to identify opportunities for 
partnerships that can help us solve 
the complex challenges we 
encounter at and around 
our operations.
We remain committed to 
transparency, and in 2017 on a 
voluntary basis we published our first 
report on the steps we are taking to 
review modern slavery in our supply 
chain, and will be providing a further 
update this year.
There are many opportunities and 
challenges ahead for resource 
businesses. I believe that Glencore 
will continue to play a leading role  
in sustainable value creation for all 
our stakeholders.

Board governance and structure
Overview
This governance report sets out  
how Glencore has applied the  
main principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the Code”) in a 
manner which enables shareholders 
to evaluate how these principles  
have been applied. As a London 
premium listed entity we seek to 
ensure full compliance with the  
Code. The Board believes that the 
Company has throughout the year 
complied with all relevant provisions 
contained in the Code.
The Glencore Board currently 
comprises eight Non-Executive 
Directors (including the Chairman) 
and one Executive Director. On 
1 January 2018 Gill Marcus joined  
the Board. A list of the Directors  
with their brief biographical details 
and other significant commitments,  
is provided in the previous pages. 
The Chief Financial Officer attends  
all meetings of the Board and Audit 
Committee. The Company Secretary 
attends all meetings of the Board 
and its committees. 
This report should be read in conjunction with the Directors’ Report  
and the remainder of the Governance section
Division of responsibilities
As a Jersey incorporated company, 
Glencore has a unitary Board, 
meaning all Directors share equal 
responsibility for decisions taken. 
Glencore has established a clear 
division between the respective 
responsibilities of the Non-Executive 
Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer which are set out in a 
schedule of responsibilities which  
has been approved by the Board. 
While the Non-Executive Chairman  
is responsible for leading the Board’s 
discussions and decision-making, the 
CEO is responsible for implementing 
and executing strategy and for 
leading Glencore’s operating 
performance and day-to-day 
management. The CEO and CFO 
have line of sight across the Group. 
The CEO is further supported by the 
Group’s senior management team 
principally comprising the heads of 
the businesses and the heads of legal 
and strategy. The Company Secretary 
is responsible for ensuring that there 
is clear and effective information  
flow to the Non-Executive Directors.
The Senior Independent Director is 
available to meet with shareholders 
and acts as an intermediary between 
the Chairman and other independent 
Directors when required. This division 
of responsibilities, coupled with the 
schedule of reserved matters for the 
Board, ensures that no individual  
has unfettered powers of decision.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Non-Executive Directors
The Company’s Non-Executive 
Directors provide a broad range  
of skills and experience to the  
Board, which assists in their roles  
in formulating the Company’s 
strategy and in providing constructive 
challenge to executive management. 
Glencore regularly assesses its Non-
Executive Directors’ independence. 
Except for Peter Coates, due to his 
employment by the Group during 
2013–14, they all are regarded by  
the Company as Independent 
Non-Executive Directors within  
the meaning of ‘‘independent’’ as  
defined in the Code and free from 
any business or other relationship 
which could materially interfere 
with the exercise of their 
independent judgement.
Management of conflicts of interest
All Directors endeavour to avoid any 
situation of conflict of interest with 
the Company. Potential conflicts can 
arise and therefore processes and 
procedures are in place requiring 
Directors to identify and declare any 
actual or potential conflict of interest. 
Any such notifications are required to 
be made by the Directors prior to, or 
at, a Board meeting and all Directors 
have a duty to update the whole 
Board of any changes in 
circumstances. Glencore’s Articles 
of Association and Jersey law allow 
for the Board to authorise potential 
conflicts and the potentially 
conflicted Director must abstain  
from any vote accordingly. During 
2017, no abstention procedures for 
conflicts had to be activated.
Board Committees 
The following four Committees are in 
place to assist the Board in exercising 
its functions: Audit, Nomination, 
Remuneration and Health, Safety, 
Environmental and Communities 
(HSEC), as set out in the diagram on 
the next page. Committee meetings 
are held prior to Board meetings and 
at each scheduled Board meeting 
the chairman of each Committee 
leads a discussion concerning  
the Committee’s activities since  
the previous Board meeting. 
The Committees carry out a 
considerable amount of work.  
In particular:
• the Audit Committee provides 
challenge and enquiry on the 
significant areas of financial 
and accounting oversight and  
risk management
• the HSEC Committee, whose 
membership includes both 
Chairman and CEO, continues to 
have the heaviest workload of all 
the committees due to its strong 
focus on sustainability issues, 
especially safety performance 
A report for 2017 from each 
Committee Chairman is set out later 
in this Corporate governance report.
Each Committee reports to, and has 
its terms of reference approved by, 
the Board and the minutes of the 
Committee meetings are circulated 
to the Board. Each Committee 
reviewed its terms of reference during 
the year and as a result revisions were 
made to the HSEC Committee’s 
terms of reference to ensure they 
reflect the Board’s expectations  
as to the Committee’s role. 
All Committees’ terms of reference 
are available at: www.glencore.com/

Additional  
Information Board meetings 
The Board has approved a formal 
schedule which sets out those 
matters which are reserved for  
its decision-making alone such as 
strategy, the annual budget and 
material acquisitions and disposals. 
Meetings are usually held at the 
Company’s headquarters in Baar, 
Switzerland. Details of the Board  
and Committee meetings held 
during the year are detailed above.
The Board and its Committees have 
standing agenda items to cover their 
proposed business at their scheduled 
meetings. The Chairman seeks to 
ensure that the very significant work 
of the Committees feeds into, and 
benefits as to feedback from, the full 
Board. The Board and Committee 
meetings also benefit from 
presentations by senior executives 
and some technical and investor 
relations updates. Presentations from 
the business and senior management 
allow Directors to enhance their 
understanding of the business and 
the implementation of strategy, in 
turn contributing to a more effective 
Board. A summary of the Board’s 
main activities during 2017 is set  
out on the next page. 
Several times a year the Chairman 
holds meetings with the Non-
Executive Directors without the 
Executive Director present, and at 
least once a year the Non-Executive 
Directors meet without the 
Chairman present.
Appointment and  
re-election of Directors
All Directors will be offering 
themselves for re-election at the  
2018 AGM. 
All of the Directors have service 
agreements or letters of appointment 
and the details of their terms are set 
out in the Directors’ remuneration 
report. No other contract with  
the Company or any subsidiary 
undertaking of the Company in 
which any Director was materially 
interested existed during or at  
the end of the financial year. 
Information, management  
meetings, site visits and  
professional development
It is considered of great importance 
that the Non-Executive Directors 
attain a good knowledge of the 
Company and its business and 
allocate sufficient time to Glencore  
to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. The Board calendar is 
planned to ensure that Directors  
are briefed on a wide range of  
topics. As well as internal briefings,  
Directors attend appropriate  
external seminars and briefings.
While attending Company meetings, 
the Directors also usually engage  
with heads of commodities and other 
senior Group functions. In addition, in 
order to better familiarise themselves 
with the industrial activities, site visits 
are also arranged. During 2017, three 
operations were visited.
All Directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible to  
the Board for ensuring the Board 
procedures are complied with, and 
have access to independent and 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense, where they judge this  
to be necessary to discharge their 
responsibilities as Directors.

Additional  
Information Director induction
New Directors receive a full, formal 
and tailored induction on joining the 
Board, including meetings with senior 
management. The induction process 
for Martin Gilbert in 2017 provided 
a comprehensive introduction to the 
main aspects of the Group, its 
business and functions and the roles 
and responsibilities of a UK listed 
company director and the Company’s 
Code of Conduct. A similar induction 
is being undertaken for Gill Marcus 
in 2018.
Board effectiveness 
Since an external evaluation was 
carried out during 2015 and no 
material governance issues arose 
during 2016, the Board resolved to 
carry out an internal evaluation for 
the year. As part of this process, the 
findings from the external evaluation 
(which were summarised in the 2015 
Annual Report) were reviewed.  
The evaluation process has been 
augmented by the private sessions 
which take place between the 
Non-Executive Directors without 
management and ongoing 
discussions as to the efficiency  
and effectiveness of the Board  
and its committees. There are 
currently no material issues which 
have been identified regarding the 
composition or operation of the 
Board. The next Board evaluation  
will be facilitated externally.
Remuneration
Remuneration is covered in the 
Directors’ remuneration report which 
follows this section. It includes 
a description of the work of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Diversity
The diversity policy which is  
applied to appointments to our 
administrative, management and 
supervisory bodies with regard to 
aspects such as, for instance, age, 
gender, or education and professional 
backgrounds is the same as for all 
Group employees, as described on 
page 36. During 2017 Martin Gilbert 
and Gill Marcus were appointed 
to the Board. 
The Board is very cognisant  
of the ongoing desire from 
stakeholders for greater diversity  
in senior management and boards.  
In particular, leading institutional 
shareholders have set a target for 
women to comprise 30% of the 
senior management and boards of 
FTSE100 companies by 2020. While 
we support the aims of diversity, we 
do not believe that a one size fits all 
policy is correct. Historically, certain 
sectors have attracted a considerable 
number of career women while 
others – such as mining and 
commodities – have not. Even today 
we find it challenging to fill positions 
in remote mining locations and for 
the marketing of commodities 
by women. 
  Risk – Board 
leadership
The Board provides leadership 
and oversight on risk  
management. Specifically it: 
(1) provides a robust assessment  
of the principal risks facing  
the Group
The Board determines the nature 
and extent of the principal risks the 
Group should take in achieving its 
strategic objectives. The Board has 
carried out a robust assessment  
of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. 
The Directors’ description of those 
risks and their explanation as to 
how they are being managed or 
mitigated are set out on page 42.
(2) determines a longer-term  
viability statement 
Taking account of the Group’s 
position and principal risks, the 
Directors assess the prospects of the 
Group and conclude whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment. Their conclusions 
are set out on page 109.
(3) monitors the Group’s risk 
management and internal  
control systems
The Board oversees sound risk 
management and internal control 
systems. It carries out a regular 
review of their effectiveness 
including reviewing the Group’s 
internal financial controls and the 
Group’s internal control and risk 
management. This monitoring and 
review covers all material controls, 
including financial, operational and 
compliance controls. Their work  
and conclusions are described  
on pages 42 and 91 – 94.

Financial reporting
The Group has in place a 
comprehensive financial review cycle, 
which includes a detailed annual 
planning/budgeting process where 
business units prepare budgets for 
overall consolidation and approval  
by the Board. The Group uses a large 
number of performance indicators  
to measure both operational and 
financial activity in the business. 
Depending on the measure, these  
are reported and reviewed on a daily, 
weekly or monthly basis. In addition, 
management in the business receives 
weekly and monthly reports of 
indicators which are the basis of 
regular operational meetings, where 
corrective action is taken if necessary. 
At a Group level, a well-developed 
management accounts pack, 
including income statement, balance 
sheet, cash flow statement as well as 
key ratios is prepared and reviewed 
monthly by management. As part  
of the monthly reporting process, 
a reforecast of the current year 
projections is performed. To ensure 
consistency of reporting, the Group 
has a global consolidation system 
as well as a common accounting 
policies and procedures manual. 
Management monitors the 
publication of new reporting 
standards and works closely with  
our external auditor in evaluating 
their impact, if any.
Risk management  
and internal control 
The Board has applied Principle  
C.2 of the Code by establishing a 
continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the risks 
that are considered significant by the 
Group in accordance with the revised 
Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control 
published by the Financial Reporting 
Council. This process has been in 
place for the period under review  
and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and financial 
statements. The process is designed 
to manage and mitigate rather than 
eliminate risk, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Directors 
confirm that they have carried out  
a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group and have 
reviewed the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control 
systems. This review excludes 
associates of the Group as Glencore 
does not have the ability to dictate or 
modify the internal controls of these 
entities. This report describes how the 
effectiveness of the Group’s structure 
of internal controls including financial, 
operational and compliance controls 
and risk management systems 
is reviewed.

Additional  
Information Katanga Restatement
Notwithstanding the strong Group 
internal control environment, 
a restatement of past financial 
statements was required at Katanga. 
This followed an internal review  
of certain of Katanga’s historic 
accounting practices under the 
direction of the independent 
directors of Katanga, who engaged 
Canadian legal counsel, and an 
international accounting firm, to 
assist them in conducting the review. 
Despite the matter not having 
a material adverse effect on the 
consolidated income, financial 
position or cash flows of Glencore,  
the Board regarded it as serious and 
accordingly established a Board 
committee headed by the Chairman 
to carefully consider the findings of 
this review, and noted the material 
weaknesses identified in Katanga’s 
internal controls over financial 
reporting. As a result of these matters, 
three of the Katanga executive 
directors resigned from the Katanga 
board and Glencore nominated  
three new directors to replace them. 
Additionally as a result of a review  
by Glencore, various structural and 
internal control changes have been 
implemented across the copper 
department in order to enhance and 
strengthen its financial processes and 
procedures. Your Board has been 
committed to ensure that the 
weaknesses identified are addressed 
and do not recur.
Katanga has been advised by the 
Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) 
that its enforcement staff are 
investigating, among other things, 
whether Katanga’s previously filed 
periodic public disclosures contain 
statements that are misleading in a 
material respect and the adequacy  
of Katanga’s corporate governance 
practices and the related conduct  
of certain directors and officers  
of Katanga. Katanga has also been 
advised that OSC enforcement  
staff are reviewing Katanga’s risk 
disclosure in connection with 
applicable requirements under 
certain international bribery, 
government payment and anti-
corruption laws. Katanga is 
cooperating fully with the OSC 
investigations and the Board 
committee continues to closely 
monitor developments with  
respect to the OSC investigation. 
Approach to risk management
Effective risk management is crucial 
in helping the Group achieve its 
objectives of preserving its overall 
financial strength for the benefit of all 
shareholders and other stakeholders 
and safeguarding its ability to 
continue as a going concern while 
generating sustainable long-term 
profitability. Spanning the 
organisational structure, Glencore’s 
disciplined approach to risk 
management and control originates 
with strategic responsibility in the 
hands of the Board, which also 
retains operational authority on 
matters exceeding agreed thresholds 
of materiality.
The Board retains final authority for 
assessing and approving the Group’s 
overall risk appetite and sets overall 
limits which are subject to review 
annually. It is assisted by the work of 
the Audit Committee for oversight 
and by senior management for 
day-to-day operational matters, in 
order to maintain an effective risk 
management governance apparatus 
for the Group.
Risk Management Framework 
Management engagement
The Company’s senior management 
reviews the major risks facing the 
Group and decides if the level of risk 
is acceptable or whether further steps 
need to be taken to mitigate these 
risks. Together, central and business 
management set the level of risk 
appetite by ensuring that there  
is an appropriate balance between 
the level of risk assumed and the 
expected return.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible 
for reviewing the risk management 
system and internal controls.
Mandated by the Board, the  
Audit and HSEC Committees are 
responsible for ensuring that the 
significant risks identified are  
properly managed.
Group functions
Group functions (Risk Management, 
Compliance, Legal and Sustainable 
Development) support the Business 
Risk Owners and senior management 
in mitigating risk across the Group.
Internal Audit
Internal Audit, as an independent 
assurance provider, reviews the risk 
management process and internal 
controls established by the 
management team. 
A risk-based audit approach is 
applied in order to focus on high  
risk areas during the audit process. 
It involves discussions with 
management on the risks identified 
in the business risk registers, 
emerging risks, operational changes, 
new investments and capital projects.
The key results from this process are 
reported to the Audit Committee for 
their review.
As well as being subject to a review  
of the Audit Committee for its 
effectiveness, the Internal Audit 
function was also subject to a 
conformance review in 2017  
Corporate Governance report

92
Glencore Annual Report 2017 by KPMG pursuant to the 
International Internal Audit Standards 
and International Professional 
Practices Framework Guidance.  
A Generally Conforms assessment 
(the best scale of assessment 
available) was made by KPMG. 
Industrial risk management 
We believe that every employee 
should be accountable for the risks 
related to their role. As a result,  
we encourage our employees to 
escalate all risks to their immediate 
supervisors. This enables risks to be 
tackled and mitigated at an early 
stage by the team with the relevant 
level of expertise.
The management teams at each 
industrial operation are responsible 
for implementing a risk management 
process that identifies, assesses and 
manages risk.
The risks that may impact on 
business objectives and plans are 
maintained in a business risk register. 
They include strategic, compliance, 
operational and reporting risks.
Any significant risks are reported  
to Management and the Audit 
Committee. A Corporate Risk 
Management Framework is 
implemented on a Group-wide  
basis to ensure consistency in the 
assessment and reporting of risks.
HSEC risk management 
These risk management processes 
are operated at asset level subject  
to coordination and guidance from 
the central sustainability team and 
subject to the leadership and 
oversight of the HSEC Committee.
The Group’s internal assurance 
programme continues to be 
developed for the assessment of 
compliance with leading practices  
in health and safety, environment  
and communities. 
Further information is provided in the 
report from the HSEC Committee 
below and will be published in the 
Group’s sustainability report for 2017.
Marketing risk management 
Glencore’s marketing activities are 
exposed to commodity price, basis, 
volatility, foreign exchange, interest 
rate, credit and performance, liquidity 
and regulatory risks. 
Glencore devotes significant 
resources to developing and 
implementing policies and 
procedures to identify, monitor and 
manage these risks. 
Glencore has a disciplined and 
conservative approach to Marketing 
Risk (MR) management supported  
by its flat organisational structure. 
Glencore continues to update and 
implement policies which are 
intended to mitigate and manage 
commodity price, credit and other 
related risks. 
Glencore’s MR is managed at an 
individual, business and central  
level. Initial responsibility for risk 
management is provided by the 
businesses in accordance with and 
complementing their commercial 
decision-making. A support, 
challenge and verification role is 
provided by the central MR function 
headed by the Chief Risk Officer 
(CRO) via its daily risk reporting  
and analysis which is split by  
market and credit risk.
The CEO, as the central figure of 
commercial leadership and control, 
drives functional risk management 
policy, supported by the CFO and 
CRO, with data and reporting from 
the central risk team and the other 
key functional units. In turn the CEO 
reports to, and seeks authority limits 
from the Board, with the main 
oversight role being performed  
by the Audit Committee which 
receives a report from the CRO  
at each of its scheduled meetings. 
It also approves (subject to Board 
confirmation) the Group-wide risk 
profile, and any exceptions to  
agreed positional thresholds.
At the heart of the risk management 
regime is the process of challenge 
that takes place between the  
CEO, the CRO and the business 
heads which sets risk appetite in 
accordance with Group requirements 
and market conditions for each 
commodity. The objective is to  
ensure that an appropriate balance  
is maintained between the levels of 
risk assumed and expected return, 
which relies on the commodity-
specific expert knowledge provided 
by business heads. This is then 
subject to challenge from the  
CEO based on his overall Group 
knowledge and experience. This 
process is designed to manage risk 
effectively while facilitating the fast, 
commercial decision-making which 
is required in a dynamic commodity 
marketing company.
Another important consideration  
of the MR team is the challenge  
of dealing with the impact of large 
transactional flows across many 
locations. The function seeks 
to ensure effective supervision  
by its timely and comprehensive 
transaction recording, ongoing 
monitoring of the transactions and 
resultant exposures, providing all 
encompassing positional reporting, 
and continually assessing universal 
counterparty credit exposure. 
Key focus points
Market Risk limits and reporting
The MR team provides a wide array  
of daily/weekly reporting. A daily risk 
report showing Group Value at Risk 
(VaR) as shown on the next page and 
various other stress tests and analyses 
are distributed to the CEO, CFO  
and CRO. Business risk summaries 
showing positional exposure and 
other relevant metrics, together with 
potential margin call requirements, 
are also circulated daily. The MR 
function works to enhance its stress 
and scenario testing as well as 
enhancing measures to capture risk 
exposure within the specific areas  
of the business, e.g. within metals, 
concentrate treatment and  
refining charges are analysed.

insurance cover, discounting and 
other means of reducing credit risk 
from counterparts. In addition, 
mark-to-market exposures in relation 
to hedging contracts are regularly 
and substantially collateralised 
(primarily with cash) pursuant to 
margining agreements in place  
with such hedge counterparts. 
The Group-wide Credit Risk Policy 
governs higher levels of credit risk 
exposure, with an established 
threshold for referral of credit 
decisions by business heads to CFO/
CEO (relating to unsecured amounts 
in excess of $75 million with BBB or 
lower rated counterparts). At lower 
levels of materiality, decisions may 
be taken by the business heads 
where key strategic transactions 
or established relationships suggest 
that an open account exposure may 
be warranted. 
Systems and reporting
Whilst no single trading system that 
the Group can identify appears able 
to manage the broad range of 
requirements that the different 
business profiles of the Group would 
place on it, interfacing with multiple 
source systems and transferring data 
from one to another create enhanced 
risk to data integrity, granularity, 
consistency and timeliness.
Corporate Governance report
continued
The Group monitors its commodity 
price risk exposure by using a VaR 
computation assessing “open” 
commodity positions which are 
subject to price risks. VaR is one of 
the risk measurement techniques 
the Group uses to monitor and 
limit its primary market exposure 
related to its physical marketing 
exposures and related derivative 
positions. VaR estimates the 
potential loss in value of open 
positions that could occur as 
a result of adverse market 
movements over a defined time 
horizon, given a specific level of 
confidence. The methodology is 
a statistically defined, probability 
based approach that takes into 
account market volatilities, as well 
as risk diversification benefits by 
recognising offsetting positions 
and correlations between 
commodities and markets. In this 
way, risks can be compared across 
all markets and commodities and 
risk exposures can be aggregated 
to derive a single risk value.
Last year, the Board approved the 
Audit Committee’s recommendation 
of a one day, 95% VaR limit of 
$100 million for 2017, consistent with 
the previous year. This limit is subject 
to review and approval on an annual 
basis. The purpose of this Group limit 
is to assist senior management in 
controlling the Group’s overall risk 
profile, within this tolerance 
threshold. During 2017 Glencore’s 
reported average daily VaR was 
approximately $25 million, with 
an observed high of $41 million  
and a low of $13 million.
There were no breaches in the limit 
during the year.
The Group remains aware of the 
extent of coverage of risk exposures 
and their limitations. In addition, VaR 
does not purport to represent actual 
gains or losses in fair value on 
earnings to be incurred by the  
Group, nor are these VaR results 
considered indicative of future 
market movements or representative 
of any actual impact on its future 
results. VaR remains viewed in the 
context of its limitations; notably, the 
use of historical data as a proxy for 
estimating future events, market 
illiquidity risks and risks associated 
with longer time horizons as well  
as tail risks. Recognising these 
limitations the Group complements 
and refines this risk analysis 
through the use of stress and 
scenario analysis. The Group 
regularly back-tests its VaR to 
establish adequacy of accuracy  
and to facilitate analysis of 
significant differences, if any.
The Board has again approved 
the Audit Committee’s 
recommendation of a one day, 95% 
VaR limit of $100 million for 2018.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Dealing with requirements arising 
from regulatory reform In 2017, 
Glencore continued to implement 
the requirements of financial 
regulatory reform, including:
• the European Market Abuse 
Regulation (MAR) which affects the 
protection and disclosure of inside 
information and the prevention of 
market manipulation
•  the Dodd-Frank Act, the European 
Market Infrastructure Regulation 
(EMIR) and the Swiss Financial 
Market Infrastructure Act (FMIA) 
which affect in particular the 
areas of risk mitigation (trade 
confirmation timeframes, 
portfolio reconciliation, portfolio 
compression and dispute 
resolution) and trade reporting
Upcoming financial regulatory reform 
proposals or requirements include:
• further requirements under EMIR 
including mandatory clearing and 
margining requirements
• further requirements under FMIA 
including trade reporting, risk 
mitigation, margin requirements 
and mandatory clearing
•  MIFID II including EU authorisations 
and position limits
The impact of certain aspects of 
these and other new regulations  
to commodity market participants is 
potentially considerable. The impact 
on our marketing business will largely 
be in the form of compliance 
requirements (with associated costs), 
rather than meaningful commercial 
limitations. Glencore’s compliance, 
finance, IT and risk teams continue  
to work together in monitoring and 
advising management on these 
developments.
Internal Audit 
Glencore has a dedicated Internal 
Audit function reporting directly to 
the Audit Committee. The role of 
Internal Audit is to evaluate and 
improve the effectiveness of risk 
management, control, and business 
governance processes. 
Internal Audit reviews areas of 
potential risk within the business and 
suggests control solutions to mitigate 
exposures identified. The Audit 
Committee considers and approves 
the risk-based audit plan, areas 
of audit focus and resources and 
is regularly updated on audits 
performed and relevant findings, as 
well as the progress on implementing 
the actions arising. In particular,  
the Committee considered Internal 
Audit’s high priority issues (with a 
particular focus on procurement 
and systems), its KPIs and the 
effectiveness and timeliness  
of management’s responses  
to its findings.
The Audit Committee reviewed  
the effectiveness of the Internal  
Audit function. As part of this work, 
it considered the function’s 
management framework and its 
improvement programme.
Relationships with shareholders
The Board aims to present a 
balanced and clear view of the Group 
in communications with shareholders 
and believes that being transparent 
in describing how we see the market 
and the prospects for the business 
is extremely important. 
We communicate with shareholders 
in a number of different ways. 
The formal reporting of our full-  
and half-year results and quarterly 
production reports is achieved 
through a combination of releases, 
presentations, group calls and one to 
one meetings. The full- and half-year 
reporting is followed by investor 
meetings in a variety of locations 
where we have institutional 
shareholders. We also regularly  
meet with existing and prospective 
shareholders to update or to 
introduce them to the Company  
and periodically arrange visits to  
parts of the business to give analysts 
and major shareholders a better 
understanding of how we manage 
our operations. These visits and 
meetings are principally undertaken 
by the CEO, CFO and senior members 
of the Investor Relations team and an 
array of business heads. In addition, 
many major shareholders have 
meetings with the Chairman and 
appropriate senior personnel of the 
Group including other Non-Executive 
Directors, the Company Secretary 
and senior Sustainability managers. 
In particular in 2017, the following 
were undertaken:
• a presentation and investor 
roadshow was held in May to 
provide a detailed account of 
the Company’s sustainability 
policies and plans. Led by the 
Chairman of the HSEC Committee, 
presentations were also given  
by the Chairman and the CEO
• the Chairman and Company 
Secretary met with a large number 
of institutional shareholders in 
the summer, principally to discuss 
governance and reporting
The Board receives regular updates 
from the Company’s Head of Strategy 
on the views of shareholders through 
a briefing, which is a standing 
agenda item for all Board meetings, 
which is supplemented by input 
from the Chairman, CEO, CFO  
and, if applicable, the Senior  
Independent Director. 
AGM
The Company’s next AGM is due to 
be held in Zug on 2 May 2018. Full 
details of the meeting will be set out 
in the Notice of Meeting which will 
be sent to shareholders one month 
before the meeting. Shareholders 
unable to attend are encouraged 
to vote by proxy as detailed in the 
Notice of Meeting. 
All documents relating to the AGM 
will be available on the Company’s 
website at: www.glencore.com/agm

Governance processes
The Audit Committee usually invites 
the CEO, CFO, Group Financial 
Controller, CRO and Head of Internal 
Audit and the lead partner from  
the external auditor to attend  
each meeting. Other members  
of management and the external 
auditor may attend as and when 
required. Other Directors, and 
sometimes all other Directors, also 
attend its meetings. The Committee 
also holds private sessions with the 
external auditor and the Head of 
Internal Audit without members of 
management being present. The 
Committee has adopted guidelines 
allowing non-audit services to be 
contracted with the external auditor 
on the basis set out below.
Role, responsibilities  
and main activities
The primary function of the Audit 
Committee is to assist the Board  
in fulfilling its responsibilities with 
regard to financial reporting, external 
and internal audit, risk management 
and controls. 
During the year, the Committee’s 
principal work included the following:
•  reviewing Glencore’s internal 
financial and compliance controls 
and internal controls and risk 
management systems
• reviewing and agreeing the 
preparation and scope of the  
year-end reporting process;
• determining the global audit  
plan, scope and fees of the audit 
work to be undertaken by the 
external auditor
• evaluating the Group’s procedures 
for ensuring that the Annual Report 
and accounts, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable

and terms of engagement of the 
external auditor
•  monitoring the independence of 
the external auditor and reviewing 
the operation of the Company’s 
policy for the provision of non-audit 
services by it
•  considering and approving two 
assignments above the approval 
threshold with the external auditor 
in respect of non-audit services

Risk analysis
The Committee receives reports  
and presentations at its meetings on 
our management of marketing and 
other risks (excluding sustainability 
risks which are reviewed by the  
HSEC Committee).
Significant issues related  
to the financial statements
The Committee assesses whether 
suitable accounting policies have 
been adopted and whether 
management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements. They  
also review external auditor reports 
outlining audit work performed and 
conclusions reached in respect of key 
judgements, as well as identifying  
any issues in respect of these. 
During the year, the Committee  
has focused in particular on these  
key matters: 
1. Katanga restatement
The Katanga restatement issue is 
described on page 92. Areas of focus 
for the Audit Committee were: 
• understanding the material defects 
in the internal control environment 
which led to the misstatements 
• to satisfy itself, in discussions 
with the CEO and CFO and the 
internal and external auditor that 
the remedial steps proposed to 
the internal controls are sufficient 
to ensure that the weaknesses 
identified do not recur
• overseeing the implementation and 
monitoring of recommendations  
by external experts and the  
Board committee to strengthen 
internal controls 
• to consider the appropriate 
treatment in our accounts  
for matters arising as a result  
of these issues
2. Acquisitions and disposals 
Accounting for acquisitions  
involves significant management 
judgements and estimates. In 2017, 
the Committee analysed the 
accounting treatment of the QIA  
and Rosneft strategic partnership,  
the purchase of interests in Katanga, 
Mutanda and Volcan, the finalisation 
of the sale of a ~50% stake in 
Glencore Agriculture, the sale of a 
controlling stake in oil storage assets 
and the Trevali zinc assets transaction. 
3. Impairment 
The Committee considered whether 
the carrying value of goodwill, 
industrial assets, physical trade 
positions and material loans and 
advances may be impaired as a result 
of commodity price volatility and 
some asset specific factors. The 
Committee reviewed management’s 
reports, outlining the basis for the key 
assumptions used in calculating the 
recoverable value for the Group’s 
assets. Future performance 
assumptions used are derived from 
the Board approved business plan.  
As part of the process for approval of 
this plan, the Committee considered 
the feasibility of strategic plans 
underpinning future performance 
expectations, and whether they 
remain achievable. Considerable 
focus was applied to management’s 
commodity price and exchange rate 
assumptions. The Committee 
discussed with the external auditor 
their work in respect of impairment 
review, which was a key area of focus 
for them.
4. Taxation
Due to its global reach, including 
operating in high risk jurisdictions,  
the Group is subject to enhanced 
complexity and uncertainty in 
accounting for income taxes, 
particularly the evaluation of tax 
exposures and recoverability of 
deferred tax. The Committee has 
engaged with management to 
understand the potential tax 
exposures globally and the key 
estimates taken in determining the 
positions recorded, including the 
status of communications with local 
tax authorities and the carrying 
values of deferred tax assets. 
5. Counterparty exposures
The Group’s global operations expose 
it to credit and performance risk, 
which result in the requirement to 
make estimates around recoverability 
of receivables, loans, trade advances 
and contractual non-performance.  
As part of an ongoing review, the 
Committee considered material 
continuing exposures, the robustness 
of processes followed to evaluate 
recoverability and whether the 
amounts recorded in the financial 
statements are reasonable.
Following its analysis of these 
matters, the Committee satisfied 
itself that the estimates made by 
management are reasonable and 
that financial statements disclosures 
included in the accounts 
are appropriate.

Additional  
Information Internal Audit
The Committee monitored the 
internal audit function as described 
under Internal Audit on page 95. 
External Audit
The Committee has evaluated the 
effectiveness of the external auditor 
and as part of this assessment, 
has considered:
•  the steps taken by the auditor 
to ensure their objectivity and 
independence
•  the deep knowledge of the 
Company which enhances 
Deloitte’s ability to perform as 
external auditor
•  competence when handling key 
accounting and audit judgements 
and ability to communicate 
these to the Committee and 
management
• the extent of the auditor’s resources 
and technical capability to deliver 
a robust and timely audit including 
consideration of the qualifications 
and expertise of the team
•  auditor’s performance and progress 
against the agreed audit plan, 
including communication of 
changes to the plan and  
identified risks 
•  the proven stability that is gained 
from the continued engagement  
of Deloitte as external auditor
• the benefit of lead audit 
partner rotation.
The Committee assesses the quality 
and effectiveness of the external 
audit process on an annual basis  
in conjunction with the senior 
management team. Key areas of 
focus include consideration of the 
quality and robustness of the audit, 
identification of and response to 
areas of risk and the experience  
and expertise of the audit team, 
including the lead audit partner. 
Provision of non-audit services  
by the external auditor
The Group’s policy on non-audit 
services provided by the external 
auditor is designed to ensure the 
external auditor independence and 
objectivity is safeguarded. A specified 
wide range of services may not be 
provided as they have the potential  
to impair the external auditor’s 
independence (Excluded Services). 
The Audit Committee’s approval is 
required for (1) any Excluded Service 
(2) any other engagement where 
either (i) the fee is contingent,  
(ii) the fee may exceed $500,000, or 
(iii) where the fees for all non-audit 
work may exceed $15 million. Subject 
to these restrictions and other 
safeguards in the policy, the external 
auditor may be permitted to provide 
certain non-audit services when it is 
concluded that they are the most 
appropriate supplier due to efficiency 
and status as a leading firm for those 
specific services. For 2017, fees paid to 
the external auditor were $32 million, 
the total non-audit fees of which 
were $9 million; further details  
are contained in note 28 to the 
financial statements.
Reappointment of the  
external auditor
Deloitte has been the auditor of the 
listed entity since its IPO in 201 1. 
A lead audit engagement partner 
rotation occurred prior to the financial 
year ended 31 December 2013 and is 
due to take place again during 2018 
for which preparations have already 
commenced. 
The Board and the Audit Committee 
acknowledge the greater investor 
scrutiny as to a tendering for, and 
rotation of, the external auditor and 
note the recent regulatory and 
guidance changes.
Taking into account all relevant 
factors the Audit Committee has 
concluded that it is not appropriate 
to tender at the current time.
The Committee has determined  
that it is satisfied that the work of 
Deloitte LLP is effective, the scope  
is appropriate and significant 
judgements have been challenged 
robustly by the lead partner and 
team. Additionally, there are no 
contractual restrictions on the 
Company’s choice of external auditor. 
The Committee has therefore 
recommended to the Board that a 
proposal be put to shareholders at 
the 2018 AGM for the reappointment 
of Deloitte LLP as external auditor.

Secondly, the Committee considered 
the composition of the Board and 
refreshment. Search processes for 
suitable additional Non-Executive 
Directors were conducted. 
Martin Gilbert was appointed  
in May 2017. In recommending  
his appointment to the Board, 
Mr Gilbert’s in-depth financial 
knowledge and long track record 
both as a listed company CEO and  
as a FTSE Non-Executive Director 
were considered. At the end of the 
year Gill Marcus was also appointed,  
with effect from 1 January 2018. 
Ms Marcus will bring to the Board 
extensive experience of finance  
and public service. 
The Committee has noted the 
recommendations of the Hampton/
Alexander Review on gender and the 
Parker Review on ethnic diversity. It is 
part of the Committee’s policy when 
making new Board appointments to 
consider the importance of diversity 
on the Board, including gender  
and ethnicity. This is considered 
in conjunction with experience  
and qualifications. Further details  
are set out on page 90. 
External consultancy Spencer Stuart 
was retained for search mandates 
during the year. Other than this 
engagement Spencer Stuart do not 
provide other services to the Group.
Peter Grauer 
Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee 
1 March 2018
All members served on the 
Committee throughout the year. 
The Committee only comprises 
Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Committee met  
four times during the year and all 
members attended these meetings. 
In addition, some of the discussions 
and deliberations in respect of the 
matters summarised below were 
carried out at Board meetings. 
Roles and responsibilities
The main responsibilities of the 
Nomination Committee are to assist 
the Board with succession planning 
and with the selection process for  
the appointment of new Directors, 
both Executive and Non-Executive, 
including the Chairman. This involves:
•  evaluating the balance and skills, 
knowledge and experience of 
the Board and identifying the 
capabilities and qualities  
(including diversity) required  
for a particular appointment
•  overseeing the search process
•  evaluating the need for Board 
refreshment and succession 
planning generally
Main activities
The Committee focused on two main 
tasks during this year. Firstly, prior 
to the notice of 2017 AGM being 
compiled, the Committee considered 
the performance of each Director. 
It concluded that each Director is 
effective in their role and continues 
to demonstrate the commitment 
required to remain on the Board. 
Accordingly, it recommended to the 
Board that re-election resolutions be 
put for each continuing Director 
at the 2017 AGM.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Directors’ remuneration report 
For the year ended 31 December 201 7
Introduction 
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased 
to present our Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2017. As usual, we have sought 
to make this report as short, simple and straightforward 
as possible. 
As a Jersey registered company headquartered in 
Switzerland, Glencore is not subject to the UK’s reporting 
regime but this report is prepared in full compliance  
with the UK rules, unless stated otherwise. Accordingly, 
over the following pages, we have set out details of the 
implementation of our reward policy in 2017 including 
the governance surrounding pay decisions, members  
of the Committee and its advisers and details of what  
was paid to Directors during the year.
At the 2017 AGM, shareholders approved our 
remuneration arrangements through two votes, one  
on the Directors’ Remuneration Report (excluding the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy) and the other on our 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy with votes in excess  
of 98% in favour of each resolution. 
There are no changes in Board remuneration to report.
The Committee continues to ensure that the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and its implementation are 
attractive to shareholders in reflecting good governance, 
reasonable terms and complete transparency.
John Mack 
Remuneration Committee Chairman 
1 March 2018
Basis of reporting
We have presented this Remuneration Report to reflect 
the reporting requirements on remuneration matters for 
companies with a UK governance profile, particularly the 
UK’s Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 
(the “UK Remuneration Regulations”). The Company aims 
to comply in all material respects with the reporting 
obligations within these regulations as a matter of good 
practice. The report also describes how the Board has 
complied with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code relating to remuneration matters.
Our auditors have reported on certain parts of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and stated whether,  
in their opinion, those parts of the report have been 
properly prepared. Those sections of the report which 
have been subject to audit are clearly indicated. 
Part A – Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved  
by shareholders at the 2017 AGM and the Company 
continues its obligation to only make payments within  
the limits it allows. The Policy will be put to a shareholder 
vote the earlier of once every three years or when an 
amendment to the Policy is proposed. As the Policy  
is not being put forward for shareholder approval  
at the 2018 AGM, it has not been included in this  
Annual Report. A summary is set out below  
and it is reproduced in full on our website at:  
www.glencore.com/who-we-are/governance. 
Summary of Directors’ Remuneration Policy
General Policy for Executive Directors
To facilitate the attraction, retention and motivation  
of Executive Directors and other senior executives of 
appropriately high calibre to implement the Group’s 
strategy. In practice, the CEO has continued to waive 
participation in bonus or LTI arrangements.
Base salary
Provides market competitive fixed remuneration.  
The Committee has not increased the salary level  
for any Executive Director since May 201 1. 
Benefits
To provide appropriate supporting non-monetary 
benefits. Benefits received by Mr Glasenberg comprise 
salary loss (long-term sickness) and accident insurance/
travel insurance with a limit of $20,000 p.a. 
Pension
Provides basic retirement benefits which reflects local 
market practice. Mr Glasenberg participates in the 
standard pension scheme for all Baar (Switzerland) -based 
employees with an annual cap on the cost of provision  
of retirement benefits of $150,000 p.a. 
Annual Bonus Plan
Supports delivery of short-term operational, financial 
and strategic goals. The Committee has set a maximum 
annual bonus level of 200% of base salary. 
Long-Term Incentives
Glencore Performance Share Plan incentivises the 
creation of shareholder value over the longer-term.  
The Committee has set a maximum annual grant  
level of 200% of base salary. 
Significant Personal Shareholdings
Aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.  
The Committee has set a formal shareholding 
requirement for Executive Directors of 300% of salary.  
The CEO has a beneficial ownership of over 8% of the 
Company’s issued share capital.

Information Directors’ remuneration report
For the year ended 31 December 201 7 
continued
Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees
Reflects time commitment, experience, global nature and 
size of the Company. Non-Executive Directors and the 
Senior Independent Director receive a base fee; additional 
fees are paid for chairing or membership of a Board 
committee. Chairman receives a single inclusive fee. 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for any other 
remuneration or benefits of any nature.
Potential rewards under various scenarios
Under the formal policy, consistent with other  
large FTSE companies, the total available variable pay  
(i.e. the maximum amount payable in respect of bonus 
and long-term incentives) available to Mr Glasenberg 
would be approximately $5,790,000 (being four times 
base salary). As Mr Glasenberg has continued to waive 
entitlement to all variable elements, including both bonus 
and long-term incentives, his base salary and all benefits 
are set at less than 25% of the aggregate remuneration 
which would potentially have been available to him  
had he not waived participation in these aspects. These 
waivers are considered appropriate as the level of his 
personal shareholding is sufficient to provide a keen 
alignment of interest between him and of shareholders 
more generally without the need to add additional 
aspects to his package (and cost to other shareholders). 
His fixed remuneration set out below was set at a 
modestly below market level so the waivers do not reflect 
any element of an excessive bias to fixed pay in the 
traditional sense. Consistent with UK legislation, it has 
been prepared using the following assumptions.
In 2017, Mr Glasenberg’s base salary was paid in US dollars 
and his benefits and pension contributions were paid 
in Swiss francs, as described in this report.
Fixed • Consists of base salary, benefits and pension
• Base salary is applicable to both 2017 and 2018

Based on what the Director would receive if 
performance was on-target (whether inclusive  
or exclusive of share price appreciation  
and dividends): 
• STI: Mr Glasenberg currently waives any  
right to participate in the annual bonus plan 
• LTI: He does not currently participate in the 
Performance Share Plan
Executive Directors’ contracts 
The table below summarises the key features of the 
service contract for Ivan Glasenberg, the only person  
who served as an Executive Director during the year.

External appointments 
The Executive Director’s external appointments are  
noted on page 82. He assigns to the Group the 
compensation received in relation to each appointment. 
The appropriateness of these appointments is considered  
as part of the annual review of Directors’ interests/
potential conflicts. 
Non-Executive Directors’ Letters of appointment  
and re-election 
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment 
with the Company for an initial period of three years  
from their date of appointment, subject to reappointment 
at each AGM. The Company may terminate each 
appointment by immediate notice and there are no 
special arrangements or entitlements on termination 
except that the Chairman is entitled to three 
months’ notice.
As set out in last year’s Annual Report, the fees payable  
to the Non-Executive Directors were increased with  
effect from 1 January 2017. The annual fees are paid 
in accordance with a Non-Executive Director’s role and 
responsibilities. The fees payable for 2018 are unchanged

Implementation Report – Unaudited Information 
Remuneration Committee 
Membership and experience of the Remuneration 
Committee  
We believe that the members of the Committee provide  
a useful balance of abilities, experience and perspectives 
to provide the critical analysis required in carrying out  
the Committee’s function. Each of John Mack, Leonhard 
Fischer and Martin Gilbert has had a long career in the 
management of large financial services organisations  
and therefore provides considerable experience of 
remuneration analysis and implementation. All members 
of the Remuneration Committee are considered to be 
independent. Further details concerning independence  
of the Non-Executive Directors are contained on page 87. 
Role of the Remuneration Committee 
The terms of reference of the Committee set out its  
role. They are available on the Company’s website at:  
www.glencore.com/who-we-are/governance 
Its principal responsibilities are, on behalf of the Board, to: 
• set the Company’s executive remuneration policy (and 
review its ongoing relevance and appropriateness) 
• establish the remuneration packages for the Executive 
Director including the scope of pension benefits 
• determine the remuneration package for the  
Chairman, in consultation with the Chief Executive 
• have responsibility for overseeing schemes of 
performance related remuneration (including share 
incentive plans) for, and determine awards for, the 
Executive Director (as appropriate) 
• ensure that the contractual terms on termination  
for the Executive Director are fair and not excessive 
• monitor senior management remuneration 
The Committee considers corporate performance on 
HSEC and governance issues when setting remuneration 
for the Executive Director. The Committee seeks to  
ensure that the incentive structure for the Group’s senior 
management does not raise HSEC or governance risks  
by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Remuneration Committee meetings 
The Committee met two times during the year and 
considered, amongst other matters, the remuneration 
policy applicable to the Executive Director, senior 
management remuneration policy, including its level  
and structure, the form and structure of grants to 
employees under the Company’s Deferred Bonus Plan 
and Performance Share Plan, and the content and 
approval of the Remuneration Report. 
The Chairman, CEO and CFO are usually invited to  
attend some or all of the proceedings of Remuneration 
Committee meetings. They do not participate in any 
decisions concerning their own remuneration. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee 
The Committee appointed and received independent 
remuneration advice during the year from its external 
adviser, FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (FIT). FIT is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants Group (the UK 
professional body for these consultants) and adheres to its 
code of conduct. The Committee was satisfied that the 
advice provided by FIT was objective and independent. 
FIT’s fees for this advice in respect of 2017 were $4,872 
(2016: $10,410). FIT’s fees were charged on the basis of  
the firm’s standard terms of business for advice provided.  
FIT provided no other services to the Group in the year. 
The Committee also receives advice from John Burton, 
the Company Secretary. 
Relative importance of remuneration spend 
The table below illustrates the change in total 
remuneration, distributions paid and net profit from 2016 
to 2017.

Distributions and buy-backs 998 —

The figures presented have been calculated on the 
following bases: 
• Distributions and buy-backs – distributions paid during 
the financial year. No shares were bought back during 
the year. 
• Net income attributable to equity holders –  
our reported net income in respect of the financial year. 
The Committee believes it is a good indicator  
of ongoing relative statutory performance. 
• Total remuneration – represents total personnel costs 
as disclosed in note 22 to the financial statements 
which includes salaries, wages, social security, other 
personnel costs and share-based payments.

Information Performance graph and table
This graph shows the value to 31 December 2017, on 
a total shareholder return (TSR) basis, of £100 invested 
in Glencore plc on 24 May 201 1 (our IPO date) compared 
with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE 350 Mining 
Index. The FTSE 350 Mining Index is considered to be an 
appropriate comparator for this purpose as it is an equity 
index consisting of companies listed in London in the 
same sector as Glencore.
The UK reporting regulations also require that a TSR 
performance graph is supported by a table summarising 
aspects of CEO remuneration, as shown below for the 
same period as the TSR performance graph:
Percentage change in pay of Chief Executive Officer  
and comparative ratios 
The UK Remuneration Regulations provide for disclosure 
of percentage changes of the CEO’s remuneration against 
the average percentage change for employees generally 
or an appropriate group of employees. In addition, the UK 
Investment Association’s 2016 Remuneration Principles 
recommend disclosure as to how the remuneration 
out-turn for a Company’s CEO compares with that of a) its 
median employee and b) its Executive Committee. Given 
that the CEO has, since May 201 1, waived any entitlement 
to any increase in salary (and given that his only other 
unwaived benefits are those provided to all employees at 
the Company’s head office in Baar) no such comparisons 
or ratios have been made.

1 The value of benefits and pension provision in the single figure vary as a result of the application of exchange rates although in the relevant local currency these parts of 
Mr Glasenberg’s remuneration have not altered since May 2011. In this table the figures are reported in US dollars, the currency in which Mr Glasenberg received his salary  
in 2017. The salary was payable in pounds sterling prior to 2014. Therefore those figures have been translated into US dollars at the exchange rates used for the preparation  
of the financial statements in those years. Mr Glasenberg’s pension and other benefits are charged to the Group in Swiss francs and these amounts are translated into 
US dollars on the same basis.

Exploration and research and development 
The Group’s business units carry out exploration and 
research and development activities that are necessary  
to support and expand their operations. 
Employee policies and involvement
Glencore operates an equal opportunities policy that aims 
to treat individuals fairly and not to discriminate on the 
basis of sex, race, ethnic origin, disability or on any other 
basis. Applications for employment and promotion are 
fully considered on their merits, and employees are given 
appropriate training and equal opportunities for career 
development and promotion. 
Where disability occurs during employment, the Group 
seeks to accommodate that disability where reasonably 
possible, including with appropriate training. 
The Group places considerable value on the involvement 
of its employees which is reflected in the principles of its 
Code of Conduct and its related guidance, which requires 
regular, open, fair and respectful communication, zero 
tolerance for human rights violations, fair remuneration 
and, above all, a safe working environment.
Employee communication is mainly provided by the 
Group’s intranet and corporate website. A range of 
information is made available to employees including all 
policies applicable to them as well as information on the 
Group’s financial performance and the main drivers of its 
business. Employee consultation depends upon the type 
and location of operation or office. Further information  
on our people is set out on pages 36 and 39.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Under Jersey law and the Company’s Articles of 
Association (which mirror section 175 of the UK 
Companies Act 2006), a Director must avoid a situation  
in which the Director has, or can have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the 
interests of the Company. The duty is not infringed if the 
matter has been authorised by the Directors. Under the 
Articles, the Board has the power to authorise potential  
or actual conflict situations. The Board maintains effective 
procedures to enable the Directors to notify the Company 
106
Glencore Annual Report 2017 of any actual or potential conflict situations and for  
those situations to be reviewed and, if appropriate,  
to be authorised by the Board. Directors’ conflict 
situations are reviewed annually. A register of 
authorisations is maintained. 
Directors’ liabilities and indemnities 
The Company has granted third party indemnities to each 
of its Directors against any liability that attaches to them 
in defending proceedings brought against them, to the 
extent permitted by Jersey Law. In addition, Directors and 
Officers of the Company and its subsidiaries are covered 
by directors & officers liability insurance.

Share capital 
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, 
being the only share class of the Company, are set out  
in the Company’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”), 
which can be found at www.glencore.com/who-we-are/
board-of-directors/governance-downloads/. Subject to 
Jersey law, any share may be issued with or have attached 
to it such preferred, deferred or other special rights and 
restrictions as the Company may by special resolution 
decide or, if no such resolution is in effect, or so far as the 
resolution does not make specific provision, as the Board 
may decide. 
No such resolution is currently in effect. Subject to the 
recommendation of the Board, holders of ordinary shares 
may receive a distribution. On liquidation, holders of 
ordinary shares may share in the assets of the Company. 
Holders of ordinary shares are also entitled to receive  
the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts (or a 
summarised version) and, subject to certain thresholds 
being met, may requisition the Board to convene a 
general meeting (GM) or the proposal of resolutions  
at AGMs. None of the ordinary shares carry any special 
rights with regard to control of the Company. 
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and 
speak at GMs of the Company and to appoint one or 
more proxies or, if the holder of shares is a corporation,  
a corporate representative. On a show of hands, each 
holder of ordinary shares who (being an individual) is 
present in person or (being a corporation) is present by  
a duly appointed corporate representative, not being 
himself a member, shall have one vote and on a poll, 
every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by 
proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he is 
the holder. Electronic and paper proxy appointments and 
voting instructions must be received not later than 48 
hours before a GM. A holder of ordinary shares can lose

Information the entitlement to vote at GMs where that holder has 
been served with a disclosure notice and has failed to 
provide the Company with information concerning 
interests held in those shares. Except as (1) set out above 
and (2) permitted under applicable statutes, there are  
no limitations on voting rights of holders of a given 
percentage, number of votes or deadlines for exercising 
voting rights. 
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a 
certificated share which is not fully paid, provided that 
the refusal does not prevent dealings in shares in the 
Company from taking place on an open and proper  
basis or where the Company has a lien over that share. 
The Directors may also refuse to register a transfer of  
a certificated share unless the instrument of transfer is: 
(i) lodged, duly stamped (if necessary), at the registered 
office of the Company or any other place as the Board 
may decide accompanied by the certificate for the 
share(s) to be transferred and/or such other evidence  
as the Directors may reasonably require as proof of title;  
or (ii) in respect of only one class of shares. 
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out 
using CREST and the Directors can refuse to register  
a transfer of an uncertificated share in accordance with 
the regulations governing the operation of CREST. 
The Directors may decide to suspend the registration  
of transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the register 
of shareholders. The Directors cannot suspend the 
registration of transfers of any uncertificated shares 
without obtaining consent from CREST. 
There are no other restrictions on the transfer of ordinary 
shares in the Company except: (1) certain restrictions may 
from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations 
(for example insider trading laws); (2) pursuant to the 
Company’s share dealing code whereby the Directors and 
certain employees of the Company require approval to 
deal in the Company’s shares; and (3) where a shareholder 
with at least a 0.25% interest in the Company’s issued 
share capital has been served with a disclosure notice  
and has failed to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares. There are no 
agreements between holders of ordinary shares that are 
known to the Company which may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. 
The rules for appointment and replacement of the 
Directors are set out in the Articles. Directors can be 
appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution  
at a GM or by the Board upon the recommendation of 
the Nomination Committee. The Company can remove 
a Director from office, including by passing an ordinary 
resolution or by notice being given by all the other 
Directors. The Company may amend its Articles  
by special resolution approved at a GM. 
The powers of the Directors are set out in the Articles and 
provide that the Board may exercise all the powers of the 
Company including to borrow money. The Company may 
by ordinary resolution authorise the Board to issue shares, 
and increase, consolidate, sub-divide and cancel shares in 
accordance with its Articles and Jersey law. 
Purchase of own shares 
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority,  
under a shareholders’ resolution passed on 24 May 2017, 
to purchase through the market up to 10% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary shares. No purchase was 
made by the Company during 2017. The Directors  
will seek a similar authority at the Company’s AGM  
to be held in 2018. 
Going concern 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows,  
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are set out  
in the Strategic Report. Furthermore, notes 25 and 26 to 
the financial statements include the Group’s objectives 
and policies for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities and its exposure  
to credit and liquidity risk. Significant financing activities 
that took place during the year are detailed in the 
Financial review section. 
The results of the Group, principally pertaining to its 
industrial asset base, are exposed to fluctuations in both 
commodity prices and currency exchange rates whereas 
the performance of marketing activities is primarily 
physical volume driven with commodity price risk 
substantially hedged. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation, having 
made appropriate enquiries that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue its operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to  
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The Directors have made this assessment 
after consideration of the Group’s budgeted cash flows 
and related assumptions including appropriate stress 
testing of the identified uncertainties (being primarily 
commodity prices and currency exchange rates) and 
undrawn credit facilities, monitoring of debt maturities, 
and after review of the Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting 2014 as published by the UK Financial 
Reporting Council.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Longer-term viability 
In accordance with paragraph C2.2 of the Code, the 
Directors have assessed the prospects of the Group’s 
viability over a longer period than the 12 months required 
by the going concern assessment above. A summary of 
the assessment made is set out on page 44 in the 
Principal risks and uncertainties section. 
Based on the results of the related analysis, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the four-year period of this assessment. They also 
believe that the review period of four years is appropriate 
having regard to the Group’s business model, strategy, 
principal risks and uncertainties, and viability.
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date  
of approval of this Annual Report confirms that:
(a)  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant  
audit information of which the Company’s auditor  
is unaware; and
(b)  the Director has taken all the steps that he ought  
to have taken as a director in order to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is aware  
of that information. 
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue 
in office as auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will 
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for the Company for each financial year.  
The financial statements are prepared in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board and 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
for use in the European Union (together “IFRS”). The 
financial statements are required by law to be properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
financial statements present fairly for each financial year 
the Company’s financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation  
of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions 
in accordance with the definitions and recognition  
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set  
out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s 
“Framework for the preparation and presentation of 
financial statements”.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will  
be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. 
However, the Directors are also required to: 
• properly select and apply accounting policies
• present information, including accounting policies,  
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the  
entity’s financial position and financial performance
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They  
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the  
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Report on the audit of the financial statements 
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the affairs of Glencore plc and its subsidiaries’ (together “the Group”) affairs as at  
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s income for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
We have audited the financial statements of the Group which comprise:
• the consolidated statement of income 
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
• the consolidated statement of financial position 
• the consolidated statement of cash flows 
• the consolidated statement of changes of equity, and
• the related notes 1 to 33 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union and as issued by the IASB.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited  
by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Impairments
• Revenue recognition
• Fair value measurements within the marketing operations
• Classification of financial instruments
• Credit and performance risk
• Taxation, and
• Katanga Mining Limited (Katanga) Restatements
Our assessment of the Group’s key audit matters is broadly consistent with 2016. “Capital preservation/
Debt reduction plans” is no longer considered a key audit matter as a result of the Group completing 
the capital preservation and debt reduction plan announced in 2015. We identified “Katanga 
Restatements” as a current year key audit matter following the announcement of the completion  
of an internal review of certain of Katanga’s historic accounting practices. 
Materiality We determined materiality for the Group to be $200 million, based on a normalised 3-year average 
pre-tax profit.
Scoping We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 47 components, representing the 
Group’s most material marketing operations and industrial assets. These 47 components account for 
93% of the Group’s net assets, 97% of the Group’s revenue and 89% of the Group’s adjusted EBITDA 
(as set out in Note 2).
Significant changes  
in our approach
Aside from the changes in key audit matters noted above, there were no significant changes to our 
audit approach when compared to 2016.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them 
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so  
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements. 
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent 
with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained  
in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in  
relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 42 – 51 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are  
being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation on page 90 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 44 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the 
Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained  
in the audit.
We confirm that we have 
nothing material to report,  
add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
We confirm that we have 
nothing material to report,  
add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation  
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Impairments
Description of key audit matter How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter 
The carrying value of the Group’s non-current assets, which 
includes intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, loans 
and advances, and investments in associates and joint ventures, 
amounted to $85,867 million at 31 December 2017.
The volatility in expected future prices of certain commodities key 
to the Group (particularly oil, copper, cobalt, zinc and coal), foreign 
exchange rates, production levels, operating costs, discount rates 
and macro-economic developments require management to 
closely monitor non-current asset carrying values. 
Given the nature of the Group’s industrial assets, developments 
concerning geology, production or distribution of the Group’s 
products may also trigger a need to consider impairment.
For loans, advances and other investments, assessing 
counterparty risk, solvency and liquidity can be highly subjective.
Management completes an impairment review on all of the 
Group’s significant investments annually, as part of the Group’s 
budgeting process.
The outcome of impairment assessments could vary significantly 
were different assumptions applied. Refer to “Key sources of 
estimation uncertainty” within note 1, notes 4, 5 and 9 as well  
as the Audit Committee Report on pages 96 – 98.
In total impairments amounting to $871 million were recognised 
in the year ended 31 December 2017 primarily relating to  
oil assets as a result of commodity prices and operational 
developments. This was offset by $243 million of impairment 
reversals within oil assets following production plan optimisation 
and cost efficiency identification.
We reviewed management’s assessment of impairment risk and 
their assessment of the indicators of impairment and challenged 
the significant assumptions used.
We sought to identify additional potential indicators of 
impairment through our review of operational performance  
and financial results as well as the impact of any significant 
regulatory changes.
Where significant indicators of impairment (or impairment 
reversals) were identified, we utilised Deloitte extractive industry 
valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of 
management’s underlying model inputs and significant 
assumptions.
In performing our challenge, we considered the risk of 
management bias in the assumptions and estimates. 
We challenged the significant inputs and assumptions used 
in impairment and impairment reversal testing for intangible 
assets, property, plant and equipment, associates and 
joint ventures. 
Our challenge included comparing inputs and significant 
assumptions as noted above, to third party forecasts and 
Deloitte developed discount rates. Production assumptions  
were compared to life of mine or hydrocarbon extraction plans 
where applicable as well as reserves and resources estimates. 
Operating costs and production levels were also compared  
to the current period actual results, management approved 
budgets and life of mine models. Further, we assessed whether 
macro assumptions had been applied on a consistent basis 
across the Group.
We challenged management’s sensitivity analysis by performing 
independent sensitivity analyses on selected assets, including 
those which were not identified as having indicators of 
impairment but have a higher risk of impairment due to lower 
available headroom in fair value models, volatility in key pricing 
assumptions, or the existence of operational circumstances 
which may indicate potential for impairment.
For impairment reversals, we reviewed the audit evidence 
relating to the reversal of conditions previously leading  
to the impairment and the models supporting the reversal.
With respect to loans and advances of $2,976 million, our 
procedures included challenging their recoverability by 
reviewing supporting agreements and obtaining evidence 
of current performance to identify potential indicators 
of impairment.
We assessed the adequacy of impairment related disclosures  
in the financial statements, including the key assumptions  
used and the sensitivity of the financial statements to  
these assumptions.
Key observations
Based on the results of our testing, we concluded that management’s assessment of impairment indicators was appropriate.  
Where there were impairment indicators, our procedures found that the impairment models were in line with the underlying  
mine and hydrocarbon extraction plans and supported by appropriate inputs and assumptions. We concluded that the key  
pricing and discount rate assumptions were in line with third party evidence and our expert’s acceptable ranges. 
We found management’s disclosures on key assumptions and impairment sensitivities to be appropriate.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Revenue recognition
Description of key audit matter How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter
Revenue for the year was $205,476 million (2016: $152,948 million), 
and the identification as a key audit matter primarily relates to 
the following:
Marketing operations:
We identified a risk that the capture of trades within the trade 
book is incomplete or inaccurate impacting the timing and 
quantum of revenue recognition for commodity sales with 
deliveries occurring on or around year-end.
Judgement is required to determine when risks and rewards 
have transferred under certain contractual arrangements with 
third parties, especially on or around year-end.
As a majority of the Group’s trades are measured at fair value 
through profit and loss, a complete and accurate trade capture 
process that includes all specific and bespoke terms within the 
commodity contracts is critical for accurate financial reporting 
and monitoring of trade book exposures and performance.
Marketing related activities depend on the reliability of the  
trade capture systems and their IT infrastructure environment.
Industrial assets:
Substantially all output from industrial assets is sold by the 
Group’s marketing divisions. Where third party sales occur, the 
key risks relate to provisional pricing terms, metal concentrate 
estimates and the consideration of embedded derivatives in 
sales contracts.
Judgement must be exercised to determine when risks and 
rewards have transferred under bill and hold and other non-
standard contract arrangements.
We presume a risk of material misstatement due to fraud  
related to revenue recognition. Refer to note 1 for the revenue 
accounting policies.
We have reviewed Glencore’s revenue recognition policies for 
compliance with the requirements of IAS 18 Revenue (IAS 18). 
For marketing operations we:
• evaluated the design, implementation and tested the 
operating effectiveness of key controls surrounding the 
completeness and accuracy of trade capture and the revenue 
and trade cycle
• tested the operating effectiveness of general IT controls 
surrounding major technology applications and critical 
interfaces involving revenue recognition and the completeness 
and accuracy of trade capture
• agreed, on a sample basis, deliveries occurring on or around  
31 December 2017 to supporting documentation to assess 
whether the IFRS revenue recognition criteria were met for 
recorded sales
• obtained third party confirmations where relevant to check 
completeness and accuracy of trade books, and
• performed cut-off testing of trades entered into the trade 
book system around the reporting date
For industrial assets we:
• assessed the design and implementation of controls around 
the methodology adopted by management to identify the 
provisional pricing terms and the determination of estimates 
of metal in concentrate sold to third parties; 
• obtained third party confirmations to verify the completeness 
and accuracy of third party sales; and
• reviewed key contracts for the existence of embedded 
derivatives and performed valuation testing as appropriate.
We also performed testing on journal entries using computer 
assisted profiling techniques to address the risk of management 
override of internal controls related to revenue recognition.
Key observations
Based on the results of our testing, we are satisfied that the revenue recognition policies are in line with IFRS and were appropriately 
applied throughout the period.

Additional  
Information Fair value measurements within the marketing operations
Description of key audit matter How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter
Determination of fair values of marketing inventories, financial 
assets and liabilities is a complex and subjective area often 
requiring significant estimates, particularly where valuations 
utilise unobservable inputs (e.g. credit risk assessments, market 
volatility and forecast operational estimates). At 31 December 
2017, total Level 3 Other financial assets and liabilities amounted 
to $356 million and $705 million respectively. 
As the Group’s marketing inventories and other financial assets 
and liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting date, 
these fair value measurements significantly impact the Group’s 
results.
Refer to “Key sources of estimation uncertainty” within note 1 
and additionally notes 26 and 27.
We evaluated the design and implementation and tested 
operating effectiveness of key internal controls over 
management’s processes for determining inputs to fair value 
measurements and performed detailed substantive testing  
on a sample basis of the related fair value measurements. 
Using financial instrument specialists embedded within  
the audit team with experience in commodity trading,  
we specifically tested the evidence supporting significant 
unobservable inputs utilised in Level 3 measurements  
in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in note 27 to the  
financial statements, which included reviews of  
independent price quotes, recent transactions and  
other supporting documentation. 
Key observations
Based on the results of our testing, we are satisfied that the level 3 fair value measurements are supported by reasonable 
assumptions in line with recent transactions and/or externally verifiable information. 
We found the financial statement disclosures on fair value measurements in note 27 to be adequate.
Classification of financial instruments
Description of key audit matter How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter
Glencore trades a diverse portfolio of commodities and utilises a 
wide variety of trading strategies in order to profit from volatility 
in market prices, differentials and spreads whilst maximising 
flexibility and optionality.
The classification of contracts relating to the Group’s marketing 
operations is a judgemental area, particularly distinguishing sales 
contracts where the Group physically delivers its own production 
to a third party (“own use”), from those which form part of the 
Group’s marketing operations. The majority of the Group’s trades 
are measured at fair value through profit and loss.
Differences in classification affect recognition of associated gains 
and losses as contracts which are “own use” are exempt from 
mark-to-market accounting.
Transactions for the sale or purchase of commodities may contain 
a financing element and/or embedded derivatives, which  
may require judgement in determining the most appropriate 
classification, presentation and accounting treatment.
Refer to notes 26 and 27.
We obtained an understanding of the trading strategies and 
associated product flows within the Group’s marketing 
departments using financial instrument specialists embedded 
within the audit team with experience in commodity trading.
We evaluated the design and implementation and tested 
operating effectiveness of key controls around monitoring 
exposures by the risk management department.
We analysed the trade books to understand unusual or complex 
derivatives open at year-end. We also analysed the trading results 
for portfolios designated as “own use” for evidence of any net 
settlements, which may indicate potential tainting of the  
IAS 39 “own use” criteria.
We challenged management’s judgement and conclusions 
associated with classification and accounting for new significant 
arrangements and significant changes to existing arrangements.
We assessed the adequacy of related disclosures in the financial 
statements in accordance with the requirements of IFRS.
Key observations
Based on the results of our testing, we are satisfied that all significant assumptions applied in respect of the classification of financial 
instruments are appropriate and that disclosures given around financial instruments are in accordance with the requirements of IFRS.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Credit and performance risk
Description of key audit matter How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter
The Group is exposed to credit and performance risk arising  
from the Group’s global production and marketing operations, 
particularly in markets demonstrating significant price volatility 
with limited liquidity and terminal markets. 
This risk is heightened in times of increased price volatility,  
where suppliers may be incentivised to default on delivery  
and customers are unable to make payments.
At 31 December 2017, total advances and loans and accounts 
receivable amounted to $2,976 million and $20,359 million 
respectively. 
Refer to notes 10, 12 and 25 and the Audit Committee Report  
on pages 96 to 98.
We undertook internal control testing of the Group’s centralised 
and local credit and performance risk monitoring procedures. 
We challenged management’s assessment of the recoverability 
of aged and overdue receivables, loans and advance payments 
with delayed or overdue deliveries, considering historical patterns 
of trading and settlement as well as recent communications 
with the counterparties and other post balance sheet 
date evidence. 
In addition, we challenged the valuation of significant fixed price 
positions in commodities across the Group at year-end given the 
high price volatility during the year, particularly with respect  
to base metals and coal where the risk of non-performance 
is higher.
Key observations
We concluded that the Group’s provisioning in relation to counterparty and performance risk was appropriately assessed. 
Taxation
Description of key audit matter How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter
There is significant judgement around accounting for income 
taxes particularly in light of the number of jurisdictions in which 
the Group operates, including judgements concerning presence 
of key corporate operations and holding companies, provisioning 
for tax exposures, application of transfer pricing rules, the 
recognition of deferred income tax assets and the taxation 
impacts of any corporate restructurings.
This gives rise to complexity and uncertainty in respect of  
the calculation of income taxes and deferred tax assets and 
consideration of contingent liabilities associated with tax years 
open to audit.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has recorded net deferred 
tax liabilities of $7,024 million and net deferred tax assets of 
$1,733 million. Additionally, the Group has $6,574 million of gross 
tax losses carried forward and deductible temporary differences, 
for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised. 
The assessment of tax-related contingent liabilities has been 
disclosed in note 21.
Refer to “Key sources of estimation uncertainty” within note 1 
and additionally notes 6 and 21, and the Audit Committee 
Report on pages 96 to 98.
We undertook a specific assessment of the material components 
impacting the Group’s tax expense, balances and exposures  
and performed detailed audit procedures in relation to these.
We considered the appropriateness of management’s 
assumptions and estimates to support the recognition of 
deferred tax assets with reference to forecast taxable profits  
and the consistency of these forecasts with the Group’s budgets. 
We reviewed and challenged management’s assessment  
of uncertain tax positions and conclusions on complex tax 
arrangements (such as transfer pricing) through discussions  
with the Group taxation department, reviewing correspondence 
with local tax authorities, reviewing third party expert tax 
opinions and utilising Deloitte tax specialists, where appropriate, 
to assess the adequacy of associated provisions and disclosures.
We challenged management on the disclosures in the  
financial statements in relation to taxation, specifically on the 
requirement for adequate assessment of uncertainties and 
contingent liabilities.
Key observations
The results of our testing were satisfactory and we concur that the level of tax provisions and disclosures are appropriate.

Information Katanga Restatements
Description of key audit matter How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter
Katanga is a Canadian listed copper and cobalt producer in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo which is controlled by Glencore 
and therefore a consolidated subsidiary. During the year, the 
non-executive directors of Katanga initiated an independent 
review into the accounting practices of Katanga covering the 
financial years ended December 2014, 2015 and 2016 
(“Independent Review”). 
This review concluded that as a result of inappropriate 
accounting practices and significant weaknesses in Katanga’s 
internal control environment around financial reporting and 
inventory valuation and recording, including management 
override of internal controls, various financial line items were 
misstated in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The cumulative restatements 
resulted in a net reduction in total assets/liabilities and equity of 
$60 million (net of income tax credits of $18 million) which was 
accounted for as a current year adjustment in Glencore’s 2017 
financial statements. These adjustments do not have a material 
adverse effect on the consolidated income, financial position  
or cash flows of Glencore.
The Glencore plc Board of Directors convened a board 
committee to assess the implications of the findings from the 
Katanga Independent Review on Glencore Group’s internal 
controls (the “Glencore Review”). This was to assess the matter 
including the possibility of similar issues existing at other 
Glencore operations, and determine the appropriate measures 
to improve the control environment and the disciplinary action 
to be taken against Glencore personnel involved in misstating 
past financial statements.
Our audit work, at Group and the relevant component level, 
included additional procedures considering the impact  
of the findings from the Katanga Independent Review  
and the Glencore plc board committee.
Please refer to page 92 and 97 for the board’s discussion  
on the matter and note 4 for the cumulative impacts of the 
above adjustments in Glencore’s financial statements.
The additional audit procedures performed by the Group and 
relevant component audit teams in response to the Katanga 
Independent Review included the following:
• The use of Deloitte forensic experts at Group and component 
level to understand and challenge both the scope and 
competency of the independent accounting expert engaged 
by the non-executive directors assisting with the Katanga 
Independent Review as well as the audit procedures 
performed by the Group audit team
• A review of the report prepared by the independent 
accounting expert from the Katanga Independent Review  
to understand the nature of the misstatements, including 
findings with respect to internal controls, including 
management override of internal control
• Additional audit work with respect to the correcting entries 
required to restate the Katanga financial statements
• Meeting with the Glencore Board of Directors and senior 
management to understand the scope and findings of the 
Glencore Review, including consideration of the risk of 
management override at other Glencore assets and 
specifically within the African copper assets
• Communicating the increased risk of management override  
of controls to component auditors with similar risk profiles  
to Katanga, requesting additional audit procedures be 
conducted, such as the involvement of Deloitte technical 
mining experts in the component audit procedures, and
• Consideration of the implementation of recommendations 
made by experts engaged to assist in this matter and other 
actions by the Katanga and Glencore boards to determine 
whether misstatements involving management override  
could exist at other components
Key observations
We concur that the cumulative impact of the adjustments recorded in Glencore’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated 
in all material respects in accordance with IFRS. Based on the results of our testing, no additional reportable misstatements involving 
management override were identified from our audit.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope  
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality $200 million (2016: $150 million)
The applied materiality is approximately 7% of normalised 3-year average pre-tax profit (2016: 7%), 
and equates to less than 1% (2016: 1%) of equity.

Basis for determining  
materiality
Consistent with the methodology in the prior year, we have determined materiality by using a 
percentage of a normalised 3-year average (2015–17) of pre-tax profits. The selected materiality  
is 3% of current year normalised results without the effect of averaging.
These normalising items are outlined in notes 3 and 4 to the financial statements. 
Rationale for the  
benchmark applied
The pre-tax profits for the 2015–17 years have been normalised in determining materiality to exclude 
items which, due to their variable financial impact and/or expected infrequency of the underlying 
events, are not considered indicative of continuing operations of the Group. These items do not form 
part of the Group’s internally or externally monitored primary key performance indicators, and which 
if included, would distort materiality year-on-year. 
We consider this approach of using a 3-year average to be more appropriate than an assessment 
based on current year results alone given the nature of the mining industry which is exposed  
to cyclical commodity price fluctuations and to therefore provide a more stable base reflective  
of the scale of the Group’s size and operations. 
We note that the maximum allowed component materiality for industrial assets has increased  
to $100 million in the current year on the basis that the contribution to pre-tax profit by industrial 
assets has significantly increased throughout the normalised 3-year average period used in the 
determination of our materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $10 million  
(2016: $10 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on our continuing assessment, we focused our Group audit 
scope primarily on the audit work at 47 components (2016: 45 components), representing the Group’s most material marketing 
operations and industrial assets, and utilised 23 component audit teams (2016: 21 component audit teams) in 20 countries  
(2016: 18 countries). 
• 27 of these were subject to a full scope audit (2016: 29 components), and 
• 20 were subject to specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risk  
of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations (2016: 16 components) 
These 47 components account for 93% of the Group’s net assets (2016: 92%), 97% of the Group’s revenue (2016: 95%) and 89%  
of the Group’s adjusted EBITDA (2016: 89%).

● Full scope audit
● Speciﬁed audit procedures
● Analytical procedures
Components are scoped based on their contribution to financial metrics (revenue, EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA), production and 
qualitative criteria, such as being a significant development project or exhibiting particular risk factors. 
Detailed audit instructions were sent to the auditors of these in-scope components. These detailed audit instructions specified areas 
of audit focus, identified the risks of material misstatement assessed by the Group audit team and set out the information to be 
reported back to the Group audit team. 
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of regular on-site meetings with components that has been designed  
so that the Group Audit Partner or another senior member of the Group audit team periodically meets with local management  
and the component audit team on a rotational basis. In 2017, the Group audit team held in-person meetings with 21 components 
(2016: 13 components).
Additionally for all in-scope components, the Group audit team was involved in the audit work performed by the component 
auditors through a combination of our global planning conference call meetings, provision of referral instructions, review and 
challenge of related component inter-office reporting and of findings from their work (which included the audit procedures 
performed to respond to risks of material misstatement), attendance at component audit closing conference calls and regular 
interaction on any related audit and accounting matters which arose.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion 
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components 
not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. 
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express  
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude  
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee, or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
We have nothing  
to report in respect  
of these matters.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors  
either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect  
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 1 13A of the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinion on other matter prescribed by our engagement letter
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied to the company.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or
• proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company or proper returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us, or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns
We have nothing  
to report in respect  
of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the Board of Directors on 22 August 201 1 to audit  
the financial statements of Glencore plc for the year ending 31 December 201 1 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm as auditors of Glencore plc is 7 years, 
covering the years ending December 201 1 to December 2017.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required to provide in accordance  
with ISAs (UK).

Glencore plc (the “Company”, “Parent”, the “Group” or “Glencore”), is a leading integrated producer and marketer of natural resources, 
with worldwide activities in the production, refinement, processing, storage, transport and marketing of metals and minerals, energy 
products and agricultural products. Glencore operates on a global scale, marketing and distributing physical commodities sourced 
from third party producers and own production to industrial consumers, such as those in the automotive, steel, power generation,  
oil and food processing industries. Glencore also provides financing, logistics and other services to producers and consumers of 
commodities. In this regard, Glencore seeks to capture value throughout the commodity supply chain. Glencore’s long experience  
as a commodity producer and merchant has allowed it to develop and build upon its expertise in the commodities which it  
markets and cultivate long-term relationships with a broad supplier and customer base across diverse industries and in multiple 
geographic regions. 
Glencore plc is a publicly traded limited company incorporated in Jersey and domiciled in Switzerland. Its ordinary shares are traded 
on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges. On 31 January 2018, the Company delisted its shares from the Hong Kong 
stock exchange.
These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a Directors’ resolution on 1 March 2018.
Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with:
• International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations as adopted by the European Union (EU) effective  
as of 31 December 2017, and
• IFRS and interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) effective as of 31 December 2017
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions 
are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that  
are believed to be reasonable and relevant under the circumstances, independent estimates, quoted market prices and common, 
industry standard modelling techniques. Actual outcomes could result in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets 
or liabilities affected in future periods.
Glencore has identified the following areas as being critical to understanding Glencore’s financial position as they require 
management to make complex and/or subjective judgements, estimates and assumptions about matters that are 
inherently uncertain:
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying Glencore’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements based on the relevant 
facts and circumstances including macro-economic circumstances and, where applicable, interpretation of underlying agreements, 
which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. 
(i) Determination of control of subsidiaries and joint arrangements (note 33)
Judgement is required to determine when Glencore has control of subsidiaries or joint control of joint arrangements. This requires an 
assessment of the relevant activities (those relating to the operating and capital decisions of the arrangement, such as: the approval 
of the capital expenditure programme for each year, and appointing, remunerating and terminating the key management personnel 
or service providers of the operations) and when the decisions in relation to those activities are under the control of Glencore 
or require unanimous consent. See note 24 for a summary of the acquisitions of subsidiaries completed during the year and the  
key judgements made in determining control thereof.
Judgement is also required in determining the classification of a joint arrangement between a joint venture or a joint operation 
through an evaluation of the rights and obligations arising from the arrangement and in particular, if the joint arrangement has  
been structured through a separate vehicle, further consideration is required of whether:
(1) the legal form of the separate vehicle gives the parties rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities;
(2) the contractual terms and conditions give the parties rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities; and
(3) other facts and circumstances give the parties rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities.
Joint arrangements in which the primary activity is the provision of output to the shareholders, typically convey substantially all the 
economic benefits of the assets to the parties and judgement is required in assessing whether the terms of the offtake agreements 
and any other obligations for liabilities of the arrangement result in the parties being substantially the only source of cash flows 
contributing to the continuity of the operations of the arrangement. 
Notes to the financial statements
128
Glencore Annual Report 2017 Certain joint arrangements that are structured through separate vehicles including Collahuasi, Glencore Agri and QHG are accounted 
for as joint ventures. The Collahuasi arrangement is primarily designed for the provision of output to the shareholders sharing joint 
control, the offtake terms of which are at prevailing market prices and the parties are not obligated to cover any potential funding 
shortfalls. In management’s judgement, Glencore is not the only possible source of funding and does not have a direct or indirect 
obligation to the liabilities of the arrangement, but rather shares in its net assets and, therefore, such arrangements have been 
accounted for as joint ventures. 
Differing conclusions around these judgements, may materially impact how these businesses are presented in the consolidated 
financial statements – under the full consolidation method, equity method or recognition of Glencore’s share of assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses, including any assets or liabilities held jointly. See note 9 for a summary of these joint arrangements and the 
key judgements made in determining the applicable accounting treatment for the material joint arrangements entered during 
the year.
(ii) Credit and performance risk (note 25)
The Group’s global marketing operations expose it to credit and performance (the risk that counterparties fail to sell or purchase 
physical commodities on agreed terms) risks; these arise particularly in markets demonstrating significant price volatility with limited 
liquidity and terminal markets and when global and/or regional macro-economic conditions are weak.
Continuously, but particularly during such times, judgement is required to determine whether receivables, loans and advances are 
recoverable and if contracted product deliveries will be received. Judgements about recoverability and contractual performance  
may materially impact both non-current and current assets as recognised in the statement of financial position. Any estimation 
uncertainty related to these judgements is not anticipated to result in a material change to the carrying value of these assets  
within the next financial year. 
(iii) Classification of transactions which contain a financing element (notes 19, 20 and 23)
Transactions for the sale or purchase of commodities may contain a financing element such as extended payment terms. 
Judgement is required to determine the most appropriate classification and presentation of these transactions within the statements 
of cash flows and financial position. In determining the appropriate classification, management considers the underlying economic 
substance of the transaction and the significance of the financing element to the transaction. Typically the economic substance 
of the transaction is determined to be operating in nature, i.e. predominantly related to the sale or purchase of commodities as the 
financing element is insignificant and the entire cash flow will therefore be presented as operating in the statement of cash flow  
with a corresponding trade receivable or payable in the statement of financial position. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying Glencore’s accounting policies, management has made key estimates and assumptions concerning  
the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty. The key assumptions and estimates at the reporting date that have  
a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,  
are described below. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may materially 
affect financial results or the financial position reported in future periods.
(i) Recognition of deferred tax assets (note 6)
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This involves  
an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether there will be sufficient taxable 
income available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse. These judgements and estimates are subject to risk and uncertainty 
and therefore, to the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be a material increase or decrease in the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which the change occurs. The recoverability of 
deferred tax assets including the estimates and assumptions contained therein are reviewed regularly by management.
(ii) Impairments and impairment reversals (notes 4 and 5)
Investments in associates and joint ventures, other investments, advances and loans, property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully 
recoverable or at least annually for goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets. If an asset’s recoverable amount is less than  
the asset’s carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of income. For those assets which  
were impaired in prior periods, if their recoverable amount exceeds their carrying amount, an impairment reversal is recorded  
in the consolidated statement of income. Future cash flow estimates which are used to calculate the asset’s fair value are discounted 
using asset specific discount rates and are based on expectations about future operations, primarily comprising estimates about 
production and sales volumes, commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), reserves 
and resources, operating costs, rehabilitation and restoration costs and capital expenditures. Estimates are reviewed regularly by 
management. Changes in such estimates and in particular, deterioration in the pricing outlook, could impact the recoverable values 
of these assets, whereby some or all of the carrying amount may be impaired or the impairment charge reversed (if pricing outlook 
improves significantly) with the impact recorded in the statement of income.

(iii) Restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs (note 21 )
A provision for future restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs requires estimates and assumptions to be made around 
the relevant regulatory framework, the magnitude of the possible disturbance and the timing, extent and costs of the required 
closure and rehabilitation activities. Most of these rehabilitation and decommissioning events are expected to take place many years 
in the future and the currently estimated requirements and costs that will have to be met when the restoration event occurs are 
inherently uncertain and could materially change over time. 
In calculating the appropriate provision for the expected restoration, rehabilitation or decommissioning obligations, cost estimates  
of the future potential cash outflows based on current studies of the expected rehabilitation activities and timing thereof, are 
prepared. These forecasts are then discounted to their present value using a risk free rate specific to the liability and the currency  
in which they are denominated. 
Any changes in the expected future costs are initially reflected in both the provision and the asset and subsequently in the 
consolidated statement of income over the remaining economic life of the asset. As the actual future costs can differ from the 
estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, technology, costs and timing, the provisions including the estimates and assumptions 
contained therein are reviewed regularly by management.
Change in estimate
In the prior year, estimates for potential likely prolongation of the underlying timing assumptions and an anticipated benefit of 
eventually realising costs lower than those estimated, were combined with the country/currency specific risk free rates in deriving 
applicable liability specific discount rates. In the current year, these cost and timing considerations have been incorporated directly 
into the underlying cash flow forecasts with the revised estimates discounted using a risk free rate specific to the liability and 
currency in which the forecasts are denominated. As a result of this change in estimate, there was no initial impact on equity  
as the rehabilitation provision increased by $312 million, with a resulting equivalent increase in property, plant and equipment. 
(iv) Fair value measurements (notes 9, 1 1, 24, 26 and 27)
In addition to recognising derivative instruments at fair value, as discussed below, an assessment of the fair value of assets and 
liabilities is also required in accounting for other transactions, most notably, business combinations and marketing inventories and 
disclosures related to fair values of financial assets and liabilities. In such instances, fair value measurements are estimated based on 
the amounts for which the assets and liabilities could be exchanged at the relevant transaction date or reporting period end, and are 
therefore not necessarily reflective of the likely cash flow upon actual settlements. Where fair value measurements cannot be derived 
from publicly available information, they are estimated using models and other valuation methods. To the extent possible, the 
assumptions and inputs used take into account externally verifiable inputs. However, such information is by nature subject to 
uncertainty, particularly where comparable market-based transactions often do not exist.
Derivative instruments are carried at fair value for which Glencore evaluates the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data 
used to measure fair value in the three hierarchy levels, Level 1, 2 and 3, as prescribed by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. Fair values 
are determined in the following ways: externally verified via comparison to quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1); by using 
models with externally verifiable inputs (Level 2); or by using alternative procedures such as comparison to comparable instruments 
and/or using models with unobservable market inputs requiring Glencore to make market-based assumptions (Level 3). Level 3 
inputs therefore include the highest level of estimation uncertainty.
Adoption of revised standards
In the current year, Glencore has applied revised IFRS standards which were adopted as of 1 January 2017:
(i) Amendments to IAS 12 – Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses
The amendment to IAS 12 clarifies the accounting treatment for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured  
at fair value. The adoption of this amendment has had no material impact on the Group.
(ii) Amendments to IAS 7 – Statement of cash flows: Disclosure initiative
The amendment to IAS 7 requires entities to provide disclosures about changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, 
including changes arising from financing cash flows and non-cash changes (such as foreign exchange movements). The Group  
has included a reconciliation of cash flow movements in borrowings in note 19 to comply with this amendment.
New and revised standards not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, the following new and revised IFRS standards, which are 
applicable to Glencore, were issued but are not yet effective:
(i) Amendments to IFRS 2 – Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions – effective for year ends 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018
The amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based payments clarify the classification and measurement of share-based payments transactions 
with respect to accounting for cash-settled share-based payment transactions that include a performance obligation, the 
classification of share-based payment transactions with net settlement features and the accounting for modifications of share-based 
payment transactions from cash-settled to equity-settled. The Group has assessed the impact of the change on its consolidated 
financial statements and it does not expect any material impact.
130
Glencore Annual Report 2017 (ii) IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for year ends beginning on or after 1 January 2018
IFRS 9 will supersede IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” and covers classification and measurement 
of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. The Group has undertaken 
a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the new standard based on the financial instruments it holds and the way in which  
they are used. As a result of the analysis, it is anticipated that there will be no material impact on the face of the statement of 
financial position or in the statement of income, however, there will be presentational changes in some of our note disclosures, as 
well as additional disclosures around classification and measurement of financial instruments which are summarised as follows: 
Expected credit loss model
The new standard introduces an expected loss impairment model for financial assets held at amortised cost, which means that 
anticipated as opposed to impending credit losses will be recognised resulting in the likely earlier recognition of impairment.  
This change is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s results, given the low exposure to counterparty default  
risk as a result of the credit risk management processes that are in place. 
Hedge accounting
The new standard introduces a less prescriptive basis to adopt hedge accounting. This change is not expected to materially impact 
the amounts recognised in relation to existing hedging arrangements. 
Classification and measurement
IFRS 9 modifies the classification and measurement of certain classes of financial assets and liabilities and will require the Group 
to reassess classification of financial assets from four to three primary categories (amortised cost, fair value through profit and loss,  
fair value through other comprehensive income), reflecting the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow 
characteristics. These modifications will result in presentational changes to the additional detail provided primarily in the advances 
and loans (note 10), accounts receivable (note 12) and accounts payable (note 23) note disclosures to reflect the business model  
and cash flow characteristics of these assets and liabilities and group them into their respective IFRS 9 category or other IFRS 
classification. A summary of the expected presentational changes on our 31 December 2017 balances is as follows:

Other payables and accrued liabilities 23 2,216 2,015 – 201 2,216
Classification of other investments 
Upon implementation, IFRS 9 provides companies with the option to irrevocably designate investments in equity instruments  
as at fair value through other comprehensive income, provided certain criteria are met. Such investments are presented as other 
investments in note 9. The Group has evaluated the applicable criteria and intends to designate all its equity investments as fair value 
through other comprehensive income upon adoption of IFRS 9. For the year ended 31 December 2017, the fair value movements 
recognised on the investments currently classified as fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated statement of income were 
$23 million, and as a result of the designation of these investments as fair value through other comprehensive income, the respective 
fair value movements will be recognised in other comprehensive income subsequent to 1 January 2018. 
(iii) IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for year ends beginning on or after 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 applies to revenue from contracts with customers and replaces all of the revenue standards and interpretations in IFRS. 
The standard outlines the principles an entity must apply to measure and recognise revenue and the related cash flows. The Group 
has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the new standard based on a review of the contractual terms of its 
principal revenue streams with the primary focus being to understand whether the timing and amount of revenue recognised  
could differ under IFRS 15. As the majority of the Group’s revenue is derived from arrangements in which the transfer of risks and 
rewards coincides with the fulfilment of performance obligations and transfer of control as defined by IFRS 15, no material changes 
in respect of timing and amount of revenue currently recognised by the Group are expected. In addition, IFRS 15 requires that 
“distinct” promised goods or services, such as insurance and freight services to deliver the contracted goods to the customers,  
if material, be deferred and recognised over time as the obligation is fulfilled. The impact of this change is also not material,  
however the revenue earned from these activities is required to be separately disclosed and thus there will be presentational 
changes in our revenue related note disclosures.

(iv) IFRS 16 – Leases – effective for year ends beginning on or after 1 January 2019
IFRS 16 provides a comprehensive model for identification of lease arrangements and their treatment (on-balance sheet) in 
the financial statements of both lessees and lessors. It supersedes IAS 17 Leases and its associated interpretative guidance. Under 
the new standard, a lessee is required to recognise the present value of the unavoidable lease payments as a lease liability on the 
statement of financial position (including those currently classified as operating leases) with a corresponding right of use asset.  
The unwind of the financial charge on the lease liability and amortisation of the leased asset are recognised in the statement 
of income based on the implied interest rate and contract term respectively. Although the Group is still evaluating the potential 
impact of IFRS 16 on the financial statements and performance measures, including an assessment of whether any arrangements 
the Group enters into will be considered a lease under IFRS 16, the Group’s recognised assets and liabilities will increase and affect 
the presentation and timing of related depreciation and interest charges in the consolidated statement of income. Upon adoption  
of IFRS 16, the most significant impact will be the present value of the operating lease commitments (see note 29) being shown  
as a liability on the statement of financial position together with an asset representing the right of use which are unwound and 
amortised to the statement of income over time.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets, liabilities, marketing 
inventories and pension obligations that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period as 
explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is defined as the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value 
of the consideration given to acquire them at the time of their acquisition. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Directors have assessed that they have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 12 months from the date of approval of the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts. Therefore, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial 
statements. Also see page 108. Further information on Glencore’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital and 
financial risks are detailed in note 25.
All amounts are expressed in millions of United States Dollars, unless otherwise stated, consistent with the predominant functional 
currency of Glencore’s operations.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
and its subsidiaries. 
Control is achieved when Glencore is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, Glencore controls an investee if, and only if, Glencore 
has all of the following:
• power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and
• the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
When Glencore has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee or similar rights of an investee, it considers all relevant  
facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over the investee including:
• the size of Glencore’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders
• potential voting rights held by Glencore, other vote holders or other parties
• rights arising from other contractual arrangements, and
• any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that Glencore has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant 
activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one 
or more of the three elements of control listed above. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when Glencore obtains control over the 
subsidiary and ceases when Glencore loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of income and other comprehensive income from the date 
Glencore gains control until the date when Glencore ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to  
the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and  
to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with 
the Group’s accounting policies. All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions 
between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Notes to the financial statements
continued
132
Glencore Annual Report 2017 Changes in Glencore’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions with any 
difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid 
or received being recognised directly in equity and attributed to equity holders of Glencore.
When Glencore loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of income and is calculated as 
the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and 
(ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. 
All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if Glencore had 
directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category 
of equity as specified/permitted by applicable IFRSs). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date 
when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IAS 39, when applicable, 
or the cost on the initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture.
Investments in associates and joint ventures
Associates and joint ventures (together “Associates”) in which Glencore exercises significant influence or joint control are accounted 
for using the equity method. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the 
investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. Significant influence is presumed if Glencore holds between 20% and 
50% of the voting rights, unless evidence exists to the contrary. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have 
joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed 
sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about relevant strategic and/or key operating decisions 
require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Equity accounting involves Glencore recording its share of the Associate’s net income and equity. Glencore’s interest in an Associate  
is initially recorded at cost and is subsequently adjusted for Glencore’s share of changes in net assets of the Associate, less any 
impairment in the value of individual investments. Where Glencore transacts with an Associate, unrealised profits and losses are 
eliminated to the extent of Glencore’s interest in that Associate.
Changes in Glencore’s interests in Associates are accounted for as a gain or loss on disposal with any difference between the amount 
by which the carrying value of the Associate is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration received being recognised directly  
in the consolidated statement of income.
Joint operations
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets,  
and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. 
When Glencore undertakes its activities under joint operations, Glencore recognises in relation to its interest in a joint operation:
• its assets, including its share of any assets held jointly 
• its liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly
• its revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation 
• its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation, and 
• its expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly 
The Group accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in accordance with  
the IFRSs applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
Where Glencore transacts with a joint operation, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of Glencore’s interest 
in that joint operation. 
Business combinations and goodwill
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of the acquisition 
is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred 
to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. The identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities (“identifiable net assets”) are recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Acquisition 
related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of income as incurred.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, Glencore’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured  
to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date Glencore attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of income.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

Additional  
Information 1. Accounting policies continued 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to the cash-generating units (CGU) that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less 
than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is 
recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not able to be reversed in subsequent periods. 
On disposal of the relevant CGU, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, Glencore reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are 
adjusted for additional information obtained during the “measurement period” (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition 
date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised 
at that date.
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net 
assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share 
of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-
transaction basis. Other types of non-controlling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in 
another IFRS.
Similar procedures are applied in accounting for the purchases of interests in Associates and joint operations. Any goodwill arising 
from such purchases is included within the carrying amount of the investment in Associates, but not amortised thereafter. Any 
excess of Glencore’s share of the net fair value of the Associate’s identifiable net assets over the cost of the investment is included 
in the consolidated statement of income in the period of the purchase.
Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups
Non-current assets and assets and liabilities included in disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, they are available for immediate disposal and 
the sale is highly probable. Non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs 
to sell.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when Glencore has transferred to the buyer all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets sold. 
Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes and is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable to the 
extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to Glencore and the revenues and costs can be reliably measured. In most 
instances sales revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the destination specified by the customer, which is typically 
the vessel on which it is shipped, the destination port or the customer’s premises.
For certain commodities, the sales price is determined on a provisional basis at the date of sale as the final selling price is subject 
to movements in market prices up to the date of final pricing, normally ranging from 30 to 90 days after initial booking. Revenue 
on provisionally priced sales is recognised based on the estimated fair value of the total consideration receivable. The revenue 
adjustment mechanism embedded within provisionally priced sales arrangements has the character of a commodity derivative. 
Accordingly, the fair value of the final sales price adjustment is re-estimated continuously and changes in fair value are recognised  
as an adjustment to revenue. In all cases, fair value is estimated by reference to forward market prices.
Royalty, interest and dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to Glencore and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Royalty revenue is recognised on an 
accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference  
to the principal outstanding and the applicable effective interest rate. 
Foreign currency translation
Glencore’s reporting currency and the functional currency of the majority of its operations is the U.S. dollar as this is assessed  
to be the principal currency of the economic environment in which it operates.
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the functional currency of each entity using the exchange rate prevailing at the 
transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities outstanding at year end are converted at year-end rates. The resulting exchange 
differences are recorded in the consolidated statement of income.
(ii) Translation of financial statements
For the purposes of consolidation, assets and liabilities of group companies whose functional currency is in a currency other than  
the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates, while their statements of income are translated using 
average rates of exchange for the year.
Notes to the financial statements

134
Glencore Annual Report 2017 Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities  
of the foreign operation and are translated at the closing rate. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component  
of shareholders’ equity and have no consolidated statement of income impact to the extent that no disposal of the foreign  
operation has occurred.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying 
assets in which case they are capitalised up to the date when the qualifying asset is ready for its intended use.
Retirement benefits
Glencore operates various pension schemes in accordance with local requirements and practices of the respective countries.  
The annual costs for defined contribution plans that are funded by payments to separate trustee administered funds or insurance 
companies equal the contributions that are required under the plans and accounted for as an expense. 
Glencore uses the Projected Unit Credit Actuarial method to determine the present value of its defined benefit obligations and the 
related current service cost and, where applicable, past service cost. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the 
beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The cost of providing pensions is charged to the consolidated statement of income so as to recognise current and past service costs, 
interest cost on defined benefit obligations, and the effect of any curtailments or settlements, net of expected returns on plan assets. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and will not be reclassified to the consolidated 
statement of income. The retirement benefit obligation/asset recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position 
represents the actual deficit or surplus in Glencore’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited  
to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions  
to the plans.
Glencore also provides post-retirement healthcare benefits to certain employees in Canada, South Africa and the United States. 
These are accounted for in a similar manner to the defined benefit pension plans, however are unfunded.
Share-based payments
(i) Equity-settled share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the awards based on the market value of the shares at the 
grant date. Fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The fair value is charged to the consolidated 
statement of income and credited to retained earnings on a straight-line basis over the period the estimated awards are expected 
to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result  
of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised  
in the consolidated statement of income such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding 
adjustment to retained earnings.
(ii) Cash-settled share-based payments
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is initially recognised at fair value based on the estimated number of awards that 
are expected to vest, adjusting for market and non-market-based performance conditions. Subsequently, at each reporting period 
until the liability is settled, it is remeasured to fair value with any changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement 
of income.
Income taxes
Income taxes consist of current and deferred income taxes. Current taxes represent income taxes expected to be payable based on 
enacted or substantively enacted tax rates at the period end on expected current taxable income, and any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of previous years. Deferred taxes are recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable income, using enacted 
or substantively enacted income tax rates which are expected to be effective at the time of reversal of the underlying temporary 
difference. Deferred tax assets and unused tax losses are only recognised to the extent that their recoverability is probable. Deferred 
tax assets are reviewed at reporting period end and amended to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related benefit will 
be realised. To the extent that a deferred tax asset not previously recognised subsequently fulfils the criteria for recognition, an asset 
is then recognised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same authority and Glencore has both  
the right and the intention to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net or simultaneous basis. The tax effect of certain 
temporary differences is not recognised principally with respect to the initial recognition of an asset or liability (other than those 
arising in a business combination or in a manner that initially impacted accounting or taxable profit) and temporary differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries and Associates to the extent that Glencore can control the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is provided  
in respect of fair value adjustments on acquisitions. These adjustments may relate to assets such as extraction rights that, in general, 
are not eligible for income tax allowances.
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the consolidated statement of income, except when they relate 
to items that are recognised outside the consolidated statement of income (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity) or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination.

Royalties, extraction taxes and other levies/taxes are treated as taxation arrangements when they have the characteristics of an 
income tax including being imposed and determined in accordance with regulations established by the respective government’s 
taxation authority and the amount payable is based on taxable income – rather than physical quantities produced or as a percentage 
of revenues – after adjustment for temporary differences. For such arrangements, current and deferred tax is provided on the same 
basis as described above for other forms of taxation. Obligations arising from royalty arrangements that do not satisfy these criteria 
are recognised as current provisions and included in cost of goods sold.
Glencore assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years open to audit based upon the latest information available. Inherent 
uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to complexities of interpretation and changes in tax laws. For those matters 
where it is probable that an adjustment will be made, the Group records its best estimate of these tax liabilities, including related 
interest charges.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given to acquire or construct the asset, 
including directly attributable costs required to bring the asset to the location or to a condition necessary for operation and the direct 
cost of dismantling and removing the asset, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the specific asset 
concerned, or the estimated remaining life of the associated mine (LOM), field or lease. 
Depreciation commences when the asset is available for use. The major categories of property, plant and equipment are 
depreciated/amortised on a units of production (UOP) and/or straight-line basis as follows:
Buildings 10 – 45 years
Freehold land not depreciated
Plant and equipment 3 – 30 years/UOP
Mineral and petroleum rights UOP
Deferred mining costs UOP
Assets under finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the Group as lessee, are capitalised 
and amortised over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.  
All other leases are classified as operating leases, the expenditures for which are recognised in the statement of income on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
(i) Mineral and petroleum rights
Mineral and petroleum reserves, resources and rights (together “Mineral and petroleum rights”) which can be reasonably valued,  
are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition. Mineral and petroleum rights for which values cannot be reasonably 
determined are not recognised. Exploitable Mineral and petroleum rights are amortised using the UOP basis over the commercially 
recoverable reserves and, in certain circumstances, other mineral resources. Mineral resources are included in amortisation 
calculations where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be extracted in an economic manner.
(ii) Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure relates to costs incurred in the exploration and evaluation of potential mineral and petroleum 
resources and includes costs such as exploration and production licences, researching and analysing historical exploration data, 
exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling and the costs of pre-feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area 
of interest, other than that acquired from another entity, is charged to the consolidated statement of income as incurred except 
when the expenditure is expected to be recouped from future exploitation or sale of the area of interest and it is planned to continue 
with active and significant operations in relation to the area, or at the reporting period end, the activity has not reached a stage 
which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially recoverable reserves, in which case the expenditure is 
capitalised. As the intangible component (i.e. licences) represents an insignificant and indistinguishable portion of the overall 
expected tangible amount to be incurred and recouped from future exploitation, these costs along with other capitalised exploration 
and evaluation expenditure are recorded as a component of property, plant and equipment. Purchased exploration and evaluation 
assets are recognised at their fair value at acquisition.
As the capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated. All capitalised exploration 
and evaluation expenditure is monitored for indications of impairment. Where a potential impairment is indicated, an assessment  
is performed for each area of interest or at the CGU level. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is not expected to be recovered  
it is charged to the consolidated statement of income.
Administration costs that are not directly attributable to a specific exploration area are charged to the consolidated statement of 
income. Licence costs paid in connection with a right to explore in an existing exploration area are capitalised and amortised over  
the term of the permit.
Notes to the financial statements

136
Glencore Annual Report 2017 Development expenditure
When commercially recoverable reserves are determined and such proposed development receives the appropriate approvals, 
capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is transferred to construction in progress, a component within the plant and 
equipment asset sub-category. All subsequent development expenditure is similarly capitalised, provided commercial viability 
conditions continue to be satisfied. Proceeds from the sale of product extracted during the development phase are netted against 
development expenditure. Upon completion of development and commencement of production, capitalised development costs are 
further transferred, as required, to the appropriate plant and equipment asset category and depreciated using the unit of production 
method (UOP) or straight-line basis.
(iii) Deferred mining costs
Mainly comprises certain capitalised costs related to underground mining as well as pre-production and in-production stripping 
activities as outlined below. Deferred mining costs are amortised using the UOP basis over the life of the ore body to which those 
costs relate. 
Deferred stripping costs
Stripping costs incurred in the development of a mine (or pit) before production commences are capitalised as part of the cost  
of constructing the mine (or pit) and subsequently amortised over the life of the mine (or pit) on a UOP basis. 
In-production stripping costs related to accessing an identifiable component of the ore body to realise benefits in the form of 
improved access to ore to be mined in the future (stripping activity asset), are capitalised within deferred mining costs provided  
all the following conditions are met:
(a)  it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the stripping activity will be realised;
(b)  the component of the ore body for which access has been improved can be identified; and
(c) the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with the improved access can be reliably measured. 
If all of the criteria are not met, the production stripping costs are charged to the consolidated statement of income as they 
are incurred.
The stripping activity asset is subsequently depreciated on a UOP basis over the life of the identified component of the ore body  
that became more accessible as a result of the stripping activity and is then stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses.
(iv) Biological assets
Biological assets are carried at their fair value less estimated selling costs. Any changes in fair value less estimated selling costs are 
included in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which they arise.
Restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning
Restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, 
discounted using a risk free rate specific to the liability and the currency in which they are denominated to their net present  
value, are provided for and capitalised at the time such an obligation arises. The costs are charged to the consolidated statement  
of income over the life of the operation through depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site disturbance, which is created on an ongoing basis during production, are provided for at their 
net present values and charged to the consolidated statement of income as extraction progresses.
Changes in the estimated timing of the rehabilitation or changes to the estimated future costs are accounted for prospectively by 
recognising an adjustment to the rehabilitation liability and a corresponding adjustment to the asset to which it relates, provided 
a reduction, if any, in the provision is not greater than the depreciated capitalised cost of the related asset, in which case the 
capitalised cost is reduced to Nil and the remaining adjustment recognised in the consolidated statement of income. In the  
case of closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of income. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation (calculated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives) and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Internally generated intangibles are not capitalised. Instead, the related expenditure is recognised in the consolidated statement  
of income and other comprehensive income in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
Identifiable intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life. The amortisation 
method and period are reviewed annually and impairment testing is undertaken when circumstances indicate the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. Other than goodwill which is not depreciated, Glencore has no identifiable intangible assets with an 
indefinite life.

Information 1. Accounting policies continued 
The major categories of intangibles are amortised on a straight-line basis as follows:
Port allocation rights 30 – 40 years
Licences, trademarks and software 3 – 20 years
Royalty arrangements 20 – 30 years
Acquired offtake arrangements 5 – 10 years
Goodwill impairment testing
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the business combination and which represent the level at which management monitors and manages the 
goodwill. In assessing whether an impairment is required, the carrying value of the CGU is compared with its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal (FVLC”) and its value in use (VIU). If the recoverable amount 
of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the 
unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of income. An impairment loss recognised 
for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. 
Other investments
Equity investments, other than investments in Associates, are recorded at fair value unless such fair value is not reliably determinable 
in which case they are carried at cost. Changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of income unless they  
are classified as available for sale, in which case fair value movements are recognised in other comprehensive income and are 
subsequently recognised in the consolidated statement of income when realised by sale or redemption, or when a reduction  
in fair value is judged to be a significant or prolonged decline.
Impairment or impairment reversals
Glencore conducts, at least annually, an internal review of asset values which is used as a source of information to assess for any 
indications of impairment or impairment reversal. Formal impairment tests are carried out, at least annually, for cash-generating units 
containing goodwill and for all other non-current assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.
A formal impairment or reversal test involves determining whether the carrying amounts are in excess (or below, as the case may be) 
of their recoverable amounts. An asset’s recoverable amount is determined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset-by-asset basis, except where assets do not generate cash flows independent  
of other assets, in which case the review is undertaken at the CGU level.
If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statement  
of income to reflect the asset at the lower amount.
For those assets which were impaired in prior periods, if their recoverable amount exceeds their carrying amount, an impairment 
reversal is recorded in the consolidated statement of income to reflect the asset at the higher amount to the extent the increased 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying value of the asset that would have been determined had no impairment 
been recognised. 
Goodwill impairments and impairments of available for sale equity investments cannot be subsequently reversed.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when Glencore has a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of past events, and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that can be reliably estimated will be required to settle the liability.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation, including interpretation of specific 
laws and likelihood of settlement. Where a provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle the present obligation,  
its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).
Onerous contracts
An onerous contract is considered to exist where Glencore has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract. Present obligations  
arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions.
Unfavourable contracts
An unfavourable contract is considered to exist when Glencore, in a business combination, acquires a contract under which  
the terms of the contract require Glencore to sell products or purchase services on terms which are economically unfavourable 
compared to current market terms at the time of the business combination. Unfavourable contracts are recognised at the  
present value of the economic loss and amortised into the statement of income over the term of the contract.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Inventories
The vast majority of inventories attributable to the marketing activities (“marketing inventories”) are valued at fair value less costs of 
disposal with the remainder valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Unrealised gains and losses from changes in fair value 
are reported in cost of goods sold.
Inventories held by the industrial activities (“production inventories”) are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is 
determined using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) or the weighted average method and comprises material costs, labour costs and 
allocated production related overhead costs. Financing and storage costs related to inventory are expensed as incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held at bank, cash in hand and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity  
of three months or less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Financial instruments
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), loans and receivables, held-to-
maturity investments or available for sale financial assets depending upon the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. 
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value on the trade date, including, in the case of instruments not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, financial assets are carried at fair value (other investments, 
derivatives and marketable securities) or amortised cost less impairment (accounts receivable and advances and loans). Financial 
liabilities other than derivatives are initially recognised at fair value of consideration received net of transaction costs as appropriate 
and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
(i) Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial 
assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the 
initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognised is the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The amount of the loss is recognised in the statement 
of income.
For financial assets that are carried at cost, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar 
financial asset. Such impairment loss will not be reversed in subsequent periods.
(ii) Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Group neither transfers nor 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its 
retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises 
a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the 
consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income  
and accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Own shares
The cost of purchases of own shares is deducted from equity. Where they are purchased, issued to employees or sold, no gain or loss 
is recognised in the consolidated statement of income. Such gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. Any proceeds received 
on disposal of the shares or transfers to employees are recognised in equity. 
Derivatives and hedging activities
Derivative instruments, which include physical contracts to sell or purchase commodities that do not meet the own use exemption, 
are initially recognised at fair value when Glencore becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are 
subsequently remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Fair values are determined using quoted market prices, 
dealer price quotations or using models and other valuation techniques, the key inputs for which include current market and 
contractual prices for the underlying instrument, time to expiry, yield curves, volatility of the underlying instrument and 
counterparty risk.
Gains and losses on derivative instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied, other than the revenue adjustment 
mechanism embedded within provisionally priced sales, are recognised in cost of goods sold.
Those derivatives qualifying and designated as hedges are either (i) a Fair Value Hedge of the change in fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or (ii) a Cash Flow Hedge of the change in cash flows to be received or paid 
relating to a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable transaction.
A change in the fair value of derivatives designated as a Fair Value Hedge is reflected together with the change in the fair value  
of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of income.

Strategic Report
 
Governance
  
Financial  
Statements
  
Additional  
Information 1. Accounting policies continued 
A change in the fair value of derivatives designated as a Cash Flow Hedge is initially recognised as a cash flow hedge reserve in 
shareholders’ equity. The deferred amount is then released to the consolidated statement of income in the same periods during  
which the hedged transaction affects the consolidated statement of income. Hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in the consolidated 
statement of income when it occurs.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in shareholders’ equity and is recognised in the consolidated statement of income 
when the committed or forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the consolidated statement of income. However, if a forecast 
or committed transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately 
transferred to the consolidated statement of income.
A derivative may be embedded in a “host contract”. Such combinations are known as hybrid instruments and at the date  
of issuance, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a standalone derivative if the  
criteria for separation are met. The host contract is accounted for in accordance with its relevant accounting policy.
2. Segment information
Glencore is organised and operates on a worldwide basis in three core business segments – Metals and minerals, Energy products 
and Agricultural products, with each business segment responsible for the marketing, sourcing, hedging, logistics and industrial 
investment activities of their respective products and reflecting the structure used by Glencore’s management to assess the 
performance of Glencore.
The business segments’ contributions to the Group are primarily derived from the net margin or premium earned from physical 
Marketing activities (net sale and purchase of physical commodities), provision of marketing and related value-add services and the 
margin earned from Industrial asset activities (net resulting from the sale of physical commodities over the cost of production and/or 
cost of sales) and comprise the following underlying key commodities:
• Metals and minerals: Zinc, copper, lead, alumina, aluminium, ferroalloys, nickel, cobalt and iron ore, including smelting, refining, 
mining, processing and storage related operations of the relevant commodities
• Energy products: Crude oil, oil products, steam coal and metallurgical coal, including investments in coal mining  
and oil production operations, ports, vessels and storage facilities, and
• Agriculture products: Wheat, corn, canola, barley, rice, oil seeds, meals, edible oils, biofuels, cotton and sugar supported by 
investments in storage, handling, processing and port facilities
Corporate and other: consolidated statement of income amount represents unallocated Group related expenses (including variable 
pool bonus charges). Statement of financial position amounts represent Group related balances.
The financial performance of the segments is principally evaluated by management with reference to Adjusted EBIT/EBITDA which  
is the net result of segmental revenue (revenue including Proportionate adjustments as defined in the Alternative performance 
measure section) less cost of goods sold and selling and administrative expenses plus share of income from associates and joint 
ventures, dividend income and the attributable share of Adjusted EBIT/EBITDA of relevant material associates and joint ventures, 
which are accounted for internally by means of proportionate consolidation, excluding significant items. The 2016 segment 
information includes the Agricultural products business which was disclosed as a discontinued operation until the close of its 50% 
sale on 1 December 2016, see note 24. Following completion of the sale, the results from Agricultural products have been combined 
under Marketing activities and the 2016 comparatives (relating to Agricultural 2016 Industrial revenue of $3,292 million and EBITDA/
EBIT of $138 million and $104 million respectively) in respect thereof have been reclassified from Industrial to Marketing activities in 
the below tables, consistent with how the business’ performance is monitored by Glencore’s management.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in note 1 with the exception of relevant  
material associates and joint ventures. Under IFRS 1 1, Glencore’s investments in the Antamina copper/zinc mine (34% owned) and 
the Cerrejón coal mine (33% owned) are considered to be associates as they are not subject to joint control and the Collahuasi 
copper mine (44% owned) and Glencore Agri (50% owned) are considered to be joint ventures. Associates and joint ventures are 
required to be accounted for in Glencore’s financial statements under the equity method. For internal reporting and analysis, 
Glencore evaluates the performance of these investments under the proportionate consolidation method, reflecting Glencore’s 
proportionate share of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the investments. Under IFRS 5, 100% of the results of the 
Agricultural business segment up to the date of completion of the sale were presented as a discontinued operation in the Group’s 
statement of income, following the agreed sale of a 50% interest in Glencore Agri, see note 24. Prior to completion of the sale, 
Glencore evaluated the performance of this segment under the full consolidation method, consistent with prior periods. The 
balances as presented for internal reporting purposes are reconciled to Glencore’s statutory disclosures in the following tables  
and/or in the Alternative performance measure section.

in the ordinary course of business, from its Industrial to Marketing operations. Management assesses segment performance prior to any such adjustments, as if the sales 
were to third parties.
7 Represents an accounting measurement mismatch between the fair value of coal derivative positions in respect of portfolio risk management/hedging activities initiated  
in Q2 2016 and the anticipated future revenue to be generated from the sale of future unsold coal production. The derivative positions manage forward sales price exposure 
relating to some 11 million tonnes of future attributable coal production, which is expected to be settled before 31 December 2017. The derivative positions include 
pre-existing trading contracts, for which mark-to-market movements, up until the time of them being ring-fenced for hedging activities, were included in trading results. 
These transactions were not able to be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS, which would have allowed for the deferment of any income statement effect until 
performance of the underlying future sale transactions. The fair value movements in the derivative portfolio will be offset against future revenue in the segment information 
as the related sales (of production) are realised.

rise to them are reported separately from operating segment results. Other expenses – net includes, but is not limited to, gain/loss  
on disposal of property, plant and equipment and restructuring and closure costs.
Net changes in mark-to-market valuations on investments held for trading
Primarily relates to movements on interests in investments classified as held for trading (see note 9) and the ARM Coal non-
discretionary dividend obligation (see note 27) carried at fair value. 
Legal settlement
Glencore Ltd (GLtd), the U.S. branch of Glencore AG, is a defendant in a case relating to an alumina refinery located in St. Croix,  
U.S. Virgin Islands which was acquired by Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation (Vialco), a former affiliate of GLtd in 1989, and was 
subsequently disposed of by Vialco in 2005. GLtd guaranteed the obligations of Vialco under the 1989 agreement which included 
certain environmental and other indemnities. The complaint alleges that GLtd is contractually obligated to indemnify the previous 
owners for two environmental lawsuits arising out of ownership and operation of the refinery. GLtd intends to vigorously defend the 
contention, but has nevertheless reserved $75 million for the possibility the plaintiff might prevail in the whole of its claims.
In September 2016, a subsidiary of the Group reached a settlement with U.S. agencies to pay a penalty of $27 million and retire 
around $65 million of credits in relation to compliance with a U.S. biofuels programme in the years 201 1/12.
Katanga restatement
During the year, Katanga Mining Limited (Katanga), an 86.3% controlled subsidiary of the Group listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, 
identified certain accounting matters affecting its results reported in prior years, the impact of which was considered material for 
Katanga but not for the Group. Consequently, for the years ended 31 December 2016 and earlier, Katanga has restated its financial 
statements, however the cumulative impact has only been corrected in the Group financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2017. Had the Group’s results been restated, income before taxes for the 2016 year would have been lower by 
$10 million.

products $310 million (2016: $1,218 million).
As part of a regular portfolio review, Glencore carries out an assessment of whether there is an indication of asset impairment 
or whether a previously recorded impairment may no longer be required.
The recoverable amounts of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were measured based on fair value less costs 
of disposal (FVLCD), determined by discounted cash flow techniques based on the most recent approved financial budgets and 
three-year business plans, which are underpinned and supported by life of mine plans of the respective operations. The valuation 
models use the most recent reserve and resource estimates, relevant cost assumptions generally based on past experience and 
where possible, market forecasts of commodity price and foreign exchange rate assumptions discounted using operation specific 
discount rates ranging from 7% – 12% (2016: 7% – 1 1%). The valuations remain sensitive to price and a deterioration/improvement  
in the pricing outlook may result in additional impairments/reversals. The determination of FVLCD uses Level 3 valuation techniques 
for both years.

Additional  
Information 5. Impairments continued
As a result of the regular impairment assessment, the following significant impairment charges resulted:
2017
Property, plant and equipment
• Following a modest downward revision, compared to prior year, of the long-term oil price assumption used to determine the 
remaining recoverable value of the E&P assets, offset by a combination of improved pricing differentials for the Chad crude 
oil blend (Doba) and further cost savings, an overall impairment charge of $278 million has been recognised in the Chad oil 
operations (Energy products segment). The remaining recoverable value of the Chad oil operations is $1,221 million. The valuation 
remains sensitive to price and further deterioration or improvement in the pricing outlook may result in additional or reversal of 
impairment. The short- to long-term Brent crude oil price assumptions used in the valuation were $65 – $70 per barrel and should 
these decrease or increase by 10%, a further $535 million of impairment or reversal would be recognised.
• In January 2018, a farm-down agreement to divest a 50% interest in the Bolongo licence in Cameroon was signed. As a result, 
the remaining recoverable value of the retained 37.5% working interest (on the assumption that the Cameroon State National Oil 
Company will exercise its back-in right to the Oak development) was impaired by $81 million, to its recoverable value of $142 million. 
The valuation remains sensitive to price and further deterioration or improvement in the pricing outlook may result in additional 
or reversal of impairment. The short- to long-term Brent crude oil price assumptions used in the valuation were $65 – $70 per barrel 
and should these decrease or increase by 10%, a further $13 million of impairment or reversal would be recognised.
• The Alen field gas production in Equatorial Guinea is currently reinjected back into the field. A project to commercialise gas 
production has now progressed sufficiently, resulting in a partial reversal of impairments of $243 million in the Equatorial Guinea  
oil operations (Energy products segment) and an increase in the recoverable value to $394 million. The valuation remains sensitive 
to price and further deterioration or improvement in the pricing outlook may result in additional or reversal of impairment.  
The short- to long-term Brent crude oil price assumptions and the Henry Hub price assumption used in the valuation were  
$65 – $70 per barrel and $3 per million Btu respectively. Should these decrease or increase by 10%, a further $75 million of 
impairment or reversal would be recognised.
• As a result of certain life of mine optimisation and design updates, alongside the finalisation phase of Katanga’s whole ore leach 
project and its successful commissioning in late 2017, it was determined that certain processing equipment and non-current 
inventories were no longer required and therefore the full carrying value of these assets were impaired by $76 million. 
• The balance of property, plant and equipment related impairment charges (none of which were individually material) relates 
to specific assets where utilisation is no longer required or projects progressed due to changes in production and development  
plans. As a result, the full carrying value of these assets/projects was impaired, with $186 million recognised in our Metals and 
minerals segment. 
Investments
• Following strategic reviews of a copper and gold exploration investment and a coal investment it was determined, for the time 
being, to cease further development and, as a result, the full carrying value of each investment, $56 million and $45 million  
respectively, was impaired. 
Advances and loans – non-current
• Glencore has reviewed the carrying value of its interest in subordinated debt and preference shares of a coal port following the 
insolvencies of certain third party shippers which impact the expected return on these investments and as a result, such loans 
were impaired by $149 million, to their estimated recoverable amount of $139 million.
2016
Property, plant and equipment
• Due to changes in estimated reserve life and revised mining plans, the estimated mine life of Tahmoor in Australia (Energy 
products segment) was reduced from 2020 to 2017. As a result, the carrying value of this operation was impaired by $168 million,  
to its estimated recoverable amount of $100 million, which is expected to be depleted over the following year as the mine 
approaches its completion.
• As a result of a write down of appraisal expenditure and certain operational challenges at the Equatorial Guinea oil operations 
(Energy products segment), an impairment charge of $31 1 million has been recognised resulting in a remaining recoverable value 
of $194 million. The valuation remains sensitive to price and further deterioration in the pricing outlook may result in additional 
impairment. The short- to long-term Brent crude oil price assumptions used in the valuation were between $50 – $75 per barrel 
and should these fall by 10%, a further $46 million of impairment would be recognised.
• During 2016, Glencore’s long-term oil price assumptions were revised downwards, which together with delayed work  
programmes, resulted in a $622 million impairment of the onshore Chad oil operations (Energy products segment), to their 
estimated recoverable amount of $1,480 million. The valuation remains sensitive to price and further deterioration in the pricing 
outlook may result in additional impairment. The short- to long-term Brent crude oil price assumptions used in the valuation  
were between $50 – $75 per barrel and should these fall by 10%, a further $695 million of impairment would be recognised.  
The balance of property, plant and equipment related impairment charges (none of which were individually material) arose  
due to changes in production and development plans and resulted in impairments of $50 million and $1 17 million being 
recognised in our Metals and minerals and Energy products segments respectively.

The non-tax deductible items of $826 million (2016: $634 million) primarily relate to non-deductible exploration charges, financing 
costs, impairments and various other expenses. The impact of tax exempt income of $332 million (2016: $443 million) primarily 
relates to non-taxable intra-group dividends, income that is not effectively connected to the taxable jurisdiction, and various 
other items.
The tax impact of foreign exchange fluctuations relates to the foreign currency movements on deferred tax balances where the 
underlying tax balances are denominated in a currency different to the functional currency determined for accounting purposes. 
The impact of change in tax rates of $193 million arises primarily from significant corporate tax rate changes in the U.S., following  
the announced U.S. tax reform.

1 Asset and liability positions in the same category reflect the impact of tax assets and liabilities arising in local tax jurisdictions that cannot be offset against tax assets and 
liabilities arising in other tax jurisdictions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit 
is probable. As at 31 December 2017, $2,404 million (2016: $2,898 million) of deferred tax assets related to available loss carry 
forwards have been brought to account, of which $1,523 million (2016: $1,653 million) are disclosed as deferred tax assets 
with the remaining balance being offset against deferred tax liabilities arising in the same tax entity. This balance is primarily 
comprised of:
• $470 million (2016: $462 million) in entities domiciled in the DRC (Katanga Mining Group), where these entities have been  
loss making for tax purposes in both 2017 and 2016
• $478 million (2016: $657 million) in entities domiciled in Switzerland, and
• $425 million (2016: $430 million) in entities domiciled in the U.S.
In evaluating whether it is probable that taxable profits will be earned in future accounting periods prior to any tax loss expiry as may 
be the case, all available evidence was considered, including approved budgets, forecasts and business plans and, in certain cases, 
analysis of historical operating results. These forecasts are consistent with those prepared and used internally for business planning 
and impairment testing purposes. Following this evaluation, it was determined there would be sufficient taxable income generated 
to realise the benefit of the deferred tax assets and that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would result in 
a material reduction in forecast headroom of tax profits so that the recognised deferred tax asset would not be realised, other than 
the potential developments in the DRC discussed below. 
The losses carried forward in the DRC have an unlimited carry forward period, subject to an annual utilisation limitation.  
Katanga Mining has recently resumed operations and is expected to generate sufficient taxable profits in the future. Should these 
expectations fully materialise, up to $633 million of available unrecognised tax effected losses could be recognised. However, in 
January 2018, the DRC parliament passed a revised mining code which raises taxes and ceases existing tax stability agreements.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 At 31 December 2017, these revisions were not substantively enacted and therefore do not impact the recognition of deferred  
taxes at year end. However, if enacted as currently contemplated, the changes could significantly impact the currently recognised  
tax losses, along with any unrecognised tax losses.
The recognised losses carried forward in Switzerland primarily relate to non-recurring events in 201 1 and 2012. Based on the core 
business activities conducted in Switzerland and taxable income in 2017, sufficient taxable profits are expected to fully utilise the 
recognised tax losses prior to expiration.
The recognised losses carried forward in the U.S. primarily relate to non-recurring events in 201 1 and have a carry forward period  
of 20 years. The U.S. entities comprise our core U.S. marketing activities and based on taxable income in 2017 and forecasts going 
forward, sufficient taxable profits are expected to fully utilise the recognised tax losses prior to expiration.
Available gross tax losses carried forward and deductible temporary differences, for which no deferred tax assets have been 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements, are detailed below and will expire as follows:

Goodwill
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs as follows:
US$ million 2017 2016
Metals and minerals marketing businesses 3,326 3,326
Coal marketing business 1,674 1,674
Metals warehousing business 50 50
Total 5,050 5,050
Metals and minerals and coal marketing businesses
Goodwill of $3,326 million and $1,674 million was recognised in connection with previous business combinations and was allocated 
to the metals and minerals marketing and coal marketing CGUs respectively, based on the annual synergies expected to accrue  
to the respective marketing departments as a result of increased volumes, blending opportunities and freight and logistics  
arbitrage opportunities.
Metals warehousing business
Goodwill of $50 million (2016: $50 million) relates to the Access World (former Pacorini) logistics business CGU.
Port allocation rights
Port allocation rights represent contractual entitlements to export certain amounts of coal on an annual basis from Richard Bay Coal 
Terminal in South Africa recognised as part of previous business combinations. The rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated economic life of the port of 40 years.
Licences, trademarks and software
Intangibles related to internally developed technology and patents were recognised in previous business combinations and are 
amortised over the estimated economic life of the technology which ranges between 10 – 15 years. 
Royalty
The fair value of a royalty income stream related to output from the Antamina copper mine was recognised as part of a previous 
business combination. This amount was being amortised on a unit of production basis. In December 2017, this royalty was disposed 
of, see note 3. 
Goodwill impairment testing
Given the nature of each CGU’s activities, information on its fair value is usually difficult to obtain unless negotiations with potential 
purchasers or similar transactions are taking place. Consequently,
• the recoverable amount for each of the marketing CGUs is determined by reference to the FVLCD which utilises a price to earnings 
multiple approach based on the 2017 approved financial budget which includes factors such as marketing volumes handled and 
operating, interest and income tax charges, generally based on past experience. The price to earnings multiple of 15.0 times  
(2016: 13.5 times) is derived from observable market data for broadly comparable businesses; and
• Glencore believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount  
to fall below the carrying value of the CGU. The determination of FVLCD for each of the marketing CGUs used Level 3 valuation 
techniques in both years.

of Century Aluminum was secured under a loan facility, with proceeds received and recognised in current borrowings of $170 million 
(2016: $Nil).
HG Storage
In December 2017, Glencore disposed of a 51% interest in HG Storage, its petroleum products and logistics business,  
for $530 million (see note 24), subsequently accounting for its remaining share using the equity method.
Trevali
In August 2017, Glencore disposed of its African zinc operations (Perkoa and Rosh Pinah) for a combination of cash and a 25% 
($222 million) interest in Trevali (see note 24).
BaseCore Metals 
In December 2017, Glencore disposed of a portfolio of selected base metals’ royalty assets for a combination of cash and a 50% 
($150 million) interest in BaseCore Metals LP (see note 3), subsequently accounting for its share using the equity method.

3 Glencore’s attributable share of impairments relating to Cerrejón amounts to $345 million, net of taxes of $176 million, resulting from reduced near term production 
estimates due to increased risks related to delays in securing approvals as a result of continued social and environmental challenges to current mine plans.

Glencore accounts for its interests in United Company Rusal plc, OAO NK Russneft (Russneft) and Yancoal Australia Limited (Yancoal) 
as available for sale investments at fair value with mark-to-market movements recognised in other comprehensive income. Although 
Glencore holds a 25% interest in Russneft, it does not exercise significant influence over its financial and operating policy decisions.
Yancoal
On 27 July 2017, Glencore and Yancoal signed agreements relating to the acquisition of a 49% interest in the Hunter Valley 
Operations (HVO) coal mine in New South Wales, Australia following Yancoal’s acquisition of Coal & Allied from Rio Tinto.  
In addition to this transaction, Glencore agreed to subscribe for $31 1 million worth of shares in Yancoal’s equity raising which 
completed in September 2017. The HVO acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals, which are expected to be received during  
the course of H1 2018. Also see note 29. 
Fair value through profit and loss
Rosneft
On 3 January 2017, Glencore and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) entered into various agreements establishing a 50:50 consortium 
(QHG) to acquire 19.5% of OSJC Rosneft Oil (Rosneft) and enter into a 5 year offtake agreement with Rosneft. The joint investments 
established constitute joint arrangements subject to joint control by virtue of the partnership agreements, in accordance with  
IFRS 1 1, and are accounted for under the equity method and included within investments in joint ventures. The structure requires 
unanimous consent for all key decisions regarding the relevant activities of the joint investments. As the joint arrangements are 
structured through separate vehicles and Glencore is not the only possible source of funding, nor does it have a direct or indirect 
obligation for the liabilities of the arrangements, the arrangements have been accounted for as joint ventures. Glencore’s initial 
investment was EUR 2. In September 2017, QHG concluded an agreement with CEFC China Energy Company Limited to dispose  
of the majority of the shares it held (amounting to a 14.16% stake in Rosneft). Following completion of the transaction, the margin 
guarantees provided by Glencore (see note 30) will terminate. The transaction, subject to customary regulatory approval processes,  
is expected to complete in H1 2018.
In relation to these arrangements, Glencore advanced EUR300 million in the form of a total return swap over 0.57% of Rosneft shares, 
accounted for at fair value through profit and loss, which constitutes the substantial majority of Glencore’s investment in QHG. 
Volcan
On 9 November 2017, Glencore completed the acquisition of additional shares in Volcan, thereby increasing its total economic 
interest from 7.7% to 23.3% (see note 24). Prior to acquisition, Glencore’s interest in Volcan was accounted for at fair value through 
profit and loss and a gain of $235 million was recognised in changes in mark-to-market valuations on investments held for trading 
(see note 4).

SNEL power advances
In early 2012, a joint agreement with Société Nationale d’Électricité (SNEL), the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC)  
national electricity utility, was signed whereby Glencore’s operations will contribute $389 million to a major electricity infrastructure 
refurbishment programme, including transmission and distribution systems. This is expected to facilitate a progressive increase  
in power availability to 450 megawatts by the end of 2018. Funding commenced in the second quarter of 2012 and will continue 
until Q1 2020. The loans are being repaid via discounts on electricity purchases, which will accelerate upon completion of the 
refurbishment programme.
Chad State National Oil Company
Glencore has provided a net $398 million (2016: $418 million) to the Chad State National Oil Company (SHT) to be repaid through 
future oil deliveries over seven years. As at 31 December 2017, the advance is net of $872 million (2016: $972 million) provided  
by a syndicate of banks, the repayment terms of which are contingent upon and connected to the receipt of oil due from SHT  
under the prepayment. Of the net amount advanced, $339 million (2016: $389 million) is receivable after 12 months and is presented 
within Other non-current receivables and loans and $59 million (2016: $29 million) is due within 12 months and included within 
Accounts receivable.
Société Nationale des Pétroles du Congo (SNPC)
Glencore has provided a net $212 million (2016: $336 million) to SNPC repayable through future oil deliveries over five years. As at

2017, the total advance of $1,172 million (2016: $1,571 million) is recorded net of $1,092 million (2016: $1,414 million) provided by the 
bank market, the repayment terms of which are contingent upon and connected to the future receipt of iron ore contractually due 
from the counterparty. Of the net amount advanced, $38 million (2016: $89 million) is due after 12 months and presented within

Additional  
Information 11. Inventories
Current inventory 
Inventories of $24,084 million (2016: $18,347 million) comprise $15,344 million (2016: $1 1,323 million) of inventories carried at fair  
value less costs of disposal and $8,740 million (2016: $7,024 million) valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The amount  
of inventories and related ancillary costs recognised as an expense during the year was $185,371 million (2016: $137,903 million).
Fair value of inventories is a Level 2 fair value measurement (see note 27) using observable market prices obtained from exchanges, 
traded reference indices or market survey services adjusted for relevant location and quality differentials. There are no significant 
unobservable inputs in the fair value measurement of such inventories.
Glencore has a number of dedicated financing facilities, which finance a portion of its inventories. In each case, the inventory  
has not been derecognised as the Group retains the principal risks and rewards of ownership. The proceeds received are  
recognised as current borrowings (see note 19). As at 31 December 2017, the total amount of inventory secured under such  
facilities was $435 million (2016: $1,632 million). The proceeds received and recognised as current borrowings were $221 million  
(2016: $1,320 million) and $80 million (2016: $61 million) as non-current borrowings. 
Non-current inventory
$369 million (2016: $564 million) of inventories valued at lower of cost or net realisable value are not expected to be utilised or sold 
within 12 months and are therefore classified as non-current inventory.

3 Includes $717 million (2016: $2,181 million) of cash collateral payments under margin arrangements related to cross currency swaps held to hedge non-U.S. dollar 
denominated bonds.
The average credit period on sales of goods is 20 days (2016: 25 days). The carrying value of trade receivables approximates fair value.
As at 31 December 2017, 7% (2016: 7%) of receivables were between 1 to  60 days overdue, and 4% (2016: 4%) were greater than 
60 days overdue. Such receivables, although contractually past their due dates, are not considered impaired as there has not been  
a significant change in credit quality of the relevant counterparty, and the amounts are still considered recoverable taking into 
account customary payment patterns and in many cases, offsetting accounts payable balances.

On 29 December 2017, Glencore completed the sale of a 51% interest in HG Storage International Ltd (HG Storage), a group 
comprising the majority of Glencore’s petroleum products storage and logistics businesses to HNA Innovation Finance Group Co Ltd 
(HNA) (see note 24). Glencore and HNA also entered into a second agreement pursuant to which three of the original transaction 
assets located in the USA (HG Storage U.S.) will be sold to HG Storage in 2018 for proceeds of $196 million, subject to receipt 
of customary regulatory approvals.
In 2017, Glencore entered into an agreement to sell Tahmoor, a coal mining operation in New South Wales, as well as its manganese 
plants located in France and Norway, with both transactions grouped under “other” in the table below. The transactions, subject 
to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, are expected to complete during the first half of 2018. At the date of this 
report, the sale of the manganese plants had closed.
As a result, assets of $432 million and liabilities of $159 million have been classified as held for sale within the Metals and minerals  
and Energy segments as detailed below:

Deferred Bonus Plan
Under the Glencore Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP), the payment of a portion of a participant’s annual bonus is deferred for a period of 
one to two years as an award of either ordinary shares (a ‘‘Bonus Share Award’’) or cash (a “Bonus Cash Award”). The awards are vested 
at grant date with no further service conditions, however they are subject to forfeiture for malus events. The Bonus Share Awards may 
be satisfied, at Glencore’s option, in shares by the issue of new ordinary shares, by the transfer of ordinary shares held in treasury or by 
the transfer of ordinary shares purchased in the market or in cash, with a value equal to the market value of the award at settlement, 
including distributions paid between award and settling. Glencore currently intends to settle these awards in shares. The associated 
expense is recorded in the statement of income/loss as part of the expense for performance bonuses.
Performance Share Plan
Under the Glencore Performance Share Plan (PSP), participants are awarded PSP awards which vest in annual tranches over 
a specified period, subject to continued employment and forfeiture for malus events. At grant date, each PSP award is equivalent 
to one ordinary share of Glencore. The awards vest in three or five equal tranches on 30 June, 31 December or 31 January of the  
years following the year of grant, as may be the case. The fair value of the awards is determined by reference to the market price of 
Glencore’s ordinary shares at grant date. The PSP awards may be satisfied, at Glencore’s option, in shares by the issue of new ordinary 
shares, by the transfer of ordinary shares held in treasury or by the transfer of ordinary shares purchased in the market or in cash, with 
a value equal to the market value of the award at vesting, including distributions paid between award and vesting. Glencore currently 
intends to settle these awards in shares.

Committed syndicated revolving credit facilities
In May 2017, Glencore signed new one-year revolving credit facilities for a total amount of $7,335 million, refinancing the 
$7,700 million one-year revolving facilities signed in February 2016. Funds drawn under the facilities bear interest at US$LIBOR  
plus a margin of 40 basis points. Glencore also voluntarily reduced the medium term facility size from $6,800 million to  
$5,425 million and extended its maturity by 24 months to 2022.
As at 31 December 2017, the active facilities comprise:
• a $7,335 million one year revolving credit facility with a 12 month borrower’s term-out option (to May 2019) and 12 month extension 
option; and
• a $5,425 million medium-term revolving credit facility (to May 2022)

Unfavourable contracts
In previous business combinations, Glencore recognised liabilities related to various assumed contractual agreements to deliver 
tonnes of coal and zinc concentrates over periods ending between 2018 and 2034 at fixed prices lower than the prevailing market 
prices on the respective acquisition dates.
These amounts are released to revenue as the underlying commodities are delivered to the buyers over the life of the contracts 
at rates consistent with the implied forward price curves at the time of the acquisitions.
Prepayments
In November 2017, Glencore entered into a silver supply arrangement in exchange for an upfront advance payment of 
$675 million. Under the terms of the arrangement, Glencore is required to deliver an average of 19 million ounces of silver per 
annum, over a 3 year period. The arrangement has been accounted for as an executory contract whereby the advance payment 
has been recorded as deferred revenue. The revenue from the advance payment is being recognised as the silver is delivered 
consistent with the implied forward price curve at the time of the transaction. An accretion expense, representing the time  
value of the upfront deposit on the deferred revenue balance, is also being recognised. 
In 2015 and 2016, Glencore entered into various long-term streaming agreements for the future delivery of gold and/or silver 
produced over the life of mine from our Antamina, Antapaccay and Ernest Henry operations in exchange for an upfront 
prepayment and, for Antamina and Antapaccay, an ongoing amount equal to 20% of the spot silver and gold price. Once certain 
delivery thresholds have been met at Antapaccay, the ongoing cash payment increases to 30% of the spot gold and silver prices. 
The arrangements have been accounted for as executory contracts whereby the advance payments have been recorded as 
deferred revenue. The revenue from the advance payments is being recognised as the gold and/or silver is delivered at an 
amount consistent with the implied forward price curve at the time of the transaction along with ongoing cash payments,  
if any. An accretion expense, representing the time value of the upfront deposit on the deferred revenue balance, is also  
being recognised.

2 See note 14.
Post-retirement employee benefits
The provision for post-retirement employee benefits includes pension plan liabilities of $392 million (2016: $428 million) and  
post-retirement medical plan liabilities of $455 million (2016: $432 million), see note 22.
Other employee entitlements
The employee entitlement provision represents the value of governed employee entitlements due to employees upon their 
termination of employment. The associated expenditure will occur in a pattern consistent with when employees choose to exercise 
their entitlements.
Rehabilitation costs
Rehabilitation provision represents the accrued cost required to provide adequate restoration and rehabilitation upon the 
completion of production activities. These amounts will be settled when rehabilitation is undertaken, generally at the end of a 
project’s life, which ranges from two to in excess of 50 years with an average for all sites, weighted by closure provision, of some 
21 years (2016: 16 years). As at 31 December 2017, the discount rate applied in calculating the restoration and rehabilitation provision 
is a pre-tax risk free rate specific to the liability and the currency in which they are denominated as follows: US dollar (2.0%), 
South African rand (4.0%), Australian dollar (3.0%), Canadian dollar (2.5%) and Chilean peso (3.0%). Decreasing the discount rates  
used by 0.5% would result in an increase in the overall rehabilitation provision by $326 million, with a resulting equal movement in 
property, plant and equipment. In the following year, the depreciation expense would increase by some $15 million, with an opposite 
direction interest expense adjustment of $10 million. The resulting net impact in the statement of income would be a decrease  
of $5 million, eventually netting to $Nil over the weighted average settlement date of the provision. 
As outlined in note 1, significant estimates are required in determining the rehabilitation provisions and during the year, certain cost 
and timing estimates that were previously incorporated into the discount rate are now incorporated into the underlying rehabilitation 
cash flow forecasts. As a result of these changes in estimates, the rehabilitation provision increased by $312 million, with a resulting 
equivalent increase in property, plant and equipment.

168
Glencore Annual Report 2017 Onerous contracts
Onerous contracts represent liabilities related to contractual take or pay commitments for securing coal logistics capacity at fixed 
prices and quantities higher than the acquisition date forecasted usage and prevailing market price. The provision is released to costs 
of goods sold as the underlying commitments are incurred.
Other
Other comprises provisions for possible demurrage, mine concession, tax and construction related claims.
Tax disputes
Glencore assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years open to audit based upon the latest information available. Inherent 
uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to complexities of interpretation and changes in tax laws. For those matters 
where it is probable that an adjustment will be made, the Group records its best estimate of these tax liabilities, including related 
interest charges. The current open tax matters are spread across numerous jurisdictions and consist primarily of legacy transfer 
pricing matters that have been open for a number of years and may take several more years to resolve. Reasonably possible adverse 
outcomes are not considered to be individually material. Accordingly, management does not anticipate a significant risk of material 
change in estimates within the next financial year.
22. Personnel costs and employee benefits
Total personnel costs, which include salaries, wages, social security, other personnel costs and share-based payments, incurred  
for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, were $4,656 million and $4,245 million, respectively. Personnel costs related to 
consolidated industrial subsidiaries of $3,593 million (2016: $3,355 million) are included in cost of goods sold. Other personnel costs, 
including the deferred bonus and performance share plans, are included in selling and administrative expenses. 
The Company and certain subsidiaries sponsor various pension schemes in accordance with local regulations and practices.  
Eligibility for participation in the various plans is either based on completion of a specified period of continuous service, or date  
of hire. Among these schemes are defined contribution plans as well as defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans
Glencore’s contributions under these plans amounted to $133 million in 2017 (2016: $1 18 million).
Post-retirement medical plans
The Company participates in a number of post-retirement medical plans, principally in Canada, which provide coverage for 
prescription drugs, medical, dental, hospital and life insurance to eligible retirees. Almost all of the post-retirement medical plans  
in the Group are unfunded.
Defined benefit pension plans
The Company operates defined benefit plans in various countries, the main locations being Canada, Switzerland, UK and the U.S.. 
Approximately 72% of the present value of obligations accrued to date relates to the defined benefit plans in Canada, which are 
pension plans that provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. Contributions to the 
Canadian plans are made to meet or exceed minimum funding requirements based on provincial statutory requirements and 
associated federal taxation rules.
The majority of benefit payments are from trustee-administered funds; however, there are also a number of unfunded plans where 
Glencore meets the benefit payments as they fall due. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practices in 
each country. Responsibility for governance of the plans – overseeing all aspects of the plans including investment decisions and 
contribution schedules – lies with Glencore. Glencore has set up committees to assist in the management of the plans and has  
also appointed experienced, independent professional experts such as investment managers, actuaries, custodians, and trustees.

The actual return on plan assets in respect of defined benefit pension plans amounted to a gain of $426 million (2016: $206 million), 
comprising interest income and the remeasurement of plan assets.
During the next financial year, the Group expects to make a contribution of $105 million to the defined benefit pension and post-
retirement medical plans across all countries, including current service costs and contributions required by pension legislation. 
Contributions over the next five years for the Canadian plans only, based on the most recently filed actuarial reports, approximate 
$337 million. Future funding requirements and contributions are reviewed and adjusted on an annual basis.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 The fair value of plan assets includes none of Glencore’s own financial instruments and no property occupied by or other assets  
used by Glencore. For many of the plans, representing a large portion of the global plan assets, asset-liability matching strategies are 
in place, where the fixed-income assets are invested broadly in alignment with the duration of the plan liabilities, and the proportion 
allocated to fixed-income assets is raised when the plan funding level increases. The asset mix for each plan reflects the nature, 
expected changes in, and size of the liabilities and the assessment of long-term economic conditions, market risk, expected 
investment returns as considered during a formal asset mix study, including sensitivity analysis and/or scenario analysis, conducted 
periodically for the plans.
Through its defined benefit plans, Glencore is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets 
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The funded plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to 
outperform bonds in the long term while contributing volatility and risk in the short term. Glencore believes that due to the long-
term nature of the plan liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of Glencore’s long-term strategy 
to manage the plans efficiently.
Change in bond yields: A decrease in bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in 
the value of the plans’ bond holdings.
Inflation risk: Some of the plans’ benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities,  
although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation. 
Life expectancy: The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liability.
Salary increases: Some of the plans’ benefit obligations related to active members are linked to their salaries. Higher salary increases 
will therefore tend to lead to higher plan liabilities.
The principal weighted-average actuarial assumptions used were as follows:
Post-retirement medical plans Defined benefit pension plans
2017 2016 2017 2016
Discount rate 3.8% 4.1% 3.2% 3.5%
Future salary increases – – 2.7% 2.8%
Future pension increases – – 0.3% 0.3%
Ultimate medical cost trend rate 4.3% 4.2% – –
Mortality assumptions are based on the latest available standard mortality tables for the individual countries concerned.  
As at 31 December 2017, these tables imply expected future life expectancy, for employees aged 65, 19 to 24 years for males  
(2016: 19 to 24) and 23 to 25 years for females (2016: 22 to 25). The assumptions for each country are reviewed regularly and are 
adjusted where necessary to reflect changes in fund experience and actuarial recommendations.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in principal assumptions as at 31 December 2017 is set out below, 
assuming that all other assumptions are held constant and the effect of interrelationships is excluded.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Volcan
On 9 November 2017, Glencore completed a tender offer, acquiring an additional 42.3% of the Class A common (voting) shares in 
Volcan, a Peruvian zinc mining business listed on the Lima stock exchange, for a consideration of $734 million, thereby increasing its 
voting shares interest from 20.7% to 63.0%. Glencore’s total economic interest (including the class B common (non-voting) shares and 
excluding treasury shares) increased from 7.7% to 23.3%. As Glencore holds the majority of the voting shares, providing it the ability  
to appoint a controlling number of directors to the board, Glencore is required to account for Volcan using the full consolidation 
method in accordance with IFRS 10.
The fair values are provisional due to the complexity of the valuation process and the proximity of the transaction to year end.  
The finalisation of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities will be completed within 12 months of the acquisition. It is 
expected that adjustments could be made to the allocation of value between fixed asset classes, deferred taxes, rehabilitation  
and other provisions.
If the acquisition had taken place effective 1 January 2017, the operation would have contributed additional revenue of $696 million 
and additional attributable income of $93 million. From the date of acquisition, the operation contributed $160 million of revenue 
and $Nil of attributable income. 
2016 Acquisitions
In 2016, Glencore acquired controlling interests in Newlands Collinsville Abbot Point Joint Venture (NCA). The net cash received in the

NCA
In September 2016, Glencore completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% interest in NCA, for cash consideration received  
of $167 million. This increased Glencore’s ownership from 55% to 100%, providing the ability to exercise control over NCA.
If the acquisition had taken place effective 1 January 2016, the operation would have contributed additional revenue of $173 million 
and an additional attributable loss of $21 million. From the date of acquisition, the operation contributed $72 million and $25 million 
of revenue and attributable income, respectively.
The acquisition accounting for NCA has now been finalised, with no adjustments to the previously reported provisional fair values.

Zinc Africa
On 31 August 2017, Glencore completed the transaction with Trevali Mining Corporation (“Trevali”) a TSX listed zinc company, to sell  
its 80.1% equity interest in Rosh Pinah and its 90.0% equity interest in Perkoa. The aggregate consideration received was $467 million, 
of which $245 million was cash and the remaining balance ($222 million) was 193.4 million shares in Trevali. As a result of the 
transaction, Glencore’s direct ownership in Trevali increased from 4% to 25.6%. 
Glencore is no longer able to unilaterally direct the key strategic, operating and capital decisions of Rosh Pinah and Perkoa and was 
deemed to have disposed of its controlling interest at fair value. The difference to the net carrying value was recognised through the 
statement of income, with Glencore subsequently accounting for its share in Trevali using the equity method in accordance with  
IAS 28 (see note 9).

Glencore Agri
On 6 April 2016, Glencore announced that it had entered into an agreement with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for  
the sale of a 40% equity interest in Glencore Agri and on 9 June 2016, entered into an agreement with British Columbia Investment 
Management Corporation for the sale of a 10% equity interest in Glencore Agri. The aggregate equity consideration for the combined 
50% interest, including the indirect assumption of certain levels of net working capital and debt, amounted to $3.125 billion, payable 
in cash upon closing.
Glencore Agri represents the entire Agricultural products operating segment and was determined to be a discontinued operation 
prior to the close of transaction on 1 December 2016, and has been disclosed as such. Upon closing of the sale, Glencore is no longer 
able to unilaterally direct the key strategic, operating and capital decisions of Glencore Agri and was deemed to have disposed of  
its controlling interest at fair value. The difference to the net carrying value was recognised through the statement of income, with 
Glencore subsequently accounting for its share of the resulting joint venture using the equity method in accordance with IFRS 1 1  
and IAS 28 (see note 9).
The results of Glencore Agri included in the consolidated statement of income until loss of control are detailed below:

EHM
In October 2016, Glencore entered into an agreement with Evolution Mining Limited (Evolution), whereby Glencore received 
$669 million cash in return for a 30% economic interest in the Ernest Henry Mine mining operation (EHM) and an entitlement to 
100% of the gold produced from Glencore’s remaining 70% interest in EHM. The consideration received was allocated between  
the two elements of the transaction (sale of the 30% interest and the 70% gold prepaid streaming arrangement) by estimating  
the fair value of the gold stream by reference to the net present value of the anticipated gold to be delivered over the life of mine 
($471 million) with the residual amount representing the consideration for the 30% interest ($198 million). Also see note 20. As part  
of the transaction, Glencore and Evolution entered into a 70/30 joint venture agreement governing the operations of EHM. As 
Glencore is no longer able to unilaterally direct the key strategic, operating and capital decisions of EHM, it is deemed to have  
lost control of EHM and, together with Evolution, jointly controls it. As the new arrangement is an unincorporated joint venture, 
Glencore derecognised 30% of the identified assets and liabilities of EHM against the proceeds received as noted above.
GRail
In December 2016, Glencore disposed of its New South Wales coal rail haulage business to Genesee & Wyoming for cash 
consideration of $840 million (A$1.1 billion).

Glencore Annual Report 2017 25. Financial and capital risk management 
Financial risks arising in the normal course of business from Glencore’s operations comprise market risk (including commodity price 
risk, interest rate risk and currency risk), credit risk (including performance risk) and liquidity risk. It is Glencore’s policy and practice  
to identify and, where appropriate and practical, actively manage such risks (for management of “margin” risk within Glencore’s 
extensive and diversified industrial portfolio, refer net present value at risk below) to support its objectives in managing its capital  
and future financial security and flexibility. Glencore’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of 
financial markets and seeks to protect its financial security and flexibility by using derivative financial instruments where possible  
to substantially hedge these financial risks. Glencore’s finance and risk professionals, working in coordination with the commodity 
departments, monitor, manage and report regularly to senior management and the Board of Directors on the approach and 
effectiveness in managing financial risks along with the financial exposures facing the Group.
Glencore’s objectives in managing its “capital attributable to equity holders” include preserving its overall financial health and 
strength for the benefit of all stakeholders, maintaining an optimal capital structure in order to provide a high degree of financial 
flexibility at an attractive cost of capital and safeguarding its ability to continue as a going concern, while generating sustainable 
long-term profitability. Central to meeting these objectives is maintaining an investment grade credit rating status. Glencore’s  
current credit ratings are Baa2 (stable) from Moody’s and BBB (positive outlook) from S&P.
Distribution policy and other capital management initiatives
Glencore’s cash distribution policy comprises two components: (1) a fixed $1 billion component and (2) a variable element 
representing a minimum 25% of free cash flow generated by our industrial assets during the year. The actual variable distribution 
component (minimum 25% pay-out guidance) will reflect prevailing balance sheet position, market conditions and outlook and be 
confirmed annually in respect of prior period’s cash flows. Distributions are expected to be formally declared by the Board annually 
(with the preliminary full-year results). Distributions, when declared, will be settled equally in May and September of the year they are 
declared in. In addition, alongside our half-year results reporting, the Board could formally declare an additional distribution to be 
included with the distribution confirmed with respect to the prior year. Notwithstanding that the distribution is declared and paid  
in U.S. dollars, shareholders will be able to elect to receive their distribution payments in Pounds Sterling, Euros or Swiss Francs  
based on the exchange rates in effect around the date of payment. Shareholders on the JSE will receive their distributions in  
South African Rand.
Commodity price risk
Glencore is exposed to price movements for the inventory it holds and the products it produces which are not held to meet priced 
forward contract obligations and forward priced purchase or sale contracts. Glencore manages a significant portion of this exposure 
through futures and options transactions on worldwide commodity exchanges or in over the counter (OTC) markets, to the extent 
available. Commodity price risk management activities are considered an integral part of Glencore’s physical commodity marketing 
activities and the related assets and liabilities are included in other financial assets from and other financial liabilities to derivative 
counterparties, including clearing brokers and exchanges. Whilst it is Glencore’s policy to substantially hedge its commodity price 
risks, there remains the possibility that the hedging instruments chosen may not always provide effective mitigation of the 
underlying price risk. The hedging instruments available to the marketing businesses may differ in specific characteristics to the  
risk exposure to be hedged, resulting in an ongoing and unavoidable basis risk exposure. Residual basis risk exposures represent  
a key focus point for Glencore’s commodity department teams who actively engage in the management of such.
Value at risk
One of the tools used by Glencore to monitor and limit its primary market risk exposure, principally commodity price risk related  
to its physical marketing activities, is of a value at risk (VaR) computation. VaR is a risk measurement technique which estimates a 
threshold for potential loss that could occur on risk positions as a result of movements in risk factors over a specified time horizon, 
given a specific level of confidence and based on a specific price history. The VaR methodology is a statistically defined, probability-
based approach that takes into account market volatilities, as well as risk diversification by recognising offsetting positions and 
correlations between commodities and markets. In this way, risks can be measured consistently across markets and commodities 
and risk measures can be aggregated to derive a single risk value. Glencore’s Board has set an unchanged consolidated VaR limit 
(one day 95% confidence level) of $100 million representing less than 0.5% of total equity, which the Board reviews annually.  
There were no breaches of this limit during the year. 
Glencore uses a VaR approach based on Monte Carlo simulations computed at a 95% confidence level and utilising a weighted data 
history for a one-day time horizon.
Position sheets are regularly distributed and monitored and daily Monte Carlo simulations are applied to the various business groups’ 
net marketing positions to determine potential losses.

VaR does not purport to represent actual gains or losses in fair value on earnings to be incurred by Glencore, nor does Glencore claim 
that these VaR results are indicative of future market movements or representative of any actual impact on its future results. VaR 
should always be viewed in the context of its limitations; notably, the use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future events, 
market illiquidity risks and tail risks. Glencore recognises these limitations, and thus complements and continuously refines its VaR 
analysis by analysing forward looking stress scenarios, benchmarking against an alternative VaR computation based on historical 
simulations and back testing calculated VaR against the hypothetical portfolio returns arising in the next business day.
Glencore’s VaR computation currently covers its business in the key base metals (including aluminium, nickel, zinc, copper and lead), 
coal, iron ore and oil/natural gas and assesses the open priced positions which are subject to price risk, including inventories of these 
commodities. Due to the lack of a liquid terminal market, Glencore does not include a VaR calculation for products such as alumina, 
molybdenum, cobalt, freight and some risk associated with concentrates as it does not consider the nature of these markets to be 
suited to this type of analysis. Alternative measures are used to monitor exposures related to these products.
Net present value at risk
Glencore’s future cash flows related to its forecast energy and metals and minerals’ production activities are also exposed to 
commodity price movements. Glencore manages this exposure through a combination of portfolio diversification, occasional 
shorter-term hedging via futures and options transactions, insurance products and continuous internal monitoring, reporting  
and quantification of the underlying operations’ estimated cash flows and valuations.
Interest rate risk
Glencore is exposed to various risks associated with the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates on its 
assets and liabilities and cash flows. Matching of assets and liabilities is utilised as the dominant method to hedge interest rate risks; 
other methods include the use of interest rate swaps and similar derivative instruments. Floating rate debt which is predominantly 
used to fund fast turning working capital (interest is internally charged on the funding of this working capital) is primarily based on 
US$ LIBOR plus an appropriate premium. Accordingly, prevailing market interest rates are continuously factored into transactional 
pricing and terms.
Assuming the amount of floating rate liabilities at the reporting period end were outstanding for the whole year, interest rates  
were 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables held constant, Glencore’s income and equity for the year ended 
31 December 2017 would decrease/increase by $1 10 million (2016: $100 million).
Currency risk
The U.S. dollar is the predominant functional currency of the Group. Currency risk is the risk of loss from movements in exchange 
rates related to transactions and balances in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such transactions include operating expenditure, 
capital expenditure and to a lesser extent purchases and sales in currencies other than the functional currency. Purchases or sales  
of commodities concluded in currencies other than the functional currency, apart from certain limited domestic sales at industrial 
operations which act as a hedge against local operating costs, are ordinarily hedged through forward exchange contracts. 
Consequently, foreign exchange movements against the U.S. dollar on recognised transactions would have an immaterial financial 
impact. Glencore enters into currency hedging transactions with leading financial institutions.
Glencore’s debt related payments (both principal and interest) are primarily denominated in or swapped using hedging instruments 
into U.S. dollars. Glencore’s operating expenses, being a small portion of its revenue base, are incurred in a mix of currencies of which 
the U.S. dollar, Swiss Franc, Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Euro, Kazakhstan Tenge, Colombian Peso and South 
African Rand are the predominant currencies.
Glencore has issued Euro, Swiss Franc, Sterling, Yen and Australian dollar denominated bonds (see note 19). Cross currency swaps 
were concluded to hedge the currency risk on the principal and related interest payments of these bonds. These contracts were 
designated as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency risks associated with the bonds. The fair value of these derivatives is

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties may not be able to settle obligations due to Glencore within their agreed 
payment terms. Financial assets which potentially expose Glencore to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, 
receivables and advances, derivative instruments and non-current advances and loans. Glencore’s credit management process 
includes the assessment, monitoring and reporting of counterparty exposure on a regular basis. Glencore’s cash and cash equivalents 
are placed overnight with a diverse group of highly credit rated financial institutions. Credit risk with respect to receivables and 
advances is mitigated by the large number of customers comprising Glencore’s customer base, their diversity across various 
industries and geographical areas, as well as Glencore’s policy to mitigate these risks through letters of credit, netting, collateral and 
insurance arrangements where appropriate. Additionally, it is Glencore’s policy that transactions and activities in trade related 
financial instruments be concluded under master netting agreements or long form confirmations to enable offsetting of balances 
due to/from a common counterparty in the event of default by the counterparty. Glencore actively and continuously monitors the 
credit quality of its counterparties through internal reviews and a credit scoring process, which includes, where available, public  
credit ratings. Balances with counterparties not having a public investment grade or equivalent internal rating are typically enhanced 
to investment grade through the extensive use of credit enhancement products, such as letters of credit or insurance products. 
Glencore has a diverse customer base, with no customer representing more than 3.3% (2016: 2.9%) of its trade receivables  
(on a gross basis taking into account credit enhancements) or accounting for more than 3.5% of its revenues over the year ended 
31 December 2017 (2016: 3.9%).
The maximum exposure to credit risk (including performance risk – see below), without considering netting agreements or without 
taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying amount of Glencore’s financial assets 
(see note 26).
Performance risk
Performance risk (part of the broader credit risk subject matter, discussed above) is inherent in contracts, with agreements in the 
future, to physically purchase or sell commodities with fixed price attributes, and arises from the possibility that counterparties may 
not be willing or able to meet their future contractual physical sale or purchase obligations to/from Glencore. Glencore undertakes 
the assessment, monitoring and reporting of performance risk within its overall credit management process. Glencore’s market 
breadth, diversified supplier and customer base as well as the standard pricing mechanism in the vast majority of Glencore’s 
commodity portfolio which does not fix prices beyond three months, with the main exception being coal, where longer-term  
fixed price contracts are common, ensure that performance risk is adequately mitigated. The commodity industry has trended 
towards shorter term fixed price contract periods, in part to mitigate against such potential performance risk, but also due to the 
continuous development of transparent and liquid spot commodity markets, with their associated derivative products and indexes.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that Glencore is unable to meet its payment obligations when due, or that it is unable, on an ongoing basis,  
to borrow funds in the market on an unsecured or secured basis at an acceptable price to fund actual or proposed commitments. 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and availability of adequate committed 
funding facilities. Glencore has set itself an internal minimum liquidity target to maintain at all times, including via available 
committed undrawn credit facilities of $3 billion (2016: $3 billion), which has purposely been substantially exceeded in recent years, 
accounting for the more volatile market backdrop. Glencore’s credit profile, diversified funding sources and committed credit 
facilities, ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its liquidity requirements. As part of its liquidity management, 
Glencore closely monitors and plans for its future capital expenditure and proposed investments, as well as credit facility refinancing/
extension requirements, well ahead of time.

26. Financial instruments
Fair value of financial instruments
The following tables present the carrying values and fair values of Glencore’s financial instruments. Fair value is the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (most advantageous) market at the 
measurement date under current market conditions. Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. When 
market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing market interest and 
exchange rates. The estimated fair values have been determined using market information and appropriate valuation methodologies, 
but are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that Glencore could realise in the normal course of business.
The financial assets and liabilities are presented by class in the tables below at their carrying values, which generally approximate the 
fair values with the exception of $33,934 million (2016: $33,218 million) of borrowings, the fair value of which at 31 December 2017 
was $34,776 million (2016: $33,673 million) based on observable market prices applied to the borrowing portfolio (a Level 2 fair value 
measurement).

Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
In accordance with IAS 32 the Group reports financial assets and liabilities on a net basis in the consolidated statement of financial 
position only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or 
to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master 
netting and similar agreements as at 31 December 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting or similar arrangements above, each agreement between 
the Group and the counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle on  
a net basis. In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities may be settled on a gross basis, however, each party to 
the master netting or similar agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the 
other party. Per the terms of each agreement, an event of default includes failure by a party to make payment when due, failure by  
a party to perform any obligation required by the agreement (other than payment) if such failure is not remedied within periods  
of 30 to 60 days after notice of such failure is given to the party or bankruptcy.

Additional  
Information 27. Fair value measurements
Fair values are primarily determined using quoted market prices or standard pricing models using observable market inputs where 
available and are presented to reflect the expected gross future cash in/outflows. Glencore classifies the fair values of its financial 
instruments into a three level hierarchy based on the degree of the source and observability of the inputs that are used to derive  
the fair value of the financial asset or liability as follows:
Level 1   Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that Glencore can assess at the 
measurement date, or
Level 2   Inputs other than quoted inputs included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or 
indirectly, or
Level 3  Unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities, requiring Glencore to make market-based assumptions
Level 1 classifications primarily include futures with a tenor of less than one year and options that are exchange traded, whereas Level 
2 classifications primarily include futures with a tenor greater than one year, over the counter options, swaps and physical forward 
transactions which derive their fair value primarily from exchange quotes and readily observable broker quotes. Level 3 classifications 
primarily include physical forward transactions which derive their fair value predominantly from models that use broker quotes and 
applicable market-based estimates surrounding location, quality and credit differentials and financial liabilities linked to the fair value 
of certain mining operations. In circumstances where Glencore cannot verify fair value with observable market inputs (Level 3 fair 
values), it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.
It is Glencore’s policy that transactions and activities in trade related financial instruments be concluded under master netting 
agreements or long form confirmations to enable balances due to/from a common counterparty to be offset in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy by the counterparty.
The following tables show the fair values of the derivative financial instruments including trade related financial and physical forward 
purchase and sale commitments by type of contract and non-current other financial liabilities as at 31 December 2017 and 2016. 
Other assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis are marketing inventories, other investments,  
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Refer to notes 1 1 and 26 for disclosures in connection with these fair value 
measurements. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.

Liabilities (513) (403)
Valuation techniques: Discounted cash flow model
Significant observable inputs: – Forecast commodity prices;
–  Discount rates using weighted average cost of 
capital methodology;
– Production models;
– Operating costs; and
– Capital expenditures.
The resultant liability is essentially a discounted cash flow valuation of the underlying mining 
operation. Increases/decreases in forecast commodity prices will result in an increase/decrease 
to the value of the liability though this will be partially offset by associated increases/decreases 
in the assumed production levels, operating costs and capital expenditures which are inherently 
linked to forecast commodity prices. The valuation remains sensitive to price and a 10% increase/
decrease in commodity price assumptions would result in an $1 15 million adjustment to the 
current carrying value.

29. Future commitments
Capital expenditure for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment is generally funded through the cash flow generated  
by the respective industrial entities. As at 31 December 2017, $987 million (2016: $776 million), of which 93% (2016: 81%) relates to 
expenditure to be incurred over the next year, was contractually committed for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.
Certain of Glencore’s exploration tenements and licences require it to spend a minimum amount per year on development activities, 
a significant portion of which would have been incurred in the ordinary course of operations. As at 31 December 2017, $139 million 
(2016: $177 million) of such development expenditures are to be incurred, of which 36% (2016: 20%) are for commitments to be 
settled over the next year.
Glencore procures seagoing vessels/chartering services to meet its overall marketing objectives and commitments. As at 
31 December 2017, Glencore has committed to future hire costs to meet future physical delivery and sale obligations and 
expectations of $247 million (2016: $217 million), of which $76 million (2016: $105 million) are with associated companies.  
72% (2016: 46%) of the total charters are for services to be received over the next two years.
As part of Glencore’s ordinary sourcing and procurement of physical commodities and other ordinary marketing obligations, the 
selling party may request that a financial institution act as either a) the paying party upon the delivery of product and qualifying 
documents through the issuance of a letter of credit or b) the guarantor by way of issuing a bank guarantee accepting responsibility 
for Glencore’s contractual obligations. Similarly, Glencore is required to post rehabilitation and pension guarantees in respect of  
some of these future, primarily industrial, long-term obligations. As at 31 December 2017, $17,578 million (2016: $17,358 million) of 
procurement and $3,615 million (2016: $2,972 million) of rehabilitation and pension commitments have been issued on behalf of 
Glencore, which will generally be settled simultaneously with the payment for such commodity and rehabilitation and pension 
obligations.
Glencore has entered into various operating leases mainly as lessee for office and warehouse/storage facilities. Rental expenses for 
these leases totalled respectively $173 million and $157 million for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016. Future net 
minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Future development and related commitments
Acquisition of HVO
On 27 July 2017, Glencore and Yancoal signed agreements relating to the acquisition of a 49% interest in the Hunter Valley 
Operations (HVO) coal mine in New South Wales, Australia following Yancoal’s acquisition of Coal & Allied (C&A) from Rio Tinto.  
Under the terms of the agreements, Glencore will pay cash consideration of $1,139 million (effective 1 September 2017) plus a 27.9% 
share of $240 million non-contingent royalties over five years and 49% of price contingent royalties payable by Yancoal to Rio Tinto  
on production from HVO in respect of the C&A acquisition. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is 
expected to close in H1 2018.
Acquisition of Chevron South Africa and Botswana
On 6 October 2017, Glencore entered into an agreement with Off the Shelf Investments Fifty Six (RF) Proprietary Limited (OTS)  
to acquire from OTS (i) a 75% stake in Chevron South Africa Proprietary Limited (Chevron SA) and certain related interests and  
(ii) the entire issued share capital of Chevron Botswana Proprietary Limited (Chevron Botswana) following closing of OTS’s exercise  
of its pre-emptive right to acquire these operations from the Chevron group. The aggregate consideration (subject to adjustment  
for debt and working capital) is $973 million. The transaction is conditional on the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals  
by OTS and Glencore and is expected to close in mid-2018. 
30. Contingent liabilities
The amount of corporate guarantees in favour of third parties as at 31 December 2017 was $Nil (2016: $Nil). Also see note 9.
The Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business as detailed below. These contingent liabilities  
are reviewed on a regular basis and where practical an estimate is made of the potential financial impact on the Group. As at 
31 December 2017 and 2016 it was not practical to make such an assessment.
Litigation
Certain legal actions, other claims and unresolved disputes are pending against Glencore. Whilst Glencore cannot predict the results 
of any litigation, it believes that it has meritorious defences against those actions or claims. Glencore believes the likelihood of any 
material liability arising from these claims to be remote and that the liability, if any, therefore resulting from any litigation will not  
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated income, financial position or cash flows.
Environmental contingencies
Glencore’s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. Glencore is in material compliance with those laws 
and regulations. Glencore accrues for environmental contingencies when such contingencies are probable and reasonably estimable. 
Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs 
from insurance companies and other parties are recorded as assets when the recoveries are virtually certain. At this time, Glencore is 
unaware of any material environmental incidents at its locations. Any potential liability arising from these allegations is not expected 
to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated income, financial position or cash flows.
Margin Call Guarantee
As part of the partnership with Qatar Investment Authority (see note 9) and in relation to the joint venture’s (QHG) ownership of 
Rosneft shares, Glencore provided a margin guarantee up to EUR1.4 billion. The margin guarantee is subject to various loan to value 
thresholds related to the financing provided to QHG. Appropriate Russian banks have in turn provided Glencore with a guarantee 
which can and will be called upon in the event of drawdown under Glencore’s margin guarantee facility with QHG. As at 
31 December 2017, $Nil has been called under the QHG margin guarantee. 
In September 2017, QHG concluded an agreement with CEFC China Energy Company Limited to dispose of the majority of the 
shares it held (amounting to a 14.16% stake in Rosneft). Following completion of the transaction, the margin guarantees provided by 
Glencore will terminate. The transaction, subject to customary regulatory approval processes, is expected to complete in H1 2018.
31. Related party transactions
In the normal course of business, Glencore enters into various arm’s length transactions with related parties, including fixed price 
commitments to sell and to purchase commodities, forward sale and purchase contracts, agency agreements and management 
service agreements. Outstanding balances at period end are unsecured and settlement occurs in cash (see notes 10, 12, and 23). 
There have been no guarantees provided or received for any related party receivables or payables.
All transactions between Glencore and its subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation along with any unrealised profits and losses 
between its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. In 2017, sales and purchases with associates and joint ventures amounted to 
$1,859 million (2016: $1,570 million) and $7,485 million (2016: $3,194 million) respectively. 
Remuneration of key management personnel
Glencore’s key management personnel are the members of the Board of Directors, CEO, CFO and the heads of the operating 
segments. The remuneration of Directors and other members of key management personnel recognised in the consolidated 
statement of income including salaries and other current employee benefits amounted to $22 million (2016: $13 million). There were 
no other long-term benefits or share-based payments to key management personnel (2016: $Nil). Further details on remuneration 
of Directors are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 101.

Alternative performance measures are denoted by the symbol ◊
When assessing and discussing the Group’s reported financial performance, financial position and cash flows, Glencore makes 
reference to Alternative performance measures (APMs), which are not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS, but  
are derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. The APMs are consistent with how the business 
performance is measured and reported within the internal management reporting to the Board and management and assist 
in providing meaningful analysis of the Group’s results both internally and externally in discussions with the financial analyst and 
investment community.
The Group uses APMs to improve the comparability of information between reporting periods and segments and to aid the 
understanding of the activity taking place across the Group by adjusting for items that are of an infrequent nature and by 
aggregating or disaggregating (notably in the case of relevant material associates and joint ventures accounted for on an equity  
basis) certain IFRS measures. APMs are also used to approximate the underlying operating cash flow generation of the operations 
(Adjusted EBITDA). 
Investments in the extractive industry are typically significant and the initial spend generally occurs over several years, “upfront”,  
prior to the operations generating cash. As a result, the investments are sometimes made with partners and an assessment to 
approximate the operating cash flow generation/pay-back of the investment (Adjusted EBITDA) is required. Against this backdrop, 
the key APMs used by Glencore are Adjusted EBITDA, Net funding/Net debt and the disaggregation of the equivalent key APMs  
of our relevant material associates and joint ventures (“Proportionate adjustment”) to enable a consistent evaluation of the financial 
performance and returns attributable to the Group. 
Adjusted EBITDA is a useful approximation of the operating cash flow generation by eliminating depreciation and amortisation 
adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement and needs to be 
considered in the context of our financial commitments. 
Proportionate adjustments are useful to enable a consistent evaluation of the financial performance and returns available to the 
Group, irrespective of the differing accounting treatments required to account for our minority/joint ownership interests of our 
relevant material investments. 
Net funding is an aggregation of IFRS measures (Borrowings less cash and cash equivalents) and Net debt is Net funding less Readily 
marketable inventories and provides a measure of our financial leverage and, through Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA relationships, 
provides an indication of relative financial strength and flexibility. 
APMs used by Glencore may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. APMs have 
limitations as an analytical tool, and a user of the financial statements should not consider these measures in isolation from,  
or as a substitute for, analysis of the Group’s results of operations; and they may not be indicative of the Group’s historical operating 
results, nor are they meant to be a projection or forecast of its future results.
Listed below are the definitions and reconciliations to the underlying IFRS measures of the various APMs used by the Group.
Proportionate adjustment
For internal reporting and analysis, management evaluates the performance of Antamina copper/zinc mine (34% owned),  
Cerrejón coal mine (33% owned), Collahuasi copper mine (44% owned) and Glencore Agri (50% owned) under the proportionate 
consolidation method reflecting Glencore’s proportionate share of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of these investments. 
See reconciliation of revenue and relevant material associates’ and joint ventures’ Adjusted EBIT to “Share of net income from 
associates and joint ventures” below.

1 In 2016, Energy products segment comprises an impairment of $345 million, net of taxes of $176 million relating to Cerrejón, resulting from reduced near term production 
estimates due to increased risk related to the possibility of delays in sourcing approvals as a result of the continued social and environmental challenges to current 
mine plans.
2 Comprises share in earnings of $164 million (2016: $12 million) from Marketing activities and $994 million (2016: losses of $1 million) from Industrial activities.
Adjusted EBIT/EBITDA
Adjusted EBIT/EBITDA provide insight into our overall business performance (a combination of cost management, seizing market 
opportunities and growth), and are the corresponding flow drivers towards our objective of achieving industry-leading returns.
Adjusted EBIT is the net result of revenue less cost of goods sold and selling and administrative expenses, plus share of income from 
associates and joint ventures, dividend income and the attributable share of Adjusted EBIT of relevant material associates and joint 
ventures, which are accounted for internally by means of proportionate consolidation, excluding Significant items, see definition 
below. In addition, the segment information includes Glencore Agri, which was disclosed as a discontinued operation until close  
of transaction on 1 December 2016, see note 24 of the financial statements.
Adjusted EBITDA consists of Adjusted EBIT plus depreciation and amortisation, including the related Proportionate adjustments.

APMs derived from the statement of financial position
Net funding/Net debt and Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA
Net funding/debt demonstrates how our debt is being managed and is an important factor in ensuring we maintain an investment 
grade rating status and a competitive cost of capital. Net debt is defined as total current and non-current borrowings less cash  
and cash equivalents, readily marketable inventories and related Proportionate adjustments. The net debt assumed in the Volcan 
acquisition (completed mid-November 2017) has also been adjusted to provide a more consistent and comparative analysis, but 
mostly to reflect the Group’s relatively low 23.3% economic ownership (compared to its 63.0% voting interest) in this still fully 
ring-fenced listed entity, with its standalone, independent and separate capital structure. In addition, the relationship of Net debt  
to Adjusted EBITDA provides an indication of financial flexibility. See reconciliation table below.
Readily marketable inventories (RMI)
RMI comprising the core inventories which underpin and facilitate Glencore’s marketing activities, represent inventories, that in 
Glencore’s assessment, are readily convertible into cash in the short term due to their liquid nature, widely available markets and  
the fact that price risk is primarily covered either by a forward physical sale or hedge transaction. Glencore regularly assesses the 
composition of these inventories and their applicability, relevance and availability to the marketing activities. As at 31 December 2017, 
$22,225 million (2016: $17,093 million) of inventories were considered readily marketable. This comprises $16,649 million (2016: 
$12,707 million) of inventories carried at fair value less costs of disposal and $5,576 million (2016: $4,386 million) carried at the lower of 
cost or net realisable value. Total readily marketable inventories includes $1,559 million related to the relevant material associates and 
joint ventures (see note 2) presented under the proportionate consolidation method, comprising $1,305 million of inventory carried  
at fair value less cost of disposal and $254 million carried at lower of cost or net realisable value. Given the highly liquid nature of 
these inventories, which represent a significant share of current assets, the Group believes it is appropriate to consider them together 
with cash equivalents in analysing Group net debt levels and computing certain debt coverage ratios and credit trends.

South American production above excludes Volcan Compania Minera. Owing to the recent timing of the share tender in Q4 2017 (Glencore now has 63% of the voting shares 
and a 23% overall economic interest), management is in preliminary stages of reviewing the operations and the associated reporting framework. Therefore production data 
has been excluded, which currently provides a more consistent comparative analysis. 208

Resources and reserves
The resource and reserve data in the following tables comprise summary extracts of the Glencore Resources and Reserves report 
as at 31 December 2017, as published on the Glencore website on 1 February 2018. The Glencore Resources and Reserves report  
was publicly reported, as appropriate for individual components, in accordance with the 2012 edition of the Australasian Code for 
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code), the 2016 edition of the South African Code for 
Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (SAMREC), the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves (2014 edition) and the Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) for  
reporting of oil and natural gas reserves and resources.
Data is reported as at 31 December 2017, unless otherwise noted. For comparison purposes, data for 2016 has been included.  
Metric units are used throughout, and all data is presented on a 100% asset basis with the exception of Oil assets which are  
shown on a working interest basis. All tonnage information has been rounded to reflect the relative uncertainty in the estimates; 
there may therefore be small differences in the totals.

Important notice regarding compilation of report
Important notice concerning this document including forward 
looking statements 
This document contains statements that are, or may be deemed 
to be, “forward-looking statements” which are prospective in 
nature. These forward-looking statements may be identified  
by the use of forward-looking terminology, or the negative 
thereof such as “outlook”, “plans”, “expects” or “does not expect”, 
“is expected”, “continues”, “assumes”, “is subject to”, “budget”, 
“scheduled”, “estimates”, “aims”, “forecasts”, “risks”, “intends”, 
“positioned”, “predicts”, “anticipates” or “does not anticipate”, or 
“believes”, or variations of such words or comparable terminology 
and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results 
“may”, “could”, “should”, “shall”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, 
occur or be achieved. Such statements are qualified in their 
entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding 
future expectations. Forward-looking statements are not 
based on historical facts, but rather on current predictions, 
expectations, beliefs, opinions, plans, objectives, goals, intentions 
and projections about future events, results of operations, 
prospects, financial condition and discussions of strategy. 
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known  
and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are  
beyond Glencore’s control. Forward looking statements are  
not guarantees of future performance and may and often  
do differ materially from actual results. Important factors that 
could cause these uncertainties include, but are not limited to, 
those discussed in the Principal Risk and Uncertainties section  
on page 42.
Neither Glencore nor any of its associates or directors, officers 
or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee 
that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any 
forward-looking statements in this document will actually  
occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these 
forward-looking statements which only speak as of the date 
of this document. Other than in accordance with its legal  
or regulatory obligations (including under the UK Listing Rules 
and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority and the Rules Governing the Listing of 
Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited and  
the Listing Requirements of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange 
Limited), Glencore is not under any obligation and Glencore  
and its affiliates expressly disclaim any intention, obligation  
or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking 
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events 
or otherwise. This document shall not, under any circumstances, 
create any implication that there has been no change in the 
business or affairs of Glencore since the date of this document 
or that the information contained herein is correct as at any time 
subsequent to its date.
No statement in this document is intended as a profit forecast 
or a profit estimate and no statement in this document should 
be interpreted to mean that earnings per Glencore share for the 
current or future financial years would necessarily match or 
exceed the historical published earnings per Glencore share.

or invitation to sell or issue, or any solicitation of any offer to 
purchase or subscribe for any securities. The making of this
