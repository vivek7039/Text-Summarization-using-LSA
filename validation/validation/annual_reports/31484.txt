Chairman
STRATEGIC REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION 
I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to address Informa 
Shareholders, as the Group comes to the end of a year  
of operational progress and improved performance that 
included the integration of Penton Information Services,  
as well as the successful completion of our programme of 
measured change and improved performance, the 2014-2017 
Growth Acceleration Plan (GAP). 
COMPLETION OF GROWTH ACCELERATION PLAN
In 2017 , Informa delivered a fourth consecutive year of growth  
in revenue, adjusted earnings, cash flow and dividends. The year 
also saw the Group fulfil its ambition to return all four Operating 
Divisions to positive underlying revenue growth. 
These results are built on the foundations of the previous four 
years, and the measures taken under GAP to increase the 
Group’s focus on customers and vertical industries, build market 
positions and strengthen overall operational capabilities. 
This started with talent and experience, including appointing  
new Divisional CEOs and a dedicated CTO in each Division.  
It continued through proactive portfolio management, exiting 
businesses and markets that were not core or where we were 
sub-scale, and expanding in geographies and verticals where the 
growth opportunities were most attractive, particularly in the US. 
INVESTMENT, EXPANSION AND THE INTEGRATION 
OF PENTON INFORMATION SERVICES
Significant capital has also been invested inside and outside the 
Group. Internally, this has included around £80m on improving 
systems and technology capabilities, enhancing customer 
platforms and supporting innovation to bring new products to life. 
Externally, the Group has pursued a targeted and disciplined 
acquisition strategy, building scale in the US and a leading 
position in B2B events, most significantly through adding Penton 
in late 2016. The effective integration of Penton has been a major 
focus for management in 2017 to ensure the Group makes the 
most of future opportunities created by the combination.
REACH AND DEPTH IN INTERNATIONAL VERTICALS 
Through these measures and more, the Group has positioned 
itself to take advantage of growth in its end markets. Within the 
broad and global market for knowledge and information, Informa 
has chosen to focus on verticals that are international, with high 
levels of growth, innovation or development, where supply chains 
tend to be fragmented and where specialist intelligence and the 
ability to connect with business partners and peers is 
therefore highly valued. Examples of these industry 
verticals can be found throughout this report. 
Informa is an international Group, with an increasing 
weighting to the US, and your Board remains alert to 
economic and regulatory developments in all key jurisdictions in 
which the business operates. Most recently, this has included the 
likely effect of changes to US tax legislation through the 2017 Tax 
Cut and Jobs Act and the potential impact of Britain’s exit from 
the European Union, the latter of which is not considered material 
due to Informa’s relatively low exposure to the region.
DELIVERING PERFORMANCE FOR SHAREHOLDERS
The combination of operational capability and increased 
international reach and depth in vertical markets has delivered  
a steady improvement in Informa’s performance in recent years, 
culminating in underlying revenue growth of more than 3% in 2017 . 
More importantly, it has created a platform for continued growth 
and scale in the future, and your Board firmly believes this Group 
and its management team has the potential for more. 
The approach for 2018 and beyond is led by this ambition, and 
this is why the Directors fully support the Group’s recommended 
offer for UBM plc, formally announced on 30 January 2018, to 
create a leading B2B information services group. 
It is a unique opportunity to combine the strengths of both 
companies, build on the success of Informa’s Growth Acceleration 
Plan and UBM’s Events First strategy, and create an enlarged 
Group with the scale and specialist capabilities to capture this 
market’s long-term growth potential. 
These decisions and actions have been taken with a view to 
creating value for Shareholders and our wider stakeholders.  
From higher growth and greater professional opportunities to  
a continued positive impact on our communities, the ambition is 
to build a robust and high performing business that benefits all.
For Shareholders, this is in part reflected through a commitment 
to dividend returns. In 2014, the initial target was to increase 
dividends by at least 2% per annum. This commitment has 
steadily been increased, reflecting confidence in the Group’s 
improving performance. In 2017 , the Board approved a final 
dividend per share of 13.80p, taking total divdends for the year  
to 20.45p, an increase of 6%.
GOVERNING THE GROUP’S PERFORMANCE  
AND GROWTH 
Your Board will continue to oversee, support and challenge, 
where appropriate, management’s plans for 2018. 
We are pleased to recognise our responsibilities to ensure  
the Group grows and operates in a way that benefits wider 
stakeholders. During 2017 , Informa’s colleagues were a  
particular focus. The Board received the views of colleagues 
through formal feedback channels and first hand, conducting a 
number of enjoyable and insightful town halls in the US and UK. 
It has been a particular pleasure to meet new colleagues and 
businesses who joined through the acquisition of Penton, and 
who have embraced Informa’s culture with enthusiasm. 
Culture remains a matter of regular Board discussion and we fully 
support management’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a 
working environment based on respect and openness, which 
enables all colleagues to fully participate in the life of the Group 
and is an important contributor to the Group’s ongoing success. 
Thanks to all Informa colleagues for their hard work and valuable 
contributions to 2017’s performance, to the management team, 
and to Shareholders for their continued support. 
Derek Mapp
Chairman
27 February 2018
VIEW FROM THE BOARD: THE GROWTH 
ACCELERATION PLAN 
What was the thinking behind GAP?
In 2014, the Board believed Informa had an opportunity 
to do more in its markets. The market for knowledge 
and information was growing but also specialising. 
This meant making some changes to how the Group 
operated, to the portfolio mix and how capital was 
allocated. It meant scaling in some areas and 
streamlining in others, and making additional 
investments. GAP was conceived as a four-year 
programme to improve growth in all the Group’s 
businesses and build a platform for future growth  
and scale.
What changes have you seen? 
The change has been measured, but when you 
compare the Group of 2013 with the Group of today, a 
lot has been achieved in reshaping and strengthening 
the Group. What was a quite fragmented business is 
now organised through four clear Operating Divisions, 
with real focus around customers and end market 
verticals. Operational capabilities and talent have 
been strengthened, particularly in technology, and 
culturally there is greater alignment between the 
Group’s success and individual actions and contributions.
What role has the Board played in GAP? 
The Board has overseen and closely monitored  
the progress of each GAP objective, through  
regular engagement with senior managers from 
across the business, encouraged and supported 
executive management, and provided feedback  
and challenge where required. 
We have also taken the opportunity to bring new 
skills onto the Board over this period as Directors 
have retired, appointing new colleagues with 
particular technology, international and/or FTSE 100 
experience to provide support in areas specifically 
relevant to Informa’s development. 
How does this carry over to 2018 and beyond?
Informa enters 2018 a better business; more robust, 
predictable, with an improved growth trajectory  
and, as intended, a platform for future growth and 
further scale. Informa’s recommended offer for  
UBM builds on this platform, bringing benefits  
of scale and future opportunity. GAP is what has  
made this possible, installing the capabilities to  
help ensure the combination generates value and 
rewards Shareholders long into the future.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
T
his year’s report marks the completion of another 
positive financial period for the Informa Group,  
and the conclusion of the Group’s four-year 
programme of measured change, strengthened 
capabilities and performance improvement through 
the 2014-2017 Growth Acceleration Plan (GAP). 
It is a significant moment for the Group, and a natural time to  
look back at the past four years, as well as to look forward  
to the future possibilities created by GAP. 
This includes the recommended offer made by Informa for  
UBM plc in January 2018 that is currently progressing through 
the necessary approval process: an exciting opportunity to create  
a leading B2B information services group, with all the benefits  
of operating scale and industry specialisation this brings.
In the first instance, I would like to thank Shareholders for their 
support over each of the last four years, as well as the Informa 
Board for its input, direction, encouragement and challenge  
over this period. 
The participation and engagement of all colleagues across  
the Group has been pivotal to GAP and the improving 
performance, and everyone’s considerable contributions, are 
appreciated and hopefully recognised in real time, at all levels.
GROWTH ACCELERATION, GROWTH IMPROVEMENT
The Growth Acceleration Plan was designed with a simple goal: 
to progressively return every part of the Group to growth, while 
simultaneously building the capabilities and platforms for future 
scale and consistent performance.
It was based on a conviction shared by the Board and the 
management team, that Informa had many of the elements 
necessary for higher levels of sustainable growth and  
consistent performance: valuable brands, strong customer 
relationships, market knowledge, talent, a culture of  
commercial ideas and creativity. 
It was also built on the belief that the Knowledge and Information 
market was expanding at pace, and, along with many of the 
industry verticals in which our customers operate, offered the 
potential for long-term growth.
From this starting point, we identified five key GAP objectives,  
as set out on page 7: to repair and grow our Business 
Intelligence Division, to streamline, focus and grow our 
Knowledge & Networking Division, to build a scale position  
in exhibitions, to expand our presence in the US, and to invest  
in our products, platforms and talent to strengthen the core 
capabilities across the Group. 
As Shareholders may remember, these headline objectives were 
underpinned by a six-part action plan: to simplify our operating 
structure, enhance the management model, be more proactive 
on portfolio management, pursue a focused and disciplined 
acquisition strategy, increase investment in organic growth 
initiatives and improve our funding discipline.
PERFORMANCE DELIVERY 
GAP has led to a considerable amount of change at Informa, 
producing a simplified Group structure, greater focus on end 
markets and customers, and improved levels of operational 
fitness. It has also led to much needed investment in technology, 
investing in the capability we will need in building for future 
scoping and scale, with more to come. 
This has been matched by significant external investment through 
the targeted addition of businesses, helping Informa to expand 
internationally, strengthen its position in key industry verticals  
and broaden its range of B2B capabilities. 
All of this has contributed to an improving financial and 
operational performance through the period of GAP, including  
in 2017 , which marked the fourth consecutive year of growth  
in revenue, earnings, cash flow and dividends.
Group revenues stood at £1,758m, an increase of almost 31% at 
a headline level, including the benefit of adding Penton Information 
Services in late 2016, and 3.4% at an underlying level.
This has been achieved while fully integrating Penton into the 
Group and I would like to thank colleagues old and new for  
their hard work in making this a success. It has been fantastic  
to see the enthusiasm of our new Penton colleagues and their 
eagerness to explore the opportunities available from being part 
of a more international business. 
It has been equally encouraging to see colleagues keen to learn 
from our new colleagues, tapping into their depth of knowledge, 
experience in key verticals and significant expertise in the US. 
Profitability and cash flow remain key metrics for our business  
and saw continued improvement in 2017 , alongside the  
progress made on revenue. Adjusted operating profits were 
£546m, +31% year-on-year, and adjusted earnings per share 
grew 9.5% to 46.1p. 
On free cash flow, the Group reached the stated target of £400m, 
a reflection of our attractive, cash generative business and the 
focus and commitment of our finance teams. 
DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
2017’s underlying revenue growth of 3.4% included positive 
growth in all four Operating Divisions for the first time since GAP 
was launched. This reflects steady operational progress across 
the business, with further strong growth at Global Exhibitions 
supported by improving growth at Business Intelligence and 
Academic Publishing, and a return to positive growth at 
Knowledge & Networking. 
The combination of consistently strong underlying growth and 
our targeted GAP expansion strategy has propelled Global 
Exhibitions to become the largest contributor to Group 
revenues, at 32%. 
The Division reported underlying revenue growth of 7 .6%  
for 2017 . This is in spite of operating as a much larger  
business, following the addition of brands from Penton  
including exhibitions in the Health & Nutrition and Agriculture 
verticals (Natural Products Expo, Farm Progress) and YPI,  
the portfolio of US-based events in the international yachting 
vertical acquired in March 2017 . 
Business Intelligence continued to steadily improve its growth 
profile, building on its return to positive growth in 2016 to deliver 
underlying growth of 2.2% in 2017 . The improving performance

STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
of this Division over the last four years is one of GAP’s major 
successes, and much praise goes to the management team  
and all Divisional colleagues for this achievement. 
This business is now more focused on customers and markets, 
with strength in subscriptions supported by a revitalised Consulting 
business and an exciting marketing services capability through 
Informa Engage. It has all the tools and talent to continue to 
steadily improve its growth profile in the coming years. 
The Academic Publishing Division, under the leadership of  
new Divisional CEO Annie Callanan, also reported improved 
underlying revenue growth at +2.0%, with revenues of £530m 
and adjusted operating profit of £154m.
This included another robust performance by our scholarly 
journals business, with high subscription renewals reflecting 
continued strong demand for our content. In our specialist  
Books business, a number of operational initiatives to improve 
publication efficiency and customer service supported 
performance, and, combined with a more stable market 
backdrop, led to positive growth over 2017 . 
Towards the end of the year, we further reduced our exposure  
to the more volatile end of the Books market through the sale  
of lower level textbook publisher Garland, which should help 
further stabilise the Books business in 2018.
We continued to invest in new growth opportunities through 
2017 , particularly in digital, data and open access (OA). In  
May, we invested in colwiz, a business developing research 
management software using artificial intelligence and machine 
learning technology. In September, we announced the addition  
of Dove Medical Press, a leading independent OA publisher, 
strengthening our position in Health Sciences and adding a 
valuable portfolio of established OA journals, and a platform  
for future expansion in this attractive and growing market. 
The Knowledge & Networking Division returned to positive 
growth in 2017 , with an underlying growth rate of 0.1%, reversing 
a decline of -4.1% in 2016. This follows four years of significant 
change designed to simplify the portfolio and focus the business 
on large, branded, international confexes and events in three  
key vertical markets, Life Sciences, Global Finance and TMT.  
In November, we completed the sale of a majority stake in 
Euroforum, our German and Swiss conference business, further 
increasing the focus on our major brands in core verticals.
Knowledge & Networking’s investment in digital communities, 
and in connecting audiences year round through networks and 
specialist content, continued to gather pace through the year  
and this is one of the areas where we expect to see more growth 
in 2018 and beyond.
A common feature across all the Operating Divisions is the 
continuous reassessment of business mix and proactive 
management of the portfolio to improve growth prospects, 
profitability and earnings quality. Much has been achieved to 
reshape the Group through GAP and this is reflected in its 
improving performance. We will maintain this focus in the  
future, continuing to reassess select non-core businesses  
to test whether we remain their best long-term owner.
INVESTING FOR GROWTH AND SCALE
The improving performance of the Group and Operating Divisions  
is in no small part due to the programme of investment and 
portfolio improvement undertaken as part of GAP.
Over the last four years, around £80m has been invested  
in a range of projects in all four Operating Divisions, as well as 
centrally in Global Support. These have focused on technology 
that enhances Informa’s core platforms, ranging from customer 
management systems and marketing automation tools to 
front-end delivery platforms. This has strengthened the Group’s 
capabilities, supporting the steady improvement in underlying 
performance and the delivery of consistent future growth and 
further scale. 
In 2017 , this GAP investment started to reap dividends, with a 
range of new products and platform enhancements launched. 
This was particularly evident in Business Intelligence, with 
upgrades and launches including improved data collection,  
new API functionality and full platform launches. 
These included a new platform for EPFR Global, our fund  
flow and asset allocation data business, the launch of Ovum 
Forecaster, a new product combining forecasts on broadband, 
cellular and TV services and technologies, and a new platform  
for Citeline, our clinical trials intelligence business, with a new 
web interface providing full access to data on more than  
265,000 trials and 400,000 investigators.
Elsewhere, in Academic Publishing, a single, enhanced 
platform for scholarly books content was introduced. In  
Global Exhibitions, the development and rollout of our 
MarkitMakr digital lead generation platform continued, as  
did the core digital platform in Knowledge & Networking.  
More details can be found in the Divisional review section. 
COMBINING AND INTEGRATING NEW BUSINESSES
Having acquired Penton Information Services, at the  
end of 2016, 2017 saw a multi-faceted integration 
programme to combine Penton’s 1,000 colleagues, 
exhibitions, intelligence brands and print and digital  
B2B insight and data products with Informa’s business 
structure, culture and commercial operations. 
DELIVER – DISCOVER – COMBINE
Planning for the integration started well in advance of the 
deal completing, but the initial focus for all the Informa and 
Penton teams remained on meeting year-end targets. At 
the same time, management teams prioritised discovering 
more about Penton and testing assumptions made around 
where and how each part of Penton’s business might best fit  
within Informa’s portfolio. 
The project moved into its Combine phase in early 2017, 
when the formal integration of businesses, people, culture 
and systems got underway. 
COLLABORATION AND GOVERNANCE
A steering committee was established to oversee and 
monitor the programme, led by Chief Integration Officer 
and Business Intelligence CEO Patrick Martell and 
comprising the CEOs of Global Exhibitions and Knowledge 
& Networking, the Director of Strategy & Planning, Director 
of Talent & Transformation and the Business Intelligence 
HR Director. The committee was supported by a dedicated 
project manager and met bi-weekly to discuss progress 
reports, agree key integration actions and collaborate on 
cross-business matters.
Each Division established workstreams to manage 
decisions and activity around commercial, marketing  
and financial integration, with sponsors and leads 
accountable for reporting progress and escalating issues. 
HR, technology and brand integration were managed at  
a cross-Group level by Global Support functional experts, 
to ensure a common approach was adopted in areas 
affecting all Divisions. 
PACE AND PROGRESS
The speed of combination varied by workstream, with 
priority given to the integration of key brands into vertical 
portfolios to allow commercial teams to quickly identify 
and seize revenue opportunities. 
To ensure minimal disruption to working practices and 
enable a more detailed period of discovery, Technology  
and HR changes were phased over the year. In HR, the 
integration provided an opportunity to rethink US payroll 
and benefits systems across Informa, and we took a number 
of steps to standardise and consolidate our processes in 
areas like time recording, holiday practices and benefit 
contributions for all US colleagues starting 2018.

In technology, colleagues from Penton were gradually

onboarding to the Group’s digital workspace Portal in  
July 2017. While we complete the rollout of our new  
Group-wide ERP, certain legacy Penton platforms  
remain in place to support their operations. 
Project Manager Helena Redshaw (above) said: “The 
integration project started from a positive place, as  
cultural fit was an important part of the rationale for 
combining our businesses, and there was a strong  
appetite amongst colleagues to come together as  
one business and community. 
“There were lots of learnings along the way that we have 
fed back into our change management processes, including 
building in the flexibility to allow different workstreams to 
move quicker where they can, and ensuring colleagues are 
kept up to date on progress throughout the programme.”

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
/ /As the Group enters 2018,  
GAP may be complete, but  
its principles will continue to 
underpin how the business is 
managed and operated/ /
During 2017 , as in every year, I have been fortunate to spend  
time meeting customers and key business partners to hear  
their needs and experiences first hand. This helps to understand 
the direction and growth opportunities for their businesses and 
how we might be able to support this progress by enhancing  
and extending the specialist intelligence, content, connections  
and sales opportunities we provide. 
Highlights included meeting exhibitors at World of Concrete  
in the Construction & Real Estate vertical, touring the vast and 
impressive Fort Lauderdale Boat Show, hosting a reception  
with the government-sponsored Egyptian Knowledge Bank to 
promote our scholarly research and other activities in the region, 
and leading a panel of experts at the LeadersIn Tech Summit  
as part of London Tech Week. 
It was also encouraging to strengthen and extend our relationship 
with one of our key partners, the Principality of Monaco, during 
2017 . This saw us expand our existing partnership on the 
Monaco Yacht Show to our full international yachting portfolio, 
including the US-based events acquired with YPI in March.
AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLATFORM FOR 
GROWTH AND SCALE
Another area of investment and platform improvement in 2017 
has been the upgrade to our Group-wide financial reporting 
system, creating a common, more robust platform with the 
capabilities to provide efficient and effective shared services  
at scale. 
Like all large-scale technology deployments, this has been 
complex to manage, with some implementation challenges as 
legacy systems have been retired. However, the vast majority  
of the Group is now live on the platform and there is a target  
to achieve a business as usual state on the platform by the  
end of May, ahead of the half-year reporting period and before 
the anticipated completion of the offer for UBM plc.
INVESTING IN COLLEAGUES AND INCLUSION
The energy, ideas and contribution of colleagues across the 
world remain the lifeblood of our business and so the Group’s 
investment in people, and the support and opportunities available 
to them, remains critical. 
This is reflected in the range of benefits available to all colleagues, 
which includes our colleague equity/share incentive plan 
ShareMatch. Participation continues to grow, with close to  
20% of colleagues now members, boosted by an improved 
one-for-one share matching offer introduced in 2017 . 
I particularly enjoyed spending extended periods of time in the 
US during the second half of 2017 , meeting colleagues in small 
and large groups to hear personal experiences from around 
Informa, answering questions and having great discussions  
on our business and its future direction. 
Alongside such informal discussions, the Group has a more 
formal colleague engagement platform, Inside Informa. This 
enables colleagues to have their say on everything at Informa, 
providing valuable feedback that drives change and action,  
as well as being a useful measure of overall engagement levels. 
For example, following the Inside Informa conversation in 2016,  
new learning and development programmes were launched  
in several Divisions to provide greater opportunities for 
professional and personal advancement. 
To supplement this, a shorter, topic-focused Inside Informa  
Pulse was introduced in 2017 , in this case giving colleagues  
the chance to have their say on GAP. Encouragingly, 75% who 
expressed an opinion believed their business was now better 
placed to succeed, and the most commonly cited benefits of 
GAP were new and upgraded technology and opportunities  
to progress and develop personally. 
Informa continues to invest in the balance of talent at all levels 
across the Group, and our twin areas of focus are international 
diversity and gender mix. As the Group becomes increasingly 
international in reach, it is important colleagues around the world 
feel they have equal opportunities to succeed and progress.
Similarly, we have launched new initiatives to promote gender 
balance, including enhanced recommended recruitment practices. 
2018 will see the launch of AllInforma Balance, a network to support 
the skills and development of all colleagues, with certain elements 
specifically tailored to women. 
Informa has a balanced workforce overall, but female 
representation is lower in more senior roles. We will continue  
to  strive to provide the right support and encouragement  
for female colleagues to ensure they have every opportunity  
to progress through the Group.
GROWTH CONTINUATION AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES
The completion of the GAP leaves the Group more robust, customer-
focused and better equipped to deliver sustainable growth and 
performance. Informa has delivered on key GAP objectives:
•  We have built a scale position in B2B events and will,  
if the offer for UBM is successful, become one of the  
largest B2B events groups globally
•  We have expanded our presence and built a strong position  
in the important US market 
•  We have repaired our Business Intelligence Division and 
returned it to positive organic growth from its starting point  
of close to a 10% decline
•  We have streamlined and focused our Knowledge & 
Networking Division, returning it to positive growth in 2017
• We have built depth in a range of attractive vertical markets 
•  We have strengthened core capabilities across the Group, 
investing in enhanced platforms and infrastructure, and the 
talent and expertise to innovate and serve customers 
This provides a strong foundation for the future, and it is our  
belief there is much more for the Group to achieve. Our markets 
are attractive and growing, often fragmented and international: 
the ingredients for continued growth and scale in the future. 
As the Group enters 2018, GAP may be complete, but its 
principles will continue to underpin how the business is  
managed and operated. We will continue to invest in the 
business, encouraging innovation and expansion, and remain 
focused on our customers and the verticals in which they 
operate. We will retain our eagerness for growth, not at any  
cost, but growth that delivers value, creates opportunities  
and drives returns for our Shareholders.
This is why, in January 2018, the Board of Informa agreed a 
recommended offer for UBM plc, an opportunity to build on  
the foundations of GAP and create a leading B2B information 
services group, with the operating scale, industry specialisation 
and operational capabilities to deliver long-term growth and value. 
It is an exciting prospect for the future, one that offers major 
benefits for customers, new opportunities for colleagues and  
the potential to create significant value for Shareholders. I look 
forward to keeping everyone updated and informed on progress 
through the year ahead. 
My thanks to the Board and all my Informa colleagues who  
have put such energy and commitment into delivering on  
our GAP ambitions and for putting the Group in such a  
strong and exciting position for the future.

PHARMA: 
COMPETITION 
AND INNOVATION
I
t is a time of change, and both challenge and opportunity, for 
major Western pharmaceutical companies. Competition and 
innovation are emerging from China, and many non-traditional 
players, revolutionary cell and gene therapies are starting to 
gain approval, and the industry is exploring the potential of 
artificial intelligence and data analytics. 
The world is wrestling with the increasing costs of keeping  
people well, and companies face the commercial challenge of 
ensuring research and development efforts provide sustainable 
returns on investment. 
Strategies to keep healthcare budgets under control include 
demanding that pharma companies demonstrate how their 
medicines deliver value, renegotiating existing prices downward 
and boosting the uptake of less expensive alternatives such as 
generics and biosimilars.
At the same time, more Chinese capital is being put to work in 
Western businesses, and the influence of innovative home grown 
companies with global ambitions is on the rise. The number of 
reviewers for new drug approvals in China is now 600 from just 
60 a few years ago, with plans to have 1,600 within a year. 
China’s Food and Drug Administration has ambitions to be as 
significant as its US, European and Japanese counterparts.
While the pharma industry is global, companies have to maintain 
intelligence on what is happening locally to ensure optimal market 
access and tailor their approaches by country and indication. 
This is particularly acute in the fast-growing biosimilars space, 
which has seen growing influence from companies based in 
India, South Korea and China. 
Currently, the best selling drugs are monoclonal antibody-based 
biologics – Humira, the top selling drug, posts sales of more than 
$18bn – but many are about to go off patent, opening the door  
to less expensive biosimilar alternatives. 
Some leading pharma companies are putting in place defensive 
strategies to protect their franchises, while others see opportunities 
to build out their own offerings, and indeed the pharmaceutical 
industry has many reasons to be optimistic.
In 2017 there was an upswing in regulatory approvals, particularly 
for innovative new medicines and revolutionary cell and gene 
therapies, which some believe signals the dawn of a new 
pharmaceutical age. The US Food and Drug Administration 
approved 46 new molecular entities, while the European 
Medicines Agency gave the green light to 28 new products 
containing 29 new active substances. Regulators are taking  
a more pragmatic view around approvals to get help to patients  
as quickly as possible. 
WORKING IN  
GROWTH MARKETS 
Informa serves customers who operate in 
one of a range of industry verticals, through 
brands, businesses and teams that are 
specialist and deeply embedded in their 
vertical communities. We typically focus on 
verticals that are international and dynamic, 
with long-term growth prospects, and where 
specialist intelligence and the ability to 
connect with customers are highly valued. 
Read on for examples of Informa’s  
verticals and the trends in these  
markets that create opportunities  
for the Group. 
With the new tax proposals in the US, and estimates that the 
largest 10 US pharma companies may be sitting on as much as 
$160bn, a surge in merger and acquisition activity is expected for 
2018. Indeed, in January alone, Sanofi and Celgene announced 
deals worth nearly $28bn. 
Beyond marquee acquisitions, an upswing in bolt-on acquisitions 
and product in-licensing is likely to boost pharma pipelines.  
Many of these assets reside in emerging small to medium-sized 
biopharmaceutical companies, who often have less than a 
handful of assets in their pipeline and are reliant on capital market 
support. In 2017 , the global biotech industry secured more than 
$70bn from the capital markets. Companies will need access to 
databases identifying the most promising emerging companies 
and unpartnered assets while stepping up their own 
biopartnering capabilities. 
Pharma is also beginning to wrestle with the potential of artificial 
intelligence to handle the terabytes of data associated with 
human healthcare globally. This may mean pharma companies 
look beyond their usual partners to develop relationships with 
businesses familiar with handling such data sets. With data likely 
to be a key differentiator in future healthcare provision, do not be 
surprised to see an increasing presence of IOT giants such as 
Google, Microsoft and Amazon in the sector in the coming years.

TMT:
TELECOMS AT THE 
TIPPING POINT 
T
he future of telecoms and TV is fast emerging, with  
TV reaching a long-awaited tipping point and the 
rapid adoption of mobile broadband leading to 
innovation in services. Technology, Media and 
Telecoms (TMT) companies in the US and around  
the world are closely watching, responding to consumer trends 
and targeting their investments accordingly. 
Few trends will be bigger in 2018 and the coming years than  
the transformation of TV and video by the delivery of services 
“over the top” of the Internet. Netflix, Amazon Video, YouTube  
and other online-only services will account for 18% of total paid  
and ad-supported TV and video revenues next year and 60%  
of growth. In the world’s most advanced TV and video market, 
the US, these over the top services will take an astonishing 89% 
of revenue growth.
Understandably, telecoms and media companies worldwide are 
watching the US closely. A meaningful number of households  
in the country are cutting the cord by cancelling their pay TV 
contracts, tired of paying for bundles including hundreds of  
TV channels they never watch. Ovum data shows that pay TV 
subscription numbers began to decline from a high of 100.8 
million at the end of 2013 and will fall to 95.8 million by 2022. The 
creation of new households uninterested in subscribing in the  
first place, known as cord-nevers, means pay TV’s penetration of 
households will fall nearly 10 percentage points to 71.9% in 2022.
A growing number of consumers will opt to use lower-priced, 
online-only services instead. We forecast the number of 
subscriptions to online video services in the US will rise to  
213.1 million in 2022, more than double the total for pay TV,  
split between 130.4 million Netflix-like subscription-based 
video-on-demand-only services, and 82.7 million subscription-
based linear online video services such as AT&T’s DirecTV  
Now, Amazon Channels and YouTube TV. 
HEAL TH & NUTRITION:
CLEAN CHOICES 
I
n the US, consumers are increasingly paying attention  
to what they put in and on their bodies. They are reading 
product labels, scrutinising chemical-sounding or perceived 
unnatural ingredients, and seeking out healthier, less processed 
offerings that their grandparents would recognise.
Consumers are also increasingly demanding greater transparency 
in the foods and packaged goods products they purchase: what 
is in the products they buy, where the ingredients came from  
and how they were made. Shoppers, particularly millennials,  
want to know the stories behind products and use those stories 
to determine how much they trust a brand and how much they 
will pay for it. According to New Hope 2017 consumer research, 
65% of millennials would pay more for responsibly produced food 
compared with 25% of baby boomers.
As US consumers put more dollars towards healthy, clean  
and sustainable nutrition, their expectations are putting pressure 
on traditional food and beverage consumer packaged goods 
companies. But as the big food companies struggle in the age of 
the new consumer, other companies are finding market opportunity. 
Growing at 6-10% each year over the last decade, US consumer 
sales of natural, organic and functional foods and beverages  
are far outpacing total US food industry sales, which grew less 
than 1% in 2016 according to Nutrition Business Journal (NBJ). 
Although still small in comparison to the total industry, natural, 
organic and functional food and beverages are forecast to reach 
$196 billion by 2020.
Other consumer packaged goods product categories are  
also being impacted by the new consumer. The US dietary 
supplement market grew 6% to $41bn in 2016, as consumers 
continued to increasingly spend their dollars on natural nutrition 
and wellness products. Combined sales of natural and organic 
personal care, household and pet products increased nearly  
7% to $18.6bn in 2016. 
The entire US natural and organic products industry, which 
includes foods and beverages, dietary supplements and  
personal care, household and pet products, surpassed the  
$200 billion mark in 2017 and has more than doubled in  
size since 2007 , when industry sales were less than $100bn. 
By 2020, NBJ is forecasting nearly $300bn in annual consumer 
sales, impressive for a business sector that was once considered 
a fad and supported only by yoga moms and tree-hugging hippies.
Shifting market dynamics, coupled with the increased and  
new kinds of investment dollars available to emerging brands, is 
motivating a growing number of companies to launch each year 
with product innovations that provide healthier, cleaner options; 
greater product transparency; and mission-driven business 
models that address societal and planetary problems like global 
warming, food security/access, nutritional poverty and more. 
The rise of over the top video will impact one of the strategies  
for growing broadband and TV subscription numbers and 
revenues: the multi-play bundle. Traditional dual-play bundles  
of fixed broadband and fixed telephony will see the greatest 
decline in numbers. 
But US operators are innovating with bundling in other ways, 
looking to hitch their next-generation video services to rapid 
adoption of mobile broadband. Uptake of quad-play offerings 
that include mobile will continue to grow, and mobile broadband 
subscriptions in the US are due to exceed 555 million in 2022 – 
including 104 million to 5G services.
In other markets, outcomes will be different. Why? It is easier to 
say what is singular about the US than to generalise about the 
rest of the world. At over 90% penetration of TV households,  
the US pay TV market has been saturated for a very long time. 
Operators have focused on increasing subscription fees to grow 
revenue, which has led average triple-play prices to reach as high 
as $145 per month. 
Globally, subscriptions to fixed-broadband bundles that do not 
include pay TV will begin to decline from 2017 , while those that  
do will grow strongly over the forecast period. But outlooks  
differ greatly by market. 
Looking at the 10 largest countries by number of households  
at the end of 2021 – China, India, the US, Brazil, Indonesia, 
Russia, Japan, Nigeria, Germany and Mexico – fixed broadband 
will dominate in some, and pay TV in others.
Varying take-up of subscription online video reveals just how 
much of an outlier the US will be, with more subscriptions than 
homes as services proliferate and some households sign up  
to two or more. 
One factor will remain constant: mobile broadband will be 
adopted widely, presenting new opportunities and challenges  
to TV the world over.

Research Director, Consumer & Electronic Services, Ovum
At our own Natural Products Expo West and East, more  
than 1,000 new finished product brands launch each year. 
The food choices prioritised in Dubai look different to those in 
Dallas, and yet these same macro forces rocking the food and 
beverage landscape in the US are causing ripples elsewhere 
throughout the globe, as evidenced by worldwide growth of 
everything from organic food to dietary supplements.
In the last 10 years in the supplements market, for instance, 
China’s share of the market has grown faster than any other 
country, up to 14.3% of the world’s industry in 2016 from 9.6%  
in 2006. The Chinese market has gained the attention of many 
supplements companies as consumers are increasingly 
spending on health products and e-commerce continues  
to grow exponentially in the country. 
And in vitamins and minerals, the strongest growth is coming 
from Eastern Europe and Russia, with increasing health concerns, 
rising obesity rates and disposable income spurring sales of 
supplements for overall health.

AVIATION:
FROM DEFENCE  
SPEND TO SPACE 
START-UPS
I
n the last few years, a sense of distrust has seeped into the 
global zeitgeist. Due to the proliferation of fake news spread 
through websites and social media, as well as the failures of 
the establishment to adequately respond during times of 
crisis, people are wary of government, corporations and the 
media, unsure if they have honest intentions or if they are 
motivated by a desire to promote self-interests. 
However, futurists who track global trends believe this mistrust 
has also given rise to a countermovement. While people are  
still sceptical of the perceived establishment, they are eager  
to embrace and bring attention to the good work of individuals 
with whom they directly relate. 
In this environment, there is potential for experts to cultivate even 
greater influence within their industries by complementing their 
vertical-specific expertise with deeper audience engagement, 
particularly through online and social media channels. 
Recent data from the Edelman Trust Barometer, an annual  
global survey of trust and perceptions of credibility, points  
to the validity of this approach. Their 2017 study found most 
participants considered peers to be just as trustworthy as  
those categorised as experts. However, in 2018, technical  
and academic experts once again landed in the top spots, as 
they had in previous years. These two groups were deemed 
most trustworthy of all those tracked in the 
2018 edition, with 63% and 61% respectively 
believing technical and academic experts 
were very or extremely credible, while trust  
in peers decreased to 54%.
Why? One theory is that the global political 
and policy instability of 2017 made people 
more trusting in only those with access,  
deep knowledge and understanding of 
specific subjects, giving experts a leg up. 
Even though peers saw declines in their  
trust ranking, they were still the third most 
trustworthy group out of a field of 11,  
staying influential partly due to the power  
of human connection. 
But it is clearly not about blindly believing  
and following anyone who is friendly or 
claims to be an expert. Expertise is often  
in the eye of the beholder, after an evaluation 
of a person’s qualifications, demonstrated 
knowledge, and public perception of their 
integrity and credibility.
Where authors and experts can demonstrate 
they have a genuine intention to inform  
and help the reader as a fellow member  
of the community – be that a local, or  
personal interest, or professional vertical 
community – they are more likely to be 
believed and trusted. 
T
he global aerospace and defence industry enters 
2018 with the wind at its back. In commercial aviation, 
the large jetliner market continues to grow, fuelled by 
new demand for air travel and more efficient aircraft. 
In the Western defence industry, government 
spending is rising again, while the space market is being 
transformed by entrepreneurial start-ups.
The large commercial jetliner market dominated by Airbus and 
Boeing is heading into an unprecedented 15th year of growth. 
History would suggest the market is overdue a downturn, but 
there are few signs of weakness. Global economic growth, rising 
numbers of middle-class travellers in emerging markets and low 
interest rates are underpinning strong demand for new airplanes.
Boeing delivered a record 763 aircraft in 2017 and took orders  
for another 912. The two airframers’ massive backlogs would 
take seven to nine years to deliver at current production rates  
and both companies are bolstering output. China’s Comac  
is emerging as a third player but is not expected to pose  
a significant challenge to either company for some time.
Technology has a major role to play in building connections with 
audiences and communities, and is now essential to deepening 
trust with an audience. 
In addition to the fact that social media is increasingly where 
people find news and information (a Reuters Institute 2017  
Digital News Report found that 33% of those between 18 and  
24 listed social media as their main source of news), it has  
also made it possible for savvy influencers to take parasocial 
relationships – a one-way relationship with someone you do not 
know in real life – to the next level by using online interaction with 
fans and followers to supplement real life interactions. 
There is a good chance that for each of us, technology has aided 
in creating or preserving a relationship that would have otherwise 
been difficult to grow or maintain. Having met someone at a 
networking event, an exhibition, a party or someone’s house,  
you connect online afterwards, and follow and interact with them, 
often over the course of years. Indeed, some researchers believe 
that online and offline relationships are often indistinguishable and 
offline relationships are not somehow more real than online ones. 
So what matters? Trends and data show that audiences and 
communities are looking for experts, first and foremost: people 
who are credible, creating and providing original content and 
unique insights and intelligence, and connected to their world 
(and more often than not, actual people  
and individuals, and sometimes brands, 
rather than institutions). They expect that 
engagement to be online as well as offline 
and to use multiple formats – video, audio, 
images, long reports and short form content. 
Connecting with audiences in these ways  
is essential to the growth and future of  
many information services products, and 
particularly intelligence-based services. 
Without these, brands may one day find  
their readers have abandoned them and 
gone elsewhere.
Informa’s response to these trends,  
and the initiatives underway to cultivate 
communities, are covered elsewhere in this 
report. This includes the ongoing focus on 
being specialist in chosen, international 
vertical markets and investing in our data, 
intelligence and connection credentials. It

In addition to new sales, the Aviation Week Intelligence Network 
(AWIN) forecasts the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) 
market for commercial aircraft will generate $88.3bn in demand 
in 2018, with another $8.3bn for business aircraft and $6.5bn for 
civil helicopters. But the civil MRO market is experiencing some 
churn as large aerospace contractors, most notably Boeing,  
aim to grab a larger share of those lucrative revenues.
The air cargo market grew 9% in 2017 , according to the 
International Air Transport Association, with e-commerce 
underpinning new demand. Further growth is expected in  
2018. Two pockets of the aviation market that continue to 
struggle are business jets, which is still climbing out of a brutal 
downturn that began in 2008, and civil rotorcraft, which was  
hit hard by a slump in demand from oil and gas companies. 
Longer term, the nascent market for urban air transport bears 
watching. Uber is aiming to begin experimental flights in Dubai 
and Dallas in 2020, which could lead to commercial operations 
by 2025. Multiple urban air taxi concepts are in development.
After several years of decline, Defense Department funding in  
the US, by far the world’s biggest spender, is growing again. The 
Trump administration has requested $686bn for the Pentagon in 
fiscal 2019, a nearly 18% increase since the budget bottomed out 
in fiscal 2015. Missile defence programmes should see hefty 
increases as Washington seeks to counter strategic threats from 
a nuclear-armed North Korea, with additional money going to 
modernise forces and aircraft used during conflicts in the Middle 
East and Afghanistan.
The Pentagon is also under pressure to reach for more advanced 
technologies such as efficient engines that can power combat 
aircraft and hypersonic missiles, as well as upgrades to artificial 
intelligence, automation and big-data analysis, which appear to 
be lagging behind investments in China.
European defence budgets have risen as NATO prepares to 
counter an increasingly aggressive Russia, and alliance members 
come under pressure to meet a commitment to spend at least 
2% of GDP on defence. But political turmoil and the UK’s 
impending exit from the EU have created uncertainties. Germany 
and France are strengthening their defence ties and have 
declared an ambition to jointly build a European answer to the 
F-35 fighter jet, while a decline in the value of the British pound 
has hit the UK since it invests heavily in US-made equipment, 
most notably the F-35. Nothing will do more to transform the 
military aircraft market than the F-35, which AWIN projects will 
see nearly $73bn worth of deliveries in the next five years.
Space is an industry characterised by disruption, with companies 
such as SpaceX and Blue Origin progressing toward their goal of 
radically reducing the cost of access to orbit. Investors pumped 
$2.8bn into 43 US space start-ups in 2016, many of them 
communications satellite ventures, according to the consultancy 
Bryce Space and Technology. New commercial space start-ups 
are also popping up in China and Japan.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
MEASURING 
GROWTH AND 
PERFORMANCE 
For 2017, the new measure of underlying revenue growth 
refines and replaces the previous measure of organic 
revenue that is reported for 2014–2016. We have also 
added scoring in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) 
as a new non-financial performance measure. This index 
assesses companies on multiple economic, environmental 
and social performance factors to understand a business’s 
sustainability, and aligns with the Group’s focus on creating 
a business that is resilient, successful and in growth over 
the long term.
As part of Informa’s recommended offer for UBM, we 
provided an update on current trading including a target  
for Group underlying revenue growth of more than 3.5%  
for 2018. Other 2018 targets will be updated based on  
the enlarged Group should this offer complete. 
* 2014-2016 figures reflect previous measure of organic growth
About: 
One view of the Group’s financial performance and growth. It measures 
change in revenue that includes year-on-year growth from material 
acquisitions, as if they had been owned in the corresponding period the year 
before. It also strips out the impact of event phasing, disposals and currency 
movements. One of the factors considered in executive remuneration plans.
2017 performance: 
Underlying revenue growth of 3.4% met the target for a further year of 
improved Group revenue growth.
About: 
Measures the underlying performance of earnings attributable to Shareholders, 
excluding adjusting items that the Directors believe would distort underlying 
results. It is one measure of the value created for Shareholders, a central aim of 
the Group, and one of the factors considered in executive remuneration plans. 
2017 performance: 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of 46.1p met the target of a further year of 
improvement in earnings.
About: 
Free cash flow is important as a measure of financial discipline. It indicates  
the availability of capital for reinvestment, which remains key to the Group’s 
growth strategy, for the payment of Shareholder dividends and for reducing 
debt. This measures the cash flow generated by the business before cash 
flows relating to acquisitions, disposals and their costs, dividends and any  
new equity issuance or purchase. 
2017 performance: 
Free cash flow of £400.9m met ambition for a further year of growth and  
target of achieving around £400m.
About: 
A measure of the Group’s financial leverage, and therefore an indicator 
of financial discipline, a specific part of the GAP. The ratio is a calculation  
of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation compared  
with net debt. See the Financial Review on page 62 for further detail. 
2017 performance: 
The Group’s year-end gearing of 2.5x was in line with our target range of 2-2.5x.
About: 
Adjusted operating profit is an alternative measure of the Group’s operating 
performance. It represents profit before tax, interest and adjusting items in a 
way that is comparable to prior year and peers. Consistent profitability enables 
the reinvestment in the Group needed under Informa’s growth strategy and 
facilitates Shareholder returns. 
2017 performance: 
Adjusted operating profit of £545.5m met the target of a further year of 
improvement in profit growth at a Group level.
About: 
Represents distributions paid to Shareholders annually, and therefore  
a measure of the value created for Shareholders, a priority for the Group.
2017 performance: 
Another year of progress in the growth of dividends per share, meeting  
the Group’s commitment of at least 6% growth in 2017.
PERFORMANCE IN DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX
88th 67
Percentile ranking Absolute score
About: 
This index measures listed businesses against a range of economic, social 
and environmental factors through a detailed and rigorous questionnaire and 
evidence gathering. Companies participating are graded into percentiles, with 
the top 10% joining the DJSI World Index. 
2017 performance: 
Informa has participated in the index since 2013 
and this is a new KPI for 2017 . The score of 67 is  
an increase of 1 1 points on 2016, when Informa 
ranked in the 73rd percentile with a score of 56. 
Performance was driven by the results of GAP 
initiatives in areas like brand, training and customer 
relationship management, and the increased 
sustainability expertise introduced in 2016. Informa 
was awarded RobecoSAM Industry Mover status 
for the largest improvement in the media sector.
Target: 
Enhance our absolute 
score by focusing on 
opportunities to progress 
in constituent parts  
of the index, and work 
towards DJSI World 
inclusion by 2020.
COLLEAGUE ENGAGEMENT LEVEL 
74% +3%
About: 
Our colleagues and their skills, ambition and contribution are one of Informa’s 
most important assets and therefore a key factor in growth. Engagement levels 
measure colleague support for business objectives, attitudes to the company 
and levels of participation in work life at the Group. 
2017 performance: 
Engagement levels are established 
through the biennial Inside Informa 
initiative, with the next edition due  
in 2018. In 2017 , we conducted a 
shortened Pulse survey and when 
comparable questions were asked, 
engagement increased from 71% to 
74% driven by specific improvements 
in Divisional engagement. 
Target: 
To enhance engagement levels by 
focusing on particular gaps and 
opportunities. We intend to introduce 
a new index for 2018 based on a 
wider set of questions that reflect 
additional factors determining 
colleague satisfaction and support. 
By this new method, engagement  
in 2017 stood at 78%.

1.  Newly introduced elements of our carbon footprint in 2017 due to change  
in material usage in these areas 
2.  Data for years restated due to property changes, new data and new  
elements of footprint
About: 
We recognise the importance of understanding and controlling our environmental 
impacts and in this area stakeholders most frequently request carbon footprint 
data. The Group follows reporting guidelines from the GHG Protocol and Defra. 
With the additions of Penton and YPI, the profile of our carbon footprint  
has shifted significantly with fugitive emissions and fuel consumption by 
vehicles and generators now material sources of emissions. These are 
therefore added to our reported scope.
2017 performance: 
Although our buildings continue to 
cause fewer emissions per head after 
investment and a move to green 
power in much of our UK estate, the 
addition of YPI has significantly 
increased our use of vehicle and 
generator fuel, affecting overall 
carbon intensity.
Target: 
By 2020, cutting our carbon  
footprint by another 10% per  
colleague, with at least five of  
our top 10 offices having invested  
in energy efficiency measures.
Informa’s management team and Directors use a range  
of financial and non-financial measures to track the 
performance of the Group. Other metrics, specific to  
each business, are used to assess performance at a  
product and Divisional level. 
Delivery against several of these measures is included  
in executive remuneration plans as well as long-term 
incentive plans.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
G
rowth has been central to Informa’s strategy since 
2014, and the continuation of growth remains  
a key principle for 2018 and onwards.
The Group recognises that continuing to deliver 
growth requires taking commercial risks. To  
enable the business to pursue opportunities at all levels in  
an agile away, Informa’s approach is one of responsible risk 
taking, where risks are transparently identified, monitored, 
reported and actively managed.
The Board believes risk and reward should be balanced, and  
that no risks or rewards should be taken that are outside of 
Informa’s approved strategy, guiding principles and financial 
objectives. Through its risk appetite and tolerance statement,  
the Board directs the Group to assess risks when considering 
opportunities and mandates an actively managed and  
adequately resourced management of risk. 
RESPONSIBLE  
RISK TAKING
Informa’s culture plays an important part in risk management. The 
Board encourages a culture of transparency, integrity and doing 
the right thing, in which identifying risk is encouraged, and actions 
are taken to ensure any necessary controls or resources are in 
place to manage that risk and ensure business objectives are 
delivered efficiently.
During 2017 , there was a considerable focus on culture, 
behaviour and ethics with enhanced training, updated policies 
and new, accessible reporting facilities introduced. For 2018,  
the focus is on continuing to support a culture that enables 
responsible risk taking, and maintaining the ongoing 
improvement in risk management rigour, including a more  
holistic oversight of our principal risks and the identification  
and monitoring of key risk indicators.
RISK GOVERNANCE 
Informa’s Risk Management Governance Framework is designed 
to provide the Board with oversight of, and insight into, the most 
significant risks the Group faces. 
The Group’s Divisions form the first line of defence against risks 
and are required to identify and report risks in their business  
and markets to the Risk Committee. The Group risk function 
provides specialist support to each Division in risk identification 
and analysis.
The Risk Committee gives the Board informed direction and 
guidance on acceptable levels of risk and advises on any 
necessary changes to compliance and operational controls.  
Growth
Seven principal  
risks relate to factors  
that could impede the 
Group’s growth strategy 
1.  Economic instability
2.  Market risk
3.   Acquisition and 
integration risk
4.   Ineffective change 
management
5.   Reliance on key 
counterparties
6.  Technology failure
7.   Data loss and  
cyber breach
People
Three principal risks 
relate to the colleagues 
and customers the  
Group relies on to deliver 
products and services
8.   Inability to attract  
and retain key talent
9 .  H e a l t h a n d  
safety incident
10.  Major incident
Culture
Two principal risks relate 
to how culture, behaviour 
and ethics contribute to 
the Group’s success
11.   Inadequate regulatory 
compliance
12.  Privacy regulation risk
It meets quarterly on a formal basis, and colleagues regularly 
work together outside of these meetings as is required to 
manage risk. Financial controls are monitored, checked and 
assured through the Audit Committee. Internal Audit reports  
to the Audit Committee and has the remit to test all controls. 
The Audit Committee oversees the work of the Risk Committee and 
challenges its activities, ensuring its work, and that of the Divisions, 
is fairly assessed and reported. The Risk Committee and Audit 
Committee provide independent reports to the Board. Steering 
committees for major projects report directly to the Board. 
Through the governance channels and reporting process, the 
Board monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal control systems, issues guidance for the management  
of risk and approves risk management initiatives.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
Principal risks are those with the potential to most significantly 
impact Informa if they materialise or are managed ineffectively.
The Risk Committee ensures the Group’s principal risks are 
identified from each Division’s risk register. These Divisional  
risk registers are reviewed quarterly along with an update on 
emerging risks, and the most significant risks based on impact, 
likelihood and frequency are assessed for inclusion in the Group 
risk register, from which principal risks are identified.
A risk taxonomy is used to conduct analysis across Divisional  
risk registers, and risks are rated using a prescribed method 
according to their quantitative and qualitative impact and their 
likelihood. Each risk has a colleague or oversight body accountable 
for its management, and where mitigating actions are required, 
the colleague responsible and relevant deadlines are recorded to 
ensure oversight and monitoring. At a minimum, this information 
is reviewed quarterly in formal Risk Committee meetings.
The Risk Committee runs a rolling programme of analysis on how 
principal risks are managed, and reports their status to the Audit 
Committee or Board. Material controls for each principal risk 
were mapped and monitored during 2017 , including identifying 
the person or body responsible for overseeing each control. 
Verification was also sought to ensure material controls had been 
reviewed by the appropriate oversight bodies during the year. 
After reviewing the effectiveness of material controls, a number  
of specific principal risks were prioritised for enhanced controls 
including those relating to health and safety, technology, data  
and cyber. Audit Committee visibility over the Risk Committee’s 
forward planning was enhanced and a status update was 
provided to the Audit Committee and Board throughout the year.
This overall approach enables the Board to form a robust 
assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties that might 
impact the company’s business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. 
Informa’s principal risks map to the Group’s strategic growth 
ambitions. They also reflect the importance of talent, the Group’s 
colleagues and the use of resources, including technology and 
brands, to the Group’s business model. They fall into three 
categories: growth, people and culture. 
PRINCIPAL RISKS DURING 2017
Removal of failure to deliver GAP
After the completion of GAP in 2017 , failure to deliver the 
2014-2017 Growth Acceleration Plan, a principal risk in  
previous years, was removed from the risk register.
Addition of privacy regulation risk 
Privacy regulation risk was added to capture the specific  
risk that tightening privacy law presents to marketing, 
compliance, technology, operations and resources.
Movements in mitigated risk ratings 
Our principal risks are rated according to the potential financial 
and non-financial impacts they could have, and the likelihood 
they will materialise in the near or long term, considering the 
controls currently in place to manage those risks and how 
effective the Risk Committee believes those controls are. 
The net mitigated risk ratings of some principal risks changed 
during 2017 , with changes explained on pages 27 to 32 under  
the relevant risk. All risks are analysed to determine if they  
would have a material financial impact, and those that would  
are modelled for their impact on the Group’s financial viability. 
CONSIDERATION OF OTHER RISKS
A range of risks are kept under review, and some of those that 
are not currently considered principal risks to the Group include 
tax compliance risk, climate change and instability caused by 
Britain’s exit from the European Union.

STRATEGIC REPORT
RISK MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED
In the area of tax, the Group takes a principled and low-risk 
approach, which limits the likelihood of disputes with tax 
authorities and is unlikely to give rise to unexpected tax liabilities.
Informa has a relatively small direct impact on the environment, 
largely related to carbon emissions and the use of paper in 
products in the supply chain. Colleagues and customers also 
travel to attend Informa’s exhibitions and events, which generates 
business opportunities for travel and accommodation providers 
and host economies, but also consumes natural resources. 
Our contribution to climate change from direct and indirect 
carbon emissions is not viewed as a principal risk because  
the emissions are small in scale compared with the size of the 
business, even if legislation were tightened or extended carbon 
pricing introduced. We recognise extreme weather events as a 
potential cause of a major incident, one of our existing principal 
risks, which could increase with changes in climate. 
As a UK-listed international Group with 78% of revenues 
generated outside of the UK and Continental Europe, the impact 
of Britain’s exit from the European Union is not considered 
material. This will be kept under review as the form of the exit 
becomes clearer. Currency fluctuation, particularly the relative 
value of sterling and the US dollar, is one potential impact, where 
an increase in the value of the dollar would have a positive effect 
on revenues. The management of currency risk is overseen by 
the Treasury function and its policies.

geographies, verticals or overall. Potential to weaken brands 
and value over time leading to reputational damage and 
impairing ability to raise funding. Impact from fluctuations  
in currency exchange rates.
Link to strategy
A global economic downturn could affect the Group’s ability 
to deliver growth in the near term but could also present  
an opportunity to acquire businesses at more competitive 
rates and lay the foundation for long-term growth.
Mitigating activities
Informa has an international customer base, selling into over 165 countries, which dilutes the effect of downturns in specific 
geographies. The breadth of the Group portfolio by verticals, products and customer types also mitigates the impact of 
downturns in particular markets and builds resilience. There is a particular weighting to the US, one of the largest markets  
for information services like exhibitions. 
Conferences that rely on domestic delegates can be vulnerable to economic downturns, and the Knowledge & Networking 
Division’s streamlining under GAP and focus on major branded and international events manages this exposure. Many 
content and data products are subscription based, making revenue more predictable. Exhibition revenue is often contracted 
well in advance of the event and credit exposure is minimised through advance payments, particularly exhibition stands, and 
through credit control activities. 
Economic risk and opportunity is considered in the three-year planning process overseen by the Group Finance Director. The 
annual budgets that result from the planning process are a control against which results are monitored through the monthly 
reporting process, surfacing any effects of economic instability and informing commercial decision making. Movements in 
currency can have positive and negative impacts on the Group’s reported earnings. This is managed through hedging 
currency fluctuations so that our net debt profile is proportionate to our exposure to currency fluctuations in EBITDA.
Risk
2. Market risk
Has potential to cause material financial impact
Is modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Executive Management Team
Description
Customer demand for the Group’s products and services  
is influenced by competition. The business may not be  
able to innovate at a pace that ensures that our products, 
services and brands remain relevant to customers.
Impact
If market risk is not addressed through strategy, 
development and innovation, products and services could 
be perceived as less valuable, with revenues and margins 
eroded and some products or services becoming obsolete.
Link to strategy
Group strategy is informed by customer demand, and  
wider market and strategic decisions are made with due 
consideration of market risk. 
Mitigating activities
The Group’s business model, including the Divisional operating structure and, beneath this, vertical team structures in many 
places, enables flexibility in product development and in response to customer demand and market developments.
In 2017 , the Risk Committee reviewed how each Division manages market risk and found that the management of market 
risk is ingrained throughout the business and in each Division as a standard practice. Market developments and risks are 
widely considered in decision making and addressed at strategic levels and through market research into peers and 
comparable products. 
The Executive Management Team oversees market risk through holding regular people, planning and product-focused 
meetings with each Division. Market risk is also regularly addressed by the Board and addressed formally as part of 
Informa’s three-year planning cycle, with these plans presented to the Board.

5. Reliance on key counterparties
Financial impact considered low
Not modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Risk Committee
Description
The Group has key strategic partners who enable the 
delivery of its business objectives. The Group’s aim is to  
not rely on individual partners, but in certain conditions, 
markets and geographies this can be unavoidable.
Impact
If key counterparties fail, there could be serious disruption  
to certain business activities, lower levels of trading and 
revenues, and customer satisfaction could decline.
Link to strategy
This risk relates to key relationships that could influence  
the Group’s ability to generate and preserve value. Key 
counterparties are identified and monitored in relation  
to strategic aims.
Mitigating activities
The Group diversifies its reliance on key counterparties wherever possible. For example, the treasury policy ensures the 
company is not over-reliant on a particular financing partner.
Divisions are required to identify key counterparties, explain the nature and extent of their exposure to them and report  
on activities in place to mitigate specific exposures to the Risk Committee when requested. 
Mitigations include requiring counterparties to have robust and tested business continuity plans in place, service level 
agreements, contracts, proactive relationship management and working with suppliers to ensure that invoices are paid  
on time so that services are not suspended. 
Following deeper analysis and understanding of our exposure to key counterparties in each Division, the assessment  
of the potential impact of this risk was reduced.
Risk
6. Technology failure
Financial impact considered low
Not modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Risk Committee
Description
The Group relies on technology to deliver products  
and services, engage with customers and pay suppliers, 
without which it would experience severe disruption.  
This dependency is recognised in the risk of a major 
technology failure.
Impact
The prolonged loss of critical systems networks or similar 
services could inhibit the ability to deliver events, products 
and services, increase costs and negatively impact the 
Group’s reputation. 
Link to strategy
Technology underpins all the Group’s business activity  
and enables future scale and innovation.
Mitigating activities
The Group’s technology strategy, including the controls set around technology, is led by a technology leadership forum 
comprising the CTOs of each Division and the Group CIO. The forum provides quarterly reports to the Risk Committee. 
The Group operates a cloud-first approach and is moving to a cloud-only strategy, which requires all new hosting platforms 
to be from cloud providers rather than in-house. This minimises the risk of failure as platforms are run by specialist companies 
with a sole focus on platform provision and governed by agreed standards of service. Technology standards, including 
policies and IT controls, which are aligned with industry standards apply across the Group. Security is emphasised through 
standards including ISO 27001, NIST and COBIT, which also benchmark us against recognised control objectives.
Key systems that are business critical or hold more sensitive data are subject to higher controls and greater scrutiny from 
assurance assessment and audit work.
In 2017 , the Risk Committee lowered this risk rating in view of the controls in place to manage this risk.
Risk
3. Acquisition and integration risk
Has potential to cause material financial impact
Is modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Board
Description
Acquisitions are sub optimal if they fail to deliver the 
expected benefits defined in the business case. This  
could arise if potential acquisitions are not evaluated 
accurately, there is a significant due diligence failure  
or acquisitions are integrated ineffectively.
Impact
Sub-optimal acquisitions could result in lower return  
on investment, diminished returns and growth, weaker 
acquired brand assets and inconsistent corporate culture. 
Sub-optimal acquisitions may lead to impairment charges 
and the inability to obtain future funding.
Link to strategy
Informa’s growth strategy includes acquiring businesses  
in target verticals and markets as well as achieving 
underlying growth. The Group is prepared to take measured 
risks to acquire new assets, talent, brands and innovation.
Mitigating activities
Informa proactively monitors the market to identify suitable acquisition targets, which are tested to ensure they are  
a good strategic and cultural fit. Investment decisions are made according to fixed financial parameters and capital is 
allocated to the markets and Divisions with the best value-creation potential. This process is led by the Director of Strategy  
& Business Planning. 
Capital allocation for acquisitions is determined at a Group level. Targets are analysed by the corporate development team 
and a cross-functional team of experts from finance, legal, risk, tax, treasury and communications meets weekly to review 
and assess the risks and considerations posed by acquisitions. These parties also support the commercial leads through 
due diligence prior to acquisition. 
Integration plans are developed in Divisions and reviewed and challenged at a Group level. This is supported by detailed 
technology and finance integration plans. Significant acquisitions have formal leadership and project management to  
deliver integration. An annual acquisition performance review is presented to the Board to test post-acquisition performance, 
including any assessment of variation to expected return on investment. 
Risk
4. Ineffective change management
Financial impact considered low
Not modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Executive Management Team
Description
As the Group grows through innovation and acquisition,  
it is necessary to adjust to change and assimilate new 
business cultures. The breadth and pace of change  
can present strategic and operational challenges. 
Impact
Change not managed effectively could result in unrealised 
opportunities, poor project delivery, colleague turnover, 
erosion of value and failure to deliver growth.
Link to strategy
The Group’s culture is based on support and inclusion,  
but if an inconsistent corporate culture develops through 
poor change management, the Group culture could  
weaken and result in behaviours that undermine and 
degrade performance and strategic direction.
Mitigating activities
The most significant changes result from large acquisitions and projects, and these have well-defined governance and 
reporting structures in place. Project management teams co-ordinate and control change projects and monitor implementation 
plans and the associated risks. Significant changes in 2017 included the introduction of a new enterprise resource platform. 
Risks were identified and dealt with on a rolling basis during the project, such as the need to grant wider access to systems 
during implementation than ordinarily, with access controls re-tightened post launch. 
Global Support is responsible for delivering large-scale changes that affect the whole Group, and has a dedicated change 
delivery team that provides change and project management expertise. The risk function assists with risk analysis and 
identifying controls and action plans for managing change risk, and Group and Divisional communications teams are attached 
to large projects to ensure effective information, engagement and feedback flow to support cultural change. The Executive 
Management Team oversees change management risks through regular people, planning and products meetings.

9. Health and safety incident
Financial impact considered low
Not modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Risk Committee
Description
A serious health and safety incident at or while travelling to 
an Informa event or office has the potential to cause physical 
harm to colleagues, customers and business partners.
Impact
A major health and safety incident has the potential to cause 
life changing injuries and, at worst, fatalities. Mismanagement 
of health and safety can result in reputational damage, 
investigations, fines and multiple claims for damages.
Link to strategy
Informa takes the welfare of its colleagues, customers and 
business partners seriously and expects to operate in safe 
and healthy conditions. A serious failure in this area could 
undermine Informa’s reputation as a leading and trusted 
business and organiser of events. 
Mitigating activities
Informa’s health and safety policies set guidance on health and safety standards in all areas of the Group. To set tone  
and direction, the Board issued a health and safety risk appetite and tolerance statement in 2017 articulating the primary 
importance of the welfare of colleagues, customers and business partners and that anyone may raise health and safety 
concerns without fear of reprisal.
Resource for the health and safety function was restructured, expanded and refocused, installing specialist leadership within 
Global Support and introducing a regional approach serving all Divisions. Security risk is now managed within this function  
to bring a more robust treatment to managing and responding to incidents. Security training is being rolled out to events 
operation teams and will be expanded to senior managers alongside the ongoing health and safety training programme. 
There are three main areas of exposure to health and safety risks: events, travel and premises. Health and safety at our 
premises is monitored monthly with incidents and near misses reported to the Risk Committee. A Group-wide travel 
management system allows us to book accommodation and travel that meet acceptable safety standards and know  
where colleagues are in the event of an emergency.
Risk
10. Major incident
Financial impact considered low
Not modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Risk Committee
Description
A significant accident or event. Major incidents can  
result from several causes, including natural disasters, 
extreme weather events, disease, epidemics, civil unrest 
and terrorism.
Impact
Major incidents have the potential to cause harm and  
injury to people, venues and premises and severely  
interrupt business. If the Group’s response to a major 
incident is inadequate, this could result in additional 
reputational damage. 
Link to strategy
The global operation and footprint of the business  
exposes Informa to extreme weather events, civil  
unrest and terrorism.
Mitigating activities
Proactive response planning for major incidents was improved in 2017 , with schedules for some events adjusted  
to avoid annual extreme weather such as hurricane season in the southern US. 
With changes to the way security risk is assessed and managed, the Group increasingly considers terrorism threats, 
proximity to other likely terrorist targets, unrest or protests in event planning, so that appropriate additional security  
measures can be taken to protect customers, colleagues and business partners and proactively deter attacks. 
The Group’s crisis communications manual was refreshed in 2017 and a desktop exercise conducted with senior 
management on responding to emergency situations, with learnings being addressed.
In recognition of improved preventative controls, and that major incidents with a Group-wide impact are infrequent,  
this risk rating was lowered in 2017 .
Risk
7. Data loss and cyber breach
Financial impact considered low
Not modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Risk Committee
Description
Major information security breach, loss of sensitive or 
valuable data, content or intellectual property. As cyber-
attacks have become more frequent and sophisticated 
across the world, the threat of this risk has increased. 
Impact
Loss of sensitive data through mismanagement, theft, 
cyber-crime or security breaches could lead to losses 
for our stakeholders, damaged reputation, investigations, 
fines and business interruption. 
Link to strategy
The business and delivery of strategic objectives is reliant  
on data. If a significant loss materialised, this would distract 
from our strategic goals through excessive demands on 
management time to respond. 
Mitigating activities
Technology security strategy is overseen by the technology leadership forum. There is also an information protection 
steering committee that oversees data-related security, privacy and compliance matters Group-wide; and a more detailed 
assessment of direction and response is delivered through the information protection management forum. Quarterly security 
reports are provided to the Risk Committee.
Multiple preventative and corrective controls are in place to manage this risk. Enterprise technology strategy incorporates a 
cross-divisional approach to technology selection, integration and security. Security credentials are assessed in the selection 
process. Technology acquired with new businesses is ring fenced and tested rigorously prior to integration with existing systems. 
Vulnerability scanning, testing and actions are carried out on a rolling basis. Information and awareness campaigns continue 
to be run to help colleagues spot, report and avoid threats such as phishing. There is a facility and process for recording, 
escalating and reporting incidents.
The risk from criminal cyber activity continues to grow and attempts to attack and disrupt business are more common and 
widespread. The risk rating was raised during 2017 because of this increased activity and likelihood of impact. In response, 
the Group is accelerating security improvement programmes related to key risks, while focusing on improving the detection 
and response to incidents.
Risk
8. Inability to attract and retain key talent
Financial impact considered low
Not modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Executive Management Team
Description
The inability to attract, recruit and retain colleagues,  
and inadequate succession planning at senior  
management levels.
Impact
Increased turnover of colleagues with associated  
increased costs, loss of knowledge, decreased efficiency, 
and a demotivated workforce with the associated erosion  
of corporate value.
Link to strategy
The sum total of contributions by Informa colleagues  
creates the products and services the Group delivers  
and the ideas and innovation necessary for future growth. 
Loss of expertise, engaged resource, corporate knowledge 
and contacts may impact the Group’s future success. 
Mitigating activities
Culture, and the value that colleagues bring to the Group, is a matter of significant importance for the management team 
and the Board. There is investment and focus in maintaining a culture based on inclusion and respect, where colleagues  
are supported and given opportunities to develop and succeed, in order to retain talent and ensure Informa is a positive  
and enjoyable place to work. 
Colleague engagement levels and attitudes are regularly assessed through the Inside Informa campaign and reported as  
a key performance indicator, with feedback informing new initiatives designed to improve the experience of working in the 
Group and retain talent. There is a Graduate Fellowship Scheme and Apprenticeship schemes designed to attract young 
talent and development programmes in each Division to enhance colleagues’ skills and support career development. For 
more on these activities, see page 37 . HR teams engage in talent mapping, to ensure there are succession plans for senior 
management and that colleagues have access to development opportunities.

11. Inadequate regulatory compliance
Financial impact considered low
Not modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Risk Committee
Description
The risk that the Group may not comply with  
applicable regulations.
Impact
Failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to 
fines, imprisonment, reputational damage and the inability  
to trade in certain jurisdictions. 
Link to strategy
The Group’s licence to operate and ability to grow is in part 
determined by compliance with national and international 
regulation and the support of stakeholders, including 
customers, colleagues and Shareholders, who increasingly 
favour companies that work in an ethical way. 
Mitigating activities
Through the Group’s compliance programme, Informa aims to conform with all necessary regulations and encourage  
a culture of transparency, integrity and respect, which ensures individual behaviours support compliance. 
In 2017 , the Group’s Code of Conduct was refreshed and mandatory training was provided to all colleagues and Board 
members, instilling standards around working with one another, customers, suppliers and third parties, and our 
communities. 
Anti-bribery and corruption training was delivered to all colleagues, with completion and an adequate pass score set as 
targets. A Group-wide breach management and investigation framework was introduced to standardise how issues are 
managed, and a Speak Up whistleblowing line launched for confidential reporting. See page 37 for details.
The onboarding process has been improved to ensure new starters receive these training modules promptly and accept 
core policies, including those on technology use and information security. 
Risk
NEW
12. Privacy regulation risk
Financial impact considered low
Not modelled for the viability statement
Oversight: Risk Committee
Description
The inability to comply with diverse tightening and  
growing global privacy legislation. Privacy regulations  
are regionally focused which presents further challenge  
for Informa as an international business.
Impact
The potential impacts include changes to operations to comply 
with regulations and changes to the way the company can 
market its products, services and events. Non-compliance 
can result in significant fines with associated customer 
dissatisfaction and reputational damage. 
Link to strategy
Compliance with privacy regulations will influence  
marketing strategies and therefore the acquisition  
of new customers. Over-compliance with privacy 
regulations, such as applying the strictest rules  
globally, could result in commercial disadvantage.
Mitigating activities
There is a global trend towards tightening privacy laws, examples of which include the Canadian Anti Spam Law, EU General  
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ePrivacy laws and cyber security law in China. This trend has a broad impact on  
the Group, from how the Group addresses privacy compliance to how marketing strategies adapt to ensure successful 
business operations under new regulation. 
The Group is proactively responding. In preparation for GDPR’s introduction in 2018, a data discovery and mapping exercise 
has been completed to understand the gaps between current practice and future requirements. This found we have a good 
baseline of compliance, with further work to do in specific areas. A new Group data protection officer was appointed and  
a data protection management forum was established to support and oversee privacy regulation compliance initiatives. 
2018 will see the launch of new global cyber security and data privacy training, with Group and Divisional communications  
to educate and inform colleagues.
INFORMA’S 
PROSPECTS  
AND VIABILITY
A
s part of the Group’s strategy and ambition to continue 
its growth and performance, Informa’s Directors at 
all times maintain a sharp focus on assessing the 
Group’s long-term prospects and the company’s 
viability as a business on a three-year basis. 
ASSESSING INFORMA’S PROSPECTS 
Informa operates in the market for knowledge and information, 
and has developed strong positions in many specialist vertical 
markets that offer the potential for long-term growth. It has many 
of the elements necessary for greater future business success –  
valuable brands, strong customer relationships and market 
knowledge, talent and a culture of ideas with commercial focus. 
The Group seeks to build on these strong foundations with 
continued investment in its products and customer platforms, 
alongside further expansion.
Through the recommended offer for UBM, Informa will benefit 
from increased operating scale and industry specialisation, 
creating a leading B2B information services group with the  
scale and specialist capabilities to capture the long-term  
growth potential of this expanding market. 
Informa runs a rigorous annual business planning process, 
involving Divisional and Group management with Board input  
and oversight. This produces Divisional and Group strategic 
plans, which in turn generate three-year financial plans that  
drive the setting of in-year budgets. 
This process, and the plans that result from it, are a significant 
contributor to the assessment of the Group’s prospects. 
Informa’s current position, Group level strategy, business  
model and the risks related to the business model are also  
used to assess prospects. 
FACTORS IN ASSESSING LONG-TERM PROSPECTS 
Group’s current position
• Recurring revenue streams with strong cash dynamics, including  
positive working capital driving high cash conversion
• Diversified business model by geography of operations and customers
• Diversified business model by products and by the verticals in which 
Informa operates
• Strong market positions, brands that customers value and a focus  
on long-term customer relationships 
• Flexible cost structure, enabling the business to respond effectively  
to changes in demand or in markets
See the Financial Review on page 62 for more detail.
Strategy and business model
• Clear growth strategy
• Focus on creating capabilities for future growth and scale under the 
2014-2017 Growth Acceleration Plan
• Intention to build further operating scale and specialism in vertical 
industries, and in B2B information services, through the January 2018 
recommended offer for UBM
• Business model that draws on talent, brands and intellectual capital, 
technology, relationships, access to finance and natural resources
See the Business Model on page 20 and Strategy on page 6 for more detail.
Principal risks related to the Group’s business model 
• Colleague and talent-focused risks around retention and  
change management
• Market risk related to new entrants and economic instability related  
to access to finance
• The risk of technology failure, data loss and cyber breach
• Customers and relationships impacted by privacy regulation  
risk and reliance on key counterparties
• Acquisition and integration-related risk
See pages 27–32 for a description of each principal risk.
STRUCTURED STRATEGIC AND  
FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS 
The Group’s prospects are assessed primarily through the  
annual strategic planning process, which involves the creation  
of business plans by Divisional management that are reviewed  
in detail by the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director 
and the Director of Strategy & Business Planning. 
To create these plans, each Division assesses external factors –  
such as peers and their activity, broad and specific risks and 
market trends – and internal factors – including people, products 
and platforms – that influence the business’s approach today. 
Objectives are set with consideration for what is known  
about customer trends and demands, and emerging risks  
and opportunities over that period, plus an analysis of what  
each Division needs to do to achieve those objectives, whether  
that is launching new activities, securing additional capabilities  
or continuing existing programmes. 
What results is a set of objectives and initiatives, from which  
each Division will derive a three-year financial plan including 
detailed financial forecasts and a clear explanation of key 
assumptions and risks. Plans are updated at key dates  
and for significant events. 
At its annual Board strategy meeting, the Board Directors  
input, scrutinise and test the strategic and financial plans.

VIABILITY STATEMENT CONTINUED
VIABILITY STATEMENT 
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the Group, excluding UBM,  
will be able to continue to operate and meet its liabilities as  
they fall due over the three-year period to December 2020. 
In making this assessment, the Directors have made the key 
assumption that the revolving credit facility is renewed in 
October 2020. 
The Directors also have a reasonable expectation that the 
enlarged Group, including UBM, will be able to continue to  
operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the two-year 
period to December 2019. 
In making this assessment, the Directors have made the key 
assumption that continued access to capital markets to refinance 
debt will be available to the enlarged Group. 
On the assumption that the acquisition of UBM completes as 
expected during 2018, the Directors expect to follow the planning 
process outlined on page 33 and therefore the Directors expect 
to report a viability statement covering a period of three years in 
the Group’s 2018 Annual Report.
GOING CONCERN
Each of Informa’s Directors, as noted on pages 74 and 75, 
confirms that the Group’s business activities, together with  
the principal risk factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, are set out in the Chairman’s 
Statement and Strategic Report on pages 1 to 71.
As described on pages 27 to 32, a number of principal risk factors 
could potentially affect the Group’s results and financial position. 
The Group adopts extensive business planning and forecasting 
processes around trading results and cash flows, and regularly 
updates these forecasts to reflect current trading.
The Group’s net debt and banking covenants are discussed  
in the Financial Review on pages 62 to 71 and the exposure  
to liquidity risk is discussed in Note 30 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
The Directors’ statement of working capital supports the 
reasonable expectation statement about the scenario where 
Informa’s recommended offer for UBM is accepted and the 
acquisition completes. 
Should the offer not take place, projections made as part of the 
viability assessment support the view that for the period up to 
30 June 2019, Informa is expected to be able to operate within the 
level of its current financing and meet its covenant requirements, 
for a period of one year from the date of the signing of the Group’s 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 . 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that there are no material uncertainties that may  
cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the  
going concern basis in preparing this Annual Report and  
Financial Statements.

The latest set of three-year business plans were reviewed and 
agreed by the Board in September 2017 . The first year of this plan 
was used to inform the 2018 budget, itself ratified by the Board  
in December 2017 .
These detailed financial forecasts are also used as a basis  
for the annual impairment review, to inform treasury funding 
requirements and as an assessment of the liquidity available for 
reinvestment and for returns to Shareholders through dividends.
Divisional financial plans combine to produce the Group’s overall 
financial forecast, where it is assumed that dividends grow by at 
least 6%.
ASSESSING THE GROUP’S VIABILITY 
For each principal risk, a severe but plausible scenario is created, 
to analyse how the risk could materialise and to calculate its 
financial impact.
Scenarios include considerably worse performance from 
acquired businesses than anticipated, general market downturns 
and external incidents in regions in which we hold events. 
Where a severe but plausible scenario creates a financial impact 
of over 5% of EBITDA, the principal risk is modelled against the 
three-year financial plan to test whether it would adversely impact 
the Group’s viability. 
Additionally, the three largest risks in terms of their potential 
financial impact are modelled together as a single scenario,  
to understand their combined financial impact.
The Group is considered to be viable if gearing and interest  
cover ratios within its financial covenants are maintained  
within prescribed limits, and if there is available debt headroom  
to fund operations. 
Viability testing is carried out against Informa’s current debt 
facilities, with an assumption that the Group’s present revolving 
credit facility is renewed in October 2020.
In all cases, including after modelling the largest three scenarios 
together, no mitigating actions are necessary in order for Informa 
to remain viable.
VIABILITY OF THE ENLARGED GROUP
The results of the viability modelling show that the company  
is viable over the three year period to December 2020. To reflect 
Informa’s recommended offer for UBM, and the enlarged B2B 
information services group that would result from this combination, 
the Board has also considered a separate business planning 
model to support the statement by the Directors on the sufficiency 
of the enlarged Group’s working capital.
This model uses a two-year horizon and also demonstrates

TALENT AND PARTNERSHIPS
OUR TALENT  
AND PARTNERSHIPS
Working closely and successfully with our 
colleagues, customers and business partners  
is fundamental to Informa’s long-term growth 
and success. They are relationships we are 
proud of, invest in and nurture.
H
ow we engage with colleagues, customers 
and business partners, understand their 
needs and address what matters to them and 
our business supports the Group’s success 
and we focus on creating and maintaining 
positive, mutually beneficial and long-term relationships.
Engagement with the investors who provide capital for  
the Group’s operations is discussed in the Relations with 
Shareholders section on page 114. 
ATTRACTING, ENGAGING AND 
SUPPORTING COLLEAGUES 
Informa colleagues are one of the Group’s most 
important assets. We are a people business; the ideas, 
energy and contribution of colleagues create and 
deliver our products and services. Investing in and 
supporting a broad mix of talent is critical to our 
success and is, we believe, the right way to operate. 
Our talent programme has three major elements: 
attract, engage and support. 
Attract: The Group sets out to attract and retain  
a diverse range of skilled colleagues through fair, 
inclusive and robust recruitment and promotion 
practices. Our recommended recruitment practices, 
which were promoted internally during 2017, 
standardise and enhance how candidates are selected, 
including using mixed-gender panel interviews where 
practical. The rollout of unconscious bias training to 
HR and recruitment teams started, to minimise the 
potential barriers to recruiting the best talent. 
Since 2014, the Group has established formal 
schemes in the UK to attract, support and invest  
in younger colleagues: the Informa Graduate 
Fellowship Scheme and the Informa Apprenticeship 
Scheme. We are also trialling the use of diverse job 
boards in the UK to explore how alternative platforms 
can assist in capturing a balanced mix of candidates. 
Rewards are one factor in attracting and retaining 
talent, and we invest in flexible benefit programmes 
tailored to each region, providing colleagues with 
choice to match their lifestyle. The Group aims to offer 
salaries that are competitive within each sector and 
region, and we are accredited by the Living Wage 
Foundation for ensuring UK colleagues are paid at  
least the independently calculated UK living wage. 
In 2017, the Group further invested in ShareMatch,  
the equity/share incentive scheme launched at the 
start of GAP to enable colleagues to participate in  
the Group’s financial performance in an efficient way. 
The matching offer was improved to provide one free 
share for every share purchased, and participation 
levels now stand at 18% of qualifying colleagues. 
Informa’s framework of codes and policies, plus the 
Speak Up whistleblowing service, were enhanced 
and relaunched to colleagues in 2017. Annie Mickle, 
Group Head of Compliance, explains why. 
“Our Code of Conduct was updated to meet the  
latest regulation and fully articulate our views and 
commitments in areas like human rights, dignity 
and respect in the workplace, modern slavery, and 
safeguarding personal data and information assets. 
“We also put a real focus on making sure our  
code, and 15 global policies that support it, give 
colleagues clear, accessible guidance on doing the 
right thing in an engaging and accessible way.“
The code includes a foreword from the Chief 
Executive and is available in five languages to 
ensure accessibility. The whistleblowing service, 
Speak Up, allows colleagues and suppliers to report 
issues confidentially in multiple languages by phone 
or online, and there is a strict no-retaliation policy. 
To implement the code, mandatory training was 
successfully rolled out to colleagues including 
contractors and the Board. Our target is to  
achieve a 100% completion rate while allowing  
new joiners a period of 30 days to finish their 
training. Non-compliance with the code can  
result in disciplinary action. 
One of the 15 global policies is a new standalone 
Diversity & Inclusion policy, created during the  
year to provide greater detail on anti-discrimination 
practices and promote a culture of equality  
and opportunity.

TALENT AND PARTNERSHIPS CONTINUED
Engage: Informa’s culture is based on providing 
personal and professional opportunity, enabling 
colleagues to contribute at various levels and 
maintaining a working environment of respect  
and openness. 
Colleague engagement is a key performance 
indicator for the Group and is measured through  
the biennial Inside Informa conversation. This  
was last conducted in 2016, with the feedback  
leading to initiatives including new learning and 
development programmes. 
A short topic-focused edition, Inside Informa  
Pulse, took place in late 2017 to enable colleagues  
to comment on the GAP programme and provide 
feedback to inform future strategy. Of those  
who expressed an opinion, 75% said their team  
or business was better placed to succeed as a  
result of GAP. Common benefits noted included 
upgraded technology and opportunities to progress 
and develop professionally. A desire for continued 
investment in equipment, tools and learning 
development will be addressed at a Divisional  
level in 2018.
Each Division conducts internal communications 
activities to enable an open and informed culture. 
Business updates, leadership messages and key 
information are delivered through monthly Stephen 
Calling blogs from the CEO, Divisional newsletters 
and campaign-based activity, with regular physical 
and online town halls at Group, Division and office 
levels plus online Yammer-based social forums 
enabling two-way engagement with senior 
management and the Board. 
In February 2017, a new, common digital workplace, 
Portal, was introduced, enabling all colleagues to 
access and work from the same platform for the first 
time. Portal combines traditional and social intranet 
elements with easy access to apps and digital tools, 
helping colleagues work smarter through quick 
information retrieval and new discussion and 
collaboration forums. Most popular so far have been 
interviews with colleagues that showcase the work 
they do and share career development tips, and 
information supporting the 2017 Informa Awards, 
which attracted record submissions. 
Support: Role-specific training takes place 
throughout the business, and learning and 
development was a key area of investment in  
2017, giving colleagues new opportunities to  
grow and enhancing the Group’s capabilities. 
OUR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR 
VERTICAL COMMUNITIES
Customers engage with Informa brands to obtain 
knowledge, intelligence and connections that  
support their personal and professional progress. 
Where our academic research, business information 
and event-based products and services meet those 
needs, customers progress and our business benefits, 
generating returns that can be reinvested for future 
growth and product improvement. 
Most areas of the Group are structured around 
vertical industries, with vertical-specific products 
and colleagues who are specialist and highly 
knowledgeable about those markets. This focus 
makes understanding and responding to customers 
and spotting trends easier, and enables resources  
like sales, product development and marketing  
to be directed and allocated effectively. 
This included a leadership development programme, 
Informa Inspire, targeted at those reporting to Divisional 
senior management teams to increase professional 
leadership skills, provide networking and collaboration 
opportunities and support succession planning. 
Training accredited by the Chartered Management 
Institute was trialled for UK line managers, and Global 
Exhibitions developed a common training framework 
that will roll out in 2018 to eight global hubs to support 
the Division’s growth and business strategy. The 
framework mixes online and classroom learning with 
a focus on practical, applicable skills and knowledge, 
enabling colleagues in sales, marketing and operations 
to expand their capabilities and effectiveness.
After planning and consultation in 2017, 2018  
will see the launch of the AllInforma Balance 
network, comprising new personal and professional 
development opportunities, mentoring programmes 
and forums to share stories and experience, providing 
additional support to colleagues of all genders with  
a specific focus on women.
Providing flexible working is another way colleagues 
are supported. In the 2016 Inside Informa, 79% 
agreed our working environment provides a good 
work–life balance. Flexible working is enacted by 
policies – including specific parental leave practices 
per region – and through investing in cloud-based 
technology and tools that allow colleagues to work 
from any location.

To deliver products that meet the needs of customers, 
you first have to understand those needs, and this  
has been a key focus for Knowledge & Networking. 
As Director of Research & Insight for Knowledge  
& Networking Stuart Corke explained: “Over the  
last 18 months, we’ve scaled and industrialised an 
improved and standardised post-event feedback 
process amongst all customers – delegates, sponsors 
and speakers. This captures information on key 
performance indicators such as customer satisfaction, 
likelihood of return and advocacy through a net 
promoter measure, with data delivered in real time 
to over 200 Divisional users through dashboards 
and automated reports. 
“This feedback has given us a much better idea of  
the areas in which our brands are strong, and the 
areas where, if we target investment and introduce 
new features, we’ll deliver value for customers and 
returns for the business,” he continued. 
“We are now seeing year-on-year customer 
performance metrics, and in time aim to build  
trend data across multiple years. This has created 
benchmarks for our portfolios across several 
measures and we now better understand the key 
drivers on our performance versus the events  
market. The initial trend is positive and we now 
understand better the key drivers on satisfaction, 
retention and advocacy.”
In Academic Publishing, we offer a suite of services 
dedicated to supporting authors at all stages of  
their research careers. One of the groups we give 
particular focus to is early-career researchers – 
those embarking on publication for the first time. 
As Mark Robinson, Communications Manager  
for Authors & Researchers at Taylor & Francis, 
explains: “The publishing process can seem complex, 
especially to those just starting out. We aim to make  
it simple, helping researchers, extending the value  
we offer and building our brand to strengthen our 
position as a publisher of choice. 
“We offer step by step guidance on how to get 
published, demystifying processes such as peer 
review, and give information on how researchers 
 can promote their own work on social media,  
which is an increasingly important tool, to build  
their reputations and positions as experts, as well  
as creating forums where researchers can share 
career tips. All of this information is online, and  
we also deliver in-person workshops to groups  
of researchers throughout the world. 
“In 2017, we launched a new podcast series with  
Vitae for researchers looking to develop their  
careers and the feedback has been great.”

STATEMENTS region. Work is underway to prepare the first report  
on our payment practices and performance for  
UK-related contracts by July 2018, as required  
under new UK legislation. 
When it comes to our direct consumption of natural 
resources, Informa has a relatively small direct impact 
on the environment, largely related to carbon emissions 
from buildings and generators at events, and our aim is 
to minimise these direct impacts. We are also working  
to consider environmental impact more fully throughout 
the supply chain, including the impact of flights and 
waste at events, and working with suppliers to reduce 
resource consumption. 
In the case of paper and timber, the Group has a policy  
to ensure responsible sourcing from legally harvested  
and well-managed sources. In 2017, the print brands 
acquired as part of Penton increased our overall paper 
usage almost twofold. 
Using the knowledge gained from Academic Publishing’s 
work with print supply chains, 100% of the paper consumed 
within those brands was transitioned to sustainably 
certified sources by November 2017, without additional 
business cost. This means around 98% of the Group’s 
combined paper usage will come from responsibly 
managed forests from 2018.
RESPONSIBILITIES AND 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
BUSINESS PARTNERS 
We aim to develop sustainable and long-term 
relationships with our business partners, from 
commercial partners to suppliers, that have a positive 
impact on all parties and the wider supply chain, by 
acting in a transparent and equitable manner and 
expecting partners to share our standards. 
Steps were taken in 2017 to strengthen our practices, 
including the creation and publication of an updated 
Business Partner Code of Conduct. This articulates 
our standards in important areas such as employment 
conditions, including child labour and modern slavery, 
the handling of information and data, and zero 
tolerance of bribery and corruption. 
Training on this code was delivered to a number  
of exhibition partners in the Middle East in 2017,  
with further proactive engagement with partners 
planned for 2018. To support implementation,  
clauses are coming into effect in new contracts,  
requests for proposals and framework agreements  
to enable the Group to better act on any partner 
breaches. All third parties also have access to our 
whistleblowing line Speak Up and are encouraged  
to report any compliance-related concerns. 
To help Informa colleagues understand their 
responsibilities within the broader business 
community, mandatory online anti-bribery and 
corruption refresher training based on our policy  
was introduced to the Group in October 2017. 
Completion rates are currently 89% and are on  
track to meet a target of 100% during the first  
quarter of 2018. New joiners are required to  
complete the training within 30 days. 
In the specific area of modern slavery, and as part  
of our programme of activities to ensure the business 
and supply chain is operated free from modern 
slavery and human trafficking, training on how to 
spot and report these issues was delivered to around 
900 colleagues, including senior management 
working in regions or functions deemed higher risk 
for encountering such issues. Our full approach can 
be found in our modern slavery statement on the 
Informa website. Information has also been provided 
to colleagues about the new offence of failing to 
prevent facilitation of tax evasion, with targeted 
training planned for 2018. 
The Group engages suppliers on a range of different 
contract and payment terms depending on the 
product or service they are involved with and the 
LOCAL COMMUNITY SUPPORT
Our support for local communities is promoted across  
the Group and organised at an office level, with  
each office encouraged to form long-term charitable 
partnerships linked to their brands and vertical 
markets, and support them through a mix of donations, 
fundraising and volunteering. 
Every Informa colleague can take up to two days each 
year to volunteer with a charitable organisation of their 
choice. Opportunities where colleagues contribute their 
professional skills are particularly encouraged, as a  
way of lending extra capabilities to the organisation 
while developing personally. Nearly twice as many 
colleagues spent time volunteering in 2017 than in  
2016, with 9% participating. 
Walk the World is Informa’s key, annual global charity  
and engagement initiative, when colleagues come 
together to participate in a common goal – walking  
in their area – and raise money to support local 
communities. Fiona Gibson, Communities Senior 
Associate, said: “For our second year of Walk the  
World in 2017, we wanted to increase participation  
in key office hubs and amongst homeworkers. 
“T o expand the programme and get colleagues excited,  
we also introduced a new element – Connections –  
a video competition that awarded seven colleagues  
a trip to the London walk for explaining how their work 
makes a difference to colleagues or communities.”

TALENT AND PARTNERSHIPS CONTINUED
Organising an exhibition involves working with  
many partners and areas of the supply chain beyond 
exhibiting companies and attendees, from venues 
and general contractors to hotels and local officials. 
In March 2017, we acquired YPI, a portfolio of 
international yachting exhibitions that includes  
the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show,  
FLIBS, the largest event of its kind attracting over 
100,000 visitors to see more than 1,200 boats. 
A first action was to start detailed engagement  
with the business partners fundamental to the 
successful operation of FLIBS, particularly the 
Marine Industries Association of South Florida, 
owners of the show, and the Bahia Mar Marina  
venue. The goal was to understand their objectives 
and present the value of Informa Exhibitions as a 
committed long-term partner and a professional 
organiser with specialist knowledge of international 
yachting through organising the Monaco Yacht Show. 
Common areas of interest to all partners included 
attracting visitors and their spend to the local area 
through marketing and promotion, enhancing the 
onsite visitor experience, and health and safety  
at the exhibition. 
These discussions fed into the planning process  
for FLIBS 2017, which included investments in  
new floating docks, tent floorage and electrical 
equipment, improved signage and additional focus  
on advertising and marketing. The success of the 
November 2017 edition has created a base for FLIBS’ 
future growth and development in a way that brings 
value to the yachting community and exhibitors, 
economic development to the local area and trading 
performance for Informa.

The performance of the Books business improved in 2017 , 
following a strong end to the year in specialist upper level  
books, which account for the vast majority of revenue.  
Textbooks that address lower level undergraduate study  
have continued to suffer from broader market headwinds, 
particularly in the US, where higher education enrolment  
is down and alternative, cheap, book rental models are  
becoming more popular. We have limited exposure to this 
market, which was further reduced at the end of 2017  
through the sale of the Garland Science textbooks business. 
A series of operational initiatives was launched in the Books 
business during the year, designed to improve publication 
efficiency and customer service. This benefited trading, as  
did the launch of a new single online platform for ebook  
content in September 2017 . Our books are typically purchased  
as individual units or in bulk orders by distributors, and are  
produced in a format-agnostic way where customers decide 
whether to receive an ebook or a printed book. Demand for 
ebooks remained consistent in 2017 at 26% of Books revenue, 
compared with 25% in 2016.
We continued to look for opportunities to invest in new areas  
of growth in 2017 . This saw us add Dove Medical Press to the 
Division, a publisher of high quality, open access medical and 
health sciences journals. 
Open access journals provide an alternative publishing model  
for authors, allowing them, their funding body or institution to  
pay a fee for research to be published once it has passed 
through peer review. That content is made freely available for 
anyone to access. We have been steadily building our open 
access content and capabilities in recent years, providing authors 
with more options and greater flexibility, and ensuring we service 
this growing market. The addition of Dove adds further capacity 
and capability in open access, increasing the Division’s portfolio 
of established open access journals to nearly 300. 
In May, we invested in colwiz, a digital services business  
that applies big data analytics and machine learning to global 
research activities and trends, to create new insights on scientific 
developments for researchers and institutional funders. 
A significant development for the Academic Publishing Division 
in 2017 was the appointment of Annie Callanan as Divisional  
Chief Executive Officer. Having most recently been CEO at 
information and software services group Quantros, Annie has 
brought a deep understanding of the application of technology  
to knowledge and information services, something that is 
increasing relevant in the academic market. 
Annie’s initial focus has been on engaging with customers, 
suppliers and distributors as widely as possible in the US, 
Europe, China, India and Australia, to gain a full understanding  
of market trends and customer requirements.

The Division comprises a Global Journals and a Global Books 
business, both predominantly serving the upper level academic 
community, but with differing growth drivers and characteristics. 
Journals continued to perform strongly over the year, maintaining 
a high level of subscription renewals and consistent, modest 
growth. This was supported by the depth of specialist content  
in its portfolio and the benefits of GAP investments made in its 
online platform, T&F Online, which have made content more 
discoverable and flexible. All our journals are produced and

ACADEMIC PUBLISHING MARKET TRENDS 
The market for scholarly research and reference-led academic 
content is global and predominantly based on the English 
language. Authors, funders, institutions and users are based  
all over the world, with research developments readily travelling 
across borders amongst specialist communities. 
China is becoming an increasingly important hub for research in 
a number of key disciplines, and Taylor & Francis is commissioning 
and receiving more submissions from Chinese authors than ever 
as the country’s academic output grows, supported by a team of 
around 30 colleagues based in Beijing and Shanghai. 
In some countries, academic research funding is managed  
at a national level. For example, in 2017 Taylor & Francis  
launched an initiative to provide journal content to academics  
and the wider public in Egypt, as part of an agreement with  
the Egyptian Knowledge Bank, a government-backed  
national knowledge archive. 
ACADEMIC PUBLISHING CONTINUED
CONNECTING BOOK CONTENT, 
CREATING NEW OPPORTUNITIES 
In 2016, Taylor & Francis’s Journals content moved  
onto a single online platform – T&F Online – a new, 
optimised and user-friendly repository for nearly 4m 
specialist academic articles. 
In 2017, it was the turn of the Division’s ebooks content  
– over 100,000 ebooks, 1.4m chapters, countless 
paragraphs and every subject area we publish on – to 
migrate to a single digital destination for the first time. 
Mark Majurey, Commercial Director & Vice President, 
Digital, at Taylor & Francis explained: “The project to unify 
our books content, making the huge amount of knowledge 
housed in this format more discoverable and usable  
for customers and better showing the wealth T&F 
publishes, was the next part in a Division-wide GAP 
investment initiative.
“The challenge was huge – we have one of the largest 
collections of e-content in book form of any publisher.  
It took 11 months building and testing, during which we 
trialled the platform with six institutions from the US,  
UK and Hong Kong, to make sure it would address how 
individual researchers and institutions would actually  
use it and understand where the gaps were.”
The Taylor & Francis ebooks platform at  
www.taylorfrancis.com went live to all customers  
over September and October. But as Mark explains,  
this is just the first step. 
“The reception has been positive. The platform opens  
up more possibilities and value for customers now that 
they can more quickly and accurately find content on 
their specialist topic that might have been buried before, 
connect chapters in different books, gain new insights, and 
make and share new discoveries. With more use being 
made of the content, author satisfaction is also improved. 
“Commercially, increasing usage means that over time, 
we can build on our current ebook revenue streams  
and explore new opportunities from additional digital 
services. We’re excited about the possibility of adding 
extra features that make ebooks behave differently to 
print books – from animation to additional data sets. 
“We can also see exactly what users are interested in and 
are consuming, target them with related content in a more 
personalised way, share analytics with institutions and 
work with them to tailor pricing to the value their users  
are getting. It also makes it easier to add new content on  
a continuous basis.”

DIVISIONAL REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHY (%)
Another key trend is the use of technology and digital platforms, 
whether for content delivery, customer tracking or search 
capability. The nature of peer-reviewed research, with its citations 
and cross references to other research, makes it well suited to a 
digital format, allowing readers to switch easily between articles 
and search for other relevant material on the same subject. This 
has been a driver of journal content usage in recent years.
Book content also has the potential to become more valuable 
through more granular digitisation, with the ability to identify 
individual chapters and sections relevant to a particular topic.  
In a world where electronic search is ubiquitous, the importance 
of making content discoverable in this way is likely to increase.
Digitisation also creates an opportunity for publishers to better 
understand customers and anticipate their needs by tracking  
and analysing usage and consumption. Such analytics can 
inform commissioning decisions, balancing typically supply-
based editorial models with demand-based evidence. At a time 
when budgets at many institutions and libraries are relatively flat, 
analytics are also being used to assist customer purchasing 
decisions and demonstrate value, with annual and multi-year 
packages tailored to content usage. 
2018 FOCUS AND POSSIBILITIES
The focus for the Academic Publishing Division in 2018, in  
its first full year under the leadership of Annie Callanan, is to 
maintain a consistent performance in the core Journals and 
Books businesses, while extending and capitalising on the  
digital publishing initiatives undertaken through GAP. 
Investment will continue in end-to-end digital processes  
and capabilities that respond to the way knowledge is used  
and shared today, that support increased content use and 
discoverability, generate new analytics and insight, and  
allow the business to explore new areas of innovation and  
growth, such as digital research services. 
We will continue to offer a range of flexible publishing models. 
This will include further expansion in open access, through new 
journal launches and potentially converting certain subscription 
journals to this model, leveraging the specialist production 
capabilities acquired with Dove Medical Press. 
Operating an efficient and scalable business will also remain  
a focus, with further initiatives underway to capture efficiencies  
in common areas of operational and production processes. 
Quality, depth and specialism of content are at the core of what  
the business provides to customers. Academics and institutions 
rely on the quality assurance that accompanies new research 
published in major journals to adopt new thinking and apply it to 
their own research. Equally, they expect rigorous analysis and 
challenge for their research output to be recognised, published 
and associated with our reputed brands or those of society 
partners such as the Mathematical Association of America,  
which we will launch a journal with in 2018.
Through curating, publishing and disseminating such knowledge 
professionally and effectively, we provide value to the academic 
community that can benefit the wider population.

Examples of product launches include the new Ovum Forecaster 
product in the TMT vertical, which responds to greater convergence 
in the mobile, fixed line and TV services market by delivering 
integrated data and forecasts across more than 140 metrics. The 
Finance vertical introduced an upgraded fund flow research and 
analytics platform for the EPFR brand, and in Agribusiness the 
Fertecon platform was refreshed, allowing customers to better 
search, manipulate and export data on global fertiliser markets. 
Following the addition of Penton Information Services brands  
to Business Intelligence, it became meaningfully bigger in  
2017 . Around 30% of the Penton business, including around  
100 digital and print-based insight products and 400 colleagues, 
was combined with Business Intelligence in the first half of 
2017 . This has further expanded its presence in the US, led to  
the creation of a sixth vertical, Infrastructure, including specialist 
brands such as IndustryWeek and EquipmentWatch, and 
broadened the coverage of the Transportation vertical to include 
automotives and trucking alongside maritime. 
Penton also brought new capabilities in specialist B2B marketing 
services, which provides customers with tools and specialist 
products to target new sales leads and promote new products. 
Customers can leverage our deep knowledge of vertical markets, 
database of segmented professional audiences and expertise  
in content-led marketing to reach those making purchasing 
decisions effectively. This business was relaunched as Informa 
Engage in September and will work more broadly across the 
Group in 2018.
Business Intelligence is a subscription-led Division, accounting 
for around 75% of its revenue. Penton has broadened the revenue 
mix to incorporate specialist marketing services, and the consulting 
business also continues to grow. Both are contingent on the 
subscriptions business, building from its customer relationships 
and specialist expertise. 
The Division also has a collection of B2B media brands, many  
of which are print-based or generate revenue through print and 
digital advertising. There is a natural shift in spend between the 
two and this is being managed carefully. Print declines eased 
since the integration of the Penton businesses into the Division, a 
reflection of a more commercial approach to this revenue stream. 
Another change as part of the Penton integration was to appoint 
two Divisional managing directors, each responsible for three 
vertical businesses. The six businesses also became more 
autonomous by moving previously shared functions such as 
sales and marketing into each business and streamlining 
Divisional central support. 
This has brought greater market focus, with management teams 
more directly accountable for performance and able to allocate 
resources and manage cost accordingly.

T
he Business Intelligence Division provides  
specialist data, insight and intelligence for 
professionals and businesses operating within  
six international vertical markets: Agribusiness, 
Finance, Infrastructure, Pharmaceuticals, 
Transportation, and Technology, Media and Telecoms (TMT).  
It is a digital subscription business, with additional revenue coming 
from specialist marketing services and consulting services with 
these verticals. The Division’s more than 200 product brands 
serve an international customer base, helping them make more 
informed business decisions and gain competitive advantage.
2017 FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 
One of the key objectives of the 2014-2017 Growth Acceleration 
Plan was to repair and return the Business Intelligence Division 
to growth. 
In 2016, the Division reported positive underlying revenue growth 
for the first time in six years, and this positive momentum carried 
into 2017 , leading to further steady improvement in underlying 
revenue growth to 2.2%. This growth was broad-based with  
all six verticals now in positive growth. 
Business Intelligence received the largest portion of GAP 
funding to upgrade its content and platform functionality,  
develop new offerings and improve its sales and marketing.  
The continued improvement in its performance reflects the 
benefit of this investment, with a steady deployment of new 
product launches and platform enhancements through 2017 , 
boosting subscription renewals, new business pipelines and 
annualised contract values, as well as helping to drive consulting 
and specialist marketing services revenue.

INFORMATION SERVICES MARKET TRENDS 
Business Intelligence operates in the growing and international 
market for B2B information services. Consultants Outsell estimate 
that the market for B2B media and business information was 
worth around $40bn in 2016 and grew at 3.1%, part of the wider 
$1.6tn global information industry, nearly 50% of which is based 
in the US. 
Key trends across this market reflect the explosion of digital 
media, with a dramatic increase in the consumption of 
information and data digitally and the innovation and utility  
that this has brought. In the continuing shift from a push to a  
pull environment, customers increasingly want to select and 
combine different pieces of intelligence and data from different 
sources, integrating them into their own models and workflows 
for additional proprietary analysis and business application. 
Responding to this trend, many product upgrades under GAP 
have focused on making the digital delivery of data more flexible 
and user-friendly, on our own platforms and through developing 
APIs that enable customers to take data feeds direct into their 
own systems.
UPGRADING PRODUCTS  
FOR CUSTOMER SUCCESS  
AND VALUE
Fertecon, part of the Agribusiness vertical, provides over 
1,500 customers with data and intelligence on the market 
for global fertilisers. But its historical format – PDF 
reports delivered by email, with limited online presence 
– was increasingly preventing the full use of content  
and data by customers, as well as limiting the ability  
of sales teams to attract new subscribers and product 
development teams to create additional services. 
Through GAP’s investment programme, work started to 
upgrade Fertecon’s entire digital interface and service  
in early 2017. Michael Dell, President and Managing 
Director for Agribusiness Intelligence, explained: “This 
was a wholesale redevelopment project, moving to 
interactive data delivery and re-engineering workflows 
and technology to deliver an improved experience and 
product performance overall. We took six months of 
product development time, beta testing with customers 
and incorporating their feedback to ensure the 
redevelopment would hit the mark. 
“In terms of key features, at the heart was fast access  
to Fertecon’s market data, and improved search. If you 
can’t get search right – comprehensive, accurate, quick –  
customers won’t know about, let alone be able to find and 
utilise, the wealth of insight and data Fertecon produces. 
“Learning from other Business Intelligence GAP projects, 
improving data download and export features was also 
critical. Customers want to take data to use in their own 
market models, files and presentations, and facilitating 
that provides them with flexibility and better value from 
their subscriptions.”
New elements introduced include interactive cost curves 
for Fertecon Outlook subscribers, plus Data Explorer,  
a set of tools that enable Fertecon’s global fertiliser price, 
supply, demand, cost and trade data to be dynamically 
investigated, compared, charted and exported. 
The new site launched in October 2017 with an immediate 
impact on usage including a 90% increase in unique 
monthly active users, 160% increase in monthly visits  
and a more than 200% increase in average page views 
per visit compared with the previous website. 
Michael summarised: “This upgrade has delivered greater 
value for current customers and improved the ability  
of our sales teams to achieve renewals and seek new 
business. On top of this, it gives us a platform for exploring 
and introducing additional services and enhancements  
in the future, not just for Fertecon, but also through 
combining and building on our proprietary market 
intelligence across the full Agribusiness value chain.”

Over the same period, intelligence – trusted, specialist, action-
oriented insight that provides information on what businesses 
can and should do – has increased in value, as customers seek 
to gain competitive advantage in the information era, more so 
than general news reporting or simple industry analysis, which 
can increasingly be found for free. 
The more specialist an information services product is, the more 
predictive and intelligence focused, and the closer its application 
is to critical business decisions and investment plans in a given 
market, the more value the product tends to have and, hence,  
the stickier it is and more defensible within customer budgets.
Each of our Business Intelligence brands operates in a specific 
vertical market, and the trends within each vertical influence  
the business’s positioning and prospects. The Division tends  
to focus on verticals that are international, fast moving and in 
growth, and in niche markets, which typically mean there are 
fewer competitors for our brands. Several are showcased on 
pages 14 to 19, including the markets for Pharma and TMT.
2018 FOCUS AND POSSIBILITIES
In 2018, the focus for Business Intelligence will be to maintain  
its recent positive momentum, delivering further steady 
improvement in underlying revenue growth, with a target to  
at least match wider industry growth levels of around 3%.
To achieve this, we will continue to focus the business around 
verticals and customers, and invest in strengthening delivery 
platforms and developing new products. Customer retention will 
remain key, as will building and converting our new business 
pipeline to expand the customer base by category and 
geographically. This will include more focus on international 
growth, including in markets such as Asia. 
We will also continue to build our contingent revenue base, 
building on the launch of Informa Engage and the relaunch  
of the consulting business. Informa Engage will seek to apply  
its specialist skills and marketing capabilities across a broader 
range of verticals and international customers, partnering not  
just with businesses in Business Intelligence but also in the 
other Operating Divisions. 
Another constant in the Division will be the commitment  
to continuous reinvestment in platform innovation and  
new product development to maintain the quality, value  
and relevance of our brands. As new and refreshed products 
deliver a better experience and greater value, this should  
increase customer loyalty and support continued growth. 
The attraction and retention of talent, and the addition of  
skills in key areas such as product development, data and 
analytics, also remain critical to the delivery of the Division’s 
growth ambitions. We remain equally committed to investing  
in colleagues to develop the talent and expertise needed to  
lead and grow the business.

GLOBAL EXHIBITIONS
Recent acquisitions have increased its weighting to the US and 
brought new and expanded positions in key industry verticals.  
In March, Global Exhibitions added YPI, a portfolio of US 
yachting shows which includes the Fort Lauderdale International 
Boat Show, the largest of its kind in the world. YPI’s brands 
complement our existing position in International Yachting 
through the Monaco Yacht Show, adding further depth and 
international reach in this vertical. 
The acquisition of Penton Information Services in late 2016 
materially expanded our portfolio of exhibitions. Around 60% of 
Penton’s businesses were combined with Global Exhibitions.  
a process completed in the first half of 2017 , with each business 
operating and reporting as a single unit through the second half 
of the year. 
The combination with Penton particularly strengthened our 
positions in Health & Nutrition, with the New Hope and Natural 
Products Expo brands joining our Vitafoods range; in Agriculture 
with the US Farm Progress show joining the Agrishow brand in 
Brazil; and in Sustainability & Waste with Waste Expo complementing 
the WWETT show. This has expanded customer relationships, 
increased our market knowledge and international connections 
and strengthened the role we play in supporting trade and 
commerce in these specialist industry sectors. 
Our top 30 events were again a key driver of growth, with strong 
performance across major brands that account for over 60% of 
Divisional revenues, including Arab Health (Life Sciences), Natural 
Products Expo West (Health & Nutrition) and China Beauty 
(Beauty & Aesthetics).
A number of product initiatives also contributed to 2017 growth. 
In Dubai, we successfully separated MEDLAB from the venue-
bound Arab Health – see overleaf for more detail. 
The rollout of a customer value initiative to a number of exhibitions 
took place, after a successful trial of tiered, value-based pricing  
at The International Surfaces Event. This provides flexibility for 
exhibitors through a more customer service-oriented approach, 
with the potential to improve rebooking rates and generate 
incremental yields. This initiative is being extended to a number  
of other exhibitions in 2018.
Investment continued in developing our digital and data 
capabilities, both to strengthen marketing and sales effectiveness, 
and in relation to our Market Maker strategy. The Division is 
building a number of vertical-specific platforms under the  
MarkitMakr brand, to address revenue opportunities outside  
of exhibitions and leverage customer relationships and industry 
knowledge to connect buyers and sellers online. The first, Omnia, 
launched in Life Sciences, to provide customers with rich data  
on buyer behaviour and targeted, developed sales leads. 
MarkitMakr platforms in other verticals are in development  
and due to be rolled out progressively from 2018 onwards.

verticals including Agriculture, Beauty & Aesthetics, Construction

2017 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A key element of the Growth Acceleration Plan has been to expand 
the Group’s position in the growing B2B exhibitions industry, and 
particularly in its single largest market, the US, through underlying 
growth and the targeted addition of new businesses. 
This focus continued in 2017 , producing another year of strong 
above-market growth alongside continued investment and 
innovation. The Division delivered underlying revenue growth of 
7 .6%, and revenues of £560.4m, of which 57% was generated  
in North America, making Global Exhibitions Informa’s single 
largest Division by revenue.

EXHIBITIONS TRENDS
The global exhibitions industry continues to grow at above  
GDP levels. Consultants AMR International estimate it expanded 
by 4.3% in 2016 to $30bn, and forecast an annualised growth 
rate of 4.2% between 2016 and 2021. 
The US is by far the largest market for exhibitions, with China 
second. Building & Construction is the single largest sector.  
It remains a highly fragmented market – the four largest 
commercial organisers account for just 9% of the US market  
– creating a backdrop for continued consolidation. 
Industry growth is supported by the enduring value of face-to-
face interaction between buyers and sellers, particularly in a 
world of increasing digital communication. A platform where 
buyers in an industry vertical can access multiple suppliers 
efficiently and effectively, learn about and source new products 
and services, and transact has become part of the annual  
buying cycle for many businesses. Similarly for sellers, the trade 
show has become an increasingly important part of the sales 
cycle as a tool for building customer pipeline for the year and  
for launching new products. 
ADDRESSING EXHIBITION 
DEMAND, CREATING NEW 
MARKETS 
Arab Health is the largest medical exhibition in the  
Middle East and the second largest in the world. For the 
last 43 years, it has been held at the Dubai International 
Convention and Exhibition Centre, the region’s largest 
events venue. 
“Healthcare is a booming industry in the Middle East and 
we are incredibly proud of our role in helping companies 
showcase their products and services, share medical 
innovation and do business in the region,” said Arab 
Health show director Ross Williams.
 “The show is a buzzing place – in 2016 there were over 
4,100 exhibitors across more than 22 halls, plus many 
ancillary events and country pavilions. But when we 
looked at the market’s development versus the space 
available at the event venue, we could see that our  
growth and ability to meet increasing exhibitor  
demands would start to be curtailed.” 
After exploring options for additional space nearby,  
and consulting with key customers and business  
partners, the team decided to separate one of the  
largest sub-areas at Arab Health – MEDLAB – into  
its own dedicated exhibition focusing on the medical 
laboratory sector of the healthcare industry. 
This addressed market demand, freed up more exhibition 
floor space at Arab Health and expanded laboratory 
interest in the region, allowing for more exhibitors and 
educational tracks. 
In 2017, MEDLAB was held immediately after Arab  
Health at the same venue, to minimise disruption to 
participants’ calendars and to allow them to attend  
both events successively.
It was a customer and commercial success. “MEDLAB 
attracted more than 570 international exhibitors and 
20,000 attendees, with positive feedback from customers,” 
said Tom Coleman, MEDLAB, Group Exhibition Director. 
MEDLAB also immediately ranked amongst the Division’s 
top 30 events, and generated a new business opportunity 
for the Division. “Splitting out the events helped cement 
medical laboratory as its own sector and create a true 
community in this space. 
“Thanks to the commercial success our customers had, 
and our own trading performance, we were able to bring 
an additional MEDLAB event to the European market in 
Barcelona in 2017, and are extending the brand into the 
US in 2018. It has been a successful enterprise in its own 
right and has created a new market for our exhibitions,” 
Coleman concluded.

In this way, major exhibition brands can become fundamental  
to the commercial health and success of an industry sector, 
helping to drive investment and growth. As they become 
established, they become an annual convening place for an 
industry and many exhibitors will pre-book their space far in 
advance, providing organisers with high levels of visibility on  
their own revenue, as well as attractive cash dynamics. 
Exhibition organisers rely on a range of resources and stakeholders 
to deliver events, from trade association partners to venue 
owners, suppliers of stand services and hotels. For an example  
of how we work with partners to deliver exhibitions, see page 41. 
For any individual exhibition, the biggest single risk is anything 
that disrupts travel to the local area or the venue, such as extreme 
weather conditions or security-related travel restrictions. The 
mitigations we put in place for such events are explained in the 
Risk Management section on page 24. 
Each of our Global Exhibitions brands operates in a specific 
vertical industry sector, and the features and trends within these 
specialist markets have an influence on the performance of the 
show. We typically focus on verticals that are international, dynamic 
and in growth, with a fragmented supply chain where buyers and 
sellers value opportunities to meet. Several are showcased on 
pages 14 to 19, including Aviation and Health & Nutrition. 
2018 FOCUS AND POSSIBILITIES 
Global Exhibitions is targeting a further year of growth ahead  
of the market in 2018, supported by continued growth in the 
wider industry and our strong portfolio of major brands in 
growing, attractive industry verticals. 
Following the successful integration of Penton, the Division has 
greater scale and increased balance and breadth internationally 
and by sector. This is delivering cost efficiencies in general 
contracting and marketing, as well as revenue benefits through 
cross-marketing, international sales and geo-cloning. 
The investment in our digital and data capabilities made under 
GAP will continue, further strengthening customer relationships 
and presence in key verticals. Products like MarkitMakr provide 
new opportunities to connect with customers throughout the 
year, and an enriched quality and depth of data can be used to 
create new products and services. Reflecting this potential for 
growth, AMR has forecast annual digital revenue growth in the 
exhibition industry of 9% between 2016 and 2021. 
Operationally, 2018 will see the phased introduction of a new, 
single sales platform across the Division to improve sales 
effectiveness and enable greater cross-selling, plus the 
completion of a marketing platform rollout that provides greater 
flexibility and efficiency in targeting new and existing customers. 
There are additional growth possibilities from extending our 
brands into new geographic markets, notably in Asia. Global 
Exhibitions has a small but growing presence in China, where 
our approach has been to partner with local businesses that  
have connections and capabilities in our target verticals, to  
bring our brands to a new, largely national, audience. 
As the Division grows in reach and scale, further opportunities 
arise to generate efficiencies in areas such as procurement, as 
well as incremental revenue opportunities such as sponsorship 
where we are able to monetise access to specialist audiences.

Technology Arena for the first time in 2017 , which helped  
to boost attendance to a record of nearly 13,000. 
While the Division has increased its focus on core verticals  
and larger, branded events, there have also been investments  
in strengthening digital capabilities to build and develop 
communities online as well as face to face. By creating  
websites for specialist communities that provide relevant  
content, webinars, videos and white papers, the Division’s  
brands are becoming more deeply embedded in the verticals  
and communities. This enhances customer relationships, builds 
loyalty around core branded events and provides new revenue 
opportunities, particularly in specialist marketing services. 
As part of the strategy to simplify the Division, in November  
we completed the sale of Euroforum, our German and  
Swiss conference business, to leading German media group 
Handelsblatt. This follows the prior sale of regional conference 
businesses in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Russia amongst 
others, each of which largely focused on domestic language, 
one-off spot conferences. 
Proactive portfolio management leaves the Division streamlined, 
with a core of internationally focused events in key verticals and 
geographic hubs. To support this structure and focus on end 
markets and customers, the operating model was updated 
during 2017 to give each vertical business greater autonomy,  
with dedicated commercial, operational and marketing teams 
and a more streamlined central Divisional support function.
Following the acquisition of Penton Information Services in  
late 2016, around 10% of the Penton business was integrated  
into Knowledge & Networking. This included complementary 
brands in TMT including TU Automotive and critical communications 
event IWCE, plus specialist content-focused platforms in the 
Food and Restaurant and Meetings areas. These businesses 
have helped increase the Division’s presence in North America, 
which now accounts for 40% of revenue. 
EVENTS TRENDS
The content-led confex, conference, community and event sector 
that Knowledge & Networking serves helps professionals stay 
up to date on trends and innovation in their specialist areas, gain 
insight and knowledge from experts and network with peers, 
supporting personal and business success. 
Revenue is generated in a number of ways, including delegate 
fees from attendees at an event, which are typically paid for by 
employers with booking taking place up until the first day of the 
programme. Sponorship is another major source of revenue,  
with corporates investing in promotional activities connected  
to the event, including presenter and demonstration slots. 
Amongst our confex brands, we also generate revenue through 
selling exhibition space, where suppliers promote and sell  
goods and services. This is typically smaller than sponsorship 
and delegate income but is increasingly significant, particularly  
at better established and branded events. 
Corporate marketers’ spend on events remains strong, with 
consultants Outsell estimating growth of nearly 3% in event budgets 
in 2017 as they seek to reach targeted and engaged audiences.

Sciences, TMT and Global Finance – with an additional specialist

2017 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE
One of the key objectives of the Growth Acceleration Plan was to 
streamline and bring greater focus to Knowledge & Networking, 
shifting it away from smaller conferences and towards branded 
events and networks within targeted vertical communities. 
Following a programme of investment and restructuring designed 
to stabilise, simplify and strengthen the Division, Knowledge & 
Networking returned to positive underlying growth in 2017 for 
the first time since the launch of GAP, moving from a revenue 
decline of -4.1% in 2016 to growth of 0.1%. 
This reflected strong trading among the Division’s largest 40 
events and in all three major verticals, including Global Finance, 
which celebrated the 20th edition of SuperReturn, our leading

BRINGING FESTIVALS TO 
PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITIES
2017 marked the first year of KNect365’s partnership  
to deliver London Tech Week, a festival of technology 
innovation, inspiration, learning, networking and 
showcases across London. 
“The festival concept is a new type of model for B2B 
events. For London Tech Week, we worked with different 
partners – most notably, the Mayor’s Office through its 
agency London Partners – and a host of businesses, 
entrepreneurs and innovators to curate and deliver a 
multi-day, multi-venue, multi-format and topical experience 
in one city, all designed to connect and promote the 
success of the UK and international tech community,” said 
Carolyn Dawson, Managing Director for the TMT vertical.
London Tech Week comprised more than 200 individual 
events, from seminars and talks to demonstrations, 
workshops, debates, meet-ups, parties and concerts. More 
than 55,000 people from over 90 countries attended, 
making it Europe’s largest tech gathering in 2017. 
“This festival is something KNect365 would have found 
much more challenging to deliver effectively before GAP,” 
Carolyn continued. “Streamlining the Division helped  
us focus on building our tech brands, capabilities and 
relationships, and GAP investments brought improvements 
to our digital estate that allowed us to present and promote 
London Tech Week as a unified brand.”
It also created new opportunities to showcase KNect365’s 
wider Technology portfolio. “As part of the festival, we ran 
TechXLR8, a portfolio of eight KNect365 events covering 
augmented and virtual reality to connected cars and 5G 
broadband. Our LeadersIn Tech Summit was packed out 
thanks to the calibre of speakers. KNect365 Learning ran 
an Innovation Academy, which included a mini-MBA for 
developing tech leaders. 
“And I’m particularly proud of the partnership we had with 
the youth charity The Prince’s Trust. We committed that  
a legacy of the festival would be developing talent in the 
tech space, and we facilitated with The Prince’s Trust a 
Get Started in Digital Media programme for a group of 
young people, to help them explore the field and build  
their skills, with a view to securing further training or 
employment,” said Carolyn. 
KNect365 is looking to apply this festival model to other 
verticals and cities. In September 2017, it launched 
Biotech Week Boston with a similar approach in the  
Life Sciences vertical.

To be successful, event organisers need to invest in their  
brands and the experiences they offer, demonstrating value  
and making them must-attend events in their community or 
sector. This is achieved by bringing together and engaging  
niche international communities, providing exclusive content  
and expert insights, as well as creating structured opportunities 
for networking and partnering, while promoting brands effectively 
both online and offline. 
Knowledge & Networking is now focused on three key verticals, 
and the trends within each industry sector will ultimately influence 
its performance. The Division has deliberately focused on building 
larger-scale, branded positions in verticals that are international 
and in growth, and where high levels of change and innovation 
create an ongoing need to keep up to date with developments. 
Several of these verticals are showcased on pages 14 to 19, 
including TMT. 
2018 FOCUS AND POSSIBILITIES 
Following the Growth Acceleration Plan, Knowledge & 
Networking enters 2018 in positive growth, with greater  
focus around its customers and markets.
The sale of a majority stake in the German and Swiss  
conference business Euroforum leaves the Division more 
streamlined, focused on branded confexes and events within  
the three core verticals of Life Sciences, Finance and TMT.
Combined with our investment in digital capabilities to build 
audiences online and offline, and increasing traction in specialist 
marketing services, this leaves Knowledge & Networking  
well positioned to continue delivering a steady and improving 
performance. Improved marketing and e-commerce platforms 
have strengthened the visibility and presence of our brands 
online, leading to higher inbound enquiries and increased  
volume of natural search leads. At the same time, investment  
in the events experience and a more structured process for 
gathering and interpreting customer feedback is leading to 
increased levels of satisfaction and higher rebooking rates.
The next phase of investment will focus on strengthening  
our digital content publishing platform with enhanced social 
media capabilities. This will build further year-round customer 
engagement, delivering specialist content and tools to reach 
engaged online audiences. 
The development of our sales processes and capabilities will 
continue in order to improve customer management and lead 
conversion rates, including the rollout of a new common sales 
platform to assist campaign planning and forecasting. This will 
also help the Division in its work to ensure readiness for new 
European data privacy regulations that come into effect in 2018 
– see page 24 for activities already undertaken. The training 
available to colleagues in core functions like sales, event 
production and marketing will continue, ensuring the skills  
and talent needed for long-term performance and success.
Across the market, the rise of digital connectivity has created 
opportunities and challenges. Increased digitisation has led  
to more business and customer interaction happening online, 
increasing the value of face-to-face platforms that provide  
access to customers, communities and networks at scale. 
The Internet has also provided a powerful platform for free 
content and information, including video and instantaneous 
expert opinions and views. This has reduced the value and 
uniqueness of some conference content. At the same time 
however, specialist branded content, delivered online, can 
engage vertical communities year-round and create new  
revenue possibilities in areas such as specialist marketing 
services, and in which Knowledge & Networking is investing.

These changes have simplified the HR organisation and brought 
consistency and equity to what the Group provides to US-based 
colleagues, incorporating both current Informa colleagues and 
new joiners from acquired businesses, including Penton and YPI. 
In 2018, this standardisation of platforms and processes will be 
extended through the introduction of a single common applicant 
tracking system internationally, making it easier to analyse the mix 
of talent attracted to the Group and how consistently candidate 
applications are processed. The team is working on a common 
global online learning platform to make the delivery of compliance 
and career-development training more efficient. 
In Finance, after preparatory work in 2016, Global Business 
Services launched a new Group-wide SAP enterprise  
resource platform, designed to consolidate, standardise  
and upgrade our financial operations globally and replace 
multiple out-of-date systems. 
The platform was rolled-out in phases by Division and  
geography during the year, to allow findings and learnings  
to be applied iteratively to future releases, and the majority  
of the Group is now live.
Once the platform is fully in place, it will bring benefits from 
simplifying our financial processes and generating improved 
management information, as well as enabling increased volumes 
of transactions to be processed efficiently as the Group grows, 
and allowing acquired businesses to be incorporated into 
processes and reporting infrastructure more easily. 
Global Business Services Technology also played an extensive  
part in the implementation of the new enterprise resource 
platform and retirement of legacy financial technology during 
2017 . The team also worked on the programme to onboard 
Penton Information Services into Informa’s technology 
infrastructure and start decommissioning old platforms. 
The resilience of our infrastructure remains a priority Group-wide 
matter, using cloud-based technology to maximise availability, 
and this is led by Global Support’s technology teams in close 
collaboration with the technology leadership of each Division.
In 2017 , we continued to invest in enhanced information  
security measures, from additional threat detection capabilities  
to enhanced authentication measures for colleagues. 
Our awareness programmes to support colleagues and mitigate  
risk are being expanded for 2018, including new information 
security training based on our information security and 
acceptable use policies and new cyber security solutions 
designed to address emerging and real-world digital risk. 
EXPERT DIRECTION AND SUPPORT  
FROM GROUP FUNCTIONS
Global Support’s Group functions work closely and 
collaboratively with Divisional teams and senior management  
with a common purpose: to provide expert advice, direction  
and support that enables the Divisions and the Group to execute  
their strategies effectively.
During 2017 , the integration of Penton Information Services 
involved many Group teams, with business planning and  
change management overseeing the progress and success 
THE TEAM  
BEHIND  
THE TEAMS
G
lobal Support provides common, efficient business 
services to the four Operating Divisions, and the 
leadership and governance that enables the Group 
to function effectively and fulfil its growth ambitions.
It has three major hubs – London and Colchester  
in the UK, Sarasota in the US and Singapore – with around  
850 colleagues. The integration of Penton Information Services 
into the Group in 2017 added around 100 colleagues to Global 
Support, largely in the US and predominantly in legal, finance 
and technology. 
Global Support is structured into two areas: Group, which 
comprises specialist functions such as legal, company  
secretary, brand, investor relations and corporate development, 
and Global Business Services, which delivers centralised and 
scalable technology, finance and HR support services that 
enable the Operating Divisions to focus on implementing their 
commercial plans. 
Since the outset of the Growth Acceleration Plan, Global 
Support has focused on putting in place the infrastructure,  
the talent and expertise and the capabilities to support the 
Group’s growth plans, particularly the ambition to expand  
in scale and international reach. 
2017 saw a number of developments focused on supporting 
future growth, including the rollout of a common finance  
reporting and information platform, and the creation of a 
centralised health, safety and security function with new 
investments in security and travel-related support.
The ambition for 2018 is to maintain the responsiveness  
and effectiveness of our Global Business Services offering, 
continuously scanning for opportunities to leverage our  
increased scale to deliver efficiencies, and to strengthen  
our functional centres of excellence, in part by ensuring  
Global Support is a stimulating and rewarding place to  
work for current colleagues and future talent. 
ROBUST AND SCALABLE GLOBAL  
BUSINESS SERVICES 
In 2017 , Global Business Services continued and extended 
several initiatives based on implementing robust, efficient  
and high quality systems and processes, with the long-term  
aim of leveraging benefits from common, scalable platforms. 
In HR, Global Business Services led the design and implementation 
of a new, consistent approach to benefits and HR processes in 
the US. This included introducing a single payroll system and 
approach to timekeeping and salary payments, and a common 
yet flexible benefits offer in time for 2018.

PROVIDING LEADERSHIP ON 
DATA AND INFORMATION USE
Alongside the programme to enhance Informa’s codes 
and policies described on page 37, in 2017 the Group 
compliance team was responsible for leading Informa’s 
data privacy programme, including developments to 
prepare for new privacy regulations including the 
introduction of the European General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) in 2018. 
For Informa, a particular impact of GDPR is the way 
data and information is used in the marketing activities 
conducted by each Operating Division, and the risk  
of non-compliance with privacy regulation has now 
been recognised as a principal risk for the Group. 
Over the year, the team conducted data mapping  
and readiness assessments per Division, revised  
and updated internal policies and processes around  
the way personal data is handled and established  
a data privacy management forum, bringing together 
stakeholders from across the Group to develop and 
implement our plans to achieve compliance. Global 
Support has also invested in the new role of Group  
data protection officer to better co-ordinate and 
enhance how data is used by the organisation. 
STRENGTHENED  
APPROACH TO HEALTH, 
SAFETY AND SECURITY
A new Global Support team was created in late 2017 – 
Group health, safety and security – to centralise  
and strengthen our capabilities in managing health, 
safety and security risk, matters that had previously  
been managed within the Operating Divisions. 
The team is divided into three areas: Informa’s events, 
our offices, and colleagues when they travel for business.  
It is responsible for setting policies in each area, reviewing 
how each Division operates in each region and reporting 
to senior management, the Risk Committee and the Board. 
It also provides expert guidance to Divisional teams on 
matters like venue assessment and approval, where 
local operations teams focus on implementation and 
working with venues and suppliers. 
Security risk management was introduced during the 
year, in recognition of the growing global threat of 
terrorism. The team made new and experienced hires, 
designed security-specific training for event operations 
teams that will be rolled out globally and widened to 
include senior managers in 2018, and is introducing 
security risk assessments.
The team is working towards achieving certification  
in the new ISO 45001 occupational health and safety 
standard over an 18-month period. 
Investments were also made to improve the infrastructure 
and support available to colleagues when travelling for 
work. This included the introduction of a global supplier for 
booking business travel that brings standardisation and 
scale benefits, as well reporting capabilities, to the Group. 
An additional emergency assistance service came into 
effect in early 2018, providing real-time intelligence  
on travel risks and dedicated crisis assistance for 
colleagues in the event of an emergency.
CONTRIBUTING TO 
COMMUNITIES AND TO 
COMMERCIAL SUCCESS 
Global Support incorporates a dedicated sustainability 
function, providing leadership and subject matter 
expertise to all areas of the Group. 
The goal is for each part of the Group to recognise and 
capitalise on the contribution sustainability makes to the 
communities Informa works with and in, as well as the 
business opportunity. We believe there are commercial 
opportunities and competitive advantage from delivering 
a positive impact through our activities and products.
The sustainability team reports to the Director of 
Investor Relations to ensure business alignment. The 
team’s strategy has four pillars, with a primary focus  
on the content we produce and its role in disseminating 
knowledge to help customers solve challenges. The  
other three elements are how Informa works with 
specialist communities, the way colleagues are 
supported, and our impact on the environment. 
Global Support’s sustainability team co-ordinates  
global activities in these areas, and 2017 saw a  
number of highlights built on 2016’s sustainable 
innovation programme. A greater number of event 
impact assessments were conducted, which analyse  
the value of major exhibitions and conferences to local 
areas and build our relationships with host cities.
In 2018, further work will be conducted to improve 
Informa’s understanding of key stakeholders and the 
issues that matter to them. 
Support will also be provided to vertical teams to 
identify the commercial opportunities arising from  
the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, a worldwide 
set of goals and targets that are directing government  
and corporate investment into particular areas of 
society and the economy, as well as to recognise how 
our products and services help customers and society 
progress towards those goals. 
The team is also working on an internal campaign to 
showcase the many ways in which sustainability can  
be incorporated into events to enhance our contribution 
to customers and host cities. 
This includes benchmarking criteria brought to life 
through a set of 40 ideas that can enhance an event’s 
positive impact. For more information and stories, see 
the dedicated Sustainability Report.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
2017 HIGHLIGHTS
Throughout the last four years of GAP, we have focused our 
financial management and operations on maximising the 
generation of cash while remaining disciplined in our approach  
to funding and leverage. 
This provides stability and the flexibility to reinvest for growth, 
pursue accretive acquisitions and pay a progressive dividend to 
Shareholders, while meeting the Group’s financing commitments. 
Our improving financial performance in 2017 reflects the 
operational progress achieved under GAP and described  
in the Divisional Review, combined with favourable currency 
movements and strong returns from acquisitions. 
Over the year, these included the purchase of US-based 
international yachting exhibitions group YPI for net cash 
consideration of £111m, and the acquisition of specialist  
open access publisher Dove Medical Press for net cash 
consideration of £43m. 
Financial highlights for the year include: 
• Underlying revenue growth of +3.4% and reported revenue 
growth of +30.7%, reflecting the full year effect of the addition 
of Penton in November 2016. 
• Underlying adjusted operating profit growth of +2.3% and 
reported growth in adjusted operating profit of +31.3%. 
•  Adjusted diluted EPS growth of +9.5% and reported EPS 
growth of +60.2%.
•  Strong operating cash conversion of 91%, and +31% growth 
in free cash flow to £400.9m.
The combination of strong cash generation and our balanced 
approach to funding led to a robust balance sheet at year end, 
with net debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times, back within our target range 
of 2.0 to 2.5 times.
I
n 2017 , the final year of the Growth Acceleration Plan, 
Informa delivered further operational progress and an 
improving financial performance, producing a fourth 
consecutive year of growth in revenue, adjusted earnings  
per share, free cash flow and dividends.
This performance, and the Group’s broader financial position, 
continue to be underpinned by our robust business model, the 
attractive markets in which we operate, sound financial discipline 
and improving operational momentum from the various GAP 
initiatives implemented over the last four years. 
GROUP FINANCIAL CHARACTERISTICS
In 2017 , almost two-thirds of Informa’s revenue could be classed 
as recurring and forward booked in nature, being generated 
through the sale of subscriptions to data intelligence products 
and scholarly journals, the sale of stand space at exhibitions and 
through multi-year sponsorship deals at our major confexes. This 
creates a good level of visibility and predictability, and a balanced 
mix of products and geographies across the portfolio. 
As an increasingly international Group, currency movements 
impact our reported revenues and profits. With the majority of  
our revenues and profits generated in US dollars or currencies 
pegged to the US dollar, there is particular sensitivity to 
fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate. 
Operating internationally also means we make tax contributions 
in several countries. We continue to recognise the value of taxes 
to society and our broader stakeholders, and for funding the 
infrastructure that companies rely on. As a result, we remain 
committed to paying our taxes in full and on time, in compliance 
with the laws of the countries in which we operate. 
The level of Informa’s financial obligations to its pension schemes 
remains limited and manageable relative to the size of the Group. 
We continue to meet our commitments to these schemes and 
their members, and our policy is to provide sufficient funding so 
that any deficits are addressed over a reasonable period and 
pension obligations to current and future pensioners are fulfilled. 
We have two UK defined benefit pension schemes plus another 
two US defined benefit schemes that came with the Penton 
acquisition, all of which are closed to future accrual. 
Outside of Informa, we view the market for knowledge, business-
to-business events and information services as an attractive one. 
The Group’s focus on specialist vertical markets that are dynamic 
and growing, such as those set out on pages 14 to 19, provide 
the potential for continued growth and expansion. 
2018 FOCUS AND POSSIBILITIES 
The operational and financial progress made through 2017  
and throughout GAP has, we believe, laid the foundation  
for continued growth and scale in the future. 
In January 2018, the Board of Informa announced a 
recommended offer for UBM plc, to create a leading  
B2B information services group. 
As detailed in the announcement of the offer on 30 January,  
the enlarged Group will reap the immediate benefits of operating 
scale, with a target of at least £60m of annual recurring pre-tax 
cost synergies by the end of 2020. 
This is expected to result in attractive earnings accretion and  
a post-tax return on invested capital in excess of Informa’s  
cost of capital within three full financial years of ownership. 
The enlarged Group is expected to generate annual free cash 
flow of approximately £600m based on pro-forma 2016 figures, 
with around two-thirds of its revenue forward booked and 
predictable in nature. 
The offer for UBM will be funded through a mixture of cash  
and equity, with the cash element funded through a new 
acquisition facility. Leverage is expected to be around three  
times net debt to adjusted EBITDA on completion, returning 
below our target ceiling of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA over 
time, a level the Board believes is broadly consistent with an 
investment grade profile.

MEASUREMENT AND ADJUSTMENTS
In addition to the statutory results, adjusted results are prepared for the income statement, including adjusted operating profit and 
adjusted diluted earnings per share. The Board considers these non-GAAP measures as the most appropriate way to measure the 
Group’s performance so it is comparable to the prior year. This is in line with similar adjusted measures used by our peers and facilitates 
comparisons. The adjusting items section provides a reconciliation between statutory operating profit and adjusted operating profit by 
Division. Adjusting items include recurring and non-recurring items. 
Following the combination of Penton with Informa, we have adopted an approach where year-on-year growth from material acquisitions 
is included in the calculation of underlying growth from the first day of ownership, as if we had owned the business in the corresponding 
period in the previous year. This measure of underlying growth also strips out the impact of any events phasing during the relevant 
period, the impact of any disposals and the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Underlying growth in 2017 reconciled to reported growth is as follows:

Our proactive and targeted acquisition programme led to an increase in intangible asset amortisation, reflecting a full year of amortisation  
of Penton acquired intangibles. Amortisation relates to book lists and journal titles, acquired databases and customer and attendee 
relationships related to exhibitions and conferences. Intangible asset amortisation arising from software assets and product development  
is not treated as an adjusting item and is included as an ordinary cost within the calculation of adjusted operating profit. 
Acquisition and integration costs of £24.0m included costs relating to the integration of Penton Information Services totalling £17 .9m. 
In 2017 , the £17 .4m loss on disposal relates primarily to two Business Intelligence businesses: Biotechniques (acquired in 2001,  
a £19.2m loss) and Lloyd’s List Australia (acquired in 1999, a £4.6m loss), as well as the Academic Publishing business, Garland 
Science US Book List (acquired 2004, a £7 .5m loss). These losses were partly offset by the £15.5m profit on disposal of Euroforum, 
the German and Swiss conference business.

NET FINANCE COSTS
Adjusted finance costs, consisting principally of interest costs on US private placement loan notes and bank borrowings, increased by 
£19.5m to £59.1m. This reflects the full year effect of higher average debt levels following the acquisition of Penton in November 2016 
and an increase in US LIBOR rates, plus a stronger average USD exchange rate in 2017 than in 2016. 
TAXATION
Approach to tax
The taxes we pay are part of the economic benefit created for societies in which the business operates, and a fair and effective tax 
system is in the interests of taxpayers and society at large. The Group supports the adoption of international best practices and 
governance standards, and aims to comply with tax laws and regulations everywhere we do business. We have open and constructive 
working relationships with tax authorities worldwide and our approach balances the interests of stakeholders including Shareholders, 
governments, colleagues and the communities in which we operate. 
Tax contribution
The Group’s total tax contribution (“TTC”), which comprises all material taxes paid out of profits and other material taxes generated  
by our businesses, was £208.4m in 2017 (2016: £183.2m). The UK element of our TTC was £89.5m (2016: £77 .2m). The increase in 
worldwide TTC was due to an increase in corporation tax payments, particularly in the UK, and higher employment taxes paid out  
of profits and by colleagues. The increase in UK TTC reflects higher UK Corporation Tax payments, including £11.8m of payments 
related to a gain on a derivative forward contract relating to the acquisition of Penton.
Tax expense
Our effective tax rate (ETR) reflects the blend of tax rates and profits in the Group’s various jurisdictions, some with lower corporate  
tax rates than the UK. In 2017 , the adjusted effective IR tax rate was 21.2% (2016: 18.0%).
The increase relates principally to changes to UK tax legislation, introduced from 1 January 2017 , which reduced the tax benefit of 
certain internal financing structures. This new legislation led to approximately £8m of additional tax to pay for 2017 . In addition, the mix 
effect of more profits being generated in the US following the addition of Penton Information Services and YPI, where the headline tax 
rate is higher, also pushed up the Group’s overall ETR.

FINANCIAL  
STATEMENTS US tax reform
In December 2017 , the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (US federal tax reform) was enacted in the US. In the 2017 financial accounts, this led  
to an £85.4m tax credit within the adjusting items in the income statement, taking the Group tax credit on statutory profit before tax 
(“PBT”) to 16.7% (2016: tax charge of 2.6%).
This credit reflects the revaluation of the Group’s deferred tax assets (mainly relating to tax losses available in the US) and deferred tax 
liabilities (mainly relating to Informa’s substantial intangible assets in the US) to reflect the future lower federal tax rate enacted by the 
new legislation. This led to a net deferred tax credit of £101.1m. The balancing item to the £85.4m tax credit within adjusting items is a 
£15.7m charge to current and deferred tax, representing tax to be paid in respect of undistributed profits of non-US subsidiaries of our 
US group (repatriation tax).
This tax credit has no impact on 2017 cash taxes. The current element of the repatriation tax, estimated at £9.2m, is expected to be 
paid in eight instalments commencing in 2018.
Tax payments
During 2017 , the Group paid £45.3m (2016: £43.3m) of corporation and similar taxes on profits, including £39.0m (2016: £24.2m)  
of UK Corporation Tax, which includes £11.8m of tax paid on a gain on a forward contract used to hedge the Penton acquisition.  
US tax payments were significantly reduced in 2017 largely due to the use of losses acquired with Penton in 2016 and tax deductions 
available from the write off of loans in 2016. These deductions, as well as further benefits from acquired tax losses, will also reduce 
cash tax outflows in the US in 2018. 
At the end of 2017 , the deferred tax asset relating to US tax losses stood at £45.6m (2016: £90.6m), which is expected to be utilised 
within five years. The recognition of deferred tax assets relating to the acquisitions of Penton and YPI means that cash savings arising 
from US tax losses do not reduce the adjusted tax rate. 
The reconciliation of the adjusted tax charge to cash taxes paid is as follows:
2017 
£m
2016

Tax charge on adjusted PBT per Consolidated Income Statement 103.1 67.8
Deferred tax (0.5) (8.0)

Taxes paid in relation to earlier years less 2017 (2016) taxes payable in later periods 5.2 18.6

Taxes paid per Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 45.3 43.3
Less: tax relating to Penton acquisition forward contract (11.8) –
Taxes paid per free cash flow 33.5 43.3
The tax charge on adjusted profits is stated after the benefit of goodwill amortisation for tax purposes in the US and similar amounts 
elsewhere. There are £27 .3m (2016: £19.5m) of current tax deductions which are taken on the amortisation of intangible assets. These 
are treated as adjusting items and are included in the current tax deductions in respect of adjusting items noted above. The use of tax 
losses in 2016 was negligible and was included in deferred taxes.
RESTATEMENT OF 2016 RESULTS
Results for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been restated, after finalising the provisional amounts recognised in respect  
of two 2016 acquisitions and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed: Penton Information Services, completed  
on 2 November 2016 and Light Reading LLC, completed on 13 July 2016. This has resulted in the following changes to the 2016

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Business segment results for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been restated to reflect the integration and allocation of Penton 
business units into the business segments of Business Intelligence, Global Exhibitions and Knowledge & Networking in 2017.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) calculated on the adjusted statutory profit for the year for equity Shareholders  
of £380.9m (2016: £306.3m), resulted in adjusted basic EPS of 46.3p (2016: 42.2p restated).
Adjusted diluted EPS of 46.1p was 9.5% ahead of 2016 (2016: 42.1p restated), principally reflecting the increase in adjusted profit 
before tax, partly offset by the full year effect of the increased average number of shares. This 13.5% increase reflects the full year 
effect of the rights issue in November 2016, which partly funded the acquisition of Penton Information Services, with 162.2m of new 
shares placed with institutional investors and 12.8m of shares issued to the vendors of Penton.

DIVIDENDS
£164.0m (2016: £134.5m) dividends were paid in 2017 , comprising £162.0m of dividends to external Shareholders and £2.0m 
dividends paid to non-controlling interests. 
In its dividend policy the Group aims to achieve a balance between sufficiently rewarding Shareholders and retaining the financial 
strength and flexibility to allow the Group to consistently invest and pursue growth. The Group made a specific commitment through 
the period of GAP to increase the dividend consistently each year, initially at a minimum of 2% per annum, increasing to a minimum  
of 4% per annum in February 2016, and to at least 6% for 2017 in July 2017 . 
As outlined in the Chairman’s Introduction, the Board has proposed a final dividend of 13.80p per share (2016: 13.04p per share). 
Subject to Shareholder approval at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 1 June 2018 to ordinary Shareholders registered as at the 
close of business on 20 April 2018. This will result in total dividends for the year of 20.45p per share (2016: 19.30p) representing a 6.0% 
year-on-year increase. The growth in earnings in 2017 means dividend cover against adjusted earnings was 2.3 times (2016: 2.2 times).
TRANSLATION IMPACT 
The Group’s strategy to build its presence in North America has increased its exposure to USD revenues and costs. In 2017 , the Group 
received approximately 65% (2016: 59%) of its revenues and incurred approximately 55% (2016: 48%) of its costs in USD or currencies 
pegged to USD. Each one cent ($0.01) movement in the USD to GBP exchange rate, based on the 31 December 2017 closing rate, 
has a circa £8.5m (2016: £6.5m) impact on annual revenue and a circa £3.5m (2016: £2.9m) impact on annual adjusted operating 
profit and a circa 0.3p (2016: 0.3p) impact on full year adjusted diluted EPS.

2. Tax payment for 2017 excludes £11.8m of tax relating to adjusting item for Penton derivative forward contract gain of £58.9m
Our focus on cash generation led to another year of strong cash conversion in 2017 , with operating cash flow of £494.8m equating  
to 91% of adjusted operating profit (2016: 95%). This is calculated by dividing the operating cash flow (£494.8m) by the adjusted 
operating profit (£545.5m). 
In the final year of GAP, net capital expenditure was £79.0m (2016: £52.0m) which is equivalent to 4.5% of 2017 revenue. In 2018,  
net capital expenditure is expected to be in the range of 3% to 5% of revenue. 
The working capital outflow of £11.1m in 2017 largely relates to timing differences, partly relating to billings for certain events in the 
Middle East in Global Exhibitions and partly to subscription journal receipts in Academic Publishing.
Net interest paid increased by £16.8m principally due to the full year effect of increased borrowings arising from the addition of Penton. 
In 2017 , the Group paid £33.5m (2016: £43.3m) of corporation and similar taxes on profits, together with £11.8m of tax related to  
the gain on the derivative forward contract associated with the Penton acquisition.

We continue to target a ratio of net debt to EBITDA in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 times, with the potential to go up to around 3.0 times  
in the short term for an acquisition. As at 31 December 2017 , net debt had decreased year-on-year by £112.3m to £1,373.1m. This 
included a foreign exchange benefit of £129.1m, primarily associated with USD weakening by 9.7% against GBP , with a closing rate

The GAP focus on retaining a robust and flexible financing framework led to a number of developments in our funding structure  
during 2017 . On 25 January 2017 , the Group issued USD 500m of private placement loan notes, with a maturity of 6 years  
(USD 55m), 8 years (USD 80m) and 10 years (USD 365m), at an average interest rate of 3.6%. In March 2017 , the Group arranged  
a new USD 400m term loan facility, with a maturity of up to 12 months, refinancing the acquisition facility that was used to fund  
the Penton acquisition on more favourable terms. The Group also repaid private placement loan notes of USD 102m, EUR 50m  
and GBP 40m that matured in December 2017 . Finally, in November 2017 , the Group agreed to issue USD 400m of new private 
placement loan notes which were issued on 4 January 2018 with maturities of 7 years (USD 200m) and 10 years (USD 200m)  
at an average interest rate of 4.0%.

The principal financial covenant ratios under the private placement loan notes and revolving credit facility are maximum net debt  
to EBITDA of 3.5 times and a minimum EBITDA to interest cover of 4.0 times, tested semi-annually. At 31 December 2017 , the  
ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 2.5 times (31 December 2016: 2.6 times), calculated according to our facility agreements (using 
average exchange rates and including a full year’s trading for acquisitions). The ratio of EBITDA to net interest payable was 9.8 times  
(at 31 December 2016: 11.0 times).
PENSIONS
The Group continues to meet all commitments to its pension schemes, which consist of four defined benefit schemes that are closed 
to future accrual. 
At 31 December 2017 , the Group had a net pension liability of £17 .8m (2016: £27 .6m), net of £5.8m of deferred tax. This remains 
manageable and relatively immaterial compared with the size of our balance sheet. The reduction in the net deficit during 2017 principally 
reflects the gain on pension assets through the period more than offsetting an increase in pension labilities relating to the reduction  
in discount rate, with the rate reducing by 20bps year-on-year to 2.4% for UK schemes and by 40bps to 3.3% for US schemes.  
There were no employer cash contributions paid in 2017 and, in 2018, we estimate total payments will be approximately £3.3m. 
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT 
The Group continued to pursue a disciplined and targeted acquisition strategy during 2017 , adding several businesses to the portfolio. 
Total net expenditure on acquisitions and disposals was £250.6m (2016: £1,313.1m). 
As part of our disciplined approach, potential acquisition opportunities are assessed on a case-by-case basis against a broad set of 
financial and strategic criteria. For bolt-on additions, we target a post-tax return on invested capital in excess of the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital in the first full year of ownership, as well as immediate earnings accretion. For certain strategic acquisitions,  
the Group will take a longer-term view on these metrics, to allow time for full integration of the acquired business, coupled with 
additional investment to maximise long-term returns. 
The Group also continually reassesses the mix and focus of the Group, scrutinising if it remains the best owner of businesses or 
whether better returns could be achieved through a sale. In 2017 , this led to the sale of the Euroforum conference businesses in 
Germany and Switzerland, as well as the sale of lower level textbook publisher, Garland. 
The largest acquisition during the year was Yachting Promotions, Inc. (YPI) which was purchased for £111.1m, net of cash  
acquired of £0.6m. YPI is the operator of some of the largest international yachting and boat events in the US. We acquired  
100% of the issued share capital of YPI on 14 March 2017 , and the business has been integrated into the Global Exhibitions 
segment. On 29 December 2017 , the Group sold a stake in YPI to the Principality of Monaco, expanding and strengthening its  
existing partnership on the Monaco Yacht Show. 
STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
The other main addition through 2017 was the purchase of 100% of the issued share capital of Dove Medical Press Limited, an open 
access journals business, on 26 September 2017 for net cash consideration of £43.0m. This business forms part of the Academic 
Publishing Division. 
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
For a description of the expected impact from adopting new accounting standards which have been issued but are not yet effective, 
see Note 2 to the financial statements. To briefly review three of these standards:
For IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which is effective for the 2018 financial year, the Group does not expect any material change to the 
income statement or balance sheet of the Group. 
For IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is effective for the 2018 financial year, the Group does not expect there  
to be any material change to the income statement or balance sheet of the Group, except for a reclassification in the balance sheet  
of approximately £70m of deferred income against trade receivables, for amounts that have been invoiced and where services have 
not yet been provided and amounts are not yet due. 
For IFRS 16 Leases, effective for the 2019 financial year, the Group is in the process of assessing the full impact of this new standard.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNANCE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
Your Board has a clear and simple overarching aim: to encourage 
and promote Informa’s long-term success and the creation of 
value. Over the last four years, this has been focused on the 
Growth Acceleration Plan, a programme of change and investment 
to improve growth and build capability, which the Directors have 
closely overseen and supported. 
We believe GAP has strengthened Informa’s operational 
capabilities and helped to deliver improving financial results. 
Furthermore, it has laid the foundations for continued growth  
and future scale, offering the potential to create long-term value 
for Shareholders. 
In this context, the Board and Executive Management Team  
have developed proposals focused on the next stage of the 
Group’s development, which includes the recommended offer 
made for UBM in January 2018 that is, at the time of writing, 
progressing through the full approval process.
STABLE BOARD COMPOSITION
The Board of Informa is largely unchanged from 2016, with the 
planned retirement of Brendan O’Neill taking effect at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting (AGM), and John Rishton becoming 
Chairman of the Audit Committee at that time. 
The Board currently comprises nine Directors, with seven 
independent members selected for the relevance and value  
of their knowledge, experience and skills, and two executive 
members – the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director – contributing operational insight. There are three 
Committees established to oversee specific remits – Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration – plus an additional Risk 
Committee that reports to the Audit Committee. 
The Board and Directors have a set of distinct responsibilities 
under the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). 
Shareholders will see that this year, the Governance Report has 
been structured according to the Code’s five principal areas, to 
provide a clear link between activities and these responsibilities. 
As Chairman, I can confirm that Informa complies with the 
principles of the Code, and that each Director is aware of their 
duties and discharges them with care and attention. More 
information on compliance with the Code and the Listing Rules  
of the Financial Conduct Authority can be found on page 73.
DELIVERING FOR SHAREHOLDERS
The primary consideration for Boards is to create value for 
Shareholders, and I would like to thank Informa’s Shareholders  
for their continued support in 2017 and over the four-year  
GAP programme.
We appreciate the discussions and the feedback from investors 
during 2017 , both as part of the independent investor perceptions 
study commissioned in October 2017 , and the engagement  
on financial targets and incentive structures at the time of the 
2017 AGM, views that have been reflected in the remuneration 
proposals due for approval in 2018. There is more on how the 
Group engages with Shareholders on page 114. 
CONTRIBUTING TO COLLEAGUE, CUSTOMER AND 
BUSINESS PARTNER SUCCESS 
As part of section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, your Directors 
are equally aware and committed to acting in ways that are most 
likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its 
members as a whole. These responsibilities include considering 
the interests of colleagues, the need to foster relationships with 
suppliers and customers, and the impact of operations on the 
community and environment.
The interests of the Group’s colleagues, and the importance  
of engagement and a positive culture, are a regular topic of 
discussion at the Board. In the ordinary course of business,  
the Directors meet a wide range of colleagues each year, from 
executive management who attend Board meetings, Divisional 
leadership teams who provide presentations on specific business 
matters at Board, to Committee and Strategy meetings, as well 
as colleagues from many different functions and geographies. 
In 2017 , the Board held a colleague town hall in Boulder, 
Colorado, a key US hub for Global Exhibitions, an informal 
lunch discussion with London Business Intelligence colleagues, 
and our Senior Independent Director participated in the Group’s 
Walk the World charity initiative. These have been both enjoyable 
and insightful for the Directors, contributing to a greater mutual 
understanding of the business, and the challenges and 
opportunities that lie ahead. 
We are also mindful of the importance of maintaining positive, 
long-term relationships with customers and business partners, 
and in particular, the Group’s role in delivering content, intelligence 
and connections that help customers progress and succeed in their 
businesses. On pages 39 and 40, we have introduced greater detail 
and examples around Informa’s activities in this space.
BOARD OPERATIONS AND CULTURE
As Chairman, I hold a specific responsibility for the Board’s 
performance and its ability to govern the Group effectively. 
The composition of the Board is kept under ongoing review,  
to ensure there is the balance of expertise and experience 
necessary to oversee a growing, international and increasingly 
data-focused Group. Should Shareholder and regulatory  
approval be secured for our recommended offer for UBM plc,  
it is our intention to welcome three directors from UBM’s Board  
Derek Mapp 
Chairman
to join the Board of the enlarged Group. The additional knowledge, 
expertise and relevant experience this will bring will, we believe, 
be valuable in governing the enlarged Group effectively.
The time commitment of each Director and the effectiveness of 
individuals and the Board as a whole are regularly assessed as 
part of the annual Board evaluation process. The Group has a 
Diversity & Inclusion policy which was introduced in 2017 and  
is endorsed by the Board, and the Group strives to ensure a 
balance of skills, experiences and talent at all levels. 
We support the findings of both the Hampton-Alexander Review 
on the representation of women in senior leadership positions 
and the Parker Review on ethnic diversity on boards. These 
findings will inform future Board appointments and succession 
planning. Further information can be found in the Nomination 
Committee Report on page 83 and in Talent and Partnerships  
on pages 36 to 41 of the Strategic Report.
How the Board operates and interacts with management is also 
a factor in performance. We aim to ensure sufficient time for  
a thorough discussion of key matters at formal Board meetings 
and during informal exchanges, and ensure each Director actively 
engages and can contribute. Board decisions are made collectively, 
with input from each Director. 
The aim of all the Directors is to encourage, support and challenge 
management teams by adopting an open, direct, collaborative and 
respectful approach. There are clear responsibilities for decision 
making, a list of which can be found on the Informa website and  
on page 79 of this Annual Report.
There are also high levels of interaction between the Board  
and the Executive Management Team. Executive and Divisional 
management present at Board meetings on topical matters,  
to ensure the Board maintains a detailed understanding of 
operations and market trends, and meet informally at Board 
dinners to encourage discussion on a broader range of issues. 
New Directors receive thorough and relevant business 
inductions. Additionally, as Chairman I work closely with  
the Group Chief Executive, with meetings to plan agendas 
supplemented by weekly discussions and exchanges to  
keep abreast of the latest market and Group developments. 
The Board also recognises its role in setting high standards of 
conduct and fostering culture in the Group, through our actions 
as well as by directing attention to conduct and culture through 
discussions at the Board table. We are wholly committed to 
acting with integrity and transparency, and in 2017 participated  
in the same Code of Conduct, modern slavery and anti-bribery 
and corruption training as all other Informa colleagues, to 
demonstrate leadership and ensure a thorough understanding  
of Informa’s core values. 
KEY ACTIVITIES AND FORWARD FOCUS
Key activities conducted by the Board in 2017 included 
monitoring the integration of Penton and reviewing the approach 
to health, safety and security matters and cyber resilience, with 
greater resources directed to both areas, and close monitoring  
of the implementation of the Group’s new financial management 
and reporting system. 
In the final year of the Growth Acceleration Plan, a key focus  
has been tracking the direct outputs of GAP and how this  
has translated into performance, as well as evolving plans for  
the future direction and growth of the Informa Group. The 
Directors remain closely involved in reviewing and approving 
major acquisition activity, which most recently has focused  
on UBM and led to the recommended offer made in January, 
which is fully supported by the Board. 
In all cases, your Board looks forward to continuing to support, 
oversee and govern the Group as it seeks to build on the  
growth and platforms established through GAP to maintain  
and improve its reputation, position and relationships with 
customers and colleagues. 
Thank you to colleagues on the Board and within the Group,  
and also to all of our Shareholders. 
Derek Mapp 
Chairman

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: EFFECTIVENESS
SECTION B: 
EFFECTIVENESS
B.4. DEVELOPMENT
On joining the Board all Directors receive a formal induction  
to the Group, designed to enable them to understand the 
Divisions and the markets Informa operates in so they can be 
effective Board members from the outset. This includes visits  
to various Informa offices and forums to meet colleagues and 
management team members. Informa’s newest Board member, 
John Rishton, completed a formal induction in 2016 and as a  
final part of the process was involved in a risk management 
induction in March 2017 prior to his appointment as Chairman  
of the Audit Committee. 
The Company Secretary regularly discusses training and 
development needs with the Chairman, who also uses Board 
evaluations to further assess the Board’s requirements. 
Discussions between the Chairman and the Directors also  
take place regularly to ensure all Board members are confident  
in their ability to add valuable contribution to Board and 
Committee meetings.
B.5. INFORMATION AND SUPPORT
The Directors are regularly updated on the Group’s business  
and the environment in which it operates by written briefings and 
by meetings with Senior Executives. Nearly every Board meeting 
includes a presentation from Group Senior Executives on a matter 
of topical interest. Non-Executive Directors receive management 
reports prior to each Board meeting from the Group Chief 
Executive and the Group Finance Director, which enable them  
to scrutinise the Group’s and management’s performance.
Directors are also updated on any changes to the Group’s legal 
and governance requirements and those which affect their duties 
as Directors. Regular reports and papers are circulated to the 
Directors ahead of time in preparation for Board and Committee 
meetings. These papers are supplemented by any information 
specifically requested by the Directors.
Training is available at the Group’s expense, to ensure that Directors 
are kept up to date on relevant new legislation and changing 
commercial risks. Should any Director wish to seek professional 
advice on any matters relating to the Company’s affairs, this is 
available at the Company’s expense. Additionally, the Company 
Secretary is available for the Directors and liaises frequently with 
all Board members. The Board as a whole is responsible for the 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary.
B.6 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE BOARD 
AND ITS COMMITTEES
The Directors undergo an annual performance evaluation,  
both individually and collectively as a Board and Committee.  
An external evaluation is carried out every three years with  
the last one undertaken in 2017 by Independent Audit Limited, 
selected by the Chairman due to its specialism in governance 
matters and experience. The next external evaluation is expected 
to be carried out in 2020.
B.1 THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD
Informa’s Board consists of two Executive Directors and seven 
Non-Executive Directors. Their biographies, including skills and 
qualifications, experience and external commitments, are set  
out on pages 74 and 75. As part of its ongoing review on Board 
effectiveness the Nomination Committee looks at whether each 
Director is sufficiently independent. No Non-Executive Director 
had a prior connection with the Company on appointment and 
the Directors continue to appropriately challenge the Executives 
and each other in the boardroom. The Board therefore considers 
all of its Non-Executive Directors to be independent in character 
and judgement.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Articles include provisions covering Directors’ conflicts of 
interest. They allow the Board to authorise any matter that would 
otherwise result in a Director breaching his or her duty to avoid 
conflicts of interest. The Company has procedures in place to 
deal with a situation where a Director has a conflict of interest.  
As part of this process, the Board will endeavour to:
• consider each conflict situation separately on its particular facts;
•  consider the conflict situation in conjunction with the Articles;
•  keep records and Board minutes on authorisations granted  
by Directors and the scope of any approvals given; and 
• regularly review conflict authorisations.
In 2017 , no Director had any unauthorised conflicts of interests. 
The Board noted the following:
• Derek Mapp is Chairman of 3aaa, which provided training  
to some UK Informa colleagues;
•  John Rishton is a director of Majid Al Futtaim, a company  
that takes part in Global Exhibitions’ Cityscape Global event;
•  David Flaschen previously worked with adviser Bruce Fador, 
who now acts as a consultant to an Informa-owned finance 
business in the US;
•  Cindy Rose is Chief Executive Officer at Microsoft UK,  
a key Informa supplier; and 
• each of the Directors has a small shareholding in the 
Company, which is not considered significant.
B.2 APPOINTMENTS TO THE BOARD
The Nomination Committee takes the lead on appointments  
to the Board. The Nomination Committee Report follows this 
section on page 83.
The Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a term of  
one year, following which they are asked to resign and seek 
re-election at the AGM. With the exception of the Chairman,  
each Non-Executive Director has served on the Board for  
no more than five consecutive years.
B.3 COMMITMENT
The Code states that directors should allocate sufficient time to 
discharge their responsibility effectively and this was reviewed  
by the Nomination Committee in 2017 as in previous years.
Derek Mapp was appointed to the Board of Mitie Group plc  
in May 2017 and was elected Chairman from July 2017 . Prior  
to this appointment, the Chairman consulted with all Board 
members, who were satisfied that he could continue to commit 
the necessary time, attention and dedication to his role at the Group.
The Company’s Non-Executive Directors are expected to  
commit 12–15 days a year to Board meetings and other  
work for the Company. Specific terms of their appointments, 
including time commitment, are contained in their letters of 
appointment, which are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal business hours. Copies of the 
letters of appointment will also be available to view at the AGM. 
All Directors are required to disclose their additional appointments 
and other significant commitments, and details can be found in 
the biographies on pages 74 and 75. Stephen A. Carter CBE has 
been a Non-Executive Director on the board of United Utilities 
Group PLC since September 2014, which the Informa Board 
approved and believes is a valuable complement to his Group 
role. Stephen was also appointed as a Non-Executive board 
member for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial 
Strategy (“BEIS”) during the year.
Attendance at 2017 Board and Committee meetings
The Chairman, Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director attended each Audit Committee meeting by invitation.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: EFFECTIVENESS CONTINUED
The review took place over June and July and feedback was 
provided to the Chairman. A formal report was presented  
and discussion took place at the December Board meeting.  
The report covered a broad spectrum of issues including the 
Board size and balance; the role of the Chairman, the Senior 
Independent Director, the Non-Executive Directors, the Executive 
Directors and the senior management; the dynamics at the 
Board; the Board’s role in strategy, mergers and acquisitions, 
innovation, digital strategy and risk management; the oversight  
of financial and operational performance, along with people, 
behaviour and culture; the organisational structure; the 
Shareholder focus; and the roles of the Committees and  
the support they receive. 
It was observed that the Board exercised strong oversight and 
provided good support, input and challenge as the Executive 
Directors have tackled a very busy agenda as outlined elsewhere. 
Many examples were cited of where the Board and individual 
Non-Executive Directors have added value or influenced the 
thinking of the Executives. It was noted that the Board has 
evolved and become more effective since the last external  
review undertaken in 2014. In addition, it has been refreshed  
and now benefits from: 
• fresh thinking and perspectives; 
• increased diversity, with a US resident Non-Executive Director; 
and
• stronger recent FTSE 100 CEO and previous CFO experience. 
The evaluation gave suggestions and recommendations for  
2018, including considering the appointment of an additional 
Non-Executive Director to ensure the Board has the skills  
and experience to meet the Group’s future strategic needs; 
ensuring succession planning for all levels, including the Board,  
is discussed; encouraging the evolution of management’s 
approach to risk management; ensuring sufficient time is made 
available to discuss innovation, the digital strategy and people 
matters; ensuring the organisational structure evolves at an 
appropriate pace to meet the needs of a Group that is growing  
in size and complexity; broadening the focus beyond financial 
KPIs to strategic and non-financial KPIs; and agreeing the  
level of detail the Board needs to receive for operational  
and strategic discussions. 
B.7 RE-ELECTION
The Articles prescribe that all Directors are subject to annual 
re-election at the AGM. The performance evaluation of the Board 
concluded that each Director remains effective, committed  
and is able to devote the required time to their role. In addition,  
as a result of the evaluation, the Board is satisfied that each 
Non-Executive Director remains independent. Therefore, all 
Directors will stand for re-election at the 2018 AGM. 
THE BOARD EVALUATION PROCESS IN 2017
RESPONSIBILITIES
• Ensuring a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure  
for appointing and inducting new Directors to the Board  
and its Committees
• Reviewing the size, structure and composition of the Board, 
including skills, knowledge, experience and diversity
• Reviewing succession plans for Directors and Senior Executives
• Reviewing colleague engagement activities in line with legal 
requirements such as gender pay gap reporting, and monitoring 
diversity, ethnicity and talent mapping
•  Implementing the annual Board evaluation process,  
which includes external evaluation every three years
•  Reviewing Non-Executive Director time commitments
The Committee’s full terms of reference are on Informa’s website 
and were last reviewed and approved in November 2017 .

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
This includes reviewing the time Non-Executive Directors are 
required to give to their roles at Informa. We were satisfied that 
each Director is able to contribute the time, as well as the focus, 
care and quality of attention, to fulfilling their duties to the 
Company and Shareholders. 
Succession planning 
The Committee keeps succession planning for the Board  
and the Executive Management Team (“EMT”) under ongoing 
review. It specifically discusses and reviews succession plans  
for the Chairman and Group Chief Executive as part of its overall 
responsibilities, and monitors talent management and performance 
management across the Divisions for Senior Executives. 
When appointing new Directors, the Group uses specialist 
executive search consultants to identify candidates that meet the 
criteria the Committee sets, after which all candidates, internal 
and external, are interviewed by the Committee and proposed  
to the Board for approval.
To support the recommended offer for UBM plc, the Committee 
looked at the current mix of Directors’ skills, experience and 
background and those that may be needed to lead the enlarged 
Group. Having considered the Board’s future needs and reviewed 
suitable candidates on the UBM plc board, the Committee 
recommended that Greg Lock be appointed as Deputy Chairman, 
and that Mary McDowell and David Wei be invited to join the 
Board, conditional on the deal completing. 
Diversity and balance 
The Group and the Board’s belief that diversity, and maintaining  
a balanced mix of talent at all levels, brings competitive 
advantage remains unchanged. 
Informa aims to recognise diversity in its broadest sense, including 
but not limited to gender, nationality, ethnicity, professional and 
personal experience and age, and to uphold a working environment 
that is welcoming, stimulating and based on respect. 
When considering succession planning for Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors, the Committee considers candidates 
from a wide range of backgrounds. The Board notes and fully 
supports the findings of the Hampton-Alexander Review on 
women’s representation in senior leadership positions, and  
the Parker Review on the ethnic diversity of boards. Their 
recommendations will be actively considered when it comes to  
new Board appointments and succession planning. The Group 
Chief Executive, who now attends the Committee meetings  
by invitation, is a member of the 30% Club, an international 
organisation that works to increase the representation of  
women and diverse talent at all levels.
During 2017 , the Committee received regular updates on 
AllInforma, Informa’s Group-wide approach to Diversity and 
Inclusion. Activities included the introduction of a standalone 
Diversity & Inclusion policy, to bring more specific focus to  
the Group’s commitment to maintaining a culture of equality, 
dignity and respect free from unlawful or unfair discrimination. 
See pages 37 and 73 for more detail. 
Informa operates several apprenticeship schemes and the 
Informa Graduate Fellowship Scheme as an additional way of 
attracting younger talent, and the Committee received updates 
on the Group’s contribution to and use of the UK’s Apprenticeship 
Levy. Informa is accredited to the UK Living Wage Foundation 
and UK colleagues are paid at least the independently calculated 
Living Wage, above the government’s National Minimum Wage, 
which is regularly audited.
Gender balance 
Informa’s principal measure of gender at Executive level is based 
on balance within the Senior Leadership Group, a group of 
approximately 160 colleagues based around the world with the 
highest levels of responsibility and accountability in the business. 
This is a slightly enlarged group compared with the definition 
used by the Hampton-Alexander Review, which considers 
colleagues who report directly to the EMT only. We believe the 
Senior Leadership Group is a better representation of senior 
talent for Informa, because of the Divisional structure of our 
Group and the nature of reporting lines across functions. 
It is also the best equivalent to the calculation of senior managers, 
as defined by section 414C(9) of the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. 
Having standardised the criteria under which colleagues  
are part of the Senior Leadership Group, the numbers and 
proportions for the prior year have been restated. The criteria 
now in place are intended as the new measure for future years.
Over 2017 , the Committee has overseen submissions to the 
Hampton-Alexander review, and received regular updates  
on the work to report Informa’s gender pay position, a new 
obligation for UK companies. The Group’s gender pay figures  
are currently under review and will be published in line with  
the UK regulatory requirements.
Approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by
Derek Mapp
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
27 February 2018
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
The Nomination Committee (“the Committee”) is responsible  
for continuously assessing and reviewing how the Board is 
structured now and how it might be in the future, as well as  
for monitoring how Informa’s colleagues are engaged and  
how talent is retained across the Group, and for ensuring  
legal reporting requirements are met.
Informa recognises that colleagues are amongst its most 
important assets and places value on difference and diversity. 
There is a focus throughout the business on attracting, 
supporting and engaging colleagues wherever they work,  
and maintaining a culture of openness and respect. The 
Committee focuses on ensuring there is a balanced mix  
of skills, experience and backgrounds at Board and senior 
management level, to fuel future growth and opportunity  
and deliver value for stakeholders including Shareholders,  
and receives updates and monitors the application of talent  
and colleague-focused policies to the wider Group. 
The Committee met twice in 2017 to discharge its duties,  
and there were no unanticipated Director changes in 2017 .  
Dr Brendan O’Neill’s retirement from the Board and as Audit 
Committee Chairman after nine years of service took effect on 
26 May 2017 , and John Rishton, appointed in September 2016, 
became Chairman of the Audit Committee on Brendan’s retirement.
Board composition under GAP 
As Informa’s operations have developed under GAP,  
becoming more weighted to the US and to exhibitions and  
data and information services, for example, the Committee  
has reassessed the skills and knowledge necessary at a  
Board level to oversee the Group’s strategic direction effectively.
When Directors have retired or stood down, we have taken  
the opportunity to look for specific additional expertise. This  
has included Directors with greater international experience,  
such as David Flaschen (appointed in 2015); with listed company 
and financial management experience, such as John Rishton 
(appointed in 2016); and with expertise in technology and digital 
information delivery, such as Cindy Rose (appointed in 2014). 
Details of each Director’s professional experience can be  
found on pages 74 and 75, and an overview of the range  
of skills available to the Board is shown above. This focus  
on composition, as well as the size of the Board overall, will 
continue as the Group exits the GAP. 
Director evaluation and Board performance 
The Committee is responsible for reviewing and implementing 
any feedback from the annual Board performance evaluation 
relating to Board composition. Feedback from the 2017  
external Board evaluation can be found on pages 81 and 82  
of the Corporate Governance Report.

STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: ACCOUNTABILITY
C.1 FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTING
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements. The Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement can be found on page 119, which includes an 
explanation of how the Directors ensured that the accounts 
prepared are fair, balanced and understandable. Pages 20  
and 21 of the Strategic Report explain the business model  
and how the Company generates value for stakeholders. 
C.2 RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for Informa’s system of internal controls 
and reviewing its effectiveness. It recognises that risks must be 
taken to achieve the Company’s business objectives and has 
mandated a responsible and balanced approach to managing 
risk through its risk appetite and tolerance statement. 
Informa’s system of internal controls is designed to manage risks 
to address causes and reduce their potential impact. It can only 
provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss, a concept that recognises that the cost of 
control procedures should not exceed its expected benefits.
Responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Group  
rests with the Group Chief Executive, supported by the EMT.  
The EMT includes the CEO of each of the four Divisions, the 
Group Finance Director, the Director of Strategy & Business 
Planning, the Director of Investor Relations, Brand & 
Communications, the Director of Talent & Transformation  
and the General Counsel & Company Secretary, who met 
bi-weekly by call and bi-monthly in person in 2017 to consider  
the implementation of Group strategies, plans and policies,  
to monitor operational and financial performance and to  
manage risks. Each Division is given operational autonomy,  
as far as possible, within an internal control framework.  
The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 71 details the activities  
of the Operating Divisions.
As illustrated in the Risk Management section on page 24,  
the Board has a risk management framework for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the  
Group which is overseen by the Risk Committee. Oversight of 
risk management continued to be strengthened and enhanced  
in 2017 and was in place throughout the year, up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements, and  
is in accordance with the Code.
Informa’s internal control and risk management systems and 
procedures around financial reporting include: 
•  B u s i ne s s p l a n ni ng – each Operating Division produces  
and agrees an annual business plan against which the 
performance of the business is regularly monitored.  
This function and process was strengthened in 2017 .
•  F i n an c i al an al y s i s – each Division’s operating profitability  
and capital expenditure are closely monitored. Management 
incentives are tied to in year and longer-term financial results. 
These results include explanations of variance between 
forecast and budgeted performance, and are reviewed in 
detail by Executive Management on a monthly basis. Key 
financial information is regularly reported to the Board.
•  Group Authority Framework – the framework provides  
clear guidelines on approval limits for capital and operating 
expenditure and other key business decisions for all Divisions. 
The Group Authority Framework was reviewed and updated 
during 2017 . 
•  R i sk a s se s s m en t – risk assessment is embedded into  
the operations of the Group and is reported on to the EMT, 
Risk Committee, Audit Committee and the Board.
• Compliance – Compliance controls have been strengthened in 
2017 and are based on the US Federal Sentencing Guidelines. 
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls, risk management and the Group’s high  
level internal control arrangements. 
The Audit Committee has been charged by the Board with 
oversight of the above controls and has considered the following 
factors in determining the overall effectiveness of the Group’s 
risks and associated control environment: 
• The Risk Committee, a sub-committee of the Audit Committee, 
reports on the effectiveness of risk management, governance 
and compliance activity within the Group. 
• The Audit Committee has approved a schedule of work to  
be undertaken by the Group’s Internal Audit team during  
the period. It receives reports on any issues identified around 
the Group’s business processes and control activities over  
the Group’s key risk areas, including following up on the 
implementation of management action plans to address any 
identified control weaknesses, and reporting any overdue 
actions to the Audit Committee.
KPMG LLP is engaged to provide the Group with internal audit 
services and acts as Head of Internal Audit.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to present this year’s Audit Committee report, 
having taken over as Chairman of the Audit Committee (“the 
Committee”) in May 2017 on Dr Brendan O’Neill’s retirement  
from the Board. The Committee’s thanks and appreciation  
go to Brendan for his expert chairmanship and contribution.
Fair, balanced and understandable reporting
As in previous years, the Committee has given significant  
time and attention to ensuring that this Annual Report and the 
incorporated financial statements provide a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s financial reporting. 
The Committee also continued to oversee the work of the  
Risk Committee, and its responsibility for the effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal control policies and the procedures  
for identifying, assessing, managing, and reporting risk. 
To fulfil these duties, the Committee received sufficient, reliable 
and timely information from the Group’s senior managers.
Membership and attendance
The Committee consists of independent Non-Executive 
Directors, and their full biographies are on pages 74 and 75. 
Members are independent in their judgement and mindset.  
The Board and Committee are satisfied that members have the 
broad commercial knowledge, competence in the business-to-
business information services market and vertical industries in 
which Informa operates, mix of business and financial experience 
and the resource to effectively discuss, challenge and oversee 
key financial matters and fulfil their responsibilities. 
In terms of specific expertise, the Committee’s Chairman for  
the first five months of 2017 , Dr Brendan O’Neill, was a qualified 
management accountant with extensive experience of Audit 
Committee procedures. John Rishton, who became Chairman in 
May 2017 , is also a qualified accountant and is currently chairman 
of the Audit Committee of Unilever plc and Serco Group plc. He 
has previously been Audit Committee chairman of Allied Domecq 
plc and Rolls-Royce plc. Further information on John Rishton can 
be found in the biographies on page 75. A summary of the 
Committee’s performance, as part of the broader performance 
evaluation conducted in 2017 , can be found on pages 81 and 82. 
There were four meetings in 2017 , structured to allow a full, open 
and robust investigation into key accounting, audit and risk issues 
relevant to the Group. 
The whole Board is invited to and has attended Committee 
meetings this year save for one Director who missed one meeting 
due to prior commitments. Certain colleagues from the business 
are also invited to attend to facilitate information gathering and 
sharing, specifically the Head of Group Finance, Head of Internal 
Audit and, when appropriate, the Head of Group Tax, Head of 
Risk, Head of Compliance and the Group Treasurer. Twice a year, 
Committee meetings conclude with private meetings with the 
external and internal auditors. Outside this meeting cycle, the 
Committee Chairman is in regular contact with the Board 
Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, 
the External Audit Partner and the Head of Internal Audit.
Key responsibilities
•  Review the integrity of the Group’s financial statements  
and reporting
•  Review and monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management programme and internal control procedures
•  Oversee the relationship with the external auditor  
including appointments, qualifications, independence,  
fees and performance
• Review the effectiveness of the internal audit function  
and the annual Internal Audit plan
The Committee’s full terms of reference are on Informa’s website 
and were last reviewed and approved in November 2017 .

Training and external advice
As noted in the Corporate Governance Report on page 81, all 
new members of the Board and the Committee follow a formal 
induction programme on appointment when they are provided 
with detailed information on the Group. Directors are provided 
with updated information on legal and governance requirements 
on an ongoing and timely basis. Members of the Committee are 
able to obtain training at the Company’s expense on any legal  
or accounting requirements required to carry out their roles.
The Committee’s terms of reference mean it can obtain 
independent external advice at the Company’s expense.  
No such advice was obtained during 2017 . 
The Committee also has access to the services of the  
Company Secretary on all Audit Committee matters and  
he provides necessary practical support.
External audit partner
The external audit partner is William Touche from Deloitte LLP .  
He is a qualified accountant, a senior audit partner in the  
London audit practice and a Vice-Chairman of the UK firm.  
He first acted as the Group’s external audit partner for the  
year ended 31 December 2015 and has, therefore, served  
three of a maximum of five years. 
Interactions with the Financial Reporting Council
In 2017 , the Company received a letter from the Conduct 
Committee of the FRC with regard to the FRC’s thematic  
review of the Alternative Performance Measures disclosure in  
the 2016 Annual Report. The purpose of this monitoring activity 
was to drive continuous improvement in the quality of corporate 
reporting. The FRC review only covered the specific disclosures 
relating to the thematic review and provides no assurance that 
the 2016 Annual Report was correct in all material aspects.
The FRC stated they had no substantive issues to raise with  
the Company and noted some minor points of disclosure  
where improvement could be made. These disclosure points 
were agreed by the Committee in November for inclusion in  
the 2017 Annual Report.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Systems, security and data capabilities
As part of its Audit remit, the Committee regularly monitors  
the Group’s investment and approach in areas that are  
critical to performance, the protection of its intellectual  
property and the integrity of its data and financial reporting.
In 2017 , the Committee focused on a number of key areas, 
including:
Cyber security: The growing threat of cyber security is a  
key issue for all companies today and one which constantly 
evolves with technology. As part of its regular assessment,  
the Committee asked the Internal Audit function to conduct  
an in-depth review of Informa’s IT security, the results of  
which were presented in the last quarter. 
While some defences were robust, it was clear that more  
could be done. This has led to a number of initiatives, including 
establishing a Cyber Security Capability Roadmap, increasing  
the frequency and effectiveness of patching across the Group, 
introducing Multi-Factor Authentication as a new security 
measure and implementing a next-generation threat solution 
called Crowdstrike.
 In addition, the Group is raising awareness amongst colleagues 
of the risks and the IT security protocols in place to protect  
the Group, including, through the launch of new Global  
Cyber and Data Security training modules and colleague 
communications in 2018. 
Data management: A related area of focus is that of the effective 
management and use of data across the Group. This is particularly 
relevant in light of the upcoming GDPR, which comes into effect 
at the end of May 2018, and the Committee has been reviewing 
the Group’s preparation for this deadline. 
Progress has been made following the appointment of a Group 
Data Protection Officer to lead the programme. There remain 
some challenges, particularly related to securing relevant and 
experienced talent to support implementation and lead training 
and awareness. 
Global Data Privacy training and communications will be 
launched alongside Cyber and Data Security training in 2018,  
and will provide a good opportunity to raise awareness of  
GDPR internally and the measures and practices being put  
in place to meet the new requirements.
Enterprise resource platform: The Committee has also been 
provided with regular updates on the progress of the Group’s 
implementation of its upgraded enterprise resource platform, 
Globe. As with many large-scale IT deployments, this has  
been complex to manage, with implementation challenges 
leading to delays. However, the majority of the Group is now  
live on the platform. 
RISK COMMITTEE
Another of the Committee’s responsibilities is to oversee the  
work of the Risk Committee. The Risk Committee reports to the 
Committee and the Group Finance Director, Gareth Wright, is  
the Chairman. It comprises the CFO of each Division, the Group 
CIO, General Counsel & Company Secretary, Director of Talent & 
Transformation, Head of Group Finance, Head of Risk and Head 
of Compliance, and meets quarterly. Its principal duties include:
• providing guidance to the Board and the Committee regarding 
the Group’s overall risk appetite, tolerance and strategy;
• overseeing and advising the Board and the Committee  
on the Group’s current risk exposures and recommending  
a risk strategy;
•  reviewing the Group’s overall risk assessment processes,  
the parameters of the qualitative and quantitative metrics  
used to review the Group’s risks, and confirming the actions 
taken to mitigate them;
•  overseeing processes to ensure the Group’s adherence  
to the approved risk policies;
•  reviewing reports on any material breaches of Group policies 
and the adequacy of proposed actions;
•  reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls 
and risk management systems, including all material financial, 
operational and compliance controls;
• reviewing the Group’s approach to and management of  
health and safety risks, including the Health and Safety  
risk appetite statement;
•  reviewing the adequacy and security of the Company’s 
arrangements for its colleagues and contractors to raise 
concerns in confidence about possible wrongdoing in 
financial reporting or other matters; 
• reviewing the Group’s instances of fraud and of fraud 
reporting to the Committee; and
•  reviewing the Group’s insurance arrangements.
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND SIGNIFICANT 
JUDGEMENT AREAS 
As part of evaluating the appropriateness of Informa’s  
financial statements, the Committee assesses whether  
suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether 
management has made appropriate estimates and judgements. 
The Committee reviews accounting papers prepared by 
management that provide details on the main financial reporting 
judgements. The Committee also reviews reports by the external 
auditor on the full year and half-yearly results, which highlight  
any issues identified in their audit process. During the year-end 
process, the Committee concentrated on the following critical 
accounting judgements and key accounting matters:
Valuation of separately identifiable intangible assets 
(Notes 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
To determine the value of separately identifiable intangible  
assets on a business combination, and deferred tax on these 
intangibles, the Group is required to make judgements when 
utilising valuation methodologies. These methodologies include 
the use of discounted cash flows, revenue forecasts and the 
estimates for the useful economic lives of intangible assets. 
There are significant judgements involved in assessing what 
amounts are recognised as the estimated fair value of assets  
and liabilities acquired through business combinations, 
particularly the amounts attributed to separate intangible  
assets such as titles, brands, acquired customer lists and 
associated customer relationships. These judgements impact  
the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisitions. Any 
provisional amounts are subsequently finalised within the 
12-month measurement period, as permitted by IFRS 3.
The Group has built considerable knowledge of these valuation 
techniques, and for major acquisitions, defined as when 
consideration is £75.0m or above, the Group also considers  
the advice of third party independent valuers to identify and 
calculate the valuation of intangible assets arising on acquisition. 
Details of acquisitions in the year are set out in Note 18.
Impairment of assets (Note 16 to the  
Consolidated Financial Statements)
Identifying indicators of asset impairment involves estimating 
future cash flows based on a good understanding of the  
drivers of value behind the asset. At each reporting period,  
an assessment is performed to determine whether there are  
any such indicators of impairment, which involves considering  
the performance of our businesses, any significant changes  
to the markets in which we operate and future forecasts. For 
impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to the specific 
cash generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit from 
the goodwill. When there are changes in business structure, 
judgement is required to identify any changes to CGUs, taking 
account of the lowest level of independent cash inflows being 
generated, amongst other factors. 
The Group has considered a number of assumptions in 
performing impairment reviews of assets, which can be found  
in Note 16. The determination of whether assets are impaired 
requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which 
assets have been allocated, except where a fair value less costs 
to sell methodology is applied. The value in use calculation 
requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to 
arise from each CGU, using five-year projections and determining 
a suitable discount rate to calculate present value and the 
long-term growth rate. The Directors are satisfied that the 
Group’s CGUs have a value in use in excess of their balance 
sheet carrying value. The sensitivities considered by the Directors 
for CGUs that have less headroom are described in Note 16.
Contingent consideration (Notes 18 and 26  
to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
The calculation of contingent consideration involves estimating 
the future performance of an acquired asset, generally based  
on a multiple of revenue or profit in a specified future year.  
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business 
combination includes assets or liabilities from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is 
measured at its acquisition-date fair value, and included as  
part of the consideration transferred in business combination. 
Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that  
qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted 
retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against  
goodwill. These adjustments will result in a restatement to 
previous reported results if the changes relate to amounts  
arising in previously reported periods. Measurement period 
adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional 
information obtained during the measurement period, which 
cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date, about  
facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
Subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration, which do not qualify as measurement 
period adjustments, depends on how the contingent consideration 
is classified. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not 
remeasured at subsequent reporting dates, and its subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration 
classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent 
reporting dates at fair value, with the corresponding gain or loss 
recognised in the income statement.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Committee takes seriously its responsibility for the 
development, implementation and monitoring of the Group’s 
policy on external audit. This policy assigns oversight responsibility 
for monitoring independence, objectivity and compliance with 
ethical and regulatory requirements to the Committee, and 
day-to-day responsibility to the Group Finance Director. It states 
that the external auditor is jointly responsible to the Board and the 
Committee, with the Committee as primary contact. The policy 
also sets out which categories of non-audit services the external 
auditor will and will not be allowed to provide to the Group, subject 
to de minimis levels.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the 
external auditor, the Committee reviewed:
•  the external auditor’s plan for the 2017 year-end audit, noting 
the role of the senior statutory audit partner who signs the 
audit report and who, in accordance with professional rules, 
has held office for three of a maximum permissible five years, 
plus any changes in the key audit staff;
•  the arrangements for day-to-day management of the  
audit relationship;
•  a report from the external auditor describing its arrangements 
to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest; and
•  the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor, in addition to its approval of the provision  
of non-audit services by the external auditor that exceed  
the pre-approval threshold.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Audit review
As part of best practice, management reviews the performance 
of the external auditor once a year to assess the delivery of  
the external audit service and identify areas for improvement.  
In 2017 , Deloitte’s performance was therefore assessed according 
to whether it exceeded, met or was below expectations against a 
variety of factors, with a questionnaire completed by Group and 
Divisional colleagues in different geographies to gather a full set 
of opinions. The results of this assessment process are reviewed 
by the Committee.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditor, the 
Committee reviewed:
• the arrangements for ensuring the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity;
•  the external auditor’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan  
and any variations from the plan; 
•  the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditor in its 
handling of the key accounting and audit judgements; and
•  the content of the external auditor’s reporting on internal control.
Audit tender
Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”) was reappointed as the Group’s external 
auditor following a tender process carried out in 2016 and 
Shareholder approval at the AGM on 26 May 2017 . Deloitte was 
first appointed as the Group’s external auditor in 2004. The 2016 
Annual Report provides details of the tender process undertaken 
during that year. 
Compliance with the CMA Order
The Committee confirms compliance with the provisions of  
the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014. It will keep its 
external auditor under review on an annual basis. Deloitte’s last 
eligible year to serve as the Group’s auditor is the year ending 
31 December 2023.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES, FEES AND POLICY 
The Committee considers that certain non-audit services  
should be provided by the external auditor, because its existing 
knowledge of the business makes this the most efficient and 
effective way for non-audit services to be carried out. 
In 2017 the non-audit fees paid to Deloitte totalled £0.3m 
(2016: £5.1m) and were 14% (2016: 364%) of the 2017 audit fee. 
The majority of non-audit fees in 2017 were incurred for work on 
the half-year review and training services provided to Knowledge 
& Networking. Deloitte acquired a training business during 2017 
that previously provided trainers and course materials for 
participants in a limited number of Knowledge & Networking 
events. The Committee approved the continuation of these 
services in 2017 , which are for the benefit of course participants, 
with fees in the year amounting to £0.1m (of the total non-audit 
fee of £0.3m). 
2018 policy 
Following the approval of a new policy on 2 March 2017 , the 
Group kept under review the provision of non-audit related 
services by the external auditor. This policy seeks to safeguard 
the ongoing independence of the external auditor and ensure  
the Group complies with new regulatory guidance in this area.
To safeguard the independence of the external auditor, the 
updated policy defines and describes:
• those services the auditor is not permitted to provide;
•  those services acceptable for the auditor to provide, where 
provision has been pre-approved by the Committee;
•  those services where the specific approval of the Committee 
is required before the auditor provides the service;
• the fee arrangements appropriate for external auditor 
engagements;
•  the internal approval mechanisms, governance and 
Committee oversight required for engaging the external 
auditor; and
•  the external reporting on the non-audit fee policy required  
as part of the Committee report in the Annual Report  
and Financial Statements.
The policy is designed to ensure that as a public interest entity 
(“PIE”), the Group complies with both the Financial Reporting 
Council Ethical Standard for Auditors and other EU audit 
regulations, which require that:
•  from 2020 the Group will comply with a 70% cap on non-audit 
fees for services provided by the external auditor to European 
Economic Area (“EEA”) PIEs and their EEA subsidiaries. The 
cap is based on the ratio of the average of three consecutive 
years of statutory audit fees to the non-audit fees for services 
paid to the external auditor in the fourth year; and
•  certain non-audit services are permitted and prohibited  
as of 1 January 2017 .
The policy is also designed to ensure that protocols are in  
place before the 70% cap comes into force, to ensure that  
the Committee has adequate opportunity to consider  
whether it should pre-approve non-audit spend with the  
external auditor that would exceed this cap.
This policy is supervised by the Committee, which has  
delegated day-to-day management to the Head of Group 
Finance and who ensures that compliance with the policy  
is kept under constant review.
The following non-audit services are approved and prohibited 
under the policy, subject to certain pre-approvals governed by 
fee limits and nature of service by the Group Finance Director  
and the Committee:
Permitted non-audit services, subject to governance 
and pre-approvals under the policy
•  A u di t - r e l a t e d se r v ic e s
•  Reporting accountant services
•  Assurance services in relation to financial statements  
within an M&A transaction e.g. providing comfort letters in 
connection with any prospectus that Informa may issue
•  Tax advisory and compliance work for non-EEA subsidiaries
•  Expatriate tax work
• Other non-audit services not covered in the list of prohibited 
and permitted services, where the threat to the auditor’s 
independence and objectivity is considered trivial and 
safeguards are applied to reduce threat to an acceptable level
Prohibited non-audit services
•  Bookkeeping and preparing accounting records or  
financial statements
•  Services that involve playing any part in management  
or decision making
•  P a y r o l l se r v ic e s
•  Design and implementation of internal control or risk 
management procedures related to the preparation  
and/or control of financial information, or the design and 
implementation of financial information technology systems
•  Certain valuation services including valuations performed in 
connection with actuarial services or litigation support services
•  Services linked to the financial, capital structure and allocation 
and investment strategy
•  Promoting, dealing in or underwriting shares
•  Internal audit services
•  Certain HR services
•  Certain legal services
•  Services provided on a contingent fee basis
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Internal Audit team is outsourced to KPMG. It provides 
independent assurance through planned audit activities that 
identify controls on a sample and rotational basis and whether 
they are adequately designed and implemented, making 
recommendations for improving controls.
At the beginning of each year the Committee approves a 
schedule of work to be undertaken by the Group’s Internal  
Audit team, with an emphasis on work covering the Group’s  
key risk areas and certain key financial controls. Internal Audit 
attends each Committee and Risk Committee meeting, tabling 
reports on:
• any issues identified around the Group’s business processes 
and control activities during the course of its work;
•  the implementation of management action plans to address 
any identified control weaknesses; and 
•  any management action plans where resolution is overdue.
Internal Audit also attended the Enterprise Resource  
Platform Steering Committee from go-live until the end of  
2017 , assessing the governance process around monitoring  
the SAP implementation and reporting on this to the Committee.
An Internal Audit effectiveness review is carried out each year to 
assess the delivery of the function and areas for improvement, 
where senior internal stakeholders are consulted and provide 
their feedback. Any areas for improvement are discussed at a 
Committee meeting and Internal Audit discusses any identified 
weaknesses directly with senior management.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
2017 PERFORMANCE AND INCENTIVE OUTCOMES
As detailed in the Strategic Report, 2017 was another year of 
improving operational and financial performance. The Group 
completed the Growth Acceleration Plan with all four divisions  
in growth, with the Group’s underlying revenue growth over  
3% and with strengthened platforms and capabilities for future 
scale and performance.
The two measures for the Executive Directors’ 2017 Short-Term 
Incentive Plan (“STIP”) were adjusted diluted earnings per share 
(“EPS”) and underlying revenue growth (“URG”). The reported 
adjusted diluted EPS of 46.1p reflected 100.6% of the target and 
combined with URG of 3.4% led to a total annual bonus of 82.4% 
of the maximum potential, or 123.6% of base salary, being 
awarded to both Executive Directors. Of this award, bonus equal 
to 100% of base salary will be paid in cash and 23.6% will be 
deferred for three years under the terms of the Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan (“DSBP”).
The 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) performance period 
ended on 31 December 2017 . The measures within this plan 
cycle were total shareholder return (“TSR”) compared to the 
FTSE 51–150 peer group excluding financial services and natural 
resources companies, and the compound annual growth rate 
(“CAGR”) in adjusted EPS. The Group’s performance against 
these measures resulted in an overall vesting outcome of  
82.98% of the original award for both Executive Directors. 
COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES IN 2017 
The Committee met eight times in 2017 , with full attendance  
at each meeting except on one occasion when one member  
was absent due to exceptional circumstances. Informa’s 
Chairman, Derek Mapp, attends meetings by invitation only  
and he is not present when matters relating to his remuneration 
are discussed. None of the members who served on the 
Committee during the year had any personal financial interest, 
other than as a Shareholder of the Group, or conflicts of interests 
arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in 
running the business. 
The Committee reviewed its remuneration advisers in early 2017 
and following a tender process, approved the appointment of 
Mercer Kepler, taking over from Willis Towers Watson, which 
served the Committee up to the AGM on 26 May 2017 . 
Summary of Remuneration Policy proposals
The Committee has continued to actively engage with major 
Shareholders through the year, including on its evolving thinking 
on proposed changes to the Policy. Initial thoughts were 
communicated through a series of letters from the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman during 2017 and the Committee intends  
to meet with major Shareholders in March 2018 to further 
understand views and expectations prior to the 2018 AGM. 
The Committee’s own review of its Remuneration Policy 
concluded that the overall approach and structure, which  
has served the Company well through the last three years, in 
substance continues to remain appropriate as Informa moves 
into the next stage of its evolution. However, the framework for 
the current Remuneration Policy was originally introduced in 2013 
when Informa was a very different company. It is now a far larger, 
more international and complex business, even ahead of the 
proposed addition of UBM plc, and so the Committee feels this 
needs to be reflected in the structure, range and targets within 
the updated Remuneration Policy.
Furthermore, should the recommended offer for UBM plc be 
successful, the Committee believes that in order to closely align 
with Shareholder interests, the success of that acquisition and  
the returns it generates through the Accelerated Integration Plan 
should be another key component of management incentives 
over the next few years.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”),  
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
for 2017 . This report is split into two sections: the Remuneration 
Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration. As part of our 
regular three-year cycle, we will be asking Shareholders to 
approve an updated Remuneration Policy at the 2018 AGM. 
The Committee’s primary focus is to align Directors’ remuneration 
to the Group’s strategic priorities, the needs of the business and 
the creation of long-term value for Shareholders. Performance 
measures and targets are designed to be suitably challenging, 
and are based on a range of factors including internal budgets, 
strategic ambitions, analysts’ views and investor expectations. 
While our existing Remuneration Policy has served the Group 
and its Shareholders well, we are proposing a number of 
changes in the updated Policy (set out on pages 97 to 104)  
that are designed to reflect market best practice. 
In addition, we will be consulting with major Shareholders in 
March on how best to motivate and incentivise our Executive 
Directors going forward, in a way that aligns closely to Shareholder 
interests whilst reflecting the evolution of the Group. Even before 
the proposed addition of UBM plc, Informa is a far larger, more 
international and complex business today than it was when the 
framework for the current Policy was first introduced in 2013.
Should the recommended offer for UBM plc be successful, the 
Committee also believes the success of that acquisition and the 
returns it generates for Shareholders through the Accelerated 
Integration Plan should be another key component of management’s 
incentive structure and targets over the next few years.
The recommended offer for UBM plc is subject to a Shareholder 
vote in April and also requires regulatory consent in a number of 
jurisdictions. Consequently, the Committee intends to engage 
with major Shareholders on the updated Remuneration Policy 
ahead of this vote and provide full and final details of all changes 
to the Policy before the 2018 AGM. These will be sent to Shareholders 
after the vote in regard to UBM plc but in advance of the AGM.
As it is currently drafted: 
• The Remuneration Policy can be found on pages 98 to  
104 of this Report. Shareholders will vote on the updated 
Remuneration Policy at the 2018 AGM, in accordance with 
regulatory requirements. 
• Changes made to the Remuneration Policy since Shareholders 
last approved it at the 2015 AGM are set out on page 97 . 
• While the updated Remuneration Policy may stay in place  
for up to three years without a further Shareholder vote,  
the Committee will keep it under regular review.
The Committee also considers environmental, social and 
governance issues, and is specifically mindful that the 
Remuneration Policy does not inadvertently create risks  
in these areas or promote irresponsible behaviours. 
As in 2016, the reward structure for all Informa colleagues is set 
out on page 110 and a comparison of CEO to average colleague 
pay is also included in this report. The Group operates in highly 
competitive markets for talent across the world and the majority 
of Informa colleagues are employed outside of the United 
Kingdom. In each market the Group operates an approach to 
remuneration that is both market relevant and competitive. Our 
statement on reward structure contains more details about the 
progressive terms used for most colleagues and how, through 
ShareMatch, the Committee is encouraging and incentivising  
all colleagues to own shares in the Group.

The Committee is also conscious that market thinking and  
best practice on remuneration continue to evolve and it is  
keen to reflect this. In this respect, it intends to propose a  
number of changes to update the Remuneration Policy,  
including an increase in the level of equity investment and  
holding required by Executive Directors, the introduction  
of a two-year post-vesting holding period for LTIP awards  
following the three-year performance period, strengthened  
malus and clawback provisions, and minor changes to the 
structure of good/bad leavers and change of control provisions. 
More detailed information is contained in the Policy Table  
on pages 98 to 110.
The Group actively encourages colleagues to participate in 
ShareMatch and as part of the Group’s ongoing investment  
in opportunities for colleagues, the matching element of 
ShareMatch was increased to a one for one match at the start  
of the plan year in April 2017 . Participation was immediately 
extended to colleagues who joined the Group from Penton  
and 18% of colleagues in countries where ShareMatch is offered 
were members in 2017 . To make it easier and more efficient for 
US colleagues to invest in the Group’s shares, we plan to launch  
a US Employee Stock Purchase Plan in early 2019. The Group  
is committed to growing colleague participation in share-based 
incentive plans in order to align as many colleagues as possible 
with Shareholders and provide colleagues throughout the Group 
with the opportunity to participate in the Group’s success.
As the Group continues to grow and expand internationally, we 
will monitor and review incentive plans accordingly to ensure we 
maintain a strong link between pay and performance. As part of 
this process we will continue to regularly engage with Executive 
Directors and Shareholders, particularly if any changes are 
proposed. As always, we welcome comments and feedback on our 
executive remuneration arrangements from all our Shareholders.

2017 PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
Executive Directors reward in 2017 
REMUNERATION POLICY
Shareholder approval for the updated Remuneration Policy will be 
sought at the 2018 AGM, as is required every three years under 
the Companies Act 2006. Pages 98 to 104 of this document set 
out the Remuneration Policy, which is subject to further Shareholder 
consultation through March and April. The final proposed form of 
the updated Remuneration Policy will be published to Shareholders 
prior to the AGM and will also be displayed on our website at 
www.informa.com. If approved by Shareholders it will take effect 
from the end of the AGM on 25 May 2018.
Following consultation with major Shareholders and advisory 
groups during 2017 , the changes outlined below are being 
proposed by the Committee, bringing the Group in line with 
current market best practice and the latest developments in 
corporate governance. Additional changes to the Remuneration 
Policy will likely be introduced following the planned further 
consultation and these will be clearly documented in the 2018 
AGM notice under the appropriate resolution, which will be sent 
to Shareholders in advance of the AGM. Shareholder approval 
will be sought at the AGM on 25 May, and the updated 
Remuneration Policy will be included in next year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. 
Incentive structure
An increase in the level of Executive Director equity 
investment and holding 
In order to align with the latest market best practice, the Committee 
is proposing that the percentage of salary Executive Directors are 
required to hold in shares should increase from a minimum of 
150% of salary to 200% of salary. 
An increase in post-vesting holding periods  
for LTIP awards to two years
In order to align with the best market best practice, the Committee 
is proposing that future LTIP awards made to the Executive 
Directors (including in 2018) will be subject to a two-year 
post-vesting holding period following the three-year performance 
period, other than any disposals made to meet income tax, 
National Insurance contributions or other regulatory obligations.
Malus and clawback provisions
In order to better align with the latest market best practice,  
the Committee is proposing an additional malus and clawback 
event referring to mathematical errors in calculating the incentive 
outcomes. This is noted on page 101.
Leaver and change of control provisions
In order to better align with the latest market best practice, the 
Committee is proposing some minor changes to the incentive 
plan structure and wording of the good/bad leaver and change  
of control provisions. These changes are:
•  Le a v e r c a te g o r i e s : Leavers are categorised into ‘good’  
leavers (defined as death, retirement, ill-health, disability, 
redundancy, or any other reason at the Committee’s 
discretion) and all other leavers.
•  Good leaver treatment: STIP: Good leavers will normally 
receive a time pro-rated bonus subject to performance 
measured at the normal time, with Committee discretion  
to dis-apply time pro-rating and/or accelerate testing of 
performance. Default treatment was previously to forfeit  
any bonus if under notice prior to bonus payment date,  
with Committee discretion to override.
•  Good leaver treatment: DSBP: Awards will normally vest  
on the normal vesting date, with Committee discretion to 
accelerate. No Committee discretion was included in the 
previous Remuneration Policy, and good leavers received  
their deferred awards earlier, at the end of the notice period.
•  Good leaver treatment: LTIP: Awards will normally be 
pro-rated for time and vest on the normal vesting date  
subject to performance, with Committee discretion to 
accelerate performance-testing and vesting. Default  
treatment was previously to test performance early and  
allow early vesting, with no Committee discretion to override.
•  Change of control: The treatment of incentives on a change of 
control was not included in the previous Remuneration Policy. 
The new change of control provisions are set out on page 
103, and are aligned to market practice.
The following tables summarise the six key elements of  
Executive Director remuneration packages and the fees  
paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Overview and  
link to strategy Operation Performance framework Maximum
Base Salary
Executive Directors 
receive an annual  
salary, which is  
targeted to be broadly 
market competitive.
Reviewed by the Committee prior  
to the beginning of each year and  
upon a change of position or scope  
of responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the 
Committee considers pay practices  
in the Group as a whole and makes 
reference to objective external data that 
gives current information on remuneration 
practices in appropriate comparator 
companies of a similar size to Informa.
If, in the Committee’s judgement, it is 
appropriate to appoint an individual  
on a salary below market norms, the 
Committee may exceed the normal  
rate of increase set out in the Policy  
Table in the following two to three  
years based on performance in role.
Not subject to performance measures. 
However, an individual’s experience, 
development and performance in the 
role will be taken into account when 
setting and reviewing salary levels.
There are no prescribed maximum 
increases for base salary. In usual 
circumstances, increases will be  
broadly in line with those awarded  
to Group colleagues taking into  
account performance and geography.  
In exceptional circumstances, such as 
following a significant increase in the size 
and/or complexity of the Group or an 
individual’s role and scope, the Committee 
can exceed the normal level of increase.
The Committee will provide the rationale 
for any such higher increases in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration following 
the increase.
Benefits
The arrangements  
offer Executive Directors 
market competitive 
benefits to retain and 
attract high calibre 
individuals.
Ongoing benefits may include but are not 
limited to company car, car allowance, 
death-in-service insurance coverage, 
family private health insurance, family 
dental insurance, accident insurance  
and permanent health insurance cover.
In the event of an international relocation 
additional benefits may include but are  
not limited to relocation, housing and 
schooling costs, financial advice and 
repatriation. It is the intention that any  
such arrangements ensure that an 
individual is not adversely impacted  
should the Group require them to relocate.
Not subject to performance 
measurement.
The maximum car allowance is £20,000 
per annum. Other benefits are provided 
through third parties and therefore the 
cost to the Company and value to the 
Executive Directors may vary.
However, the nature of the provision  
will remain unchanged.
There is no prescribed maximum for 
benefits related to an international 
relocation given the nature of the  
provision and the amounts will vary  
based on factors such as an individual’s 
circumstances and the countries involved.
Retirement and life assurance benefits
The arrangements  
offer Executive  
Directors a retirement 
plan contribution which  
is motivating and in line 
with previous plans at  
the point of recruitment 
as well as in line with  
the market.
Retirement benefits will be paid in part  
or in full into a Group Personal Pension  
or Personal Pension vehicle. The pension 
allowance may also be taken in part or  
in full as a gross cash payment. Any  
cash payment will be paid monthly. Life 
assurance is payable in a lump sum,  
in the event of the insured individual’s 
death-in-service.
Not subject to performance 
measurement.
Retirement benefits: 25% of base salary.
Life assurance: Four times base salary.
Overview and  
link to strategy Operation Performance framework Maximum
Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”)
The STIP rewards 
Executive Directors for 
delivery of excellent levels 
of annual performance.
Performance  
metrics are selected  
to ensure a focus on  
improvements in 
short-term performance 
that will help drive the 
sustainable long-term 
success of the Group.
Bonus can be delivered entirely in cash,  
or in a combination of cash and shares. 
Any bonus up to 100% of base salary  
is paid in cash and any above 100%  
of base salary is deferred in shares  
for a period of three years under the 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”).
Participants will receive a dividend 
equivalent payment in the form of cash or 
shares in respect of DSBP awards that vest.
In certain circumstances the Committee 
will have the discretion to reduce the size 
of or cancel an unvested award (“malus”) 
under the DSBP or require the repayment 
of the cash bonus or shares received (or 
an equivalent cash amount) (“clawback”) 
once awards have been received by the 
Executive Director.
The performance measures,  
weightings and targets are set  
annually by the Committee.
Bonus opportunity will be linked to the 
achievement of challenging financial 
and, when appropriate, non-financial 
performance targets. Details of the 
measures and their weightings will be 
disclosed annually in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration, with the targets 
disclosed retrospectively in the following 
year provided they are not deemed to  
be commercially sensitive at that time. 
Below threshold: performance results  
in a zero bonus. 
Threshold: performance results in a bonus 
of up to 25% of maximum of the award.
On-target: performance results in  
a bonus of up to 67% of maximum  
of the award.
Maximum bonus payout: will  
be confirmed following the major 
Shareholder consultation.
The Committee reserves the right to  
adjust the targets if events occur (e.g. 
material acquisition and/or divestment  
of a Group business) which cause  
it to determine that they are no  
longer appropriate.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The LTIP rewards 
Executive Directors  
for delivery of strong, 
sustained performance 
over a period of  
three years.
Executive Directors can receive an  
annual award of shares (or share-based 
equivalent) subject to the achievement  
of specified performance conditions over 
a three-year performance period.
Awards may vest after three years,  
and a two-year holding period applies  
for vested awards, during which time 
Executive Directors may not sell shares, 
save to cover tax or to meet other 
regulatory requirements.
Participants will receive a dividend 
equivalent payment in the form of cash  
or shares in respect of awards that vest.
In certain circumstances, the Committee 
will have the discretion to reduce the  
size of or cancel an unvested award 
(“malus”) under any share plan or bonus 
plan operated by the Company or  
require the repayment of the shares 
received (or an equivalent cash amount) 
(“clawback”) once shares have been 
received or options exercised by the 
Executive Director.
The performance measures,  
weightings and targets are set  
annually by the Committee.
LTIP awards will be linked to the 
achievement of challenging financial 
and, when appropriate, non-financial 
performance targets.
Details of the measures and  
their weightings will be disclosed 
annually in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, with the targets 
disclosed, at the start of the 
performance period, provided  
they are not deemed to be  
commercially sensitive.
At the end of the performance  
period, the Committee will assess 
performance against the targets  
set and review any other relevant  
events during the period in reaching  
a judgement with respect to the  
overall level of vesting under the award.
Below threshold: performance results  
in a zero vesting.
Threshold: results in vesting of up  
to 25% of maximum of the award.
On target: results in vesting of up  
to 67% of maximum of the award.
Maximum award: will be  
confirmed following the major  
Shareholder consultation.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENTS
The percentage of salary the Executive Directors are required  
to hold in shares or in exercisable options over shares is 
equivalent to 200% of salary. They are expected to meet the 
guideline within five years of appointment and maintain this 
throughout their term. The increased shareholding requirements 
will take effect from the 2018 AGM and the Executive Directors 
will be expected to meet the increased requirement within five 
years from that date.
MALUS AND CLAWBACK
Malus and clawback powers in the STIP , DSBP and LTIP may  
be applied over a three-year period in the case of:
• material misstatement of the Group’s financial results;
•  a mathematical error in the calculation in the number of  
shares or the amount of cash payment under an award;
•  as a result of a regulatory investigation or a breach of any 
material legislation, rule or code of conduct; and
•  if, after the Executive Director has left employment with  
the Group, facts emerge which, if known at the time,  
would have resulted in either the share award lapsing  
or discretion being applied by the Board.
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any 
award or other remuneration arrangements made prior to the 
approval of the current Remuneration Policy (such as the vesting 
of LTIP awards made under a previous Remuneration Policy, or 
made prior to appointment to the Board). Details of any such 
payments will be set out in the relevant year’s Annual Report  
on Remuneration as they arise.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND THE TARGET 
SETTING PROCESS
The performance measures that apply to the STIP and LTIP 
awards are selected by the Committee to align with the Group’s 
strategic priorities and contribute to the creation of long-term 
value. The Committee judges that the performance measures  
for both Executive Directors and senior management do not  
raise environmental, social, governance or operational risks  
by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviours.
The Committee will consult with Shareholders on setting the  
EPS targets for the LTIP , and when setting these targets, the 
Committee considers a range of factors including internal 
budgets, strategic ambitions, analysts’ consensus views and 
investor expectations, as well as performance on environmental, 
social and governance issues. Depending on the nature of the 
measure, some factors play a greater role than others but all 
targets are set to ensure they are suitably challenging.
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE SCENARIOS
A clear majority of the maximum potential remuneration of the 
Executive Directors should be performance related. For each  
of the Executive Directors, the bar charts below illustrate the 
composition of remuneration for the 2018 financial year under 
three performance scenarios:
• Minimum, which assumes no variable elements of pay are 
awarded or vest;
•  On target, which assumes target bonus of 67% of  
maximum, and threshold vesting under the LTIP of 25%  
of maximum; and
•  Maximum, which assumes the variable elements of pay  
are awarded or vest in full.
The projected remuneration outcomes are based on the existing 
maximum opportunities under the STIP in 2018 (being 150% of 
base salary) and the existing maximum opportunities under the 
LTIP (being 200% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive 
and 150% of base salary for the Group Finance Director). Any 
changes to these thresholds following consultation will be 
reflected in updated charts included in next year’s report.
The projected values exclude the impact of any share price 
movements and dividend equivalents.
OTHER REMUNERATION POLICIES 
Appointments to the Board
The Committee will take a number of factors into account when 
making a Board appointment, depending on whether it is an  
external hire or internal promotion. 
The intention is that elements of pay will be consistent with the 
Remuneration Policy Table on pages 98 to 100. To allow for the 
Overview and  
link to strategy Operation Performance framework Maximum
Share Incentive Plans (“SIPs”)
To encourage share 
ownership in Informa in 
those markets where 
SIPs are operated.
SIPs may be operated in markets that 
Informa operates in. These SIPs will  
be informed by relevant tax and share 
legislation. For example, in the UK,  
the Company operates a SIP which 
qualifies for tax benefits.
The Committee retains the discretion  
to allow Executive Directors to participate 
in SIPs that operate in their home market, 
where the terms of participation are 
consistent for all eligible colleagues.
The Board has Shareholder authority  
to match colleague subscriptions up  
to a maximum two for one basis.
Not subject to performance 
measurement.
Limits vary according to local market 
practice. In the UK, the default limits  
set out in the UK tax legislation will  
serve as a maximum, although lower 
levels may be operated in practice.
 
 
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Fees
The fees are set to attract 
and retain high calibre 
individuals by offering 
market competitive fees, 
considering the time that 
is required to fulfil the 
relevant role.
Fees are reviewed annually.
The Chairman of the Board is paid  
a consolidated fee to reflect all the  
duties associated with the position.
The Non-Executive Directors receive  
a base fee reflecting their duties on  
the Board and memberships of any 
Committees. The Senior Independent 
Director and chairs of Board Committees 
are eligible for an additional fee, reflecting 
the additional time and expertise required.
The Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors are covered under the Group 
accident and travel policy as it relates to 
work on behalf of Informa. Expenses in 
line with Informa policy will be reimbursed.
Not subject to performance 
measurement.
There is no prescribed individual 
maximum but the fee levels will reflect 
prevailing market practice and salary 
increases across the Group. The 
maximum annual aggregate fee for all 
Non-Executive Directors is as set out in 
the Company’s Articles, but may increase 
or decrease if the Articles are amended to 
reflect such a change. An increase in the 
aggregate from £1,000,000 to £1,250,000 
is proposed to be put to Shareholders for 
approval at the 2018 AGM.
The Committee is satisfied that the Remuneration Policy is in the best interests of Shareholders and does not promote excessive 
risk taking. The Committee retains discretion to make non-significant changes to the Remuneration Policy without reverting  
to Shareholders.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
uncertainties associated with making appointments, particularly when recruiting externally, the following guiding principles also  
form part of the appointments policy for Executive Directors:
• Salary levels will be informed by the factors set out in the Policy Table and by the individual’s prior experience. If the Committee 
judges it appropriate to appoint an individual on a salary below market norms, it may exceed the normal rate of increase set out  
in the Policy Table in the two to three years following, based on performance in role.
•  Benefits will be in line with the elements set out in the Policy Table, but may vary if a non-UK national is appointed or if a role is  
to be based outside the UK.
•  Subject to the bullet point below, the aggregate incentive awards that can be received in one year will not exceed the maxima  
in the Policy Table. In the year of appointment, an off-cycle award under the LTIP may be made by the Committee to ensure an 
immediate alignment of interests. Performance measures and targets will be reviewed and may be changed to ensure they are 
appropriate depending on the timing and nature of the appointment.
•  In the event of an external appointment, the Committee may buy out incentive awards (both annual and long term) that the 
individual has forfeited on departure. In determining the nature of any award, the Committee will take account of the likelihood  
of vesting, the applicability of performance requirements, the time horizons, the anticipated value of any awards and the vehicle  
of the awards. The fair value of the buy-out award would be no greater than the awards being replaced. In order to facilitate 
like-for-like buy-out awards on recruitment, the Committee may avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.2 to apply an alternative incentive 
structure, if required. 
•  In the event of an internal appointment to the Board, pre-existing obligations can be honoured by the Committee and so payment 
will be permitted under this Remuneration Policy.
Fees for any new Non-Executive Director will be set in accordance with the prevailing level for other Non-Executive Directors at the 
time of the appointment. In the event of a new Chairman being appointed, the consolidated fee will be informed by the individual’s 
experience and profile, as well as the anticipated time commitment and market rates. The Group may pay expenses and additional 
benefits related to travel and relocation depending on the nationality and home market of the incumbent.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Committee’s policy with respect to Executive Director service contracts is summarised below. The Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors have letters of appointment that can be terminated by either party on three months’ notice. The service contracts are 
available for inspection at the registered office and will be available for inspection at the 2018 AGM.
Notice period Up to 12 months’ prior notice by either party
Payment in lieu of 
notice (“PILON”)
Payment on immediate termination by the Company of salary, benefits allowance and pensions allowance covering 
the Executive Director’s notice period. Such payments are to be made in equal monthly instalments in arrears and 
the Group is entitled to reduce such payments by the amount of any earnings received or receivable by the 
Executive Director from any other employment, engagement, office or appointment in respect of the same period.
Change of  
control provisions
The Executive Director will have no claim against the Group or against the undertaking arising out of or connected 
with a change of control of the Company.
Entitlements  
on termination
No automatic entitlement to compensation for the loss of any rights or benefits under any share option, bonus, 
LTIP or other profit sharing or benefit scheme operated by the Company.
No payment of salary, benefits allowance, pensions allowance or bonus except for that described above in PILON.
DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has specific terms of appointment.
The dates of the Directors’ original contracts are shown in the table below. The current contracts, which include details of remuneration, 
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office and will be available for inspection at the AGM. The Executive Directors’ 
contracts have a 12-month notice period by either party and the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are terminable by 
either party on three months’ notice.
LOSS OF OFFICE
The Committee’s principle around loss of office is that no payments for failure will be made. Loss of office payments will be made in 
accordance with the relevant contractual employment or settlement obligations and provisions under the plan rules:
Plan Scenario Timing and calculation of payment/vesting
STIP Retirement, injury, disability, ill-health, 
redundancy, sale of employer or business 
out of Group, or negotiated termination not 
for cause, or any other reason at the 
Committee’s discretion
Performance is typically assessed at the end of the year in the 
normal way, and any resulting bonus is pro-rated for time served 
during the year and paid on the normal payment date. The 
Committee retains discretion to dis-apply time pro-rating or 
accelerate testing of performance.
Death The Committee may make a payment subject to performance. 
Any resulting bonus is typically pro-rated for time, and paid as 
soon as possible after the date of death.
Change of control The Committee will assess the most appropriate treatment for the 
outstanding bonus period according to the circumstances.
All other reasons No bonus is paid.
DSBP Retirement, injury, disability, ill-health, 
redundancy, sale of employer or business 
out of Group, or any other reason at the 
Committee’s discretion
Awards vest at the end of the vesting period with Committee 
discretion to accelerate vesting.
Death Awards vest immediately.
Change of control Awards normally vest immediately; alternatively, awards  
may be exchanged for new equivalent awards in the acquirer 
where appropriate.
All other reasons Awards lapse.
LTIP Retirement, injury, disability, ill-health, 
redundancy, sale of employer or business 
out of Group, or any other reason at the 
Committee’s discretion
Any unvested awards normally vest on the normal vesting date, 
subject to performance, and will be pro-rated for time (based on 
the proportion of the vesting period elapsed).
The Committee retains discretion to accelerate testing of 
performance and vesting and dis-apply time pro-rating.
Death Any unvested awards vest immediately, subject to performance 
and time pro-rating (which the Committee retains the discretion  
to dis-apply).
Change of control Any unvested awards normally vest immediately, subject to 
performance, and will be pro-rated for time (based on the 
proportion of the vesting period elapsed). Alternatively, awards 
may be exchanged for new equivalent awards in the acquirer 
where appropriate. The Committee retains discretion to dis-apply 
time pro-rating.
All other reasons Awards lapse.
In respect of vested LTIP awards that are still subject to a holding period, awards will normally be released at the end of the holding 
period, though the Committee has discretion to determine otherwise, taking into account the circumstances at the time.
The Group may terminate an Executive Director’s service contract with immediate effect, by giving written notice of its intention to 
make a payment in lieu of notice to the Executive Director, that is equal to the salary, benefits allowance and pensions allowance  
that they would be entitled to receive during the unexpired part of the notice period, less any required deductions.
Letters of appointment of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors provide for payment of accrued fees up to the date of termination, 
as well as the reimbursement of any expenses properly incurred prior to the date of termination. Termination may be for any reason, 
including resignation, non-re-election by Shareholders, gross misconduct or termination for cause.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
CONSIDERATIONS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN SETTING THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
In determining the Remuneration Policy, the Committee’s primary focus is on the needs of the business, its alignment with Group 
strategy, and the best interests of Shareholders. Market practice more generally, feedback from Shareholders and aspects of  
practices across the Group are taken into account.
PRACTICES ACROSS THE GROUP
The Group is diverse, operating in many different countries and vertical markets, and with several different lines of business.  
Where businesses join the Group through acquisition, this can also create a level of difference in remuneration practices. 
As a result of this diversity, the level and structure of remuneration for different groups of colleagues differ from the Remuneration 
Policy for Executive Directors. The intention is that all remuneration agreements consider all reasonable factors, and the Committee 
takes into account certain aspects of Group-wide remuneration, such as base pay increases, when setting the Remuneration Policy. 
Other aspects are less relevant because of the operational differences influenced by geography, line of business and in some 
instances legacy plans from acquired businesses. 
The Committee has not sought the views of colleagues in formulating the Remuneration Policy because of the operational challenges 
and cost associated with undertaking such an exercise, and no comparison metrics are used.
For the senior management team, base salary is reviewed annually and takes into account factors consistent with those applied to 
Executive Director pay. Incentive pay varies significantly with greater focus placed on the annual performance of the relevant Division 
or business unit.
The Group’s remuneration policy for colleagues as a whole is based on principles that are broadly consistent with those applied  
to Executive Directors. Annual salary reviews for colleagues are conducted at the same time as the annual salary review for  
Executive Directors, and take into account personal performance, the performance of the Group and salary levels for similar  
roles in comparable companies. 
Colleagues below Executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes and receive benefits and retirement benefits. 
They are also entitled to participate in ShareMatch on the same terms as the Executive Directors.
FEEDBACK FROM SHAREHOLDERS
As noted on page 94, the Committee has been in consultation with its major Shareholders during 2017 and will consult in early 2018  
on the proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy (outlined on pages 97 to 104) and the setting of targets (outlined on page 101). 
The Committee considers all feedback from Shareholders, including feedback received at the AGM each year and guidance from 
Shareholder representative bodies.
The Committee maintains an open and transparent dialogue with Shareholders and takes an active interest in voting outcomes.  
The Committee engages with Shareholders when appropriate on specific matters.
EXTERNAL DIRECTORSHIPS
The Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company, provided that the Chairman determines that  
it is appropriate. The Executive Director will be entitled to retain any fees in relation to such outside appointments. 
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 
This section of the report provides details of how Informa’s existing Remuneration Policy was implemented during the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017 , and how the Committee intends to implement the proposed Remuneration Policy in 2018. Any information 
contained in this section of the report that is subject to audit is highlighted.
Key responsiblities of the Remuneration Committee
• Designing the Remuneration Policy 
• Determining the total remuneration package of the Executive Directors within the scope of the Remuneration Policy 
• Determining the Chairman’s fees
• Approving the design and implementation of all colleague share plans and pension arrangements 
• Reporting on the implementation of the Remuneration Policy 
• Approving the design of and determining targets for any bonus or other performance-related plans
• Approving the appointment of remuneration advisers
The Committee’s full terms of reference can be found on the Company’s website and were reviewed in December 2017 .
Committee membership and meetings 
The Committee comprised three independent Non-Executive Directors during the year. The Committee held eight meetings during the 
year, and attendance at meetings is set out in the table below.

1.  Dr Brendan O’Neill stepped down from the Board and the Committee on 26 May 2017.
In determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee consulted the Chairman about its proposals and no Executive 
Director played a part in any decision about his own remuneration. The Chairman, CEO, Director of Talent & Transformation and the 
Company’s remuneration advisers attended meetings held during the year by invitation. The Director of Talent & Transformation and 
the Company Secretary also provided assistance to the Committee during the year. 
The Committee initiated a review of its remuneration advisers in late 2016, following the review of our external auditor. The process  
was completed in February 2017 and Mercer Kepler was appointed as the Group’s new remuneration adviser. Willis Towers Watson 
(“WTW”) had been the Committee’s adviser since 2010 and continued to provide advice during the first half of the year up to the  
AGM on 26 May 2017 when Mercer Kepler took over. The Committee has satisfied itself that both WTW and Mercer Kepler’s advice  
is independent and objective and both are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group, follow its voluntary code of conduct  
and do not provide any other material services or have any other connection to the Group. 
Dr Brendan O’Neill, who served as a member of the Committee in early 2017 and retired from the Board on 26 May 2017 , is a member 
of the WTW board and did not and has never taken part in any discussions on the selection of WTW or Mercer Kepler, or their contracts. 
Fees paid to WTW in respect of services during the financial year ended 31 December 2017 amount to £27 ,830 and are primarily 
related to advice to the Committee (prior to 26 May 2017) and incentive plan monitoring reports. Fees paid to Mercer Kepler during  
the year ended 31 December 2017 amount to £81,010 and relate to attendance at Committee meetings, Remuneration Policy review 
and advice to the Committee. The Committee has not requested advice from any other external remuneration advisory firms apart  
from WTW and Mercer Kepler during the year ended 31 December 2017 . Legal advice has been taken from Clifford Chance LLP .

1.  Taxable benefits include company car allowance, expenses incurred for accompanied attendance at certain corporate events, professional advice, family private health 
insurance, family dental insurance, accident insurance and permanent health insurance cover.
2.  STIP awards are deferred in line with the Company’s bonus deferral policy. 
3.  The 2015 LTIP award is valued based on the average share price taken over a three-month period from 1 October 2017 to 31 December 2017 and the quantum of shares 
vesting (82.98% of the original award). Performance period covered the financial years 2015, 2016 and 2017 and the performance outcomes for the 2015 LTIP award are 
explained on page 107. The 2014 LTIP award values noted in 2016 have been restated using the share price on vesting (27 March 2017) of 645.0p. Both the 2014 and 
2015 award values include dividends accrued to 31 December 2017.
Components of Executive Director remuneration 
Base salary
Executive Directors’ salaries were reviewed at the beginning of 2017 . The Committee determined that Stephen A. Carter CBE and 
Gareth Wright’s base salaries would increase by 1.0%.
Previous 
salary Effective date 2017 salary Effective date
Stephen A. Carter CBE £817,100 1 January 2016 £825,271 1 January 2017
Gareth Wright £465,900 1 January 2016 £470,559 1 January 2017
Pension
The Group makes a cash payment of 25% of basic salary to the Executive Directors in lieu of pension contributions. Neither Executive 
Director is a member of the defined benefit schemes provided by the Group or any of its subsidiaries, and accordingly they have not 
accrued entitlements under these schemes.
STIP
In 2017 , the STIP was linked to the achievement of budgeted adjusted diluted EPS (weighted 80% of total) and URG (weighted 20%). 
The maximum STIP opportunity was 150% of salary for both Executive Directors. The EPS measure is based on budgeted exchange 
rates, in line with market practice, and therefore the targets and outturn shown below have been adjusted for the impact of exchange 
rates to enable constant currency comparison. 
Measure
Weighting 
(% of 
maximum)
Performance targets
Actual 
outturn
Payout  
(% of 
maximum) Threshold Target Maximum
EPS 80% 42.61p 44.85p 47.10p 45.12p 62.4%
URG 20% 1.0% 1.5% 3.0% 3.4% 20%
Total 100% 82.4%
EPS outturn was between target and maximum, resulting in a payout of 62.4% out of 80% of the maximum award. URG for the  
year was 3.4%, resulting in a full payout of 20%, being the maximum award. Consequently, the overall STIP outcome for 2017 was 
82.4% of maximum, equal to 123.6% of salary for each Executive Director, which the Committee approved, having determined that  
the general financial underpin had been satisfied. 
In line with the Remuneration Policy in effect during 2017 , any bonus above 100% of salary is deferred in shares under the DSBP  
for three years, and is subject to malus and clawback provisions. 
Vesting of 2015 LTIP awards
On 13 February 2015, Stephen A. Carter CBE and Gareth Wright received LTIP awards as set out in the table below:
Date of award
Number  
of shares 
awarded
Price at  
date of  
award

Value at date of

Stephen A. Carter CBE 13 February 2015 306,425 528.00p 200% 1,617,924
Gareth Wright 13 February 2015 130,397 528.00p 150% 688,496
Vesting of the awards was based on relative TSR vs. the FTSE 51–150 (excluding financial services and commodities companies)  
(50% of the award) and EPS growth (50% of the award), measured over the three years to 31 December 2017 .
Under the TSR element, if Informa ranks at median, 20% of the award subject to this measure will vest. This increases on a  
straight-line basis to full vesting for ranking at or above the 80th percentile. A ranking below median will result in the lapsing of the  
TSR element. Under the EPS element, 2% p.a. growth will result in 20% of the award subject to this measure vesting, 4% p.a. growth  
will result in 50% vesting, and 6% p.a. growth or higher will result in full vesting; vesting occurs on a straight line basis between these 
points. Growth below 2% p.a. will result in the lapsing of the EPS element.
In respect of the TSR element, Informa’s TSR over the period was ranked at the 67 .2nd percentile vs. the peer group, resulting in a 
vesting outcome of 32.98% (out of 50%) for that element. In respect of the EPS element, compound annualised growth rate over the 
period was 6.9%, resulting in a vesting outcome of 50% (out of 50%) for that element. The total amount that vested in February 2018 
was 82.98% of the total award.
The performance outcomes above have resulted in the following LTIP vesting levels:

1. The share price used to calculate the value of each award is the closing share price on the date immediately prior to the date of grant of the award.
Vesting of the awards will be based on relative TSR vs. the FTSE 51–150 excluding financial services and natural resources  
(50% of the award) and EPS growth (50% of the award), measured over the three years to 31 December 2019.
Under the TSR element, if Informa ranks at median, 20% of the award subject to this measure will vest. This increases on a  
straight line basis to full vesting for ranking at or above the 80th percentile. A ranking below median will result in the lapsing of  
the TSR element. Under the EPS element, 2% p.a. growth will result in 20% of the award subject to this measure vesting, 4% p.a. 
growth will result in 50% vesting, and 6% p.a. growth or higher will result in full vesting; vesting occurs on a straight line basis  
between these points. Growth below 2% p.a. will result in the lapsing of the EPS element.
The Committee will disclose details of its assessment of performance following the conclusion of the performance period. 
ShareMatch 
ShareMatch, a global share incentive plan (which qualifies for tax benefits in the UK), has been offered to virtually all Informa colleagues 
since 2014. Colleagues are able to invest up to £1,800 per annum in the Company’s shares through monthly contributions or a one-off 
lump sum. 
In 2017 , the Group improved the matching element from a one for two, to a one for one match, further rewarding colleagues who 
participate in the Group as Shareholders. Participation in 2017 reached nearly 1,200 colleagues across the world. Stephen A. Carter 
CBE and Gareth Wright, as well as all of the Executive Management Team, are members of ShareMatch.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2018
A summary of how the proposed Remuneration Policy will be applied for the year ending 31 December 2018 (if approved by 
Shareholders) is set out in the section below.
Base salary and fees
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ fees have not changed since 5 March 2017 but will be kept under review, particularly  
if the combination with UBM completes. 
Pension
The Group will continue to make a cash payment of 25% of basic salary to the Executive Directors in lieu of pension contributions.
STIP
We will consult with major Shareholders in March 2018 about the STIP but it is intended that: 
• the performance measures will be EPS and underlying revenue growth (“URG”), weighted 120% and 30% of base salary, respectively; 
• performance below threshold will result in no EPS-related bonus. Threshold and on-target performance will result in payout of  
25% and 75% of the maximum EPS element, respectively; and 
• a below-threshold performance for URG will result in no URG-related bonus. Threshold and on-target performance will result  
in payout of 0% and 33.3% of the URG element, respectively. 
Full details of performance targets and outturn for 2018 will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
LTIP
The Committee will consult with major Shareholders on the revised Remuneration Policy and potential LTIP awards to the  
Executive Directors. 
It is currently intended that the performance measures will be relative TSR vs. the FTSE 51–150 excluding financial services and natural 
resources (weighted 50% of the total award) and compound EPS growth (weighted 50%).
Under the TSR element, if Informa ranks at median, 20% of the award subject to this measure will vest. This increases on a straight line 
basis to full vesting for ranking at or above the 80th percentile. A ranking below median will result in the lapsing of the TSR element.
The EPS growth performance range will be determined after the Committee has taken into account a variety of factors, including the 
internal and external projections for the Group’s performance, and has consulted with major Shareholders. The range will be disclosed 
at the earliest opportunity.
Details of the award opportunities, performance measures and targets, and time horizon will be discussed with major Shareholders 
and will be disclosed in the 2018 AGM notice, and these details will then be included in full in the LTIP section of the Remuneration 
Policy in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.

The graphs below illustrate the Group’s TSR performance compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Media Index, the 
FTSE 350 Index excluding Investment Trusts and the FTSE 51–150 peer group (excluding financial services and natural resources),  
in the nine-year period ended 31 December 2017 . These indices and peer group have been selected for this comparison because  
the Group is a constituent company of all three.

CEO AND COLLEAGUE REMUNERATION CHANGES AND RATIOS 
An analysis of the average base salary for the senior leadership team, which represents a group of around 160 colleagues around the 
world, has been carried out and results in a ratio of 12.9x as compared with the CEO. 
The key annual remuneration averages in the Group and CEO multiples are:
• Senior leadership team – £317k (12.9x multiple)
• Group-wide – £60k (68.2x multiple)
Comparing the 2017 single pay figure of the CEO with the average pay for UK colleagues results in a ratio of 75.9x, where the average 
UK colleague pay is £53,917 .
All above figures include salary, bonus payments and benefits package, with the CEO’s figure including full LTIP earnings.
The following table shows the percentage change in salary, benefits and bonus from 2016 to 2017 for the Group Chief Executive and 
the average percentage change from 2016 to 2017 for all colleagues of the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT: RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
SECTION E: 
RELATIONS WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS
Group. There are often detailed discussions at Board meetings 
and during informal Board exchanges on Shareholder sentiment 
and engagement. At times of major corporate activity, the  
Board is provided with more regular updates and analysis. 
In October 2017 , the Board commissioned an independent study 
of investor perceptions to gather detailed independent feedback 
from Shareholders as the Group approached the end of the 
Growth Acceleration Plan period. This provided valuable insight 
into Shareholders’ views on the progress made through GAP  
and the future opportunities for the Group. 
Informa’s Chairman Derek Mapp and Senior Independent 
Director Gareth Bullock make themselves available for  
meetings with Shareholders if requested and provide the  
Board with feedback on any issues raised. The Chairmen of  
the Remuneration and Audit Committees are also available  
to discuss any relevant matters with Shareholders. 
2017 engagement highlights
Formal Shareholder engagement takes place to coincide with 
Informa’s financial reporting calendar. 
In 2017 , an in-person presentation and webcast on the Group’s 
2016 full year results took place on 6 March and on 25 July for 
2017 half-year results. Informa held its AGM on 26 May and 
published a trading update on that day. To accompany the 
nine-month trading update on 9 November, a conference call 
was also held for investors and analysts. 
After postponing the annual investor day in 2016 due to the 
process of seeking Shareholder approval to acquire Penton 
Information Services, the 2017 Investor Day was held in London 
on 15 June 2017 . This featured presentations from the Group 
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, and several 
members of the management teams of Business Intelligence, 
Global Exhibitions and Knowledge & Networking. The newly 
appointed CEO of Academic Publishing also attended. 
Informa also attended a number of investor conferences  
through the year as an efficient way to meet with large  
numbers of institutional investors, both current Shareholders  
and non-holders. In addition, the Group organised a series of 
investor roadshows in cities, including Edinburgh, New York, 
Boston, Paris, Barcelona and Frankfurt, as well as hosting 
numerous meetings with investors in London.
Informa was shortlisted for Best Investor Communications  
(FTSE 100 category) at the Investor Relations Society  
Awards in 2017 and was also shortlisted for the Best  
Investor Communication at the 2017 PLC Awards. 
RELATIONS WITH DEBT HOLDERS 
Informa runs an active programme of engagement with debt 
holders. While the Group currently has no public bonds in issue, 
as at the end of December 2017 we had more than £840m of US 
private placement loan notes held by more than 15 institutions. 
The Group regularly holds conference calls and face-to-face 
meetings with debt investors to keep them updated with 
developments and the latest financial results. There is close 
liaison between the Treasury and Investor Relations teams,  
with a common commitment to clear and open engagement. 
E.2 CONSTRUCTIVE USE OF THE  
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
At the AGM, the Board reports to the Shareholders on the 
Company’s performance and welcomes questions and feedback 
from Shareholders.
We value the AGM as one forum for engaging with investors  
and all Directors attend each year. Shareholders are encouraged 
to ask questions of individual Directors and the Chairmen of the 
Board Committees are available for specific questions relating  
to Nomination, Remuneration and Audit.
The Directors are also available to meet with Shareholders  
on an individual basis before and after the AGM.
THE 2017 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
The last AGM was held in London on 24 May 2017 . All Directors 
attended and were pleased to meet with the Conpany’s investors. 
All resolutions were passed and the results were posted on  
the Company’s website following the meeting. The Board 
acknowledged the number of votes received for the 2016  
Annual Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 2016 AGM  
and has consulted with Shareholders during 2017 to address 
feedback and questions. Further information on the consultation 
can be found on pages 94 and 97 of the Remuneration Report. 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2018
This year’s AGM will be held on Friday 25 May 2018, in the 
Heritage Room, Number Twenty, Grosvenor Street, Mayfair, 
London W1K 4QJ, at 11.00 am. The notice is being dispatched  
as a separate document to all Shareholders and is also available 
on the Company’s website. The notice sets out the resolutions to 
be proposed at the AGM and an explanation of each resolution. 
Each resolution proposed relates to a substantially different issue. 
All members are invited to attend the AGM and as required by the 
Articles, a minimum of 20 days’ notice is given to allow members 
to make arrangements to attend. If unable to attend, members 
can appoint a proxy. Details on proxy appointments and the 
voting process can be found in the notice.

E.1 DIALOGUE WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Shareholders are among the most important stakeholder groups 
for Informa, as their support and financial capital enable the 
Group to fund ongoing operations, reinvestment and the addition 
of new businesses. 
To maintain positive and constructive relations with Shareholders, 
the Group runs a proactive engagement programme throughout 
the year, with the aim of providing clear, timely and material 
corporate and financial information, creating forums for 
discussion between management and Shareholders and  
meeting all necessary standards for public company disclosure. 
We operate a Level I sponsored American Depository Receipts 
(“ADR”) programme through BNY Mellon to facilitate investment 
from US-based Shareholders, with ADR ownership accounting 
for 1.7% of Informa’s share capital at the end of December 2017 . 
Informa’s Shareholder engagement programme
The programme is led by the Director of Investor Relations, 
Corporate Communications & Brand who is a member of the 
EMT and attends all main Board meetings. The Group Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director are also heavily involved  
in institutional investor and analyst engagement, and Informa’s 
Divisional CEOs take part where practical and where Shareholders 
have a particular interest in meeting with them. 
Informa holds ad hoc individual meetings and pre-planned 
roadshows to meet current and potential Shareholders and 
analysts. The Group organises wider meetings around financial 
results and major corporate announcements and typically holds 
an annual Investor Day to provide more detailed insight into 
businesses and access to management teams.
The Group also engages with the proxy agencies that advise 
certain Shareholders on governance and voting matters. This 
activity is conducted collaboratively between the Company 
Secretarial and Investor Relations teams. 
The Investor Relations and Communications team puts 
substantial focus on the availability of high quality digital and 
online materials, to ensure that useful information about the 
Group is as accessible as possible to anyone no matter their 
location, size of holding or communication preference. Results 
calls and webcasts are streamed live through the website, with 
audio, video, written transcripts and presentation materials  
made available promptly online.
Shareholders are encouraged to use the website to receive  
and access corporate materials as a way of reducing the cost 
and resources involved with printed materials, and to ensure 
information is received in a timely way. Colleagues who are 
Shareholders through ShareMatch or other personal investment 
plans are also encouraged to use these facilities, alongside 
regular internal communications, to stay up to date on 
developments and performance. 
Board oversight
The Board oversees activity through detailed reporting at each 
Board meeting. This includes data on changes to shareholdings 
and share price movements, information on market sentiment and 
sector news flow, and feedback from analysts and institutional 
investor meetings along with the latest analyst reports on the

the only share class of the Company, are set out in the Articles, 
which can be found on the Company’s website. Subject to 
relevant legislation, any share may be issued with or have

every holder of Ordinary Shares present in person or by proxy 
shall have one vote for every share of which he/she is the holder. 
Electronic and paper proxy appointments and voting instructions 
must be received not later than 48 hours before a GM. A holder 
of Ordinary Shares can lose the entitlement to vote at GMs  
where that holder has been served with a disclosure notice and 
has failed to provide the Company with information concerning

•  the Directors may decide to suspend the registration of 
transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the register of 
Shareholders. The Directors cannot suspend the registration 
of transfers of any uncertificated shares without obtaining 
consent from CREST.
There are no agreements between holders of Ordinary Shares 
that are known to the Company which may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Shares held on trust
Shares are from time to time held by a trustee in order to  
satisfy entitlements of employees to shares under the Group’s 
share schemes. Usually the shares held on trust are no more 
than sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Group’s share 
schemes for one year. The shares held by these trusts do  
not have any special rights with regard to control of the  
Company. While these shares are held on trust their rights  
are not exercisable directly by the relevant employees. The 
current arrangements concerning these trusts and their 
shareholdings are set out on page 178.
Purchase of own shares
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority, under a 
Shareholders’ resolution passed on 26 May 2017 , to purchase 
through the market up to 10% of the Company’s issued  
Ordinary Shares. This authority expires at the conclusion  
of the AGM of the Company to be held on 25 May 2018.

There are no significant agreements to which the Company  
is a party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control following a takeover bid (nor any agreements between  
the Company and its Directors or employees providing for

COLLEAGUE ENGAGEMENT
Informa has a continuous and proactive programme of internal 
communications and colleague engagement activities, designed 
to support and inform colleagues and foster a discursive and 
engaged working culture throughout the Group. 
Further details can be found in the Talent and Partnerships 
section on pages 36 to 41. Colleagues are kept informed on 
Group and Divisional developments by various digital, physical 
and in-person channels, including written and video blogs from 
the Group Chief Executive, Divisional newsletters, email 
campaigns, stories and discussions on the Group’s Portal digital 
workspace and in-person and online town halls and meetings
Colleagues are provided with regular updates on the Company’s 
performance and the Group Chief Executive holds an online town 
hall to coincide with half-year and full year results, as well as at 
other times, where colleagues can ask questions directly.
The Group actively seeks feedback from colleagues on their 
experience of working within the Company, taking that feedback 
into account when prioritising investment in talent and workplaces 
amongst other matters. In 2017 this included a specific Inside 
Informa Pulse conversation to gather colleague perspectives  
on the Growth Acceleration Plan. Informa was again accredited  
a UK Top Employer for 2017 by the Top Employers Institute. 
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES 
Informa aims to attract and retain a diverse range of talent. Having 
a breadth of skills and experiences is both an essential business 
need and, the Group believes, the only right way to operate. 
We recognise the value that differences bring, including but  
not limited to difference of gender, age, race, nationality,  
social background, professional and personal experiences  
and preferences. We comply fully with all national equal 
opportunities legislation, and make recruitment and promotion 
decisions based solely on the ability to perform each role.  
No individual colleague or potential colleague will receive less 
favourable treatment on the grounds of age, gender, sexual 
orientation, disability, colour, race, religion, nationality or ethnicity. 
The Committee’s role on diversity can be found in the Nomination 
Committee Report on page 85, and the Talent and Partnerships 
section on pages 36 to 41 contains more information on the 
Group’s approach to developing and supporting colleagues. 
Where a colleague’s circumstances change, it is the Company’s 
policy to do everything reasonably possible to ensure that a 
successful return to work is facilitated, be it in the same job  
or a different role. 
AUDITOR
Each person who is a Director at the date of approval of this 
Annual Report and Financial Statements confirms that: 
•  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
•  the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware  
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Deloitte LLP has expressed willingness to continue in office as 
auditor and a resolution to reappoint Deloitte will be proposed  
at the forthcoming AGM.
During 2016, the Company conducted an audit tender in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Audit 
Committee recommended Deloitte LLP as the best candidate 
and the Board adopted the resolution in June 2017 to appoint 
Deloitte LLP as the Company’s auditor.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors, whose names are set out on pages 74 and 75,  
are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union and issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board.
International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 1 requires that  
financial statements present fairly the Company’s financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows for each financial 
year. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards 
Board’s “Framework for the preparation and presentation of 
financial statements”.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved 
by compliance with all applicable IFRS. However, the Directors 
are also required to:
•  properly select and apply accounting policies;
•  present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable  
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and 
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for:
• keeping proper accounting records that disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the Consolidated 
Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation;
•  safeguarding the assets of the Company and taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud  
and other irregularities; and
• the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
In accordance with DTR 4.1.12R, the Directors whose names  
and roles appear on pages 74 and 75, confirm that, to the best  
of their knowledge:
•  the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards 
and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
•  the management report, which is incorporated into the 
Strategic Report, includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
In addition, each of the Directors as at the date of this report 
considers the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as  
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information for Shareholders to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF  
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the  
state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s profit for  
the year then ended;
•  the group financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
•  the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting 
Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable  
in the UK and Republic of Ireland”; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Informa PLC  
(the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’)  
which comprise:
•  the Consolidated Income Statement;
•  the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
•  the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets;
•  the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement;
•  the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity;
•  the related notes 1 to 40 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements; and
• the related notes 1 to 11 to the Parent Company  
Financial Statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in  
the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable  
law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation  
of the parent company financial statements is applicable law  
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 
“The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further  
described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of  
the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in 
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to  
our audit of financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services 
prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to 
the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Key audit matters
The key audit matters that we identified in the current and  
prior year were:
• The timing of revenue recognition;
•  The recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill  
and intangible assets; and
•  The identification and valuation of intangible assets  
and associated goodwill in business combinations.
In addition to those listed above we introduced a new key  
audit matter, namely the phased implementation of the  
group’s new SAP system during 2017 . 
Materiality
The audit materiality that we agreed with the Audit Committee for 
the current year was £22.0 million. This represents 5% of statutory 
pre-tax profit adjusted for impairment charges and amortisation of 
intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
The increase in materiality over the prior year materiality figure 
(£16.5 million) reflects the inclusion of a full year’s results of 
Penton, acquired on 2 November 2016.
Scoping
We performed full scope and specified audit procedures at the 
principal business units within the shared services centres in  
the UK, USA and Singapore, and also performed full scope  
audit procedures on Penton in the USA. These in-scope  
locations represent the principal business units within the  
group’s operating divisions and account for 72% (2016: 74%)  
of the group’s revenue and 74% (2016: 78%) of the group’s 
adjusted operating profit.
Significant changes in our approach
Our planned audit approach was discussed with the Audit 
Committee in May 2017 . 
During the year, the group commenced the phased deployment 
of a new SAP system across its shared services centres to 
replace a legacy general ledger system. We originally planned  
to take a controls reliance approach to our audits in the UK 
shared services centre, with fully substantive audits being 
undertaken by other component teams. However, as described 
further below, the findings of our general IT controls audit work 
on the new SAP system led us to change our approach in the  
UK also to a substantive approach. These findings led us to 
elevate the deployment of SAP to a significant audit risk and 
hence a key audit matter. 
There were no other significant changes to our planned audit 
approach, which was reviewed again and finalised with the  
Audit Committee in November 2017 . 
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN, 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND VIABILITY STATEMENT
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in Note 2 to  
the financial statements about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting  
in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s and company’s ability to continue  
to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date  
of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to 
add or draw attention to in relation to that statement required  
by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and 
considering whether they were consistent with the knowledge  
we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge 
obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the 
group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, we are required to state whether we have anything 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
•  the disclosures on pages 27 to 32 that describe the principal 
risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
•  the directors’ confirmation on page 34 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity;
•  the directors’ explanation on pages 33 to 34 as to how they 
have assessed the longer term prospects of the group, 
•  and also on pages 33 to 34 the directors’ assessment of the 
group’s viability, including their description of appropriateness 
of the period selected, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement 
relating to the prospects of the company required by Listing  
Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit. 
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and represent those risks we 
assessed to be the most significant risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud). These matters included those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of  
the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit  
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our  
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion  
on these matters. 
The timing of revenue recognition (2016 and 2017)
Key audit matter description 
The specific nature of the risk of material misstatement in revenue 
recognition varies across the group’s operating divisions. The 
group’s revenue recognition accounting policies are disclosed in 
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements with an analysis 
by revenue stream and by segment in Notes 5 and 6 respectively. 
In respect of the Global Exhibitions and Knowledge & 
Networking divisions customers are generally billed in advance 
and a key risk in revenue recognition is that revenue from events 
and conferences might be recognised in the wrong period, 
particularly if events are held close to year end. 
In respect of both the Academic Publishing and Business 
Intelligence divisions we identified a risk that the deferral and 
release of subscription revenues does not appropriately match 
the subscription period in customer contracts. 
In Academic Publishing we also identified a key risk relating  
to sales cut-off, being the recording of revenue from physical 
book and e-book sales in the period around the year end.
In addition, auditing standards identify revenue recognition as a 
presumed area of potentially fraudulent management manipulation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF INFORMA PLC CONTINUED
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
We confirmed our understanding of each of the divisions’ 
business models and our understanding of the principles set out 
in customer contracts and the sales process. We then confirmed 
our understanding of the design and implementation of controls 
by performing sample transaction walkthroughs of the revenue 
recording process, from order processing to invoice production 
through to cash collection. These procedures enabled us to 
design and perform substantive audit procedures to respond to 
each of the specific risks of material misstatement we identified. 
The substantive audit procedures we performed across the 
entities within our audit scope included:
• for Global Exhibitions and Knowledge & Networking, for a 
sample of transactions, obtaining invoices, payments, exhibitor 
contracts and evidence of event occurrence to determine 
whether revenue was recognised at the appropriate time;
• for Global Exhibitions and Knowledge & Networking, performing 
a trend analysis of revenue over the course of the year, plotting 
revenue against the calendar of events and verifying whether 
these events had occurred to third party sources;
•  for a sample of transactions relating to print or e-book sales 
and exhibitions or conferences occurring close to the year 
end, examining supporting documentation to determine 
whether revenue recognition criteria had been met and 
whether the revenue had been appropriately recognised  
in the period or deferred at the period end; for a sample  
of subscription transactions, obtaining and reviewing the 
relevant order confirmations and contracts to validate  
whether revenue was properly allocated across the term  
of the contract in the correct accounting period; and
•  in the UK shared service centre, employing data  
analytics techniques to recalculate deferred revenue  
in relation to subscriptions.
Key observations
We reported to the Audit Committee that the audit response 
procedures were performed satisfactorily and we did not  
identify any material exceptions as a result of performing  
our audit procedures.
The recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill  
and intangible assets (2016 and 2017)
Key audit matter description
As the group has expanded by acquisition it has recognised 
goodwill and intangible assets as required by accounting 
standards. At 31 December 2017 , total goodwill and intangible 
assets were stated a £2,608.2 million and £1,701.4 million 
respectively (2016:£2,699.5 million and £1,802. 1 million respectively).
Where goodwill exists, accounting standards require that 
management performs an annual impairment test, computing  
the “recoverable amount” normally based on a “value in use” 
approach (an accounting term for the estimated net present value 
to the current owner) and comparing this with the balance sheet 
carrying value of each cash generating unit (“CGU”). This same 
impairment test is required for individual intangible assets where 
indicators of potential impairment have been identified.
To perform its impairment review, management prepares 
forecasts for three years, using the budget for year one and  
the strategic plan for years two and three, and then applies  
a terminal value beyond year three using growth factors and 
discount rates applicable for each cash generating unit. The 
selection of the growth rates and the discount rate assumptions 
requires judgement and is fundamental to this audit risk. 
Management engages independent expert valuation advisers  
to assist in deriving appropriate discount rates.
During 2017 , there have been changes to the composition  
of the CGUs within the group resulting from the integration  
of the Penton business into the group’s existing divisions,  
and further changes to CGUs arising from restructuring  
within the Knowledge and Networking division.
Management discusses the policies and processes followed  
in Notes 2 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  
and impairment of assets is identified as a key source of 
estimation uncertainty in Note 3. This significant judgement  
area is also referred to within the Audit Committee report.  
In 2017 , based on the methodology applied, impairment  
charges of £5.6 million have been recognised (2016: £67 .7 million) 
(see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), primarily 
relating to the TMT and I&I CGUs within Business Intelligence. 
Management also discloses a sensitivity analysis in note 16 
showing the impact on the impairment charge of changes  
to the key assumptions arising from reasonably possible  
future scenarios, and the CGUs which could show impairment 
under these scenarios.
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
We audited management’s impairment testing of goodwill and 
other intangible assets using the following audit procedures:
Assessing management’s methodology:
• assessing the design and implementation of controls relating  
to the impairment review process undertaken by management;
•  considering the process by which management identified 
each CGU, to ensure that they were appropriately aligned with 
the management and reporting structure, and how the assets 
generate cash inflows, and consistent with our understanding 
of the integration of Penton and the reorganisation of the 
Knowledge & Networking division;
• considering how management prepared its forecasts,  
and assessing recent forecasting accuracy against actual 
performance; and
•  involving our internal valuation specialists to assess the 
appropriateness of the key components of the discount  
rate calculation prepared by management’s expert  
valuation adviser.
Reviewing the cashflow forecasts:
• determining whether the 2018 budgets for each CGU were 
consistent with the budgets adopted by management and 
approved by the Board of Directors; and
•  determining whether the projections for 2019 and 2020  
were in line with our understanding of trends in the business 
and how they compared to analyst forecasts;
Performing detailed analysis of CGUs with headroom  
less than 15%:
• determining whether the growth rates selected by management 
were in line with the requirements of accounting standards, 
which require consideration of long-term economic growth 
rates for relevant territories, and with industry trends;
•  considering the reasonableness of sensitivities applied by 
management and performing further sensitivity analyses  
on the impairment models.
Key observations
We reported to the Audit Committee that the audit response 
procedures were performed satisfactorily, that management  
had applied considered assumptions and that the disclosures 
behind the two impaired CGUs (with a year-end value for goodwill 
and intangible assets of £303.3 million) were appropriate.
The identification and valuation of intangible assets  
and associated goodwill acquired in business 
combinations (2016 and 2017)
Key audit matter description
The group acquired a number of businesses during the year,  
the most significant of which was Yachting Promotions, Inc.  
(YPI), which was acquired on 14 March 2017 for a total 
consideration of £111.7 million.
During 2017 , the group also completed 13 further business 
combinations for a consideration of approximately £113.2 million 
(see Note 18) and 16 asset acquisitions resulting in intangible 
additions of £32.2 million (see Note 17).
Accounting for business combinations and asset acquisitions  
can be complex and requires judgements to be applied and 
assumptions to be used when assessing the fair value of the 
consideration paid, the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, 
the identification and valuation of acquired intangible assets  
and any associated goodwill that arises.
For this reason management commissions independent valuation 
experts for significant acquisitions, which management determines 
to be those with a total consideration in excess of £75 million 
(2016: £50 million). 
During the year management finalised the provisional values used 
in accounting for the acquisition of Penton in November 2016, 
and has now adjusted the provisional amounts recognised within 
the 2016 financial statements, as shown in Note 4.
Management discusses the policies and processes followed in 
Note 2, and discloses business combinations in Note 18 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. In Note 3 the valuation of 
intangible assets acquired in business combinations is identified 
by management as a critical accounting judgement. 
This judgement area is also referred to within the Audit 
Committee report.
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
We tested the design and implementation of controls relating to 
business combinations. For each business combination where 
the total consideration exceeded audit materiality, we audited the 
acquisition accounting applied by management, including:
•  review of the sale and purchase agreement;
•  assessing the fair values recorded at acquisition;
•  engaging Deloitte internal valuations specialists to review  
and challenge the identification and valuation of intangible 
assets, the basis for their valuation, and benchmarking the 
reasonableness of the key valuation assumptions, such as 
discount rates, useful economic lives and growth rates; and
• evaluating the business assumptions applied by management 
in determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets,  
in particular in relation to operating forecasts.
We audited the finalisation of the provisional values used in 
accounting for the acquisition of Penton and the restatement. 
Key observations
We reported to the Audit Committee that the audit response 
procedures were performed satisfactorily and we did not  
identify any material exceptions as a result of performing  
our audit procedures. 
In particular we commented on the finalisation of the fair values  
of Penton acquisition accounting and management’s considered 
assessment of the useful lives of the Penton assets acquired  
and the related restatement to the provisional values recorded  
in the prior period.
We note that management has elected to show the fair value 
amounts within Note 18 for acquisitions made in 2017 as 
provisional as permitted by IFRS 3 Business Combinations for 
finalisation within 12 months of the respective acquisition dates.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF INFORMA PLC CONTINUED
The implementation of the new global ERP system  
(new in 2017)
Key audit matter description
In 2017 the group commenced the phased deployment  
of a new SAP system across its shared services centres  
to replace the legacy general ledger system, CODA. 
The risk in relation to the deployment of this new finance system 
has two elements: first, that the data migration to the new SAP 
system might not be complete or accurate, and, second, that 
both the IT and business process controls implemented might 
not be designed, implemented or operating in a manner conducive 
to the effective processing and reporting of financial information.
We originally planned to take a controls reliance approach in the 
UK shared services centre, with fully substantive audits being 
undertaken by other component teams. However, the findings  
of our general IT controls audit work on the new SAP system  
led us to change our approach in the UK also to a substantive 
approach and to elevate the change in systems to a significant 
risk and a key audit matter. The findings included significant 
deficiencies in internal controls in relation to the provisioning  
of privileged user access rights within the new SAP system. 
During the implementation phase, user access rights for certain 
individuals had been extended beyond that designed, which 
increased the risk of inappropriate financial transactions being 
posted, either through fraud or error, thus potentially affecting  
our ability to rely on the data contained within the SAP system.
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
The procedures performed under our original audit plan, which 
we conducted alongside our IT audit specialists, included: 
Programme governance
• considering the company’s governance and controls  
around the phased data migrations; and
•  considering the programme assurance activities of  
internal audit.
Data migration
• reviewing presentations to the Steering Committee before  
and after each data migration and associated minutes;
•  testing the design and implementation of relevant controls  
to ensure that the completeness and accuracy of the data 
migrated was validated and approved by an appropriately 
senior member of IT and/or finance management; and
• sampling reconciliations of migrated data to compare data 
within ledgers before and after migration to ensure all data 
was transferred appropriately, and is complete and accurate.
Conduciveness to effective processing  
and reporting of financial information
•  testing the General IT Controls (GITCs) over access  
security, change management and IT operations,  
using our proprietary GITC auditing tools; and 
•  testing automated business process controls embedded 
within the SAP system, to confirm that controls were 
implemented as designed within the project plans and risk 
and control matrices, using our proprietary SAP control tools.
The findings of our general IT controls audit work on the new 
SAP system led us to adopt a substantive audit approach also  
in the UK. We communicated the findings and our revised risk 
assessment to our US and Singapore component audit teams, 
who had previously planned to take a substantive audit approach, 
to ensure the findings could be taken into account in their 
component audits.
We performed additional procedures in order to investigate  
and assess the potential exposure from the control  
deficiencies identified, working alongside the group’s  
technology team, including:
•  investigating whether inappropriate activities to undermine 
data integrity had in fact been performed from the two 
highest-risk privileged access assigned to end users.  
This was performed via a reconciliation of system logs 
showing all activities of this nature performed, to supporting 
documentation provided by management and/or an audit  
trail of management approval of these privilege rights.
• performing additional sample tests on reports produced  
from the SAP system to ensure that the information  
included in those reports was complete and accurate.
This exposure testing provided assurance to reduce the risk that 
the integrity of the data in the SAP system had been undermined, 
and that we could therefore use financial data and reports from 
the system for our substantive audit testing. Nevertheless, since 
we noted significant IT controls weaknesses, auditing standards 
obliged us to re-plan our audit, and re-assess the risks of material 
misstatement for account balances and classes of transaction, 
which we performed in consultation with our technical specialists, 
such activities including:
•  reconsidering and revising the risk classifications we attached 
to specific account balances and classes of transactions;
• performing additional substantive audit procedures,  
where we had initially planned to rely upon the operating 
effectiveness of controls;
•  extending the scope of our procedures in relation to review 
scope entities contributing more than £10 million of revenue  
to include detailed analytical reviews of the income statement 
and balance sheet for these entities, through detailed 
discussions with management in order to identify any 
significant unexplained items;
•  extending the use of data analytics techniques within  
our audit procedures; and 
•  performing additional tests of journal entries to ensure 
appropriate segregation of duties, that journals have  
been appropriately approved, and that they have valid 
business rationale.
Key observations 
We reported to the Audit Committee that the additional response 
procedures were performed satisfactorily and that whilst for  
audit purposes the additional procedures had achieved the  
audit objectives, management has further SAP stabilisation 
activities to perform.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality 
for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements
Parent company  
financial statements
Materiality £22.0 million 
(2016: £16.5 million)
£1 1.0 million  
(2016: £8.25 million)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
Our planning materiality is 
based on a percentage of 
statutory pre-tax profit 
adjusted for impairment 
charges and amortisation  
of intangible assets acquired  
in business combinations. 
£22.0 million represents  
5% of this measure  
(2016: £16.5 million, 5%).
£22.0 million represents 8.3% 
of statutory profit before tax 
(2016: 9.3%).
The basis for determining 
materiality is consistent with 
the prior year and is capped  
at 50% of group materiality, 
which is lower than materiality 
calculated as 3% of net assets.
Rationale for  
the benchmark 
applied
We adjust for goodwill 
impairment charges and 
amortisation of intangible 
assets acquired in business 
combinations to use a profit 
measure also used by 
analysts, and because  
profits adjusted for these  
items more closely aligns  
with current cash flows. 
Net assets is normally 
considered an approriate 
benchmark for materiality  
as the parent company is  
a holding company, but in  
this case this benchmark 
produces a higher result  
than 50% of group materiality. 
Misstatement 
reporting 
threshold
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £1. 1 million 
(2016: £750,000), as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee material disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of 
the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group 
level. Based on that assessment, we performed full scope and 
specified audit procedures at the principal business units within 
the shared services centres in the UK, USA and Singapore.  
We also performed full scope audit procedures on Penton  
in the USA. The parent company is located in the UK and  
audited directly by the group audit team.
The scope of our audit for 2017 changed on the prior year with 
the removal of BTS (Brazil) and Virgo (US) from our group audit 
scope, and the inclusion of Penton (USA) within full scope audit 
procedures, reflecting the inclusion of Penton in the results for  
a full year.
The in-scope locations (those at which a full scope audit or 
specified audit procedures were performed) represent the 
principal business units within the Group’s operating divisions 
and account for 72% (2016: 74%) of the Group’s revenue and 
74% (2016: 78%) of the Group’s adjusted operating profit. We 
audit the entirety of the Group’s goodwill and acquired intangible 
assets. Our audit work at all the locations in the group audit 
scope was executed to a materiality of up to £11.0 million, and 
therefore not exceeding 50% of Group materiality of £22.0 million.
At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and 
carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement in the 
aggregated financial information of the remaining components 
not subject to audit.
Revenue
Adjusted 
operating 
profit
Full audit scope 68% 69%
Specified audit procedures 4% 5%
Review at group level 28% 26%
100% 100%
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor 
or a designate visits each of the locations in the Group audit 
scope at least once every two years and the most significant of 
them at least once a year. In the course of the 2017 audit, visits 
were undertaken to the shared service centres in Colchester, UK 
and Sarasota and Cleveland, USA. In the prior year, visits were 
also made to Singapore and Brazil. In years when we do not visit 
a significant component we include the component audit team  
in our team briefings, discuss their risk assessment, support and 
direct their audit approach, dial into local audit close meetings, 
perform remote reviews of their working papers, and review their 
reporting to us of the findings from their work.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF INFORMA PLC CONTINUED
OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED  
IN THE ANNUAL REPORT
The directors are responsible for the other information.  
The other information comprises the information included  
in the annual report, other than the financial statements  
and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated  
in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there  
is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a  
material misstatement of the other information. If, based on  
the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a  
material misstatement of this other information, we are required  
to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to  
report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the  
other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given  
by the directors that they consider the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business 
model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work 
of the audit committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement 
required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the 
group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have  
no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT  
OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from  
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to  
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee  
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken  
on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
USE OF OUR REPORT
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and  
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND  
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Opinions on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report  
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance  
with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course  
of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group  
and of the parent company and their environment obtained  
in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material 
misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report  
if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
OTHER MATTERS
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we  
were reappointed by the Board on 26 May 2017 to audit the 
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017 .  
The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointments of the firm is 14 years, covering  
the years ending 2004 to 2017 . The most recent external audit 
tender was finalised in June 2016.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the 
Audit Committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report  
to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in  
accordance with ISAs (UK).

1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Informa PLC (“the Company”) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange. The Company is a public company limited by shares and is registered in England and Wales with registration 
number 08860726. The address of the registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. The nature of the Group’s operations 
and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report.
The Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2017 and for the year then ended comprise those of the Company and its 
subsidiaries and its interests in joint ventures and associates (together referred to as “the Group”).
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (“GBP”), the functional currency of the Parent Company, Informa PLC. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 2.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the Consolidated Financial Statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further detail is contained in the Strategic 
Report on page 35.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and 
hedged items which are measured at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below, all of which have been 
consistently applied to all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries. Control is achieved where 
the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity, has the rights to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold  
are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of acquired subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line 
with those used by other members of the Group. 
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity and consist  
of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination plus their share of changes in equity since that date.
Joint ventures are joint arrangements in which the Group has the rights to the net assets through joint control with a third party. Joint 
operations arise where there is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about 
the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control, and where the joint operators have rights to the 
assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Associates are undertakings over which the Group exercises 
significant influence, usually from 20%–50% of the equity voting rights, in respect of the financial and operating policies.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures and associates using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment 
in the joint venture or associate is initially measured at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in 
the Group’s share of net assets of the joint venture or associate since the acquisition date. The income statement reflects the Group’s 
share of the results of operations of the entity. The statement of comprehensive income includes the Group’s share of any other 
comprehensive income recognised by the joint venture or associate. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive  
the payment is established. Where an associate or joint venture has net liabilities, full provision is made for the Group’s share of 
liabilities where there is a constructive or legal obligation to provide additional funding to the associate or joint venture.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of 
the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated at the rates 
ruling at that date. These translation differences are included in net operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the  
date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency  
are not retranslated.
The balance sheet of foreign subsidiaries is translated into pounds sterling at the closing rates of exchange. The income statement 
results are translated at an average exchange rate, recalculated for each month between that month’s closing rate and the equivalent 
for the preceding month.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of opening net investments in foreign subsidiaries at the closing rate are 
taken directly to the translation reserve. In addition, foreign exchange differences arising from retranslation of the foreign subsidiaries’ 
results from monthly average rate to closing rate are also taken directly to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences 
are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the financial year in which the operations are disposed of. The translation 
movement on matched long-term foreign currency borrowings, qualifying as hedging instruments under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement, are also taken directly to the translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the acquisition closing rate.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and other asset purchases that are assessed as meeting the definition of a business under the  
rules of IFRS 3 Business Combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group  
in exchange for control of the acquiree. If the accounting for business combinations involves provisional amounts, which are finalised in 
a subsequent reporting period during the 12-month measurement period as permitted under IFRS 3, restatement of these provisional 
amounts may be required in the subsequent reporting period. In the year ended 31 December 2017 , the 12-month measurement 
period ended for the Penton acquisition, which was acquired on 2 November 2016. This resulted in a restatement of the provisional 
amounts previously reported in the year ended 31 December 2016. Full details of the restatement are provided in Note 4. Acquisition 
and integration costs incurred are expensed and included in adjusting items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is classified as a financial liability that is within the scope of IAS 39  
will be recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised 
for non-controlling interests over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair 
value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss. On an acquisition by acquisition basis, 
the Group recognises any non-controlling interest either at fair value (under the full goodwill method) or at the proportionate share of 
the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Disposal
At the date of a disposal, or loss of control, joint control or significant influence over a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the Group 
derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the entity, with the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest and 
any cumulative translation differences recorded in equity. The fair value of consideration including the fair value of any investment 
retained is recognised. The consequent profit or loss on disposal that is not disclosed as a discontinued operation is recognised in 
profit and loss within “profit or loss on disposal of subsidiaries and operations”.
Equity transactions
Where there is a change of ownership of a subsidiary without a change of control, the difference between the consideration and  
the relevant share of the carrying amount of net assets acquired or disposed of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. The carrying 
amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary.  
Any difference between the amount at which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration is 
recognised directly in equity.
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes, and provisions for returns  
and cancellations. 
Subscription income for online services, information and journals is normally received in advance and is therefore deferred and 
recognised evenly over the term of the subscription. Revenue from exhibitions, trade shows, conferences and learning events,  
together with attendee fees and event sponsorship, is recognised when the event is held, with advance receipts recognised as 
deferred income in the balance sheet. 
Unit sales revenue is recognised on the sale of books and related publications when title passes, depending on the terms of the  
sales agreement. 
Marketing and advertising services revenues are recognised on issue of the related publication or over the period of the advertising 
subscription or over the period when the marketing service is provided.
Revenue relating to barter transactions is recorded at fair value and recognised in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition 
policies. Expenses from barter transactions are recorded at fair value and recognised as incurred. Barter transactions typically involve 
the trading of advertisements and trade show space in exchange for services provided at events.
Pension costs and pension scheme arrangements
Certain Group companies operate defined contribution pension schemes for colleagues. The assets of the schemes are held separately 
from the individual companies. The pension cost charge associated with these schemes represents contributions payable and is 
charged as an expense when incurred.
The Group also operates funded defined benefit schemes for colleagues. The cost of providing these benefits is determined using  
the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at regular intervals. There is no service cost due to the 
fact that these schemes are closed to future accrual. Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the opening net defined 
benefit liability or asset and shown in finance costs, and the administration costs are shown as a component of operating expenses. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Consolidated Income Statement and 
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus in the Group’s 
defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in  
the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. 
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain colleagues. These are measured at fair value at date of grant.  
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight line basis, after allowing for  
an estimate of the share awards that will actually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number  
of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss  
such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate. 
For awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), where the proportion of the award is dependent on the level of total shareholder 
return, the fair value is measured using a Monte Carlo model of valuation, which is considered to be the most appropriate valuation 
technique. The valuation takes into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
Where the proportion of the award is dependent on earnings per share performance conditions, which are non-market based 
measures, the fair value is remeasured at each reporting date to reflect updates for expected or actual performance. For awards 
issued under ShareMatch, the fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate  
of shares that will eventually vest. For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised over the vesting period, with the  
fair value remeasured at each reporting date and any changes recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Own shares are deducted in arriving at total equity and represent the cost of the Company’s Ordinary Shares acquired by the 
Employee Share Trust (“EST”) and ShareMatch in connection with certain of the Group’s colleague share schemes. 
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax. Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s 
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
A current tax provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group 
will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The provision is the best 
estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using  
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax nor 
accounting profit.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Deferred tax is calculated for all business combinations in respect of intangible assets and properties. A deferred tax liability is 
recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value of those assets for tax purposes 
and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax 
is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies and businesses is calculated as the excess of the fair value of purchase 
consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition. It is recognised as an asset  
at cost, assessed for impairment at least annually and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed. Fair value 
measurements are based on provisional estimates and may be subject to amendment within one year of the acquisition in line  
with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, resulting in an adjustment to goodwill. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units (“CGUs”), as determined  
by the Executive Directors, which are expected to benefit from the combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more 
frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired. Where an impairment test is performed, the carrying value is compared 
to the recoverable amount which is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less cost of disposal. Value in use is the present 
value of future cash flows and is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the cash flows of the CGU compared with 
the carrying value of that CGU, including goodwill. The Group estimates the discount rates as the risk-adjusted cost of capital for the 
particular CGUs. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis  
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. At each reporting date, the Group reviews the composition of its CGUs to reflect the 
impact of changes to cash inflows associated with reorganisations of its reporting structure. 
On disposal of a business which includes all or part of a CGU, any attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or 
loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. For intangible assets acquired in business combinations, cost is calculated based  
on the Group’s valuation methodologies (Note 17). These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis, 
as follows:
Book lists       20 years
1
Journal titles      20 years
1
 
Brands and trademarks     10–30 years
Customer relationship database and intellectual property  10–30 years
Non-compete agreements     1–3 years
Software       3–10 years
Product development     3–5 years
1. Or licence period if shorter. 
Software which is not integral to a related item of hardware is included in intangible assets. Capitalised internal-use software costs 
include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software, and payroll and other direct 
costs for employees who devote substantial time to the project. Capitalisation of these costs ceases when the project is substantially 
complete and available for use. These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives. 
Product development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset only if all of certain conditions are met, with all research costs 
and other development expenditure being expensed when incurred. The capitalisation criteria are as follows:
•  an asset is created that can be separately identified, and which the Group intends to use or sell;
•  it is technically feasible to complete the development of the asset for use or sale;
•  it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefit; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
The expected useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually. The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite 
lives (excluding goodwill).
Property and equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided to 
write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  
of the assets. Freehold land is not depreciated. The rates of depreciation on other assets are as follows:
Freehold buildings   50 years
Leasehold land and buildings  Over life of the lease 
Equipment, fixtures and fittings 3–15 years 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the net sale proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is  
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset  
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset, for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset  
(or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant  
asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Investments in joint ventures, associates and joint operations
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint  
venture. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the arrangement. The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity 
method and stated in the balance sheet at cost adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets, less any 
impairments in value. 
Joint operations arise where there is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions 
about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control, and where the joint operators have rights to 
the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. These are accounted for by recognising the assets, liabilities, 
revenues and expenses relating to the interest in the joint operation in accordance with the IFRS relevant to particular revenues, 
assets, liabilities and expenses.
Other investments 
Other investments are entities over which the Group does not have significant influence, where the Group holds less than 20% interest 
in the voting interests of the entity. Other investments are classified as assets held at fair value through profit and loss, with changes in 
fair value reported in the income statement.
Inventory 
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and expenses incurred in bringing the 
inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less marketing and distribution 
costs expected to be incurred. Pre-publication costs are included in inventory, representing costs incurred in the origination of content 
prior to publication. These are expensed systematically, reflecting the expected sales profile over the estimated economic lives of the 
related products (typically over one to five years).

Leases
Leases would be classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire-purchase contracts would be capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the lease  
and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. The corresponding 
liability to the lessor is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Finance charges are allocated over 
the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in equal annual amounts on a straight line basis over  
the lease term. Lease incentives where these are received from the lessor, such as rent-free periods and contributions to leasehold 
improvements, are treated as a reduction in lease rental expense and spread over the term of the lease.
Rental income from sub-leasing property space is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised in the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are classified into the following categories: trade and other receivables, and cash at bank and on hand.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and with a maturity of three months or less and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank 
overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of 
cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated 
future cash flows of the investment have been negatively impacted.
For unlisted shares classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is 
considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets, objective evidence of impairment could include:
•  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
•  default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
• a probability that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are 
subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could 
include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the 
average credit period of 30 days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with increased 
default risk on receivables. A specific provision will also be raised for trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the Group 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the 
debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 
90 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against the provision account. Changes in the carrying amount of the provision are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs and stated at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method.
Net debt 
Net debt consists of cash and cash equivalents and includes bank overdrafts, borrowings and other loan receivables where these are 
interest bearing and do not relate to deferred consideration arrangements and finance leases.
Debt issue costs 
Debt issue costs, including premium payable on settlement or redemption, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the Consolidated 
Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest  
rate method.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, as set out above, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The 
derivative instruments utilised by the Group to hedge these exposures are primarily interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.  
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated 
as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
•  hedges of a change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedge);
•  hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); 
or
• hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as 
its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge 
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values 
or cash flows of the hedged item.
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit  
or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are 
recognised in the line of the Consolidated Income Statement relating to the hedged item. 
Hedges of net investment in foreign operations
Hedges of net investment in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument in relation to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
foreign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in the 
foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item is disposed of. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement as they arise.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until 
the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised  
in equity is transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than  
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or 
current liabilities.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 30.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will  
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated 
to the affected parties or implementation has commenced.
Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
Standards and interpretations adopted in the current year
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted in the current year:
•  Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses – effective from 1 January 2017;
•  Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative – effective from 1 January 2017; and
• Annual improvements to IFRS: 2014-2016 Cycle – specific items effective from 1 January 2017 .
The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not led to any changes to the Group’s accounting policies or had any  
other material impact on the financial position or performance of the Group. Other amendments to IFRS effective for the year  
ended 31 December 2017 have had no impact on the Group.
Standards and interpretations in issue, but not yet effective 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied  
in these financial statements were in issue but have not yet come into effect:
Effective from 1 January 2018:
•  I F R S 9 Financial Instruments – EU endorsed;
•  I F R S 1 5 Revenue from Contracts with Customers – EU endorsed; 
•  Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts – EU endorsed;
•  Interpretation IFRIC 22: Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration – not yet EU endorsed.
•  Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions – not yet EU endorsed;
•  Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle (certain items effective from 1 January 2017) – not yet EU endorsed; 
• Amendments to IAS 40: Transfer of Investment Property – not yet EU endorsed. 
Other items applicable in subsequent periods:
•  I F R S 1 6 Leases (effective from 1 January 2019) – EU endorsed;
•  Interpretation IFRIC 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments – not yet EU endorsed;
•  Amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation – not yet EU endorsed;
•  Amendments to IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures – not yet EU endorsed; 
•  Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle – not yet EU endorsed;
•  I F R S 1 7 Insurance Contracts – not yet EU endorsed.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will not have a material impact  
on the financial statements of the Group, except as described in relation to IFRS 16 Leases and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts  
with Customers: 
•  I F R S 9 Financial Instruments (effective for the 2018 financial year) replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement. The new standard introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and liabilities in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Group has conducted an assessment of the impact of this standard and concluded there  
is not expected to be any significant adjustment required on the measurement, presentation or disclosure of financial assets and 
liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the standard is adopted. 
•  I F R S 1 5 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for the 2018 financial year) is a new standard providing a single point  
of reference for revenue recognition, based on a five-step model framework, which replaces all existing revenue accounting 
standards, interpretations and guidance. The major change is the requirement to identify and assess the satisfaction of delivery  
of each performance obligation in contracts in order to recognise revenue. 
  Following an assessment of the financial impact of the changes required from the forthcoming adoption of this new standard, the 
Group does not expect there to be any material change to the Consolidated Income Statement of the Group. The Consolidated 
Balance Sheet will be adjusted by the requirement to net-down deferred income against trade receivables for amounts that have 
been invoiced but are not yet due. This balance sheet adjustment will not affect the net assets of the Group and will involve the 
reduction of approximately £70m of both the accounts receivable balance and deferred income as at 31 December 2017 . 
•  I F R S 1 6 Leases (effective for the 2019 financial year) will replace the existing leasing standard, IAS 17 Leases. It will treat all leases  
in a consistent way, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases, and require lessees to recognise all leases, 
with a term of greater than 12 months, on the balance sheet. The most significant effect of the new requirements will be an increase 
in lease assets and lease liabilities for leases currently categorised as operating leases. The new standard changes the nature of 
expenses related to those leases, replacing the straight line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for the lease asset 
(included within operating costs) and an interest expense on the lease liability (included within finance costs). The Group is in the 
process of assessing the impact of this new standard and will provide a further update in the half-year results for the six months to 
30 June 2018 and a full impact assessment in the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ending 31 December 2018. 
Note 34 provides further information on the Group’s operating lease obligations.
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Critical accounting judgements
In addition to the judgement taken by the Group in selecting and applying the accounting policies set out above, the Directors have 
made the following judgements concerning the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Valuation of separately identifiable intangible assets (Notes 17 and 18)
To determine the value of separately identifiable intangible assets on a business combination, and deferred tax on these intangibles, 
the Group is required to make judgements when utilising valuation methodologies. These methodologies include the use of discounted 
cash flows, revenue forecasts and the estimates for the useful economic lives of intangible assets. 
There are significant judgements involved in assessing what amounts are recognised as the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities 
acquired through business combinations, particularly the amounts attributed to separate intangible assets such as titles, brands, 
acquired customer lists and associated customer relationships. These judgements impact the amount of goodwill recognised on 
acquisitions. Any provisional amounts are subsequently finalised within the 12-month measurement period, as permitted by IFRS 3.
The Group has built considerable knowledge of these valuation techniques, and for major acquisitions, defined as when consideration 
is £75.0m or above, the Group also considers the advice of third party independent valuers to identify and calculate the valuation of 
intangible assets arising on acquisition. Details of acquisitions in the year are set out in Note 18.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised. 
Impairment of assets (Note 16)
Identifying indicators of asset impairment involves estimating future cash flows based on a good understanding of the drivers of  
value behind the asset. At each reporting period, an assessment is performed to determine whether there are any such indicators  
of impairment, which involves considering the performance of our businesses, any significant changes to the markets in which we 
operate and future forecasts. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to the specific cash generating units (“CGUs”)  
that are expected to benefit from the goodwill. When there are changes in business structure, judgement is required to identify any 
changes to CGUs, taking account of the lowest level of independent cash inflows being generated, amongst other factors. 
The Group has considered a number of assumptions in performing impairment reviews of assets, which can be found in Note 16.  
The determination of whether assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which assets have been 
allocated, except where a fair value less costs to sell methodology is applied. The value in use calculation requires the Group to 
estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from each CGU, using five-year projections and determining a suitable discount  
rate to calculate present value and the long-term growth rate. The Directors are satisfied that the majority of the Group’s CGUs  
have a value in excess of their balance sheet carrying value. The sensitivities considered by the Directors for CGUs that have less 
headroom are described in Note 16.

3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED
Contingent consideration (Notes 18 and 26)
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration 
transferred in a business combination. The contingent consideration is based on future business valuations and profit multiples  
(both Level 3 fair value measurements) and has been estimated on an acquisition by acquisition basis using available profit forecasts  
(a significant unobservable input). The higher the profit forecast, the higher the fair value of any contingent consideration (subject to  
any maximum payout clauses). Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments 
are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. These adjustments will result in a restatement to 
previous reported results if the changes relate to amounts arising in previously reported periods. Measurement period adjustments  
are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year  
from the acquisition date, about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
Subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration, which do not qualify as measurement period 
adjustments, depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not 
remeasured at subsequent reporting dates, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration 
classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, with the corresponding gain or loss 
recognised in profit or loss.
Use of non-GAAP measures
In addition to the statutory results, adjusted results are prepared for the income statement, including adjusted operating profit  
and adjusted diluted earnings per share, as the Board considers these non-GAAP measures to be the most appropriate way  
to measure the Group’s performance in a way that is comparable to the prior year. 
Adjusted results (Notes 8 and 15)
The Group presents adjusted results (Note 8) and adjusted diluted earnings per share (Note 15) to provide additional useful information 
on business performance trends to Shareholders. These results are used for performance analysis and incentive compensation 
arrangements for employees. Adjusted results exclude items that are commonly excluded across the media sector: amortisation  
and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets relating to businesses acquired and other intangible asset purchases of titles and 
exhibitions, acquisition and integration costs, profit or loss on disposal of businesses, restructuring costs and other items that in the 
opinion of the Directors would distort underlying results. The term “adjusted” is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore 
be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or 
superior to, IFRS measurements of profit. Refer to Note 8 for details of adjusting items recorded for the year and reconciled to  
statutory operating profit. 
4 RESTATEMENT
Restatement of balance sheet as at 31 December 2016 and income statement for the year ended 31 December 2016
The results for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been restated for the finalisation of provisional amounts recognised in respect 
of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the Penton Information Services acquisition that completed on 
2 November 2016 and finalisation of fair values related to the Light Reading LLC acquisition that completed on 13 July 2016. Details 
are set out in Note 4.
The Penton adjustments to the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2016 resulted in the following 
adjustments to adjusted results: a reduction in revenue of £0.9m, a reduction in net operating expenses of £0.4m and a related 
reduction in the adjusted tax charge of £0.2m. Adjusting items were restated to reflect reduced amortisation of intangible assets  
of £0.3m and increased tax on adjusting items of £0.1m.
The Penton adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheet at 31 December 2016 reflected the balance sheet impact of the above 
income statement adjustments, together with finalisation of the fair value of the acquisition balance sheet and foreign exchange 
movements on these adjustments from acquisition date on 2 November 2016 to 31 December 2016. The adjustments include a 
£25.1m reduction to goodwill, a £47 .1m increase in intangibles arising from a £49.9m increase in acquisition intangibles and a £2.8m 
reduction in other intangibles. There was also a £19.1m increase in the deferred tax liability mainly associated with the increase in  
the value of acquisition intangibles.
The Light Reading fair value finalisation resulted in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at 31 December 2016 being adjusted for the 
recognition of an additional £0.2m accounts receivable and a corresponding increase of £0.2m in goodwill.

Business segments
The Group has identified reportable segments based on financial information used by the Executive Directors in allocating resources 
and making strategic decisions. We consider the chief operating decision maker to be the two Executive Directors. 
The Group’s four (2016 restated: four) identified reporting segments under IFRS 8 Operating Segments are as described in the 
Strategic Report. The operating segments for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been restated to integrate the results of the 
previously reported Penton segment into the relevant Global Exhibitions, Business Intelligence and Knowledge & Networking 
segments (see Note 4). 
Segment revenue and results
The Group’s primary internal income statement performance measures for business segments are revenue and adjusted operating 
profit. A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to statutory operating profit and profit before tax is provided below:

assessment of segment performance. Finance costs and investment income are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity is 
driven by the central Treasury function, which manages the cash positions of the Group.

The Audit Committee approves all non-audit services within the Company’s policy. In the prior year, the auditor provided transaction 
support services principally in relation to the reporting requirements associated with the size of the Penton acquisition, the Audit 
Committee having concluded that the auditor was best placed to perform these services due to its knowledge of the Company. The 
other services in 2017 relate to services provided by Market Gravity Limited, a training organisation which was acquired by Deloitte  
on 31 May 2017 . Market Gravity Limited was contracted by Informa, prior to the acquisition by Deloitte, to support in delivering the 
London Tech Week Innovation Mini MBA from 12–16 June. K&N engaged Market Gravity Limited for a further three events in 2017 . 
There are no contingent fees involved and the fees are payable to Market Gravity Limited on completion of the events. 
The ratio of non-audit services to audit services was 0.1x (2016: 3.6x, 0.1x excluding transaction support services).

1. 2016 restated for finalisation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Penton acquisition completed in 2016 (see Note 4).
The principal adjustments made are in respect of:
• intangible asset amortisation – the amortisation charges in respect of intangible assets acquired through business combinations  
or the acquisition of trade and assets are excluded from adjusted results as they do not relate to underlying trading; 
• impairment – the Group tests for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when an indicator exists. Impairment charges are 
individually disclosed and are excluded from adjusted results as they do not relate to underlying trading (See Note 16 for further details);
• acquisition and integration costs – the costs incurred by the Group in acquiring and integrating share and asset acquisitions. 
Acquisition costs totalled £4.4m and integration costs totalled £19.6m;
• restructuring and reorganisation costs – these costs are incurred by the Group in business restructuring and changing the operating 
model to align with the Group’s Growth Acceleration Plan. These include vacant property costs arising from restructuring activities; 
•  subsequent remeasurement of contingent consideration is recognised in the year as a charge or credit to the Consolidated Income 
Statement unless qualifying as a measurement period adjustment arising within one year from the acquisition date. Subsequent 
remeasurements are excluded from adjusted results as they do not relate to underlying trading; 
•  loss on disposal of subsidiaries and operations – loss or profit on the disposal of individual businesses; these are excluded from 
adjusted results as they do not relate to underlying trading; 
• investment income in the prior year of £58.9m related to the gain on a deal contingent forward contract associated with the Penton 
acquisition; and
•  the tax items relate to the tax effect on the items above and tax adjustments related to rate changes. US federal tax reform relates 
to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 .

The Group recognised total expenses of £6.9m (2016: £4.9m) related to share-based payment transactions in the year ended 
31 December 2017 with £4.8m (2016: £3.6m) relating to equity-settled LTIPs, £0.6m (2016: £0.3m) relating to equity-settled 
ShareMatch and £1.5m (2016: £1.0m) relating to cash-settled awards. 
The Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plans (“LTIPs”) provide for nil-cost options and have a grant price used in the valuation of the awards 
equal to the closing share price from the day prior to the grant date. The performance period is three years starting with the year in 
which the grant is made. LTIP awards are conditional share awards with specific performance conditions. To the extent that they are 
met or satisfied then awards will be exercisable following the end of the relevant performance period. LTIP allocations are equity settled 
and will lapse if the colleague leaves the Group before an LTIP grant is exercisable, unless the employee meets certain eligibility criteria.

Long-Term Incentive Plan
The 2017 LTIP award was granted on 15 March 2017 , with the 2016 LTIP award granted on 17 March 2016 and the 2015 LTIP award 
granted on 13 February 2015. The performance conditions for each of these awards to Executive Directors are relative total shareholder 
return (TSR for FTSE 51–150 constituents, excluding financial services and commodities) and earnings per share (“EPS”) compound 
annual growth rate (“CAGR”). 
The movement during the year is as follows:

2. From 1 January of year in which grant made.
In order to satisfy share awards granted under the LTIP , the share capital would need to be increased by up to 2,543,639 shares  
(2016: 2,545,976 shares) taking account of the 388,118 shares held in the Employee Share Trust (Note 32). The Company will satisfy 
the awards either through the issue of additional share capital or the purchase of shares as needed on the open market. The weighted 
average share price during the year was £6.81 (2016: £6.78).
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over one, two and three years back 
from the date of grant. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the Group’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
ShareMatch (Share Incentive Plan)
In June 2014, the Company launched ShareMatch, a global Share Incentive Plan (tax qualifying in the UK), under which eligible 
colleagues can invest up to the limit of £1,800 per annum in the Company’s shares. The scheme includes a matching element, 
whereby for every one share purchased by the colleague, the Company will award the participant one matching share. The matching 
element was increased to one new share for every one purchased from March 2017 (previously one share matched for every two 
shares purchased). Matching shares are subject to forfeiture if the purchased shares are withdrawn from the scheme within three 
years of purchase or if the colleague leaves the Group, unless the reason for leaving is due to restructuring or retirement. In addition, 
both the purchased and matching shares are eligible to receive any dividends payable by the Company, which are reinvested in more 
shares. Employee subscriptions can be made on a monthly or one-off lump sum basis and matching shares are purchased on a 
monthly basis, through a UK Trust. Further details are set out in the remuneration section of the financial statements.

15 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic
The basic earnings per share calculation is based on profit attributable to equity Shareholders of the parent of £311.3m (2016: £171.5m 
profit, restated amount). This profit on ordinary activities after taxation is divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
(less those shares held by the EST and ShareMatch), which is 823,352,304 (2016: 725,629,255).
Diluted
The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the basic EPS calculation above except that the weighted average number of 
shares includes all potentially dilutive options granted by the reporting date as if those options had been exercised on the first day  
of the accounting period or the date of the grant, if later, giving a weighted average of 826,146,627 (2016: 727 ,826,695).
The table below sets out the adjustment in respect of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares:
 2017 2016
Weighted average number of shares used in basic earnings per share 823,352,304 725,629,255
Potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares 2,794,323 2,197,440
Weighted average number of shares used in diluted earnings per share 826,146,627 727,826,695
Earnings per share 
In addition to basic EPS, adjusted diluted EPS calculations have been provided as this is useful additional information on underlying 
performance. Earnings are based on profits attributable to equity Shareholders and adjusted to exclude items that, in the opinion of 
the Directors, would distort underlying results with the items detailed in Note 8.

Impairment review
As goodwill is not amortised, it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. The testing 
involves comparing the carrying value of assets in each cash generating unit (“CGU”) with value in use calculations or assessments  
of fair value less cost-to-sell, derived from the latest Group cash flow projections. 
In 2017 there was impairment of goodwill totalling £3.4m (2016: £65.8m), with a charge of £2.0m in Business Intelligence relating  
to the Telecoms, Media & Technology (“TMT”) CGU and Industry & Infrastructure CGU.
In 2017 the number of CGUs was 26 (2016: 24). For reporting purposes, the CGUs are aggregated into the four reportable segments 
which each has its own Managing Director and Finance Director. The carrying amount of goodwill recorded in the major groups of 
CGUs is set out below:

16 GOODWILL CONTINUED
The movements in the carrying amount relate primarily to acquisitions, disposals, exchange movements and adjustments arising from 
reclassifications arising when acquisition intangible valuations are completed.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined as the greater of the value in use calculations or fair value less costs to sell, 
which are based on the cash flow projections for each CGU. The key assumptions are those regarding the revenue and operating 
margin growth rates together with the long-term growth rate and the discount rate applied to the forecast cash flows. The recoverable 
amount measurement is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used.
Estimated future cash flows are determined by reference to the budget for the year following the balance sheet date and forecasts for 
the following two years, after which a long-term perpetuity growth rate is applied. The most recent financial budget approved by the 
Board of Directors has been prepared after considering the current economic environment in each of our markets. 
Key assumptions
Long-term market 
growth rates Pre-tax discount rates
2017 2016 2017 2016
Academic Publishing 2.5% 2.2% 9.9% 10.5%
Business Intelligence 2.0–2.5% 2.0–2.4% 10.2–10.5% 9.8–10.7%
Global Exhibitions 1.7–3.9% 1.9–3.9% 7.2–12.9% 8.9–14.9%
Knowledge & Networking 1.7–2.5% 1.9–2.4% 9.2–11.8% 9.8–11.0%
The pre-tax discount rates used in the value in use calculations reflect the Group’s assessment of the current market and other risks 
specific to the CGUs. Long-term growth rates are applied after the forecast period. Long-term growth rates are based on external 
reports on long-term CPI inflation rates for the geographic market in which each CGU operate and therefore do not exceed the 
long-term average growth prospects for the individual markets. 
The Group has undertaken a sensitivity analysis across all CGUs, taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test 
assumptions arising from a range of possible future trading and economic scenarios, summarised as follows:
•  an increase in the pre-tax discount rate by 1.0%; and
•  a decrease in the terminal growth rate by 0.5%.
The sensitivity analysis shows that, when applying the 1.0% increase in pre-tax discount, there would be a £29.9m increase in the  
total impairment charge, which reflects an increase in impairment charge of £6.1m in the TMT CGU and £23.8m in the Industry & 
Infrastructure CGU, which both sit within the Business Intelligence Division. 
When applying the 0.5% decrease in terminal growth rate sensitivity there would be a £13.2m increase in the total impairment charge, 
which reflects an increase in impairment charge of £2.7m in the TMT CGU and £10.5m in the Industry & Infrastructure CGU, which 
both sit within the Business Intelligence Division. 
When applying the above criteria combined, there would be a £40.2m increase giving a total impairment charge of £45.7m, which 
reflects an impairment of £8.2m in the TMT CGU, and £32.0m in the Industry & Infrastructure CGU, both of which sit within the 
Business Intelligence Division, as well as other impairments of £3.5m.

Divisions which have been determined by reference to past default experience. Under the normal course of business, the Group  
does not charge interest on its overdue receivables.
Included in other receivables is an amount of £10.4m relating to the proceeds of the disposal of 10% of the YPI business (see Note 20 
for further details). The Group’s exposures to credit risk and impairment losses related to trade and other receivables are disclosed in

period taken for trade purchases is 49 days (2016: 37 days). There are no suppliers who represent more than 10% of the total balance 
of trade payables in either 2017 or 2016. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are 
paid within the credit time frame. Therefore, under the normal course of business, the Group is not charged interest on overdue 
payables. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

The contingent consideration will be paid primarily in one to two years. The contingent consideration is based on future business 
valuations and profit multiples (both Level 3 fair value measurements) and has been estimated on an acquisition by acquisition  
basis using available profit forecasts (a significant unobservable input). The higher the profit forecast, the higher the fair value of  
any contingent consideration (subject to any maximum payout clauses), and if all future business valuations and profit multiples  
were achieved, the maximum undiscounted amounts payable for contingent consideration would be £221.1m.
The acquisition and integration provision of £2.2m at 31 December 2017 relates to amounts incurred but not yet settled associated 
with acquisitions. See Note 18 for further details.
The property lease provision represents a provision for vacant property. This is calculated as the estimated excess of rent payable  
on surplus property leases, plus dilapidation provisions, less rent receivable via sub-leases. The property lease provisions will be  
fully utilised between one and five years. 
See Note 8 for details of items included in restructuring provisions and details of the remeasurement of contingent consideration. 
Amounts included within restructuring provisions are expected to be utilised in 2018.

1. 2016 restated for finalisation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for certain acquisitions completed in 2016 (see Note 4).
Deferred tax assets have been recognised on the basis that, from the current forecast of the Group’s entities, it is probable that there 
will be taxable profits against which these assets can be utilised, offset for reporting purposes jurisdiction by jurisdiction. 
Deferred tax has been provided on UK intangible assets in respect of temporary timing differences at the UK rate at which they are 
expected to reverse. Deferred tax has been provided at the rate of 19% on all other UK temporary differences.
The Finance Act 2016 enacted reductions to the UK main Corporation Tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020, as follows:
Year to 31 March 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022
Corporation Tax rate 19% 19% 19% 17% 17%
At 31 December 2017 , the Group had unused tax losses of approximately £232.0m (2016: £289.7m) available for offset against  
future profits of which a deferred tax asset of £45.6m relating to the US has been recognised. The Directors have concluded that  
it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which these losses can be utilised, taking into account the 
Group’s latest available forecast. A deferred tax asset of £23.0m (2016: £22.8m) has not been recognised due to the unpredictability  
of future taxable profit streams.
At 31 December 2017 , the Group had unused capital losses of approximately £38m (2016: £46m) available for offset against future 
qualifying gains. No deferred tax asset has been recognised due to the unpredictability of future qualifying capital gains.

27 DEFERRED TAX CONTINUED
At the reporting date, the aggregate amount of withholding tax on post-acquisition undistributed earnings for which deferred tax 
liabilities have not been recognised was £1.2m (2016: £13.7m). No liability has been recognised because the Group, being in a position 
to control the timing of the distribution of intra-Group dividends, has no intention to distribute intra-Group dividends in the foreseeable 
future that would trigger withholding tax. 
28 NON-CURRENT TAX LIABILITIES
The Group has a number of ongoing tax disputes around the world, and has taken some tax positions where the legislative position is 
not clear, but are not currently the subject of disputes. In total, the Group has accrued £14.3m (2016: £13.3m) for potential tax liabilities 
arising from such matters; no more than £3.2m (2016: £5.0m) is expected to become payable in the next 12 months, and the balance 
is held as a non-current liability.

30 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
(a) Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Capital risk management
•  M a r ke t r i s k
•  C r e d it r i s k
•  L i qui di t y r i s k
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s management of capital, and the 
Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.  
The Board has established a Treasury Committee which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group’s financial risk 
management policies. The Treasury Committee meets regularly and reports to the Audit Committee on its activities.
The Group Treasury function provides services to the Group’s businesses, co-ordinates access to domestic and international  
financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. These risks include market  
risk (including currency risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Treasury Committee has put in place policies to identify and analyse the financial risks faced by the Group and has set appropriate 
limits and controls. These policies provide written principles on funding investments, credit risk, foreign exchange and interest rate risk. 
Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Treasury Committee. This Committee is assisted in its oversight role 
by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of 
which are reported to the Audit Committee. 
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the 
return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, 
the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to Shareholders, return capital to Shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to 
reduce debt. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes borrowings (Note 29), cash and cash equivalents (Note 24),  
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital (Note 31), reserves and retained earnings.
Cost of capital
The Group’s Treasury Committee reviews the Group’s capital structure on a regular basis and, as part of this review, the Committee 
considers the weighted average cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Gearing ratio
The principal financial covenant ratios under the Group’s borrowing facilities are maximum net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and 
minimum EBITDA interest cover of 4.0 times, tested semi-annually. At 31 December 2017 both financial covenants were achieved,  
with the ratio of net debt (using average exchange rates) to EBITDA being 2.5 times (2.6 times at 31 December 2016). The ratio of 
EBITDA to net interest payable in the year ended 31 December 2017 was 9.8 times (2016: 11.0 times). EBITDA is calculated from 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, with earnings stated before adjusting items.

(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income  
or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. 
The Group manages these risks by maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and currency borrowings using derivatives where 
necessary. The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies 
approved by the Board of Directors. 
(d) Interest rate risk
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets at floating rates but is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow 
funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. 
Borrowings issued at or converted to fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
The interest rate risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest  
rate swap contracts. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk 
section of this note.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
A high percentage of loans are at fixed interest rates; hence the Group’s interest rate sensitivity would only be affected by the exposure 
to variable rate debt.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year 
would have decreased or increased by £5.9m (2016: £8.5m).
(e) Foreign currency risk
The Group is a business with significant net US dollar (“USD”) transactions; hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Allied to the Group’s policy on the hedging of surplus foreign currency cash inflows, the Group will usually seek to finance its net 
investment in its principal overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in those subsidiaries’ functional currencies, primarily USD. This policy 
has the effect of partially protecting the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet from movements in those currencies to the extent that 
the associated net assets are hedged by the net foreign currency borrowings.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
In 2017 , the Group earned approximately 65% (2016: 59%) of its revenues and incurred approximately 55% (2016: 48%) of its costs  
in USD or currencies pegged to USD. The Group is therefore sensitive to movements in USD against GBP . In 2017 , each $0.01 
movement in the USD to GBP exchange rate has a circa £8.5m (2016: £6.5m) impact on revenue and a circa £3.5m (2016: £2.9m) 
impact on adjusted operating profit. Offsetting this are reductions to the value of USD borrowings, interest and tax liabilities. This 
analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.

30 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
(f) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables (Note 23) and cash and cash equivalents (Note 24), which 
represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.  
The Group has adopted a policy of assessing creditworthiness of counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial  
loss from defaults. 
The Group’s exposure and the creditworthiness of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of 
transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits  
that are reviewed and approved as part of the Group’s treasury policies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the  
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
Trade receivables
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group based on prior experience and its assessment of the 
current economic environment.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographic areas and the Group’s 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. 
The Group does not have significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. Concentration of credit 
risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year. 
The Group establishes a provision that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and the 
investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The main components of this provision are a specific loss 
component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets  
in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss provision is determined by reference to past 
default experience. 
All customers have credit limits set by credit managers and are subject to the standard terms of payment of each Division. As Global 
Exhibitions, Knowledge & Networking and the journals part of the Academic Publishing Division work predominantly on a prepaid 
basis they are not subject to the same credit controls and they have a low bad debt history. The Group is exposed to normal credit risk 
and potential losses are mitigated as the Group does not have significant exposure to any single customer.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. 
Non-current other receivables
Non-current other receivables arose from disposals made in the current and prior years as disclosed in Note 23. The Risk Committee 
reviews these receivables and the credit quality of the counterparties on a regular basis.

Trade receivables that are less than three months past due for payment are generally not considered impaired. For trade receivables 
that are more than three months past due for payment, there are debtors with a carrying amount of £24.4m (2016: £20.4m) which  
the Group has not provided for, as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and the amounts are considered 
recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. 
A provision relating to returns on books of £17 .0m (2016: £17 .8m) has been disclosed separately in the table above. This is based on 
the Group’s best estimate of previous returns trends, and the amount is included as part of the overall provision balance of £27 .2m 
(2016: £31.3m).

31 December 27.2 31.3
There are no customers who represent more than 10% of the total gross balance of trade receivables in either 2017 or 2016. 
(g) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for  
liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, though operationally it is managed by Group Treasury with oversight  
by the Treasury Committee. Group Treasury has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management  
of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and debt 
facilities, together with continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets 
and liabilities. Included in Note 29 is a summary of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal. 
Historically and for the foreseeable future the Group has been, and is expected to continue to be, in a net borrowing position. The 
Group’s policy is to fulfil its borrowing requirements by borrowing in the currencies in which it operates, principally GBP and USD; 
thereby providing a natural hedge against projected future surplus USD cash inflows. 
(h) Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below has been drawn up based on the contractual maturities of the financial assets including interest that will be earned  
on those assets except where the Group anticipates that the cash flow will occur in a different period.

(j) Fair values and fair value hierarchy
Financial instruments that are measured subsequently to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into Levels 1 to 3, based on the 
degree to which the fair value is observable, as follows:
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable  
for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Reserve for shares to be issued
This reserve relates to LTIPs granted to colleagues reduced by the transferred and vested awards. Further information is set out  
in Note 10. 
Merger reserve
The merger reserve was created in 2004 when the merger of Informa plc and Taylor & Francis Group plc resulted in a merger reserve 
amount of £496.4m being recorded. On 2 November 2016, the Group acquired Penton Information Services and the £82.2m share 
premium on the shares issued to the vendors was recorded as an increase in the merger reserve in accordance with the merger  
relief rules of the Companies Act 2006.
Other reserve
The other reserve includes the inversion accounting reserve of £2,189.9m which was created from an issue of shares under a scheme 
of arrangement in May 2014. 
Employee Share Trust and ShareMatch shares
As at 31 December 2017 , the Informa Employee Share Trust (“EST”) held 388,118 (2016: 616,187) Ordinary Shares in the Company  
at a cost of £388 and a market value of £2.8m (2016: £4.2m). As at 31 December 2017 , the ShareMatch scheme held 273,560  
(2016: 141,814) matching Ordinary Shares in the Company at a market value of £2.0m (2016: £1.0m). At 31 December 2017 the  
Group held 0.1% (2016: 0.1%) of its own called up share capital.
33 NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
The Group has subsidiary undertakings where there are non-controlling interests. At 31 December 2017 , these non-controlling interests

36 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES
(a) Charge to operating profit
The charge to operating profit for the year in respect of pensions, including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, 
was £11.1m (2016: £10.3m). This consisted of a £0.5m (2016: £0.4m) charge to operating profit related to administration costs for  
the defined benefit schemes and a £10.6m charge to operating profit relating to defined contribution schemes (2016: £9.9m).
(b) Defined benefit schemes – strategy 
The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, the Informa Final Salary Scheme and the Taylor & Francis  
Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (“the Group UK Schemes”) for all qualifying UK colleagues, providing benefits based  
on final pensionable pay. Additionally, as a result of the Penton acquisition, the Group has two defined benefit schemes in the US:  
the Penton Media, Inc. Retirement Plan and the Penton Media, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“the Penton Schemes”).  
All schemes (“the Group Schemes”) are closed to future accrual. Contributions to the Group UK Schemes are determined following 
triennial valuations undertaken by a qualified actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Contributions to the Penton Schemes  
are assessed annually following valuations undertaken by a qualified actuary.
For the Group UK Schemes, the defined benefit schemes are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the 
Company. The Trustees are responsible for running the Group UK Schemes in accordance with the Group Schemes’ Trust Deed  
and Rules, which sets out their powers. The Trustees of the Group UK Schemes are required to act in the best interests of the 
beneficiaries of the Group Schemes. There is a requirement that one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the  
Group UK Schemes. The Trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the  
fund. Neither of the Schemes has any reimbursement rights.
The Group’s pension funding policy is to provide sufficient funding, as agreed with the Trustees, to ensure any pension deficit will be 
addressed to ensure pension payments made to current and future pensioners will be met.
For the Penton Schemes, the defined benefit scheme is administered by Penton Media, Inc. and is subject to the provisions of the 
Retirement Income Security Act 1974. The Company is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.  
The Scheme has no reimbursement rights.
The investment strategies adopted by the Trustees of the Group UK Schemes include some exposure to index-linked gilts and 
corporate bonds. The investment objectives of the Penton Schemes are to maximise plan assets within designated risk and return 
profiles. The current asset allocation consists primarily of listed stocks and corporate bonds. All assets are managed by a third party 
investment manager according to guidelines established by the Company.
(c) Defined benefit schemes – risk 
Through the Group Schemes the Company is exposed to a number of potential risks as described below:
•  Asset volatility: the Group Schemes’ defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate 
bond yields; however, the Group Schemes invest significantly in equities. These assets are expected to outperform corporate 
bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
•  Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the Group Schemes’ defined benefit obligation; 
however, this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes’ bond holdings.
•  Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the Group Schemes’ defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher 
inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation (subject to a cap of no more than 5% p.a. for UK Schemes). The majority  
of the Group UK Schemes’ assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase  
in inflation would also increase the deficit.
• Life expectancy: if the Group Schemes’ members live longer than expected, the Group Schemes’ benefits will need to be paid  
for longer, increasing the Group Schemes’ defined benefit obligations.
The Trustees and the Company manage risks in the Group Schemes through the following strategies:
•  D i v e r s i f i c a ti o n : investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact  
on the overall level of assets.
• Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
There are three categories of pension Scheme members:
• employed deferred members: currently employed by the Company;
•  deferred members: former colleagues of the Company; and
• pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit payments (allowing for future salary increases 
for UK employed deferred members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for UK members) 
and then discounting to the balance sheet date. UK members receive increases to their benefits linked to inflation (subject to a cap of 
no more than 5% p.a. for UK Schemes). There are no caps on benefits in the Penton Schemes. The valuation method used for all 
schemes is known as the Projected Unit Credit Method. 
The approximate overall duration of the Group Schemes’ defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2017 was as follows:

The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the IAS 19 valuation for the Schemes are those relating to the 
discount rate, the rates of increase in price inflation, salaries, and pensions and life expectancy. The main assumptions adopted are: 
 
2017 2016
Penton 
Schemes UK Schemes
Penton 
Schemes UK Schemes
Discount rate 3.3% 2.4% 3.7% 2.6%
Rate of price inflation n/a 2.1% (CPI) and 3.1% (RPI) n/a 2.4% (CPI) and 3.4% (RPI)
Rate of salary increase – employed deferred n/a 2.1% n/a 2.9%
Rate of increase in deferred pensions – former colleagues n/a 2.1% n/a 2.4%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment – pensioners n/a 1.9–3.0% n/a 2.1–3.3%
Life expectancy:
For an individual aged 60 – male (years) 85 87 85 87
For an individual aged 60 – female (years) 87 89 87 89
For the Group UK Pension Schemes, mortality assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuations are taken from tables published by 
Continuous Mortality Investigation (“CMI”). The latest base tables for self-administered pension schemes use S2PMA (males) and 
S2PFA (females), and life expectancy improvements are taken from CMI 2016 (2016: CMI 2015) with the long-term rate of improvement 
of 1.25% (2016: 1.25%). For the valuation of US scheme liabilities, the RP-2014 mortality tables have been used (2016: RP-2014), with 
life expectancy improvements using scale MP 2017 (2016: scale MP-2016).
(d) Defined benefit schemes – individual defined benefit scheme details 
Informa Final Salary Scheme
The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years. The result of this valuation determines the level of 
contributions payable by the Group. 
The last actuarial full valuation of the Informa Final Salary Scheme was performed by the Scheme actuary for the Trustees as at 
31 March 2017 . This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of £5.5m. The recovery plan shows future annual employer contributions  
of £2.0m in 2018, £2.0m in 2019 and £1.5m in 2020. The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Informa Final Salary Scheme will be  
as at 31 March 2020, at which point the recovery plan will be reassessed. 
An actuarial valuation was carried out for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 December 2017 by a qualified independent actuary. The Scheme 
was closed to new entrants on 1 April 2000 and closed to future accrual on 1 April 2011. The Group’s contribution over the year was 
£nil (2016: £nil). The weighted average duration of pension scheme liabilities was 20 years at 31 December 2017 .
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the Informa Final Salary Scheme liabilities are set out below:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0. 1% Decrease/increase by £2.0m
Rate of price inflation pre-retirement Increase/decrease by 0.25% Increase/decrease by £4.3m
Rate of mortality Increase/decrease by 1 year Increase/decrease by £3. 1m
Taylor & Francis Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme
The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years. The result of this valuation determines the level of 
contributions payable by the Group. 
The last actuarial full valuation of the Taylor & Francis Group Life Assurance and Pension Scheme was performed by the Scheme 
actuary for the Trustees as at 30 September 2014. The valuation as at 30 September 2014 revealed a funding surplus of £1.4m and  
no recovery plan was required. The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Taylor & Francis Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme 
began at 30 September 2017 and is currently in progress. A recovery plan will be determined with any payments required expected to 
arise only from 2019 onwards and no contributions expected for the year ending 31 December 2018.
An actuarial valuation was carried out for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 December 2017 by a qualified independent actuary. The Scheme

actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by the Scheme actuary as at 31 December 2017 . The Group’s contribution over the 
year was £nil (2016: £nil). The employer expects to pay contributions during the accounting year beginning 1 January 2018 of £1.3m, 
with contributions for future years dependent on the level of any future year deficits arising from future valuations. The weighted 
average duration of pension scheme liabilities was 15 years at 31 December 2017 .

The proportion of voting power held is the same as the proportion of ownership interest. The Consolidated Financial Statements 
incorporate the financial statements of all entities controlled by the Company as at 31 December each year. Refer to Note 2 for  
further description of the method used to account for investments in subsidiaries.
39 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Consideration for the acquisition of Penton Information Services on 2 November 2016 includes deferred consideration that is payable 
in October 2018 for anticipated future tax benefits. The estimated fair value of this consideration is £16.7m ($22.6m) at 31 December 
2017 and reflects the receipt of external legal advice. The amount is under dispute with the seller, as an amount of approximately 
£28.9m ($39m) is expected by the seller. No provision has been made for the potential additional amount as the Directors do not 
consider it is probable that an additional amount is due. Any future settlement that is higher than the fair value estimate of £16.7m 
($22.6m) will result in an income statement charge in a future accounting period as more than 12 months have elapsed since the 
acquisition and therefore any adjustment would fall outside the 12 month remeasurement period permitted by IFRS 3.
40 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
On 16 January 2018, the Group announced it was in preliminary discussions for a potential combination of UBM plc to be effected  
by way of an acquisition of the entire share capital of UBM by Informa for shares and cash consideration. On 17 January 2018, the 
Group outlined the key financial terms, with UBM Shareholders receiving for each UBM share 1.083 Informa shares and 163p  
in cash. On 30 January 2018 the Boards of Informa and UBM confirmed the creation of a leading B2B information services group 
through a recommended offer for UBM by Informa. A Circular to the Shareholders of Informa recommending the offer is expected to 
be issued in March 2018 and general meetings for Informa and UBM are expected to take place in April 2018. Subject to approval 
from Shareholders of both companies and regulatory approvals the transaction is expected to complete in June 2018.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (“FRS 100”) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. The financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 The Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
The last financial statements under previous UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2014 and the date of transition to 
FRS 102 was therefore 1 January 2015. There were no material adjustments recorded for the transition from UK GAAP to FRS 102.  
As permitted by FRS 102, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation  
to share-based payments, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective and related party transactions. The 
Directors’ Report, Corporate Governance Statement and Directors’ Remuneration Report disclosures are on pages 72 to 119 of  
this report. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis and on the going concern basis as explained  
in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the 
exception of the merger reserve accounting treatment arising from the Scheme of Arrangement in 2014.
The Company’s financial statements are presented in pounds sterling being the Company’s functional currency. 
Profit and loss account
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account or 
statement of comprehensive income for the year. The Company’s revenue for the year is £nil (2016: £nil), and profit after tax for  
the year is £22.6m (2016: £59.2m).
Share-based payment amounts that relate to employees of subsidiary Group companies are recorded as capital contributions  
to the relevant Group company. 
Investments in subsidiaries and impairment reviews
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Where the recoverable amount of the investment 
is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised. Impairment reviews are undertaken at least annually or more frequently 
where there is an indication of impairment.

DIVIDEND
Informa usually pays a dividend to all Shareholders twice each year. Shareholders can arrange for dividends to be paid by mandate 
directly to a UK bank or building society account through the BACS (Bankers’ Automated Clearing Services) system. You can register 
your bank or building society details online at www.investorcentre.co.uk or contact Computershare for a dividend mandate form. 
If you wish to receive your dividends in a different currency, you will need to register for the global payments service provided by 
Computershare. Further information can be found on the Computershare website. 
Shareholders can also elect to join Informa’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP), where instead of receiving dividends via cheque  
or into a bank account, cash dividends are automatically reinvested in Informa shares, further building Shareholders’ portfolios.
This service is also administered by Computershare and its full terms and conditions, including eligibility for Shareholders based 
outside of the UK, are available at www.investorcentre.com.
• Under the DRIP , the cash dividend paid by Informa will be used to buy new shares in the company, and as many whole shares  
as possible from the proceeds of each cash dividend.
• There is no charge for joining the DRIP . Dealing fees are charged when shares are bought. See www.investorcentre.com for  
a list of current fees associated with the plan.
• Shareholders can change their instruction and withdraw from the DRIP at any time by contacting the administrators. The DRIP 
terms and conditions include full details of notice periods.
• To join this plan, Shareholders can complete the online form at www.investorcentre.com or contact Computershare on the  
details above.
SHARE DEALING
Shareholders have the opportunity to buy or sell Informa PLC shares using a share dealing facility operated by our registrar 
Computershare. Internet and telephone dealing are available via Investor Centre at www.investorcentre.co.uk.

is also payable on all purchases. 
Before you trade, you will need to register for this service. This can be done by going online at www.computershare.trade.
Telephone dealing
The fee for this service will be 1% of the value of the transaction plus £35. Stamp duty of 0.5% is also payable on all purchases. To use 
the service, please call +44 (0)370 703 0084 and have your Shareholder Reference Number (SRN) to hand. This service is available 
Monday to Friday from 8 am to 4.30 pm. 
Please note that due to the regulations in the UK, Computershare is required to check that you have read and accepted the Terms & 
Conditions before being able to trade, which could delay your first telephone trade. If you wish to trade quickly, we suggest visiting the 
Computershare website and registering online first at www.computershare.trade.
SHAREGIFT
ShareGift (Registered Charity no. 1052686) is an independent charity which specialises in accepting donations of small numbers of 
shares which are uneconomic to sell on their own. ShareGift is particularly designed to accept unwanted shares and uses the ultimate 
proceeds to support a wide range of UK charities. Around £25m has been given by ShareGift so far to over 2,000 different charities. 
Further information about ShareGift can be found on its website, www.ShareGift.org, or by calling 020 7930 3737 .

Shareholders the opportunity to elect to register for electronic communications. To elect to receive all future Shareholder 
communications by email, please visit www.investorcentre.co.uk/ecomms. 
PROTECTING YOUR INVESTMENT FROM SHARE REGISTER FRAUD
Over the last few years, a number of companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls  
or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from brokers who target existing shareholders offering to  
sell what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be extremely persuasive and very 
persistent. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
•  Check that they are properly authorised by the FCA before getting involved. You can check at www.fca.org.uk.
•  Report the matter to the FCA by completing an online form at www.fca.org.uk.
•  Inform Computershare by calling 0370 707 1679.
TIPS ON PROTECTING YOUR SHAREHOLDING
• Ensure all your certificates are kept in a safe place or hold your shares electronically in CREST via a nominee.
•  Keep all documentation containing personal share information in a safe place and destroy any correspondence you do not wish  
to keep by shredding it.
•  If you change address, inform Computershare. If you receive a letter from Computershare regarding a change of address and you 
have not recently moved, contact them immediately.
•  Know when the dividends are paid and consider having your dividend paid directly into your bank. If you change your bank 
account, inform Computershare of the details of your new account. Respond to any letters Computershare send to you about this.
• If you are buying or selling shares, only deal with brokers registered in the UK or in your country of residence.
