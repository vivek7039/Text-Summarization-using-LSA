Chairman‚Äôs Statement
The culture we have created in the business and the structures that we operate give 
us huge confidence for our future.
Conviviality is a business whose strength lies in the combined skills and expertise 
of the enlarged group, ‚ÄúOne Conviviality‚Äù, a business where the whole is greater 
than the sum of the parts and that has the firm foundations in place from which 
to grow. 
We look back on a year of unprecedented change politically and economically. 
Our business has also undergone unprecedented change throughout the past 
year. Following the acquisition of Matthew Clark on the 7th October 2015, 
Conviviality acquired Bibendum PLB Group on 20th May 2016, creating a one 
stop shop drinks solution for our customers and providing an opportunity to 
undertake a single integration programme. This integration has resulted in a full 
restructuring of the business, from a programme to generate significant buying 
synergies, the development of one Group Wine Buying team, to the development 
of the Group Logistics function. The acquisition of Bibendum PLB Group has 
enhanced the Group with additional wine expertise, access to the premium 
On Trade, particularly in London, and significant capability in consumer insight 
across the alcohol sector. 
I am proud that, against this backdrop the teams in all of the business units have 
stayed on track in integrating the business and ensuring that, first and foremost, 
our customers see the passion for their success and growth regardless of size of 
business and continue to benefit from the expertise of the combined group. As 
the UK economic and political environment remains uncertain, we believe that 
Conviviality has the flexibility to succeed through our unique model spanning 
both the On and Off Trade.
The Group is now structured into three Business Units: Conviviality Direct 
(wholesaler & distributor to On Trade) led by Mark Aylwin; Conviviality Retail 
(for Off Trade consumer businesses Bargain Booze, Select Convenience and 
Wine Rack) led by David Robinson; and Conviviality Trading (an innovative 
and dynamic approach to sourcing, ranging, brand building, merchandising, 
activation and events) led by James Lousada. Each of the business unit Managing 
Directors ensures their operation has the best people in the right place to deliver 
excellent service to customers and drive collaborations and savings across the 
Group. The Business Units are supported by the expertise of the Group functions 
of Logistics, Finance, Legal, IT and Human Resources. We believe that the recent 
acquisitions and new structure have resulted in Conviviality being well positioned 
in our market with a robust business model that provides a unique positioning 
with both our suppliers and our customers. 
The successful delivery of our strategy will depend on having great talent in 
the business in every area. We continue to invest significantly in training our 
colleagues and, in addition, we strengthen from outside of the Group where 
appropriate. In FY17 David Robinson joined us to head up Conviviality Retail 
and both David and Mark Aylwin (Managing Director, Conviviality Direct) were 
invited to join the Plc Board. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank everyone working in our business 
for their passion, commitment and customer focus that has made it possible to 
deliver our acquisitions to plan while also delivering underlying growth across 
the business.

Chief Executive Officer‚Äôs statement
When Conviviality floated on AIM in July 2013 the 
business was an alcohol, impulse and tobacco wholesaler 
serving the UK‚Äôs largest Franchise off-licence and 
convenience brand, Bargain Booze, with 616 stores and 
a turnover of ¬£372m. During the past four years we have 
systematically pursued the strategy of taking the core 
competence of the business, the wholesaling of alcohol, 
and extending Conviviality‚Äôs reach to more consumers 
across the UK drinks market whenever and wherever 
they wish to enjoy our products. We have fundamentally 
restructured and reconfigured the Group, building 
on our unique strength, expertise and reach in the UK 
drinks market. We now have the infrastructure and 
capability within the Group to drive further potential in 
both the On Trade and the Off Trade markets, working 
with our existing suppliers providing customers with 
more opportunities to drive profitable growth. 
Conviviality is unique in our sector. We provide our customers 
with access to over 14,000 alcohol SKUs, and 6,400 impulse, 
food and tobacco SKUs. We serve c.25,000 outlets in the 
On Trade, over 700 retail stores trading under the retail 
propositions of Bargain Booze, Select Convenience and Wine 
Rack, over 400 independent specialists and we are supplier 
to the larger multiples. A key part of our strategy is to deliver 
a logistics capability that anticipates the future needs of our 
customers and creates significant differentiation in the market, 
thereby adding significant value to the organisation. As the 
retail environment becomes more complex, we can leverage 
Conviviality‚Äôs expertise in the alcohol and impulse markets to 
provide our valued customers with the solutions they need 
from distribution, to buying, ranging and merchandising and 
marketing.
As a result of this scale and reach we have unparalleled market 
access, insight and capabilities to support our suppliers in 
the development of their brands and to help our customers 
differentiate from their competition by tailoring their offering 
to meet their target consumer needs by location, venue and 
format. Conviviality is independent of any major drinks brands 
and therefore is able to supply an unrestricted selection of 
products and provide expertise in key categories to customers 
who value breadth of range whilst offering a compelling route 
to market for suppliers to access both the On Trade and Off 
Trade retailers. 
It is this scale and reach that has created even stronger ties with 
our supplier partners. Increasingly our suppliers are engaging 
with the full capability of Conviviality from building their brands 
with our brand agency Catalyst PLB, accessing consumers with 
Elastic and Peppermint in events and experiential marketing, to 
more effective targeting in the On Trade utilising our data and 
insight, through to Off Trade execution in our Franchise retail 
business. A recent example was the exclusive On Trade launch 
of Bud Light for AB InBev across the Conviviality Group.

Chief Executive Officer Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017       7
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
This past year has been a transformational 
year for the service we offer. We will 
continue to grow by keeping our people, 
our customers, Franchisees and suppliers at 
the heart of everything we do.
The successful integration of the three 
businesses, working as a cohesive unit and the 
management team‚Äôs performance continues 
to deliver consistent results. The new internal 
structure grouped individual brands and 
businesses together under three distinct 
Business Units: Conviviality Direct (wholesaling/
distributor to On Trade) led by Mark Aylwin; 
Conviviality Retail (for Off Trade consumer 
businesses Bargain Booze, Select Convenience 
and Wine Rack) led by David Robinson; 
and Conviviality Trading (an innovative and 
dynamic approach to sourcing, ranging, 
brand building, merchandising, activation and 
events) led by James Lousada. Each of the 
business unit Managing Directors ensures their 
operation has the best people in the right place 
to deliver excellent service to customers, and 
drive collaborations and savings across the 
Group. The business units are supported by the 
expertise of the Group functions of Logistics, 
Finance, Legal, IT and Human Resources.
This past year has, therefore, been a 
transformational year for the service we offer, 
creating a range of benefits for customers. It is 
the nature of the On Trade and Off Trade market 
that our customers are constantly looking for 
the same thing as their own consumers: great 
value, new and innovative products, breadth 
of choice and excellent service. Critically, we 
continue to strive to ensure that our customers 
see our people regularly whether they are a one 
site restauranteur, hotelier or a large national 
account or a Franchisee, so that our customers 
may enjoy the relationships and service support 
they value from us. All of our businesses were 
initiated and built on personal relationships. 
These relationships remain at the heart of how 
we will continue to do business. Bibendum‚Äôs first 
ever On Trade customer was Michelin-starred 
Odette‚Äôs in Primrose Hill and it continues to be 
a valued customer over 30 years on. Matthew 
Clark has been a partner to JD Wetherspoon‚Äôs 
for over 20 years and a distributor of Martell for 
198 years. In our Franchise business we have 133 
Franchisees who have worked with the group 
for over 10 years. Our On Trade, Off Trade and 
franchised customers still expect ‚Äì and still get 
‚Äì an outstanding portfolio of products, that 
they can tailor to their own customers‚Äô tastes 
and needs, as well as the support they value to 
help them develop their own business moving 
forward.
For each of them, business and growth 
opportunities can come from a number 
of sources. It can be from our expanding 
catalogue of products or markets; for example 
Matthew Clark‚Äôs extended spirits range giving 
customers access to niche and small parcel 
spirits, or Bibendum‚Äôs limited release wine 
collection offering something rare or interesting 
from suppliers they already value, and equally 
Franchisees benefit from new and exclusive 
launches from the Group as well as access to 
the extensive range of spirits now available to 
them. It can also be in how we serve them ‚Äì 
and where their own vision sees potential. Our 
experts within Catalyst PLB help introduce 
customers to the newest and most exciting 
products in craft and premium spirits, beers 
and ciders, almost challenging end consumers 
to experiment; colleagues at Elastic (who 
reinvigorate brands) and in our events business, 
Peppermint, have unparalleled expertise in 
bringing new and old products to life. We ‚Äì and 
our suppliers - have seen excellent sales growth 
in a range of products that has been supported 
by our teams and their combined expertise 
from across Conviviality.
We will continue to grow by keeping our people, 
our customers, Franchisees, and suppliers 
at the heart of everything we do. Everyone 
who works for Conviviality from Glasgow to 
Southampton, and Bristol to Crewe, from shop 
to depot to office, knows it is critical that we 
keep finding new ways to improve our customer 
service and deliver excellence. As we focus our 
investment in the services customers value, so 
we will see our online services grow, in the past 
year the number of customers using our digital 
platform has increased by 20% year on year  8 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
to 4,645, ensuring more accuracy in customer 
ordering, better ordering history to assist with 
forecasting and in turn greater efficiency for 
both our customers and Conviviality. 48% of 
customers using our digital platform do so 
daily, indicating increasing engagement with 
the brand and assortment.
Our commitment to customers can be seen in 
the accolades they have awarded us. In 2016 
Bibendum won the ‚ÄúCompass Supplier Award 
for Implementation‚Äù for the successful execution 
of a wine culture across the Compass Group 
and is currently listed as Mitchells & Butlers 
#1 wine supplier; and in 2017 Matthew Clark 
was Drinks Supplier of the Year in Restaurant 
Magazine Reader‚Äôs Choice Awards for the 
third year running. More recently Conviviality 
Retail has been awarded Grocer Gold ‚Äì Drinks 
Retailer of the Year for the second consecutive 
year. Conviviality Trading was recognised by 
Stonegate for Innovation of the Year with the 
launch of Gancia Leggero, a skinny Prosecco.
Results
An important aspect of our business model is 
its flexibility, protecting our earnings through 
periods of significant change in our organisation 
and a competitive external environment. We 
have continued to deliver against our objectives 
set out at flotation in July 2013 and are pleased 
to report profits ahead of expectations, during 
a year where we have significantly transformed 
our business. For the 52 weeks to 30 April 2017 
revenue was up 85%
1
 to ¬£1,560m, reflecting the 
benefit of the Bibendum PLB Group acquisition 
on 20 May 2016, as such, Adjusted EBITDA* 
was up 102% to ¬£60.9m and Adjusted profit 
before tax
5
 up 111% to ¬£45.8m, demonstrating 
the significant strength of the combined group. 
Adjusted fully diluted EPS* was up 48% to 
21.0 pence. The recent acquisitions resulted in 
an increase of net debt, however, at year end 
this was ¬£95.7m, which is below consensus 
expectations. The full year dividend is up 
33% to 12.6 pence in line with our progressive 
dividend policy and reflecting a strong return 
to our shareholders.
Outlook 
The Company‚Äôs focus for the near-term is on 
continuing to deliver against our stated strategy 
and meet the expectations of our stakeholders, 
customers, suppliers and our people. The 
greatest asset from all of our acquisitions has 
been our people and we continue to work 
hard to ensure that their skills and talent are 
utilised to the benefit of our customers and 
suppliers. Our presence in the market through 
our different specialist businesses, provides us 
with unique insight into both our market and 
consumers from the widest of perspectives. We 
are already successfully leveraging this insight 
to ensure that our customers have the right 
product range and support to help them grow. 
Furthermore, we are continuing to look at new 
ways of maintaining our unique position and 
broadening the ways in which our customers, 
our supplier partners and the Group can 
benefit. We are excited by the future potential 
for growth across the Group as we continue to 
explore these opportunities.

Conviviality Direct
The UK‚Äôs largest independent 
wholesaler to the On Trade, serving 
c.25,000 outlets from national prestige 
hotel chains to independent food led 
pubs and restaurants trading through 
two businesses, namely Matthew Clark 
and Bibendum. Since the acquisition, 
of Bibendum, Conviviality Direct 
revenues have increased 6.4% to 
¬£1,040m (corresponding prior period 
¬£978m)
6
. To date average sales per 
outlet have increased 4.8% to ¬£43,700 
and we welcomed 235 new customers 
in the year. The number of Bibendum 
Wine customers buying all categories 
has increased from 5% to 12%, a strong 
indication that our customers value the 
increased choice and service offering 
of our model. As an example, during 
the past year, spirits have grown in 
the Bibendum regional business by 
43.7%, and National business by 21% as 
customers appreciate the wider choice 
now on offer through Conviviality 
Direct. 
Conviviality Direct affords a range of 
over 14,000 alcohol lines to over 11,000 
customers, offering a one-stop solution 
to hotels, restaurants, bars and venues 
for their alcohol needs delivering 
consistent service nationwide next 
day. Conviviality Direct has a national 
sales force through the Bibendum and 
Matthew Clark brands of over 300 
employees based across Scotland, 
England and Wales and London and 
the South East ensuring excellent 
service to its Independent Free Trade 
customers and National Account 
customers. The sales team have up 
to date information on industry sales 
trends, new product information and 
pricing and are able to recommend the 
right mix of products to customers to 
help them optimise their offer to their 
consumers. Conviviality‚Äôs nationwide 
distribution network of 16 depots 
means customers benefit from a 
nationwide next day delivery service 
and timed delivery slots.
A key part of the Conviviality Direct 
strategy is to focus on growth in 
key cities, specifically focused on 
existing customers identifying with 
the Bibendum and Matthew Clark 
propositions and their ability to utilise 
the brands to meet all of their drinks 
purchasing needs. The Caring Group 
of restaurants (the Ivy collection, Le 
Caprice for example), Prezzo and 
Searcys have all chosen to work with 
Conviviality Direct to enable them to 
access the extensive range, service and 
solutions the Group offers. At the same 
time as attracting new customers, our 
existing customers have continued 
to value a long standing relationship 
with us. Stonegate has worked with 
us for 9 years and we continue to 
enjoy supporting their business, and 
JD Wetherspoons have worked with 
Matthew Clark from having 8 pubs 
in their portfolio to over 900 pubs to 
date. 
We continue to work closely with our 
customers to understand their current 
and future needs, ensuring that we 
are at the fore front of customer 
service. Furthermore 770 customers 
have recognised the opportunity to 
improve order accuracy and efficiency 
by moving onto our digital platform. 
4,645 customers now engage with the 
digital platform and order value per 
customer is 13% higher than customers 
who place orders via the contact

Conviviality Retail
The UK‚Äôs largest franchised off-licence 
and convenience chain with 352 
Franchisees and more than 700 retail 
stores trading primarily under the fascia 
of Bargain Booze, Select Convenience 
and Wine Rack. In line with our 
programme to focus on the underlying 
quality of retail stores, we continue 
to see low levels of store closures to 
63 in total which include the closure 
of small CTN (confectionary, tobacco, 
newsagent) stores which no longer 
serve the Off licence or Convenience 
proposition. Whilst net store numbers 
are in line with the prior year the quality 
of the outlets opening is significantly 
improved, with retail sales per new 
outlet opening up 29.8% versus last 
year. Sales of multisite Franchisees 
outperform the total estate by 2.1% like 
for like*. We saw 39 Franchisees join 
the Group, a strong indication of the 
benefits of our model to independent 
business people. Our core model is 
predicated by Franchisee loyalty and 
commitment to upholding the values 
of our brands. This, combined with 
the high standards that we set, are 
helping to deliver our differentiated 
‚Äúlocal customer experience‚Äù. We have 
some of the highest levels of loyalty in 
the sector with the percentage of sales 
of goods by our Franchisees that are 
purchased from the Group at 91%. It is 
also pleasing that Wine Rack continues 
to perform well and during 2016 we 
opened one new Wine Rack in Epsom. 
Like for like performance in Wine Rack 
is 1.4% reflecting the importance of a 
specialist Wine and Spirits proposition 
on the high street.
Conviviality Retail continues to 
grow a national store estate with a 
differentiated consumer proposition 
that responds to consumer needs 
and market trends. The strategy aims 
to consolidate Conviviality Retail‚Äôs 
position as the UK‚Äôs leading drinks-
led convenience retailer. The business 
has three fundamental sources of 
advantage:
Drinks Heritage and Expertise:
Approximately 50% of sales are from 
beer, wine and spirits categories, 
producing a category mix that is unique 
in the sector. Conviviality‚Äôs unrivalled 
category expertise in the drinks sector 
allows Franchisees to benefit from a 
differentiated proposition and from 
the footfall and margin benefits of a 
compelling range and assortment. It 
is this drinks heritage and expertise 
that underpins and differentiates our 
three key retail brands. In particular 
the business will continue to develop 
the Select Convenience proposition to 
ensure that it is at the heart of ‚Äúlocal 
convenience‚Äù in the communities in 
which it trades. Further development 
of the Vape proposition is being 
rolled out across the estate, and is 
now in 249 stores. Vape products are 
margin-enhancing and protect against 
the decline in tobacco sales. We are 
already seeing average sales of ¬£220 
per store per week and margin benefit 
to Franchisees of approximately 
¬£5,000 per store per year.
Sourcing and Distribution Scale:
As part of the Conviviality Group, the 
business has significantly benefited 
from its scale advantages in buying 
and distribution, whilst remaining a 
largely standalone business operating 
out of its own offices with a dedicated 
and experienced management team. 
Distribution is managed in-house 
by the Conviviality Group logistics 
operation, primarily on dedicated 
branded vehicles, with stores typically 
choosing to receive two, or sometimes 
three, deliveries per week. Service 
levels are very high compared to our 
competitors in the sector with over 99% 
of deliveries received on time and with 
complete orders. The transformation 
of the Conviviality logistics network 
will allow Conviviality Retail to benefit 
from the Group‚Äôs scale through lower 
delivery costs. Conviviality Retail can 
leverage its scale position to source 
advantageously and provide consistent 
value to Franchisees. Offering good 
value to consumers through reliable 
low-pricing and compelling promotions 
is core to the Bargain Booze model. 
Locally Embedded Franchise Model:

retailers to deliver superior returns via

a simple turn-key solution that leverages strong 
business fundamentals and a scalable back 
office: the Franchisee proposition is the core of 
Conviviality Retail‚Äôs success. Franchisees access 
a distinct drinks-led consumer offer supported 
by dedicated support managers, regular, and 
deep engagement at senior level and a reward 
package that is unique in the sector, including 
accessing the Franchisee Incentive Plan under 
which shares in Conviviality Plc are awarded 
based on compliance and performance. 285 
Franchisees own or hold options over 3m 
shares in Conviviality Plc. The Company‚Äôs 
352 Franchisees are local people, employing 
local people, and are passionate about their 
customers and the communities in which they 
trade. Our Franchisees make a real difference 
in their local communities through a relentless 
focus on meeting consumer needs and 
providing a unique customer experience. 
To reinforce the three fundamental sources 
of advantage, Conviviality Retail has made 
an investment in upgrading its retail systems. 
The new core operating system (ERP) will 
be introduced during the Autumn of 2017 
and the rollout of new EPOS to all stores is 
already in progress. The new solutions will 
enable business efficiencies, future-proof the 
Franchisee proposition, and accelerate the 
strategic direction to invest in a growing mix of 
multisite Franchisees. 14 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Conviviality Trading 
A full service drinks brand and 
wine agency business with national 
sales and activation capability from 
traditional On and Off Trade retail, to 
festivals and events. New products and 
brands can be developed, both with 
our partner suppliers, and also directly 
by our own teams as we see trends 
and opportunities emerge across the 
market. Within Conviviality Trading, 
Catalyst PLB brings together PLB, Instil 
and Catalyst Brands: three specialist 
brand agency businesses, each with 
significant expertise in their respective 
categories. The brand agency business 
enhances the marketing capability and 
sales reach of the business and gives 
partner suppliers and brand owners 
unparalleled market coverage.
In addition, Conviviality Trading is 
also responsible for the development 
and growth of new business areas 
including Peppermint, a specialist 
in outdoor events and festivals, and 
Elastic, a brand activation agency that 
provides support and insight to many 
of Conviviality‚Äôs branded supply base.
Within Catalyst PLB the team represent 
over 25 brands across drinks categories 
in the UK drinks market. This area of 
the business not only represents large 
suppliers and brands as a drinks agency 
but is also a consolidator of wine 
suppliers, managing the supply of wine 
to the Off Trade including high street 
retailers, specialists and supermarkets. 
Conviviality Trading has skills and 
capabilities in consumer insight, 
sourcing, ranging and supply that can 
add significant value to its customers 
by offering a ‚Äúone-stop shop‚Äù reducing 
the complexity of the wine category in 
large multiple national chains.
We have already seen new strategic 
relationships established. In April 2016 
the Catalyst business started working 
with global spirits business Beam 
Suntory. The team won the distribution 
rights for Larios Gin and Sauza Tequila. 
Larios is the leading gin in Spain and 
Catalyst were tasked with launching 
the brand in the UK. In the first year 
working together the Catalyst team 
built distribution for Larios in over 
1,700 accounts and grew the volume 
significantly. In January 2017 two of 
the largest Chilean wine producers 
transferred their Off Trade business to 
Conviviality: Santa Rita, with brands 
including Santa Rita, Vina Carmen and 
Sur Andino; and Luis Felipe Edwards, a 
privately owned wine group founded in 
1976 by Luis Felipe Edwards Senior, with 
brands including Luis Felipe Edwards, 
Dona Bernada, Marea and Cien.
Conviviality also has the ability to 
develop its own brands opening 
up opportunities where gaps in the 
market exist to create and build brands 
that directly meet our customers‚Äô and 
their consumers‚Äô needs. In 2017 we 
launched two new brands: Rolling Calf 
spiced spirit, capitalising on the trend 
for dark spirits and cocktails, already 
distributed to customers in the On 
T rade and due to launch in the Off T rade 
during Winter 2017; and Whipstitch 
cider which has been launched 
specifically for festival customers 
and received positive response from 
customers when trialled at the Isle of 
Wight Festival in June 2017.
Building our partners‚Äô brands across 
the UK market means accessing the 
consumer wherever they are buying 
and consuming products whether 
that be in pubs, bars and restaurants; 
in supermarkets; convenience stores; 
online; and also in the emerging ‚Äúthird 
space‚Äù. This includes non-traditional 
areas like outdoor events, pop ups 
and festivals. Through Peppermint, 
a specialist in outdoor events and 
festivals, we deliver this promise. This 
year Peppermint will be operating 
at over 35 events. Sales increased by 
46% over the corresponding prior 
period. For events owners, Peppermint  Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017       15

Spiced Spirit: two of Conviviality‚Äôs latest 
brand innovations

management as well as ATM operation 
and Click and Collect.
Furthermore, Elastic, our brand 
activation agency which provides 
activation and brand building expertise 
to many of Conviviality‚Äôs branded 
supply base, saw sales grow strongly. 
Elastic has completed work for eight 
new branded suppliers in addition to 
the continued strong partnerships 
with businesses such as ABInBev and 
Heineken, cementing our positioning 
as one of the UK‚Äôs leading experiential 
drinks agencies. 16 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
A Group Wide approach to efficiencies 
With the greater scale of the Group there is the potential 
to realise lower costs through buying, distribution and 
improved organisational efficiency. The Integration plan 
set out at the acquisition of Matthew Clark and Bibendum 
PLB Group is ahead of plan with good progress being 
demonstrated against the stated synergy benefits in 
FY18 Buying (¬£8m), Bibendum PLB (¬£4m) and Logistics 
(between ¬£1m and ¬£1.5m). The key benefit areas of the 
integration are detailed as follows:
Buying
The Beer, Lager, Spirits and Soft Drinks buying teams 
across Conviviality Direct and Conviviality Retail work 
collaboratively to ensure that the opportunities for 
both the business and the suppliers are maximised. This 
approach has been key particularly for new product 
launches such as Bud Light. This approach by the Buying 
teams has also resulted in the stated buying synergies 
set out at the acquisition of Matthew Clark being 
achieved for this financial year, which is a demonstration 
of the quality of the buying team and the support of the 
enlarged group by our supply base. 
Group Wine Buying
A Group Wine Buying team was established shortly after 
the purchase of Bibendum PLB Group. The team is led 
by Andrew Shaw, Group Wine Buying Director, and is 
responsible for the selection and purchasing of the full 
assortment of wines, sparking wines and Champagne. 
Our Wine buying teams have long standing relationships 
with our producers and with our customers, giving 
them the unique ability to marry customers‚Äô needs 
with producers‚Äô wines. Across the Group we have 430 
suppliers, 310 of which are exclusive to Conviviality. These 
exclusives cover over 3,000 of the 4,902 SKUs available 
for our customers. Already we have seen Conviviality 
Retail Franchisees benefit from the ability to sell over 
54,000 bottles of wines that are exclusive to Conviviality. 
In addition, with the increased scale and buying volumes 
of the Group there is significant opportunity to address 
costs within the supply chain to release synergy benefits.
As a result we expect to generate additional buying 
benefits of ¬£2 million during FY19.

IT, Systems and Organisation
During the year we have undertaken a programme 
to align the ERP systems across the Group. We are 
implementing the same ERP system as is used in Matthew 
Clark and applying it to both the Bibendum business 
and the Conviviality Retail business. Once the system 
implementations are complete at the end of Autumn 
2017, we will have the opportunity to realise back office 
synergies, drive further improvements for customers 
and improve the ways of working across the Group. The 
enlarged Group employs 2,640 people across 16 depots 
and 4 support offices and regional sales teams, as such 
there is significant talent in the organisation. By bringing 
the respective teams in the businesses closer together 
we are seeing clear opportunities to drive greater 
efficiencies, develop talent across the business and drive 
operational savings. During 2016 10% of our people took 
the opportunity to develop their careers further across 
the Group. We expect additional organisational synergy 
benefits of ¬£1.0m to be realised in FY19.
Trading for the 9 weeks ended 2 July 2017
The Company and its businesses are trading in line with 
expectations. Conviviality Direct continues to trade 
strongly with sales 9% above last year. It is particularly 
pleasing to see the continued improvement and 
confidence of Conviviality Retail with LFL* sales 0.5% with 
Wine Rack up 4.0%. Finally Conviviality Trading is 7.6% 
above last year demonstrating its customers recognising 
the expertise and support of the agency business, and 
additionally with the Events business increasing the 
number of events this year versus last year by 27% to 140.
Diana Hunter
Chief Executive Officer
Group Logistics
The logistics operation is a key strength and differentiator 
for Conviviality . Conviviality serves our customers through 
our network of 11 depots, 5 stockless outbases and 3 
depots operated by our logistics partners. During May 
2016 we transferred the leadership of these depots from 
regional management to the Group Logistics function, 
thereby enabling consistent standards and best practice 
to be applied across the Group. Since the transition 
Telematics has been introduced to all vehicles delivering 
a 3.9% MPG saving, and Paragon route planning software 
is in the process of being rolled out across all depots. 
There are over 1,000 of our people working in our depots 
and delivering to our customers, under the leadership 
of Nigel Basey, Group Logistics Director. We have 
strengthened the capability of the team through training 
and development, and delivered changes to support the 
efficient growth of the Conviviality business. 
During the year, we closed both Y ork and Shefford depots 
and opened new depots in Wetherby and Bedford, 
providing greater capacity to serve our customers and a 
better working environment for our people. We took the 
decision to close the Dundee depot to enable customers 
to order from the full assortment available at Glasgow 
delivered to customers via a stockless outbase. During 
this period, the logistics team supported the service to 
over 100 festivals and the growth of the Conviviality 
Direct and Conviviality Retail businesses. Looking 
ahead, the team are confirming the plans for the Group 
logistics strategy whereby we continue to focus on 
delighting customers and growing the business and, in 
doing so, achieve a greater level of efficiency. Through 
the continued efficiency actions being undertaken we 
expect to deliver ¬£1.2m of distribution synergies in FY18, 
rising to ¬£1.5m in FY19.

JD Wetherspoons
‚ÄúOur two companies have had a working 
relationship for over 25 years. Be it business, 
marriage or friendship; in a relationship lasting 
this many years, both parties evolve and 
constantly adapt. Sometimes you choose to 
compromise and at other times you stand your 
ground. The important thing is that both parties 
have a common understanding of each other‚Äôs 
objectives and communication is fluid. 
In our time working with Matthew Clark, our 
company has grown from less than 100 pubs to 
over 900. At each stage of our development, we 
have received a reliable and appropriate service 
in terms of product range, distribution and 
management support.
Whether it be through the complete supply chain 
management of our house wine, Coldwater Creek, 
to the supply and distribution of the UK‚Äôs most 
popular vodka brand, Smirnoff, the end result 
for our Managers is the same. The lorry turns 
up when it should, the driver puts the delivery 
away and there are very few errors. Reducing 
the increasingly complex task of sourcing and 
delivering wines and spirits for Wetherspoons 
to such simplicity has been, in my view, a real 
accomplishment. 
Which is why, 25 or so years into our relationship, 
despite the obvious quarrels and squabbles that 
one would naturally expect over so many years, 
we are still together.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never intended to stay long with Bargain

to save up some money to go travelling to 
Australia. That was 15 years ago and I‚Äôm still 
here. 
I fell in love with the business. I rapidly 
progressed from shop assistant to store

owners were looking for a buyer, I jumped at 
the chance and I‚Äôve never looked back. 
That store continues to thrive and I‚Äôve now

Dr. Laura Catena 
‚ÄúAlthough I am the fourth generation of my 
family making wine, I came to winemaking as 
my second profession. My first was as a Doctor 
of Medicine, because I dreamed of a life in 
serving others, and did not initially imagine that 
I could do this while making wine. When I joined 
my father in the 1990‚Äôs in his mission to elevate 
Argentine wine, I came to the realization that 
we were changing lives, one bottle at a time. 
When I was a child, rural Mendoza was a very 
poor area where life was extremely hard and 
many were moving to the cities in search of 
opportunity. Today, rural Mendoza is thriving; 
you can tell by the beautiful gardens, well 
painted adobe homes, and thriving small towns, 
where everything from healthcare to education 
have improved dramatically. And in addition, 
our noble Argentine Malbec brings daily joy to 
wine drinkers all over the world, Salud!
From the beginning, when my father presented 
the wines of Catena to Bibendum in 1991, we 
have felt that Bibendum and now Conviviality 
are our partner in every new adventure. And 
most importantly that they believe in our 
dream to make Argentine wines that can stand 
with the best of the world. When we came 
to Bibendum with the Adrianna single parcel 
wines, before we had received two 100 point 
ratings, Bibendum gave us its full support, 
and today the UK is our number one market 
for these wines in the world. More recently, 
my father and I decided that we should try to 
bring the miracle of Mendoza to other more 
impoverished provinces in Argentina and 
to their undiscovered high altitude terroirs. 
Our partners at Conviviality wholeheartedly 
embraced our vision and helped us to launch 
the project, from the storytelling, to the choice 
of varieties, to the packaging. And that is how 
UK became the first export market in the world 
for these extraordinary regional wines: Altaland 
and Pasarisa from Salta, La Rioja Argentina and 
Patagonia.
I must admit that at first we were a bit worried 
about working with a larger company, but the 
various divisions of Conviviality have been able 
to focus on our different brands and terroir-
concepts in a way that has made each one 
of them stronger. Most importantly, the team 
at Conviviality shares our vision that we are 
preserving the farming traditions of Argentina 
and the world, and I honestly believe that in the 
end they believe in our dream as much as we 
do.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe last 12 months have flown by! It was last year at 
the London Wine Fair that the astonishing news of the 
acquisition of Bibendum by Conviviality was announced. 
Hot on the heels of the Matthew Clark acquisition I think 
much of the trade was shocked and also sceptical about 
the possibility of bringing all the cultures together to 
create a strong and enduring business.

the case of Louis Jadot, 61 years! We were both excited 
and concerned, there were varied cultures, varied 
purchasing philosophies and as with all acquisitions lots 
of potential upsides along with lots of chances to reduce 
stakeholder value. The master stroke was that there was 
only 3% overlap between the Bibendum account base 
and the Matthew Clark one so in Conviviality Direct there 
was little chance of cannibalisation. The other piece 
of genius was the very early segmentation in to three 
divisions with one wine purchasing team. This gave a 
strong platform for each to work on and focus on its on 
channel specific objectives.
The Hatch philosophy has always been one of working 
via a selective route to market to ensure that as little 
cross distributor disruption occurs as is possible. On top 
of this we layer a large team who work with the sales 
team in generating sales either by utilising our strategic 
partnerships or by simply helping knock on doors! In retail 
we try to segment and tailor our product proposition to 
meet the demographics of the specific channel we are 
on shelf in. No retailer wants dust on a wine bottle so 
it‚Äôs all about relevance to target market. Fortunately 
these philosophies found deep favour in the enlarged 
Conviviality business and as such the last 12 months have 
allowed us very good growth.
Clearly an organisation with scale provides opportunities, 
if you can clearly align to the destination they are trying 
to get to. Conviviality works well for us in this respect 
as we believe our portfolio that Conviviality represent 
should help them influence every drinking occasion.
Currently Conviviality are set apart from others by a 
combination of factors, namely scale, channel clarity and 
a collaborative approach. If you align to this the ability 
to use insight to create a joint forensic approach to new 
business acquisition, then it is hard to see why success 
will not come. With scale comes data, with data comes 
complexity. However as I see it currently Conviviality are 
asking the data the right questions to help us all find the 
right answers.
Success looks different in different people‚Äôs eyes. From 
the perspective of Hatch Mansfield, success is continued 
growth in relevant distribution with a rate of sale that 
makes the distribution work for the on and off trade 
retailers. Working as we do with shared objectives to 
Director level and clarity of what we are both good at 
allows us to outperform a declining market. A recent 
example of this is the work we have piloted with email 
offers. We identify who we want to target we then create 
the compelling offer and communication as well as the 
pull mechanic and we then go to market. Interestingly 
the first time we did this we failed but because both 
Hatch and Conviviality are learning organisations, we 
then looked at what went right and what went wrong, 
reworked the communication tried again and achieved 
superb results. However, let‚Äôs not forget the people, 
relationships in this industry are critical. We work on a 
one to one basis with targeted outcomes and a shared 
prize but alongside that we actually have huge respect 
for the people and all those involved with Conviviality ‚Äòwe 
like to do business with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs favourite beer brand, Bud Light, officially landed in the 
UK in March 2017. It‚Äôs no over statement to say that this was one of 
our biggest ever UK launches. In fact, it was probably the biggest 
beer launch the UK has seen in the past twenty years. 
Our ambitions were high. We knew from our research that 60% 
of UK consumers were already aware of Bud Light and we were 
frequently asked by our fans to bring it to the UK. Our challenge was 
to gain the maximum amount of reach and impact to capitalise on 
the opportunity to drive growth in the category and, in particular, 
attract the next generation of 18-24 year olds.
Conviviality provided a route to the whole UK market, right across 
the On Trade and Off Trade. Scale and reach were matched with 
marketing expertise and a team of people who were committed 
to our success. They translated our brand strategy into a high 
impact marketing campaign to drive On Trade listings and 
consumer excitement across the Off Trade. The results speak 
for themselves. We secured over 700 Bud Light installs in just a 
few months and we‚Äôre set to achieve 10% share of the Standard 
Lager Market in the On trade by 2018. Across retail, Bargain Booze  
was the first to market with in-store takeovers across its 700+ 
retail stores. 
Conviviality understood our needs and delivered for us at scale 
and pace. They were true partners in achieving success.‚Äù

Our markets
Continued
to join the Group as Franchisees. A trend driving the 
convenience sector is the resurgence of consumer interest 
in participating in community life and shopping locally, 
and this is reflected in our Franchisees‚Äô embeddedness 
in their local communities. Conviviality Retail is the only 
national chain of drinks-led convenience stores, giving it 
a clear point of difference in the convenience market.
IGD convenience market size and forecast 2015 - 2022
Consumer and Category Trends
Two of the most important trends in the market are 
premiumisation and hyper-convenience.
Premiumisation: 
Consumers have an increasing desire for more choice 
and quality, creating a mix shift towards more premium 
products. Over the last 12 months, consumers have 
continued to spend more on wine, with Conviviality 
Retail‚Äôs store fascias, including both Bargain Booze and 
Wine Rack, performing ahead of this trend. Sales of 
wine priced over ¬£9 increased 7% across the Off Trade, 
with an 18% increase for Conviviality Retail stores
9
. The 
premiumisation trend is also apparent in the spirits 
category. UK volume imports of premium spirits grew by 
10% between 2015 and 2016
10
, with Conviviality Direct‚Äôs 
premium spirit sales rising c.40% in FY17. This trend is 
reflected in the successes of premium products recently 
promoted in Conviviality Retail; for example Ciroc vodka, 
which retails for ¬£29.99 at standard price and less on 
promotion, now represents a 5x greater proportion of 
our total vodka sales than last year. 
Consumers‚Äô increasing willingness to try more premium 
products has driven the artisan and craft movements 
across the food and drink sector. These trends are 
evidenced with the significant growth in gin, which has 
now surpassed vodka as the UK‚Äôs number one spirit. 
In the last twelve months, gin sales have increased 15% 
across the on- and Off Trades
11
, with 1 in 3 consumers now 
picking gin as a favourite
12
. Conviviality are leading the 
gin trend, having outgrown the market with group-wide 
gin sales growth of c.20% in FY17. 
The trend for premiumisation has also translated into 
growth in cocktails, with an increase in the proportion 
of On Trade outlets serving these drinks to almost 30%
13
. 
Over the last year, the greatest rise in demand was for 
the Pornstar Martini which now has a market share of 
8%
14
. As one of the key ingredients of this cocktail, the 
increased demand has partly driven the sales growth 
of flavoured vodka, with Conviviality Direct selling c.15% 
more flavoured vodka this year than last year. 
As standard ales and lager volumes fall, premium lager 
and ale have seen value growth of +6% and +10% 
respectively
15
. Over 1 in 4 beer drinkers pick craft beer 
as their favourite beer, and 1 in 5 of all consumers have 
tried a craft ale in the last 3 months
16
. Conviviality Retail‚Äôs 
craft beer sales have increased by almost 40% over the 
past year, with a range of over 40 SKUs now available to 
Franchisees. 
Hyper-convenience:
Consumers are fuelling a second wave of convenience, 
expecting outcomes that are especially convenient to 
them. This continues to support Conviviality Retail‚Äôs 
strategy to grow through drinks-led convenience. 
Furthermore the trend for ultimate convenience is 
demonstrated in more overt ‚Äòmission splitting‚Äô (where 
consumers‚Äô choices of shops depend on the specific 
shopping missions they are undertaking) and the growth 
of apps into the On Trade as well as the Off Trade. The 
Bargain Booze App continues to see usage of c.65,000 
and customers using the app spend almost twice as 
much as the average customer. Our customers and 
partners are also finding success through apps, weekly 
visits to the Bargain Booze facebook page, website and 
App were up 216% to 79,000. Since its launch in March 
2017, the JD Wetherspoons at-table ordering app has 
been downloaded over 22,000 times. since its launch in 
March 2017, the JD Wetherspoons at-table ordering app 
has been downloaded over 22,000 times. Conviviality

working to increase engagement at a local level.

Our strategy
The Conviviality goal is to be the drinks and impulse products sector‚Äôs leading 
specialist wholesaler and distributor to the On Trade and Off Trade by being the  
most knowledgeable and inspiring partner for our customers
Progress
We have restructured the business into three distinct 
business units with expertise in anticipating and 
understanding their specific customer needs. The 
business unit mission is to ensure that customers have 
the support they need to select the right products 
from our extensive ranges to directly fulfil their target 
customer needs. As Conviviality customers they have 
the assurance of our compelling delivery proposition 
through our nationwide logistics network. By working 
with over 980 suppliers and brand owners across an 
assortment of over 18,000 SKU‚Äôs Conviviality can offer 
its customers and Franchisees the right assortment to 
meet their consumer needs by format, outlet and region. 
The enlarged Group is independent of major drinks 
brands, enabling it to supply an unrestricted selection 
of products to customers who value breadth of range, 
offering a compelling route for suppliers to access both 
on and Off Trade retailers. By serving outlets spanning 
retail, outdoor events, pubs, clubs, premium restaurants, 
hotels and bars, this reach provides Conviviality with 
unique access to emerging trends in the UK market and 
significant insight into UK consumers‚Äô drinking habits. 
Looking ahead
Conviviality is focused on ensuring that we anticipate 
the requirements of our customers and to support this 
we have invested in ERP systems, Digital platforms 
and EPOS systems to ensure that we not only deliver 
outstanding service everyday but we stay ahead of our 
customers‚Äô future needs, supporting their profitable 
growth. Already the greater scale of the enlarged Group 
provides the potential to realise lower costs through 
the implementation of a consistent ERP system across 
the Group that will unlock operational benefits through 
streamlined back office processes. In the year ahead 
we will start to set out plans to improve our processes 
maximising efficiency, in doing so we will remove the 
inevitable duplication that existed within the three 
businesses. We will further strengthen our capability, 
growing our businesses organically in both the Franchise 
business and in the On T rade in addition to complementary 
strategic acquisitions where and when they provide value 
creation for the Group and our shareholders.

Progress
As a result of the acquisition of 
Matthew Clark and Bibendum PLB 
Group, Conviviality now employs 
over 2,600 people. All key leadership 
roles have been recruited with the 
team in place, new and existing 
team members successfully working 
together. With process streamlining 
we continue to develop and promote 
our people into roles across the 
organisation. In the past year 249 
employees have changed roles across 
the group. Conviviality offers career 
development opportunities for all 
employees across the Group; in the 
Franchise business, through to the On 
Trade wholesale business, as well as 
career opportunities across logistics, 
marketing, buying and finance. This 
benefits Conviviality by retaining a 
motivated and talented workforce 
that is flexible to new opportunities.
Looking ahead
Conviviality has put in place an 
organisational structure that leverages 
the benefit of the enlarged Group. 
Conviviality will continue to grow 
and develop talent from within, 
ensuring we create a motivating and 
sustainable future for our employees. 
We continue to invest in the skills and 
capabilities of our people and ensure 
that our customers and suppliers 
receive the expertise and support 
they have come to expect from 
Conviviality people. 
Maximising  
Returns
Maximising returns for our 
customers, Franchisees, 
suppliers and investors by 
consistently delivering against 
our targets and metrics, and 
balancing the delivery of 
excellence every day with long 
term sustainable growth. 
Progress
We have built a business model that 
creates a natural hedge against the 
challenging economic environment, 
we span all the consumer segments 
of the UK drinks market. Through 
the diverse nature of our customer 
base we cover both drinking in the 
home and drinking out of the home 
missions. Conviviality has a unique 
service proposition for customers 
as solution provider and one stop 
shop for all drinks purchasing needs. 
This enables our customers to 
create efficiencies within their own 
businesses by increasingly accessing 
more of the Conviviality offer to 
simplify their operation and remove 
supply chain duplication. 
Looking ahead
As we continue to stand in the shoes 
of our customers we recognise the 
need to help them drive greater 
efficiencies and meet their future 
customer needs and trends. The 
development of our digital platform 
is a key driver of efficiency for our 
customers, there has been a 20% 
growth year on year in the number 
of customers using our platform. 
In the year ahead we will make this 
available to Bibendum customers. 
Our customers benefit from more 
efficient and more accurate order 
processes and in turn Conviviality 
benefits from greater engagement in 
the product range and assortment. 
Nearly half of our existing customers 
view the site daily, with an average 
of 15 page views per session and 
we have seen a significant increase 
in average order size versus the 
traditional ordering methods. 
Delighting Customers  
& Partners 
Delighting our consumers in 
every drinking occasion, on and 
off-premises through choice, 
convenience and great value. 
Progress
The enlarged Group now has access 
to 4,902 SKUs of wine, 3,800 lager, 
beer and cider, 5,400 spirits, 877 soft 
drinks, 4,500 impulse and grocery 
SKUs and 1,900 tobacco products. 
Increasingly Conviviality‚Äôs suppliers 
value the access to route to market 
benefits, the data and insight and 
brand building capability across the 
Group engaging at a deeper level 
than they previously would have 
found possible pre acquisition. This 
extensive assortment enables each 
of the Group‚Äôs customers to access 
household name brands as well as 
exclusive ranges and own labels to 
directly meet their target consumer 
needs, by format and venue and 
addressing regional variances. The 
Group‚Äôs customer support team, with 
the support of expert buyers, and 
menu designers and merchandisers, 
can help customers and Franchisees 
select the right range and assortment 
and in doing so manage their pricing 
and mix.
Looking ahead
Delivering daily consistent and 
excellent service to our customers 
is core to our business. The strong 
relationships with our suppliers and 
the expertise we have within the 
enlarged Group will result in our 
customers being able to access the 
widest assortment to meet their 
needs as well as expertise and market 
advice. Conviviality will continue to 
work with brand owners maximising 
distribution potential across all 
drinking occasions, in home and out 
of the home, across a deeper product 
portfolio. Our strategy is to deliver a 
logistics capability that anticipates 
the future needs of our customers 
and creates significant differentiation 
in the market, thereby adding 
significant value to the organisation.

Risks & mitigation factors
Franchisee retention and quality
Markets and competition
Risk and description Mitigation factors Level
The alcohol wholesale market 
remains competitive with several 
companies seeking to grow 
organically and via acquisition to 
leverage the benefits of scale. 
The convenience retail market 
remains competitive with several 
larger companies seeking to 
expand. The market is starting to 
consolidate as companies seek to 
leverage the benefits of scale and 
independents find it increasingly 
hard to compete. The discounters‚Äô 
reputation for price leadership is 
firmly established with consumers. 
The possible emergence of larger 
alcohol wholesale competitors 
and the continued growth of the 
discounters may impact on the 
development of future revenue 
streams.
Retaining Franchisees and 
improving the overall quality of 
Franchisees is fundamental to the 
Group‚Äôs future growth. Failure to 
retain Franchisees could result in a 
reduction in the number of stores 
through higher store closures 
and fewer store openings as the 
Group‚Äôs ability to attract new 
Franchisees may diminish.
The quality of the Group‚Äôs 
Franchisees are a key driver of 
sales growth, brand reputation and 
reputation with end consumers. 
Any failure to maintain or improve 
Franchisee quality could result 
in lower sales per store with a 
consequential effect on profitability 
of both the Franchisee and the 
Group.
Conviviality Direct has a strong position in the alcohol 
wholesale market providing customers with a broad 
range of wines, spirits, beers and soft drinks available for 
next day delivery. 
Conviviality offers its suppliers unrivalled access to the 
UK alcohol market enabling the development of strategic 
supply relationships. Conviviality‚Äôs ability to connect 
suppliers and customers creates the opportunity to 
leverage scale providing even broader choice and better 
value for our customers.
Conviviality Retail has a unique proposition as off-
licence led convenience stores providing a compelling 
combination of a value and choice of our 14,000 alcohol 
range with 60% on promotion at any one time. The 
extensive alcohol range and significantly improved 
impulse and grocery ranges provides consumers the 
choice they demand.
Franchisee engagement remains strong with the 
combination of the Franchisee Incentive Plan and cash 
incentives providing Franchisees the opportunity to earn 
up to an extra ¬£17,800 per annum. 
The Group continues to provide high levels of training and 
support for Franchisees and is working in an increasingly 
collaborative way to launch new services such as the new 
EPOS Till system. 
The continued focus on improving store standards has 
resulted in significantly tougher standards and it is very 
pleasing that 262 achieved the ‚ÄúGold standard‚Äù.

Other legal and regulatory
Britain‚Äôs exit from the EU
Minimum unit pricing
Risk and description Mitigation factors Level
There is a risk that new and 
existing legal and regulatory 
requirements could impact 
revenue and costs. The Alcohol 
Wholeslaer Registration Scheme 
came into force in June 2017. 
Failure to maintain registration 
would significantley disrupt the 
business.
Britain‚Äôs exit from the EU in March 
2019 creates significant uncertainty 
and could result in changes 
to import tariffs and delays in 
importing goods from the EU. 
Minimum unit pricing could be 
introduced in England and Wales if 
it proves an effective way to reduce 
excessive drinking in Scotland.
The Group is on the approved list of registered wholesalers. 
The Group continues to monitor regulatory and legal 
developments to determine its strategic and competitive 
response and ensure compliance with its obligations.
The Group is a member of the Association of Convenience 
Stores and Wines and Spirits Trading Association through 
which gives the Group insight and access to current 
legislator thinking and debate.
The UK government‚Äôs position is that suitable trade 
deals can be struck within the two year exit period; 
however, there are very few historical precedents of 
trade deals agreed this quickly. The insertion of a border 
with the EU, however, could be disruptive with the 
possibility of delays as HMRC scale up processes and 
systems. Leading groups, such as the British Beer & Pub 
Association (BBPA) and the Association of Licensed 
Multiple Retailers (ALMR), are campaigning on behalf 
of our industry to ensure concerns are voiced and 
disruption caused by Brexit is minimised. 
Minimum unit pricing continues to be debated within 
the UK government. In Scotland, where the legislation 
was passed in 2012, the implementation has now been 
approved after being held up by repeated legal challenges. 
In April 2017, in their review on the 2003 Licensing Act, 
the House of Lords Committee recommended that if the 
implementation in Scotland was found to be effective in 
reducing excessive drinking, then the policy should be 
rolled out in England and Wales.

Business integration
Tobacco demand
Data security and IT reliability
The Group is in the process of 
integrating Matthew Clark and 
Bibendum PLB Group to delivery 
buying, distribution, revenue and 
organisational synergies. Failure 
to implement the integration plan 
effectively could result in lower 
synergies and result in short term 
disruption to the Group‚Äôs business.
The UK government and health 
industry continue to discourage 
smoking and on 20 May 2016 plain 
packaging was introduced.
Whilst tobacco sales do not 
make a significant contribution 
to the Group‚Äôs profits, tobacco 
remains a key driver of footfall into 
Conviviality Retail‚Äôs stores.
The Group relies on its IT 
infrastructure and in particular its 
EPOS, warehouse management 
and ERP systems to service its 
customers. Cyber security risk is 
increasing.
A major breach or malfunction 
of these systems would cause 
significant disruption to the Group 
and its performance.
The Group is executing a robust and well-resourced plan 
to integrate Matthew Clark and Bibendum PLB Group and 
create three customer facing business units (Conviviality 
Direct; Conviviality Retail; and Conviviality Trading) 
supported by a number of group support functions. 
The integration is on track and the Group‚Äôs Change 
Board continues to lead the change program and meets 
monthly to review progress, risks and to ensure adequate 
resources are available.
Conviviality‚Äôs reliance on tobacco sales has substantially 
reduced with tobacco sales mix falling from 30% in the 
year ending April 2015 to 7% in the year ending 30 April 
2017.
The Group‚Äôs reputation for value has mitigated the 
impact of the introduction of plain packaging with like 
for like tobacco sales down only 1.2%. 
Recent growth in the electronic cigarettes and Vape 
products provides a new revenue stream with stronger 
margins.
The Group is nearing completion of significant IT projects 
to implement new systems into Conviviality Retail and 
expand Matthew Clark‚Äôs systems to Bibendum Wine.
A Group IT Director has been appointed to oversee 
all systems development as Conviviality continues to 
implement its systems convergence strategy.

16 distribution centres throughout 
the UK. The loss of a key operating 
site could seriously disrupt business 
activity.
A disaster recovery plan is in place to enable a proactive 
and effective response if a site should be severely 
impacted. A detailed review of the plan will be undertaken 
in the next 12 months. There are regular and robust risk 
assessments to identify and mitigate business interruption

¬£1,560m

 (FY16: ¬£9.1m) and 
fully diluted earnings per share increased 136% to 10.4 pence 
(FY16: 4.4 pence).
Net debt at 30 April 2017 was ¬£95.7m (1 May 2016 ¬£86.1m) with 
leverage falling to 1.6 times adjusted EBITDA (1 May 2016 2.2 
times).
Revenue
Revenue increased by 85% to ¬£1,560m
1
 (FY16: ¬£841m) due to 
the full year impact of acquiring Matthew Clark, the acquisition 
of Bibendum PLB Group and organic growth of 5.8%, with each 
business unit growing strongly.
Conviviality Direct generated sales of ¬£1,040m in the 52 weeks 
ending 30 April 2017. This represents an increase of 6.4%
6
 on the 
corresponding prior period with sales per outlet increasing by 
4.8% and the number of outlets served increasing by 1.5%. The 
Matthew Clark and the Bibendum Wine sales teams are working 
well together and customers are recognising the benefits of 
sourcing from a single supplier that offers great choice, service 
and value. 
Conviviality Retail‚Äôs sales increased 6.1%
6
 over the corresponding 
prior period primarily due to a 10.7% increase in the number of 
average stores trading during the year (FY17:703; FY16:635) due 
to a Franchisee acquiring a large parcel of stores in the final 
quarter of FY16. This resulted in lower sales per store in FY17 
and, as the Franchisee closed or sold a number of the smaller 
underperforming stores, the number of closures increased to 
63 (FY16: 34). At 30 April 2017 the Group operated 713 stores 
(1 May 2016: 716) with 43 stores opening and 17 acquisitions in 
the year. 
Sales improved during the year with like for like sales

 +0.5% 
in the second half compared to (1.7)% in the first half. In the 
financial year like for like

 sales were (1.0)%. 
Conviviality T rading sales increased 1.0%

¬£207.1m (FY16: ¬£101.2m). This was partly offset by an 
increase in operating costs (excluding exceptional items, 
depreciation, amortisation, share based payment charges 
and fair value movement on foreign currency contracts) 
of 106% to ¬£146.2m (FY16: ¬£71.0m) due to the full year 
impact of the acquisition of Matthew Clark in October 
2015 and the acquisition of Bibendum PLB Group in May 
2016. 
Gross margin percentage improved to 13.3% (FY16: 
12.0%) primarily due to buying synergies of ¬£6.0m (0.4% 
point increase) and the acquisitions of Matthew Clark 
and Bibendum PLB Group (0.4% point increase).
Profit before tax
Group profit before tax increased by ¬£13.4m to 
¬£22.5m
1
 (2016: ¬£9.1m) primarily due to the ¬£30.7m 
increase in Adjusted EBITDA
2
 offset by higher finance 
costs, depreciation and amortisation (including the 
amortisation of Matthew Clark and Bibendum PLB 
Group acquisition intangibles), an increase in share 
based charges and an adverse fair value adjustment on 
foreign exchange contracts of ¬£3.3m. 
Net finance costs increased by ¬£2.7m primarily due 
to interest on term loans drawn down to fund the 
acquisitions of Matthew Clark and Bibendum PLB Group, 
amortisation of banking arrangement fees and increased 
utilisation of working capital facilities. 
Depreciation and amortisation (excluding amorisation of 
acqusition intangibles) increased by ¬£3.3m reflecting a 
full year charge from the acquisition of Matthew Clark, 
the acquisition of Bibendum PLB Group and our recent 
investment in IT systems and stores.
Matthew Clark and Bibendum PLB Group acquisition 
intangible assets include the Matthew Clark and 
Bibendum Wine brands and customer bases (total net 
book value ¬£60.0m). The brands are being amortised 
over 10 years and the customer base over their expected 
life of between 5 and 6.5 years giving an amortisation 
charge in the year of ¬£10.0m.
Share based charges increased by ¬£0.7m due to the 
continued investment in the Franchise Incentive Plan and 
management share options to ensure both Franchisees 
and management are aligned with the Group‚Äôs objectives 
and rewarded based on the performance of the Group.
Exceptional items of ¬£10.0m primarily comprises 
professional fees relating to the acquisition of 
Bibendum PLB Group of ¬£1.6m and costs to integrate 
and restructure the Group following the acquisitions of 
Matthew Clark and Bibendum PLB Group of ¬£8.7m. The 
integration of Matthew Clark and Bibendum PLB Group 
with Conviviality Retail was completed as a single project 
to make the integration more efficient and reduce costs. 
A significant amount of work was undertaken in FY17 to 
create three customer facing business units (Conviviality 
Direct; Conviviality Retail and Conviviality Trading) plus 
group support functions (Logistics, Finance, IT, Legal and 
Human Resources). The Group is now operating within 
this structure which facilitates the delivery of buying, 
logistics and organisational synergies whilst ensuring 
the Group is well positioned to continue to drive organic 
sales growth.
Conviviality owns 61% of Peppermint Events and is 
committed to acquire the remaining 39% in the year 
ending April 2020 or April 2021 based on EBITDA in the 
year ending April 2019 or April 2020. The timing of the 
final earn-out will depend on whether Peppermint Events 
exceeds an EBITDA target that has been set for the year 
ending 2019. If the target is not met the earn-out moves 
to the year ending 2020. The EBITDA targets set at the 
date of acquisition resulted in a contingent consideration 
of ¬£6.2m and a liability was established for this amount. 
Reflecting current market conditions the estimated 
contingent consideration has decreased by ¬£3.4m. This 
has been recorded as exceptional income. 
Adjusted profit before tax
5
 increased 111% to ¬£45.8m 
(FY16: ¬£21.7m) as Adjusted EBITDA
2
 of ¬£60.9m was 
offset by net finance charges of ¬£5.2m, depreciation 
and amortisation (excluding amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles) of ¬£7.4m and share based charges of ¬£2.4m.
Tax
The tax charge of ¬£4.0m represents tax on Group profit 
before tax and exceptional items of ¬£6.1m offset by a tax 
credit tax on exceptional items of ¬£2.1m. The effective 
tax rate on Group profit before tax and exceptional 
items is 18.8% due to movements in deferred tax. The tax 
credit on exceptional items is 20.9% due to disallowable 
transaction costs on the acquisition of Bibendum PLB 
Group.
Earnings per share
Profit after tax increased 249% to ¬£18.5m (FY16: ¬£5.3m) 
and the basic weighted average number of shares 
increased 48% to 170.1m (FY16: 115.3m) following the 
placing of 15.6m new shares with institutional investors 
to raise gross proceeds of c. ¬£32.0m to part fund the 
acquisition of Bibendum PLB Group. This resulted in basic 
EPS increasing 135% to 10.8 pence (FY16: 4.6 pence).
Fully diluted weighted average shares increased 48%

 of ¬£60.9m was augmented by a reduction in 
working capital of ¬£17.3m and offset by net capital 
expenditure of ¬£13.4m, interest payments of ¬£5.3m and 
tax payments of ¬£8.3m.
Capital expenditure includes a continued investment 
in stores of ¬£6.0m and the development of IT systems, 
including a new EPOS till system, the implementation 
of JD Edwards ERP system into Bibendum Wine and 
Conviviality Retail and the implementation of warehouse 
management systems and logistics planning tools, of 
¬£9.8m. This is offset by the proceeds from the sale of 
assets of ¬£6.3m, primarily the sale and leaseback of the 
Shefford depot.
Net debt increased by ¬£9.6m as free cash flow
9
 of ¬£51.2m 
was offset by a net cash outflow on the acquisition of 
Bibendum PLB Group of ¬£28.6m, the acquisition of KMD 
Enterprises for cash consideration of ¬£4.0m, restructuring 
and integration costs of ¬£8.7m and dividend payments of 
¬£19.9m.
The consideration for Bibendum PLB Group was ¬£39.7m 
which, together with ¬£19.1m of debt acquired and 
acquisition costs of ¬£1.6m, resulted in a total investment 
of ¬£60.4m. This investment was funded by proceeds from 
the issue of new ordinary shares of ¬£31.8m generating a 
net cash out flow of ¬£28.6m.
At 30 April 2017 the Group‚Äôs net debt totalled ¬£95.7m  
(1 May 2016: ¬£86.1m) and comprised ¬£95.8m of term 
loans and ¬£10.7m drawn down under the Group‚Äôs working 
capital facilities, less cash of ¬£10.4m and unamortised 
banking arrangement fees. The bank facilities include a 
leverage and an interest cover covenant. The leverage 
covenant requires debt (excluding any amounts drawn 
down on under the Group‚Äôs invoice discounting facility) 
to be less than 2.5 times the last 12 months adjusted 
EBITDA
2
. The interest cover covenant requires adjusted 
EBITDA
2
 to be at least four times net finance charges. At 
the measurement date of 30 April 2017 leverage was 1.6 
and interest cover was 11.5.
Dividend
Conviviality has a progressive dividend policy and aims to 
increase dividend cover (based on fully diluted adjusted 
EPS) to two times by the year ending April 2020. In line 
with this policy a final dividend of 8.4 pence per share 
is proposed. Subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid 
on 5 October 2017 to shareholders on the register on 8 
September 2017. This increases the total dividend for the 
year by 33% to 12.6 pence per share (FY16: 9.5 pence per 
share) and increases dividend cover to 1.7 times (FY16: 
1.5 times).

A Values based approach to sustainability
We see it as our responsibility to offer our talented 
and committed people sustainable and worthwhile 
employment where they can grow and thrive in a safe 
and secure environment. 
The Group takes its responsibilities as a 
business in its community seriously, creating 
sustainable employment within the industry 
for local communities across the UK. Several 
members of our senior leadership team play 
important roles with trade organisations and 
charities, so that as well as running our business 
they represent the interests of our customers 
and our industry to the trade bodies who 
influence Government. They will harness their 
access to these opinion formers and decision 
makers to lobby on behalf of our small business 
customers for fair and equitable treatment. 
We will fundamentally remain committed to 
sustainable growth for all our stakeholders: 
customers, Franchisees, suppliers, our people. 
Our culture and our values
It is through our people that our suppliers 
and customers see our business, its talent and 
its potential. Organisationally we have very 
purposefully lowered the centre of gravity to 
empower our people closest to the customer 
so they can focus on delighting our customers. 
We have put in place Employee Forums across 
all of our depots and support centres ensuring 
we listen to the views of our people and make any 
changes necessary to improve how we work. 
Our values are driven from our people across all 
of our business and they underpin how we work 
together to deliver our strategic goals. In the 
last year we have launched the values across 
the entire Group and we now see our values 
in action across every one of our ten depots 
and eight out-bases, our four support centres 
as well as our retail outlets and our teams 
operating out on location with customers ‚Äì 
work that we will continue to embed. We have 
appointed Values Champions, a group of 33 
employees who help us bring the values to life 
and champion the spirit of ‚ÄúOne Conviviality‚Äù. 
On 2 May 2017 the Values Champions created a 
celebratory event that took place in every one 
of our support centres and depots to launch the 
start of the financial year as One Conviviality. 
The values champions continue to work at the 
heart of the business to help make Conviviality 
a great place to work for everyone.
Conviviality believes in treating all employees 
fairly and equitably and is a champion of 
equal opportunities. As such, having brought 
together three large businesses a key element 
of our integration activity has to be to ensure 
all roles across the organisation are paid fairly 
and equitably across the group and relative to 
the external market. This full benchmarking and 
alignment exercise on pay is complete and has 
been communicated to all employees as part of 
the pay review process.
A further benefit of the benchmarking exercise 
into roles and pay is that we now have a robust 
database that enables us to understand the 
diversity of our workforce. Our workforce 
balance is split 1805 male and 876 female, 
and whilst there‚Äôs only a small pay differential 
between male and female employees of 2.5%, 
we remain committed to ensuring we have 
equal pay for equal roles with performance 
being the only differentiator on pay.
We recognise and reward positive behaviours 
and the performance of our people through 
our annual performance review process where 
every employee in the organisation has the 
opportunity to discuss their performance and 
their future career development with their line 
manager.

Apprenticeships
Apprenticeships provide an opportunity for us 
to develop and grow our talent locally. We have 
three apprentices across Group and we have 
two colleagues who have completed their two 
year apprentice programme and have secured

programmes are not just a way for us to find 
great people they also strengthen our links

Apprentices across the Group
Training
Our commitment to training and developing 
our people is part of what makes Conviviality 
special. We encourage employees to take 
professional qualifications for example in 
Finance, HR, Logistics and Marketing. We have 
17 team members completing AAT, ACCA, or 
CIMA qualifications. We also provide training 
and development in business and management 
skills as well as job skills at all levels. During 
the past year 84 employees took the WSET 
(Wine and Spirits Education Trust) courses as 
part of their career development. In addition 
more than 1,103 of our customers‚Äô employees 
also took WSET courses led by our expert and 
award winning trainers.
Community
Charitable Giving
We believe that our businesses and our people 
play an important role in the communities 
where we trade. All Conviviality businesses 
support charities as well as encourage and 
involve their people in charitable giving and 
in volunteering. During the last year more 
than 22 charities benefited from the support 
of Conviviality and over ¬£37,373 was donated. 
Conviviality specifically supports Cheshire 
Community Foundation and The Rainbow Trust 
which benefited through the year from ¬£14,049 
between them. Through the charity matching 
scheme for volunteering in Matthew Clark, over 
80 employees undertook activities for charity 
and ¬£6,000 was matched by the Company to 
the charity of their choice. For example eight 
employees from Direct and Trading took part 
in a sailing regatta which raised ¬£1000 for Brain 
Cancer and Team Margot. Conviviality further 
support our people in volunteering by allowing 
a paid day off for every employee to fundraise 
for charity.

Energy Efficiency
Conviviality is fully compliant with the ESOS 
regulations. Energy efficiency initiatives are in 
place across the business and have continued 
to reduce overall energy consumption by 5.4%. 
This is demonstrated with the commissioning 
of two new distribution centres both of 
which have high performance rigid thermoset 
insulation thermal conductivity as well as being 
BREAM ‚Äúvery good rating‚Äù. Conviviality has PIR 
activated lighting systems in place helping to 
reduce energy usage versus the prior year. The 
business is registered with the Carbon Trust. 
Waste and Recycling
Conviviality continues to work hard in reducing 
waste across the business. Our business has 
decreased waste sent to landfill by 13.66% 
with an increase of 8% of waste diverted from 
landfill. All our depots have recycling facilities 
for cardboard and plastic and all mixed waste is 
sent directly to a Materials Recycling Facility, so 
limiting the amount we send to landfill.
The eleven depots that are operated by 
Conviviality are accredited to the 18001 
Occupational Health and Safety standard. Four 
of depots have achieved the ISO 14001 standard 
which relates to environmental management 
and one depot has been accredited with the 
British Retail Counsel food safety standard.
The Strategic Report, as set out on pages 1 to 
41, has been approved by the Board.

Corporate governance report
Strong leadership team committed to driving growth
As an AIM-quoted company, the Group is not 
required to produce a corporate governance 
report nor comply with the requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. However, the 
Directors are committed to providing information 
on an open basis and present their Corporate 
Governance Report below:
The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises one Non-
Executive Chairman; one Non-Executive 
senior independent Director; two independant 
Non-Executive Directors and four Executive 
Directors, who are the Chief Executive, the 
Chief Financial Officer, the Managing Director 
of Conviviality Direct and the Managing 
Director of Conviviality Retail. 
The Non-Executive Directors demonstrate a 
range of experience and sufficient calibre to 
bring independent judgement on issues of 
strategy, financial performance, resources and 
standards of conduct, which are vital to the 
success of the Group.
The Board meets at regular intervals and is 
responsible for setting corporate strategy, 
approving the annual budget, reviewing 
financial performance, agreeing the renewal 
of and any new banking/treasury facilities, 
approving major items of capital expenditure 
and reviewing and approving acquisitions. The 
Board is provided with appropriate information 
in advance of Board meetings to enable it to 
discharge its duties effectively. The Chairman 
ensures that the Directors are able to take 
independent professional advice as required at 
the Company‚Äôs expense.
The number of meetings of the Board, and the 
attendance of Directors is set out to the right.

Renumeration committee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of 
David Adams as Chairman, Steve Wilson, Martin 
Newman and Ian Jones. The Committees policy 
and the details of each Director‚Äôs remuneration 
are clearly explained in its report on pages 54 
and in note 5 to the accounts. Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017       45
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
retiring Director shall, if willing, be deemed to 
have been reappointed unless it is expressly 
resolved not to fill the vacancy or a resolution 
for the reappointment of the Director is put to 
the meeting and lost.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining the Group‚Äôs system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
the Group‚Äôs strategic objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group and there is a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved for decision by the Board. 
Each year the Board approves the annual 
budget. Key risk areas are identified, reviewed 
and monitored. Performance is monitored 
against budget, relevant action is taken 
throughout the year and quarterly rolling 
forecasts are prepared. The reports reviewed 
by the Board include reports on operational as 
well as financial issues. 
Capital and development expenditure is 
regulated by a budgetary process and 
authorisation levels. For expenditure beyond 
specified levels, detailed written proposals 
have to be submitted to the Board for approval. 
Reviews are carried out after the purchase is 
complete. The Board requires management to 
explain any major deviations from authorised 
capital proposals and to seek further sanction 
from the Board. Due diligence work is carried 
out if a business is to be acquired.
Where the management of operational risk 
requires outside advice this is sought from 
expert consultants, and the Group receives this 
in the areas of employment law and health and 
safety management.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of 
the Groups system of internal controls and 
has considered the need for an internal audit 
function. At this stage the Board has decided 
that an internal audit function is not required 
as the Groups internal controls system in place 
is appropriate. The Board will keep this under 
review.
The Board also reviews the Group‚Äôs 
arrangements for its employees raising  
concerns, in confidence, about possible 
Audit committee
The Audit Committee is comprised of Steve 
Wilson as Chairman and David Adams. The 
meetings are also attended, by invitation, by 
the other Directors. The Audit Committee has 
met on two occasions during the year and once 
since year end.
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility 
for monitoring the quality of internal controls, 
ensuring that the financial performance of the 
Group is properly measured and reported on 
and for reviewing reports from the Group‚Äôs 
auditors relating to the Group‚Äôs accounting 
and financial reporting, in all cases having due 
regard to the interests of shareholders.
The Board has established a Risk Committee 
for which the Chairman is the Group Chief 
Financial Officer. The Risk Committee identifies, 
evaluates and manages risks faced by the 
Group. The Chairman of the Risk Committee 
reports the outcome of the Risk Committee 
meetings to the Plc Board. 
The Audit Committee also oversees the 
relationship with the external auditors including 
approval of remuneration levels, approval of 
terms of engagement and assessment of their 
independence and objectivity. In so doing 
they take into account UK professional and 
regulatory requirements and the relationship 
with the auditors as a whole, including the 
provision of non-audit services. KPMG LLP have 
been auditors to the Group since November 
2015.
Nomination committee
The Nomination Committee is comprised of 
David Adams as Chairman, Ian Jones, Steve 
Wilson and Martin Newman. The Committee 
identifies and nominates, for the approval of 
the Board, candidates to fill Board vacancies 
when they arise. The Committee meets at least 
once a year.
At each AGM of the Company, the articles of 
the Company require one-third of the Directors 
(or the number nearest to but not exceeding 
one-third when the number of Directors is not 
a multiple of three) to retire from office. Each 
such Director may, if eligible, offer themselves 
for re-election. The Company has adopted best 
practice by having all its directors stand for re 
appointment at each AGM.
If the Company, at the meeting at which a 
Director retires, does not fill the vacancy, the  46 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
wrongdoing in financial reporting or 
other matters. The Board ensures that 
such arrangements allow for independent 
investigation and follow-up action.
Board composition
Relationship with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given 
high priority. There is regular dialogue with 
major and/or institutional shareholders, 
including presentations after the Company‚Äôs 
announcements of the half-year and full-year 
results in February and July, respectively. 
Presentations are also made to analysts at 
those times to present the Group‚Äôs results and 
report on developments. This assists with the 
promotion of knowledge of the Group in the 
investment marketplace and with shareholders. 
The financial statements include a review of 
the business and future developments. These 
financial statements and other corporate news 
relating to the Group are also available on the 
Group‚Äôs website.
Following the half-year and year-end 
presentations of results, the Executive Directors 
report to the Board on the feedback received 
from analysts and shareholders. In addition, 
the Company‚Äôs Nominated Advisor produces 
a feedback report from those meetings which  
is made available to all Directors. The 
Executive Directors also report to the Board 
on any meetings with shareholders or 
institutional investors that may take place  
at other times of the year.
Corporate governance report
Continued
The Board encourages shareholder participation 
at its Annual General Meeting, where 
shareholders can be updated on the Group‚Äôs 
activities and plans.
Going concern
The Group‚Äôs business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are set 
out in the Strategic report. The financial position 
of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described within 
the Financial Review section of the Strategic 
report also. In addition, note 18 to the financial 
statements includes the Group‚Äôs objectives and 
policies of its financial risk management and 
details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities and its exposure to credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
The Directors have prepared cash flow 
forecasts for the period until April 2019. Based 
on these, the Directors confirm that there are 
sufficient cash reserves to fund the business for 
the period under review, and believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risk 
successfully. For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.

Remuneration Committee report
Remuneration Committee Chairman‚Äôs Letter
Dear Shareholders,
In my role as acting Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I am 
pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, the Remuneration 
Committee‚Äôs report for the year ended 30 April 2017. Following 
Jennifer Laing stepping down from the role, and the Board, 
during the year, we are undertaking a search for a replacement.
To continue to improve the transparency of our reporting, this 
year we have set out our remuneration report in the style of 
a main market listed company; this includes a Remuneration 
Policy report describing the principles behind our approach to 
Directors‚Äô Remuneration, and an Annual Report setting out how 
the policy has been implemented in this past year, and outlining 
our approach to the year ahead. As an AIM listed company we 
are not required to submit either section of our report to a vote 
at the upcoming AGM. However, we are committed to consulting 
with our shareholders, as evidenced by the consultations we 
have undertaken in this and in previous years.
As disclosed in last year‚Äôs report, following the transformational 
acquisitions of Matthew Clark and Bibendum PLB Group, the 
Committee sought to establish a clear Remuneration framework 
for directors. During this year, we have reviewed that framework 
and engaged in consultation with our major shareholders, 
holding around 60% of the share capital of the business, on two 
topics - executive bonus deferral, and the introduction of an 
extra level of potential LTIP, awarded in return for exceptional 
performance. 
Feedback from the consultation exercise was taken into 
account in our approach going forward in these two areas of 
remuneration. The key changes in the annual bonus deferral 
arrangements are a mandatory deferral of 25% of any bonus 
earned, the opportunity to defer up to 100% at the executive‚Äôs 
discretion, the introduction of an extra allocation of shares as an 
incentive to do so, and the introduction of a three year holding 
period. For the Long Term Incentive Plan we have introduced a 
‚Äúsuper stretch‚Äù target with a 20% higher award potential, taking 
the CEO award to a potential 150% of base salary and other 
executive directors to 120%. A two year holding period has been 
introduced on top of the three year vesting period. Full details 
of Annual Bonus and Long Term Incentive Plans are outlined in 
the report.
No retrospective changes were made as part of these 
amendments. We believe the changes made will act as a strong 
incentive for our talented executive team, encourage greater 
retention, and give greater alignment to shareholder interests.
We hope you find this report both clear and informative.

Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
Annual Bonus
Purpose Operation Opportunity Performance Metrics
To focus management on 
delivery of annual business 
priorities which tie into the 
long-term strategic objectives 
of the Company.
Performance measures, targets 
and weightings are set at the 
start of the year. At the end 
of the year, the Remuneration 
Committee determines the 
extent to which targets have 
been achieved.
At least 25% of any bonus 
earned must be delivered in 
shares, deferred for three years. 
Participants may voluntarily 
defer up to the remaining 75% 
of the bonus in shares and earn 
an uplift of 25% on voluntarily 
deferred shares, subject to 
continued employment and 
satisfaction of a performance 
underpin over the deferral 
period, to promote take-up 
and long-term executive share 
ownership. 
Dividends will accrue on shares 
over the deferral period.
Malus (on deferred shares) and 
clawback (on any bonus paid) 
provisions apply in the event of 
serious financial misstatement, 
miscalculation or gross 
misconduct, for a period of 
two years following bonus 
payment.
The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity for executive 
directors is up to 100% of 
salary in cash, or 118.75% if 
the bonus is deferred fully in 
shares for three years and the 
conditions for receiving the 
uplift are satisfied. 
Detailed and weighted 
role specific measures are 
established annually for 
each Executive Director. 
Performance, on a linear basis 
from Threshold to Stretch with 
reference to these measures, 
will determine actual Annual 
Bonus awards. No Bonus is 
payable for performance below 
Threshold. With reference 
to the maximum Annual 
Bonus award opportunity for 
each Executive Director as a 
percentage of salary, 100% 
of maximum is payable for 
the achievement of Stretch 
performance; 60% of maximum 
for T arget performance and 30% 
for Threshold performance.
Performance is measured 
annually against a combination 
of financial measures and 
personal and strategic 
objectives.
Financial measures may include, 
but are not limited to, earnings 
per share, free cash flow, 
revenue, EBITDA, net debt, 
etc. Measures will be weighted 
appropriately each year 
according to business priorities. 
Personal and strategic objectives 
are set annually to reinforce the 
Group‚Äôs strategic plan. 
Overall pay-out under the 
annual bonus may be subject to 
additional underpins, determined 
by the Committee at the start of 
the financial year. 
Vesting of the uplift shares on 
voluntarily deferral is subject 
to continued employment and 
satisfaction of a performance 
underpin, determined by 
the Committee. For the first 
cycle the underpin is the LTIP 
Threshold EPS requirement for 
the relevant 3-year period.
The Committee has discretion 
in exceptional circumstances 
to adjust the formulaic bonus 
outcomes within the plan limits 
to ensure alignment of pay 
with performance and ensure 
fairness to both shareholders 
and participants. Any such 
adjustments would be fully 
explained in the Directors‚Äô 
Remuneration Report.
Advisors
During the year, the Committee appointed Kepler, a brand of Mercer (Kepler), part of the MMC group of companies, to 
provide independent advice on executive remuneration matters. Kepler was appointed by the Committee following 
a competitive selection process, through which the Committee has satisfied itself that Kepler‚Äôs advice is objective 
and independent. Kepler is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants in the UK, details of 
which can be found on the Remuneration Consulting Group‚Äôs website at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
Services provided by Kepler included advice on remuneration packages for executives and assistance with a review 
of their incentive arrangements, drafting the Director‚Äôs Remuneration Report, as well as other ad-hoc advice related 
to remuneration. The Committee evaluates the support provided by Kepler annually and is comfortable that they do 
not have any connections with Conviviality that may impair their independence. Other than advice on remuneration, 
no other services were provided by Kepler (or any other part of the MMC group of companies) to the Group.
Directors‚Äô remuneration policy
In this section of the report we outline the policy for directors‚Äô remuneration at Conviviality Plc. The Committee has 
sought to establish a remuneration framework that is strongly aligned to the interests of shareholders and the needs, 
values and strategy of the Group. The framework recognises the Company‚Äôs need to recruit, retain and appropriately 
incentivise high calibre colleagues to deliver the strategy set by the Board. 50 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Base salary
Benefits
Long Term Incentive Plan 
Pension
Purpose Operation Opportunity Performance Metrics
To recognise the individual‚Äôs 
skills and experience and to 
provide a competitive base 
reward that helps us attract 
and retain a high calibre 
executive team to execute  
our strategy.
To provide appropriately 
competitive market benefits.
To drive sustained long-term 
performance that supports 
the creation of shareholder 
value.
To provide an opportunity for 
executives to build up income 
on retirement.
Base salaries are reviewed 
annually, taking into account 
individual performance, 
experience, market 
competitiveness and average 
increases across the Group. 
Benefits typically consist of 
a car allowance or provision 
of driver, as appropriate, life 
assurance, and private medical 
insurance. Other benefits may 
be offered including, but not 
limited to, travel, relocation and 
employee shares schemes.
Under the long-term incentive 
plan (LTIP) annual awards 
of shares or nil-cost options 
may be made to participants. 
Award levels and performance 
conditions are reviewed before 
each award cycle to ensure 
they remain appropriate.
Awards made under the LTIP 
will have a performance period 
of at least three years. Any 
vested shares will be subject to 
an additional holding period of 
up to two years.
Dividends will accrue over 
the vesting period (and any 
holding period), but will only 
be paid on shares which vest.
Nil-cost options may be 
exercised between the date of 
vesting and within 10 years of 
the date of grant.
Malus and clawback provisions 
apply for a period of two years 
following LTIP vesting. 
All Executives are either 
members of the pension 
scheme or receive a cash 
allowance in lieu of pension.
It is anticipated that 
percentage salary increases 
will generally be in line with 
employees across the Group. 
Increases may be above this 
level if there is a material 
increase in the scale, scope, 
market rate or responsibilities 
of the role.
Benefits vary by role and 
individual circumstances; 
eligibility and cost is reviewed 
periodically.
Awards under the LTIP may 
be up to 250% of salary in 
exceptional circumstances. 
Annual awards will normally 
be 150% of salary for the CEO 
and 120% of salary for other 
executive directors. 
No LTIP will vest for 
performance below Threshold, 
25% of maximum will vest 
at Threshold, 50% at Target, 
83.3% at Stretch and 100% at 
Super-Stretch, with straight-
line vesting between each.
Details of the EPS targets to 
be used in the FY18 - FY20 
LTIP grants are included on 
page 57.
Executive directors receive a 
pension contribution of up to 
15% of salary or an equivalent 
cash allowance.
Individual and business 
performance are considerations 
in setting base salary.

Vesting of LTIP awards is subject 
to continued employment and 
performance against metrics 
defined by the Committee at the 
start of each award cycle. 
Overall vesting under the LTIP 
may be subject to additional 
underpins, determined by the 
Committee prior to the grant of 
each award.
For FY18, the LTIP will be based 
on EPS growth. Vesting is also 
subject to the Committee being 
satisfied that the recorded EPS 
outcome reflects underlying 
business performance, 
taking into account factors 
including the Company‚Äôs TSR 
performance.
Details of the targets to be

Notes to the policy table
Shareholding guidelines
Executive directors are expected to build up a shareholding of 100% of salary (200% of salary 
for the CEO) within five years of appointment or the introduction of this guideline (whichever 
is later), to help align executive shareholders‚Äô interests. Details of executive directors‚Äô current 
shareholdings are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Legacy schemes
The Committee will honour the payment of any outstanding schemes to executive directors, 
which were granted prior to the implementation of this policy or before the director joined the 
Board, including but not limited to the following legacy schemes for current executive directors:
Joint Share Ownership (‚ÄúJSOP‚Äù)
In respect of vested options granted by Conviviality Plc in respect of shares which are held by 
Bargain Booze EBT Trustees Limited (‚ÄúEBT‚Äù), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, such 
shares were made subject of a Joint Share Ownership (‚ÄúJSOP‚Äù) arrangement whereby the 
applicable executive and the EBT jointly own the relevant shares, with certain rights accruing to 
the relevant executive, including the right to dividends declared on such shares. This arrangement 
applies to 896,809 shares held by the EBT, of which 826,809 are jointly held by Diana Hunter and 
70,000 are jointly held by Andrew Humphreys. No further joint share ownership arrangements 
are anticipated to be made to executive directors.
Employee Share Option Plan (‚ÄúESOP‚Äù)
Prior to the introduction of the LTIP, awards were made under the ESOP to executive directors. 
Awards were subject to performance and continued employment. Andrew Humphreys has three 
ESOP awards that are outstanding, performance targets for which have been met in full, and 
which are due to vest in September 2017. Following the introduction of the LTIP no further awards 
are anticipated to be made to executive directors under the ESOP. 
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting
The measures used under the annual bonus plan are selected annually to reflect business priorities. 
Financial targets are set with reference to market expectations and internal budgets. 
The Committee selected Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the LTIP and the uplift on voluntary bonus 
deferral as it is well-aligned with shareholders‚Äô interests, and can be translated into measures which 
provide good line-of-sight to all LTIP participants. The discretionary underpin on LTIP vesting, 
which takes into account factors including the Company‚Äôs TSR performance, further reinforces 
alignment with shareholders. EPS targets are reviewed in advance of grant, and take account of 
a number of internal and external reference points, including Conviviality plc‚Äôs strategic plan and 
broker forecasts.
Remuneration policy for other employees
Conviviality‚Äôs approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration 
given to the level of accountability, experience, individual performance plus salary comparisons 
internally and externally. 
Over 2,000 employees are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme with similar metrics 
to those used for the executive directors. 
Approximately 40 Senior Managers are eligible to participate in the LTIP. Performance conditions 
are broadly consistent for all participants.
The Company has now extended the invitation to all employees with more than 6 months service 
to participate in a Share Incentive Plan (SIP). There are 3 elements to this plan:
 - Partnership Shares whereby employees can use pre-tax salary to purchase shares;
 - Matching Shares whereby Partnership Shares are matched for free by the Company;
 - Performance Shares whereby employees can receive shares through an annual scheme based 
on Company performance. 52 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Service contracts and treatment for leavers and change of control
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully 
considered by the Committee. Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract 
requiring 12 months‚Äô notice of termination on either side. Such contracts contain no specific 
provision for compensation for loss of office, other than an obligation to pay for any notice period 
waived by the Company, where pay is defined as salary only. Each of the executive directors has 
agreed to confidentiality undertakings, without limitation as to time, and have agreed to non-
compete, non-solicitation and non-dealing restrictive covenants that apply for a period consistent 
with individual notice periods following termination of employment with the Group. The Company 
may reimburse reasonable legal costs in connection with a termination of employment, if the 
Committee considers it appropriate. Executive Director service contracts are available to view at 
the Company‚Äôs registered office.
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews incentive outcomes to ensure they are 
fair to both shareholders and participants. On leaving, current year annual bonus and unvested 
LTIP awards normally lapse, unless a participant is considered a ‚Äògood leaver‚Äô
1
, in which case 
bonuses and/or unvested LTIP awards will be paid only to the extent that performance conditions 
set at the beginning of the period have been met. Any resulting incentive payments will be pro-
rated for time served during the year.
Deferred bonus shares paid in respect of a previous year would normally be released at the end of 
the normal deferral period. Any dividends and uplift shares on voluntary deferral would normally 
lapse unless the individual is a good leaver
1
, in which case the dividends and uplift shares would 
vest at the usual time, subject to performance and time pro-rating, with Committee discretion to 
treat otherwise.
The Committee retains discretion to accelerate vesting in exceptional circumstances, e.g. in the 
event of death, based on a reasonable estimate of the extent to which any performance condition 
has been met at that time. In the event of a change of control, awards may alternatively be 
exchanged for new equivalent awards in the acquirer, if appropriate. The final treatment of any 
award remains subject to the Committee‚Äôs discretion.

Implementation of Executive Director‚Äôs remuneration policy for FY18
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually, with reference to salary levels for similar roles of comparable 
size and complexity in the market, taking into account the individual contribution of each executive 
director. On this basis, the Committee approved the following base salary increases for FY18. 
     Percentage 
Executive Director FY17 base salary FY18 base salary   increase
D Hunter ¬£450,000 ¬£456,750   1.5%
C A Humphreys ¬£300,000 ¬£304,500   1.5%
M T Aylwin ¬£375,000 ¬£380,625   1.5%
D P Robinson ¬£365,000 ¬£370,475   1.5%
Pension and Benefits
Executive Directors will continue to receive a pension contribution of 15% of salary or an equivalent 
cash allowance. 
In addition, Executive Directors are eligible for a car or equivalent allowance, private medical 
insurance and life assurance.
Annual Bonus
For FY18 executive directors‚Äô annual bonus opportunities as a % of salary are unchanged. 
Performance will be measured 50% against financial measures, including sales, EBITDA, EPS, 
free cash flow and net debt. For Diana Hunter and Andrew Humphreys financial measures will 
be based on Group targets and for Mark Aylwin and David Robinson, they will be based on an 
equal combination of Group and relevant Business Unit targets. 25% of awards will be based 
on individual targets focused on ensuring the future performance and delivery of the change 
programme and the remaining 25% will be based on personal objectives. The overall payout of 
the bonus will continue to be subject to achieving Threshold EPS for the Group. 
For FY18 a change is being made to bonus deferral arrangements 25% of any bonuses paid in 
respect of FY18 will be mandatorily deferred in shares for three years. Executive directors may 
voluntarily choose to defer up to the remaining 75% in shares and earn a 25% uplift on voluntarily 
deferred shares, subject to continued employment and achievement of the LTIP Threshold EPS 
for the Group for the relevant 3-year period (see below for details).
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
A grant will be made by the Autumn of 2017 to approximately 40 Senior Managers in total, 
including the four executive directors.
As described earlier in this Report, the Committee reviewed the maximum long-term incentive 
opportunity available to executive directors in normal circumstances and determined to increase 
this by 20% to a typical award of 150% of salary for the CEO and 120% of salary for the other 
executive directors for additional performance. In order to receive the additional 20% uplift, 
executive directors will be required to achieve a ‚Äòsuper-stretch‚Äô EPS requirement, to ensure that 
the overall cost to the company is more than funded through the higher performance required 
for the award.
Awards will vest after three years in accordance with the performance conditions outlined in 
the table below and the Committee being satisfied that TSR performance has been satisfactory 
over the period. To ensure that the increase in award size is funded through higher performance, 
the Committee has introduced a new ‚Äúsuper-stretch‚Äù performance level for maximum vesting of 
awards. No award will vest below Threshold performance and vesting will increase on a straight-
line basis between defined levels of performance. Any vested awards will be subject to an 
additional two-year holding period. Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017       57

Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
Governance
The Directors acknowledge the importance 
of the principles set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012 is not compulsory 
for AIM-quoted companies and has not been 
complied with. However, the Directors apply the 
principles as considered appropriate given the 
size and nature of the Company in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 
and the QCA Corporate Governance Code for 
Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies 2013.
On 9 May 2016 the Board was further 
strengthened by the appointment of Mark 
Aylwin, Jennifer Laing and, on 1 July 2016, by the 
appointment of David Robinson. Jennifer Laing 
resigned during the period and ceased to be a 
director on 30 April 2017 and a replacement is 
currently being sought. The Company intends 
to operate with nine Directors, of which four 
are Executive Directors and five will be Non-
Executive Directors. The Board reflects a blend 
of different experience and backgrounds (see 
Directors‚Äô profiles on pages 42 and 43) and 
meets every 6 weeks to consider strategy, 
performance and the effectiveness of internal 
controls amongst other things.
At each AGM of the Company, the Company‚Äôs 
articles of association require that one-third 
of the Directors (or the number nearest to but 
not exceeding one-third when the number 
of Directors is not a multiple of three) shall 
retire from office and stand for reappointment 
by shareholders, however, the Company has 
elected to adopt best practice and have all 
directors stand for reappointment at each 
annual general meeting. 
If the Company, at the meeting at which a 
Director retires, does not fill the vacancy, the 
retiring Director shall, if willing, be deemed to 
have been reappointed unless it is expressly 
resolved not to fill the vacancy or a resolution 
for the reappointment of the Director is put to 
the meeting and lost. 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Steve 
Wilson and has primary responsibility for 
monitoring the quality of internal controls, 
ensuring that the financial performance of the 
Group is properly measured and reported on 
and reviewing reports from the Company‚Äôs 
auditor relating to the Group‚Äôs accounting 
and internal controls, in all cases having due 
regard to the interests of the shareholders. The 
Committee meets at least twice a year, with 
David Adams being the other Audit Committee 
member. The Audit Committee has established 
a Risk Committee chaired by the Group Chief 
Financial Officer to manage the Group‚Äôs risks 
and report to the Plc Board. 
The Nomination Committee is chaired by 
David Adams and identifies and nominates, 
for the approval of the Board, candidates to fill 
Board vacancies as and when they arise. The 
Committee meets at least once a year, with Ian 
Jones, Steve Wilson and Martin Newman being 
the other Committee members.
The Remuneration Committee was chaired by 
Jennifer Laing from 12 September 2017 until 
her resignation on 30 April 2017 at which point 
David Adams became acting Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration 
Committee reviews the performance of the 
Executive Directors and determines their 
terms and conditions of service, including their 
remuneration and the grant of options, having 
due regard to the interests of shareholders. The 
Committee meets at least once a year, with Ian 
Jones, Martin Newman and Steve Wilson being 
the other Committee members. 
Executive Directors are invited to attend 
Committee meetings as required from time  
to time.
The Directors understand the importance 
of complying with the AIM Rules relating to 
Directors‚Äô dealings and have established a 
share dealing code which is appropriate for an 
AIM-quoted company.
Control environment
The Directors are responsible for the internal 
controls of the Group and have established 
a framework intended to provide reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material 
financial misstatement or loss.
An annual budget is prepared against which 
specific objectives and targets are set. This 
budget is reviewed and approved by the 
Board on a regular basis, with trading activity 
monitored weekly and internal management 
accounts prepared and reviewed monthly, with 
comparisons against the latest plan and prior 
year. The Group will continue to review and 
develop operating documentation and controls 
as the business develops. 60 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Health and safety
The Group is committed to high standards in 
health, safety and environmental performance. 
It is the Group‚Äôs policy to abide by all laws, 
directives and regulations relevant to its 
operations and to act in a manner so as to 
minimise the effects of its operations on the 
environment. The Group seeks to provide 
safe places and systems of work, plant and 
machinery and handling of materials and 
ensures appropriate information, instruction 
and training is in place. The Group has 
procedures relating to the appropriate reporting 
and monitoring of accidents, incidents and 
dangerous occurrences and employees are 
encouraged to identify and report on any 
potential policy breach to ensure preventative 
actions are taken to avoid any unsafe work 
practices. Emphasis is placed on all employees 
having a responsibility to maintain a safe 
working environment. 
Financial risk management
Financial risk is managed through a formal 
quarterly update by the Board and informally 
on an ongoing basis. The key risks relating to 
the Group are outlined in more detail in note 18 
to the consolidated financial statements.
Regulatory
The Group‚Äôs Risk Committee is responsible 
for monitoring, controlling and ensuring all 
regulatory obligations are complied with on an 
ongoing basis.
Responsible retailing
The Group acknowledges that alcohol misuse 
and underage drinking are issues causing real 
concern. The Group takes these matters very 
seriously and is committed to the responsible 
retailing of alcohol in order to mitigate their 
impact. The Group is a supporter of Drinkaware, 
the government sponsored trust that promotes 
responsible drinking and, in addition, the Group 
operates the Challenge 25 scheme to ensure 
that minors are not able to purchase alcohol in 
our stores. Responsible retailing is re-enforced 
through awareness training for both our 
employees and Franchisees. We insist on high 
levels of training for Franchisees and regular 
store audits. We believe that our independent 
Franchisee retailers take their responsibilities 
very seriously and, through their excellent local 
community links, are in a strong position to 
exercise responsible retailing effectively.

Statement of Directors‚Äô responsibilities
In respect of the Annual Report, the Strategic Report, the Directors‚Äô Report and the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Strategic Report, the Directors‚Äô Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. As required 
by the AIM rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required 
to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‚ÄòIFRS‚Äô) as adopted 
by the European Union and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the parent company 
and of their profit or loss that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 - Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 - Make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 - State whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
 - Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company‚Äôs transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information including on the 
company‚Äôs web site. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
By order of the Board

Auditor and disclosure of 
information to auditor
Each Director in office at the date of approval 
of this report has confirmed that:
 - So far as he/she is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company‚Äôs 
auditors are unaware; and
 - He/she has taken all reasonable steps that 
he/she ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company‚Äôs auditors are aware of 
that information.
In accordance with Section 489 of the 
Companies Act 2006, a resolution will be 
proposed at the AGM that KPMG LLP will be 
re-appointed as auditors.

stated.
Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the 52 week period ended 30 April 2017 have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (‚ÄúIFRS‚Äù) 
and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
consolidated financial information has been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical 
cost convention.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the period until April 2019. Based on these, the 
Directors confirm that there are sufficient cash reserves and available working capital facilities to fund the 
business for the period under review, and believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risk 
successfully. The Group is forecasted to be cash generative going forward. For this reason they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Restatements
On 7 October 2015 the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Matthew Clark (Holdings) Limited. 
As of 1 May 2016, management had not finalised the fair value assessment of certain of Matthew Clark‚Äôs 
assets and liabilities and as a result the 2016 results reflected the provisional assessment of the fair values 
as at the acquisition date. During the period ended 30 April 2017, management identified an additional 
fair value adjustment. A provision of ¬£5,824,000 was identified with a corresponding deferred tax asset 
of ¬£1,779,000. This generated additional goodwill of ¬£4,045,000. The balance sheet and applicable 
notes have been restated to reflect the above changes. Further details are given in note 28 Business 
Combinations.
In addition, management have changed the classification of retrospective sales rebates, listing fees and 
franchise fees in the income statement. In the prior period retrospective sales rebates of ¬£22,056,000 were 
treated as a cost of sale. Management now believe it is more appropriate to recognise these rebates as 
a reduction to revenue. In the prior period listing fees of ¬£3,443,000 were recognised within cost of sales, 
management now believe it is more appropriate to recognise these fees within revenue. Franchise fees 
of ¬£2,024,000 were previously recognised as other operating income; these have been reclassified as 
revenue. The prior year comparative income statement and applicable notes have also been restated to 
reflect the above changes.
The classification of cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement has been amended to 
exclude the receivables financing facility. The impact of the change is to increase the cash and cash 
equivalents reported in the prior period by ¬£20,255,000 and to decrease the repayment of borrowings by 
¬£20,255,000. The prior year comparative cash flow statement and applicable notes have been restated to 
reflect these changes. There is no change in net debt as a result of the restatement.
Basis of consolidation
The financial information comprises a consolidation of the financial information of Conviviality Plc and all 
its subsidiaries. The financial period ends of all Group entities are coterminous.
Subsidiaries are all entities to which the Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its 
involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
subsidiary. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017       69
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
2. Accounting Policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated except to the extent they provide evidence of impairment 
of the asset transferred.
The Group operates an Employee Benefit Trust (‚ÄòEBT‚Äô) and a Franchisee Incentive Trust (‚ÄòFIT‚Äô) for the 
purposes of acquiring shares to fund share awards made to employees and Franchisees respectively. The 
assets and liabilities of these trusts have been included in the consolidated financial information. The cost 
of purchasing own shares held by the EBT and FIT are accounted for in other reserves. 
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost 
of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, 
liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued. 
Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, are recognised at the fair 
values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the 
Group‚Äôs share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
Acquisition costs are expensed to the income statement and are included within exceptional items.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement. 
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Although these estimates are based on management‚Äôs best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, 
actual events ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances.
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting 
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial information are considered to relate to:
a. Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-
generating units (‚ÄòCGU‚Äô) to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires 
management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate present value. The estimation of the timing and value of underlying projected 
cash flows and selection of appropriate discount rates involves management judgement. Subsequent 
changes to these estimates or judgements may impact the carrying value of the goodwill, which as at 
30 April 2017 was ¬£210,994,000 (note 11). Other intangible assets, including brand names and customer 
bases, have been valued at fair value using the relief from royalty valuation method for brand names 
and the mutli-period excess earnings (MEEM) valuation method for customer bases. The estimation 
of royalty rates, future cash-flows and customer attrition rates required for these methods involves 
management judgement. 
b. Impairment of trade receivables
The assessments undertaken in recognising provisions and contingencies have been made in 
accordance with IAS 39. A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all outstanding amounts in full due to 
the receivables being classified as ‚Äòbad‚Äô or there are indications that the collection is ‚Äòdoubtful‚Äô. The 
amount of any loss is recognised in the income statement within cost of sales. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited against cost of sales in the income statement. The gross 
amount of trade receivables at 30 April 2017 was ¬£186,962,000 and the associated provision was 
¬£2,779,000 (note 14). 70 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
2. Accounting Policies continued
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued
c. Share options
The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation 
model (Black-Scholes pricing model), consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model 
chosen, and the estimation of the number of awards that will ultimately vest. The key assumptions are 
on expected life of share options, volatility of share price, the risk free yield to maturity and expected 
dividend yield. The total charge for equity and cash settled share based payments for the financial 
period was ¬£2,923,000 (note 27).
d. Provisions and contingent consideration
The recognition and measurement of provisions and contingent consideration require management 
judgement to assess the likelihood and magnitude of the future outflow of resources and payments of 
consideration.
e. Acquisition accounting and fair values
Acquisition accounting and fair value adjustments require management judgement to assess the 
identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed to ensure they are 
recognised at the fair values at the acquisition date.
f. Classification of exceptional items 
The classification of items as exceptional requires management judgement to assess whether the 
particular items, which by virtue of their scale and nature, are appropriate to be separately classified as 
exceptional items within the income statement.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision-maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer.
Foreign currency translation
a. Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial information of each of the Group‚Äôs entities are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‚Äòthe functional currency‚Äô). 
The consolidated financial information is presented in Sterling, which is the Company‚Äôs and its 
subsidiaries‚Äô functional and presentation currency.
b. Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the reporting date are translated at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses arising on translation are recognised in the income statement for the period 
except for differences arising on qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are 
retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was 
determined.

2. Accounting Policies continued
Revenue
Revenue relates to the wholesale supply of goods in the UK to the On-Trade and Off-Trade markets, and 
is recognised when the significant risks and benefits of ownership of the product has been transferred 
to the buyer. Revenue is the total amount receivable by the Group for goods supplied excluding VAT. 
Revenue is recognised net of discounts and retrospective rebates to customers.
Wholesale revenue is recognised on delivery of the product to the customer. Retail revenue generated by 
company owned stores is recognised at the point of sale to the customer. Events revenue is generated 
through the operation of temporary bars at events and is recognised as the event occurs.
Fees for the provision of continuing services to Franchisees (e.g. IT support, marketing, training etc.) are 
recognised as revenue in the consolidated income statement as the services are rendered. Initial fees are 
recognised as revenue when performance of all the initial services and other obligations required of the 
franchisor have been substantially accomplished.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales represent the cost to the Group of the product sold. It consists of all external costs incurred 
in procuring goods for resale and delivering them to the distribution warehouses, together with any 
adjustments to inventory and any bad debt expense.
Supplier income
Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts, collectively known as ‚Äòsupplier income‚Äô, are recognised on an 
accruals basis as they are earned for each relevant supplier contract within cost of sales. The accrued 
value at the reporting date is included in accrued income.
The most common types of supplier income which the Group receives are:
 - Retrospective discounts typically based on an agreed sum per item sold on promotion for a period
 - Fixed amounts agreed with suppliers to support specific promotions
 - Supplier rebates typically based on sales targets on an annual calendar year basis
Operating costs
Operating costs consist of distribution costs, administrative expenses, head office costs, and the costs 
associated with running corporately owned stores.
Financing income and expenses
Financing expenses comprise interest payable and finance leases recognised in the consolidated income 
statement account using the effective interest method. Financing income comprises interest receivable on 
funds invested. Interest income and interest payable is recognised in the consolidated income statement 
as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs 
attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use.
Land is deemed to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. 
Depreciation is recognised on a straight-line basis to write down the cost less estimated residual value of 
buildings, plant and equipment, and motor vehicles. The following useful lives are applied:
Leasehold buildings Shorter of lease term and 50 years
Plant and equipment 2 to 15 years
Motor vehicles 3 years
The assets‚Äô residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each reporting date.  72 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
2. Accounting Policies continued
Property, plant and equipment continued
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset 
are classified as finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of 
the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease 
are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets
a. Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group‚Äôs share of 
the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or businesses at the date of acquisition. Goodwill 
is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. A CGU is identified at the lowest 
aggregation of assets that generate largely independent cash inflows, and that which is reviewed by 
management for monitoring and managing the business. The Group‚Äôs CGUs are Bargain Booze, Wine 
Rack, Matthew Clark (Holdings), Peppermint Events, Bibendum PLB Group and KMD Enterprises.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of 
the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. The recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset or CGU‚Äôs fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Any impairment is 
recognised immediately in the income statement and is not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal 
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous 
UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. 
b. Other intangible assets
Brand names and customer base: Brand names and customer bases acquired in a business 
combination that qualify for separate recognition are recognised as intangible assets at their fair values. 
The fair values have been calculated using the relief from royalty method for brand names and the 
multi-period excess earnings method (MEEM) for customer bases. 
Internally developed software: Expenditure on the research phase of projects to develop new 
customised software for IT and telecommunication systems is recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly attributable to a project‚Äôs development phase are recognised as intangible 
assets, provided they meet the following criteria:
 - the development cost can be measured reliably;
 - the project is technically feasible and viable;
 - the Group intends to, and has sufficient resources to, complete the project;
 - the Group has the ability to use or sell the software; and
 - the software is expected to generate probable future economic benefits.
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. 
Intangible assets arising on acquisition of subsidiaries or businesses are recognised separately from 
goodwill if the fair value of these assets can be identified separately and measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. 
The useful life of the Group‚Äôs intangible assets is 5 years to 20 years for brands and customer bases, 
and 5 years for other intangibles which are predominately software.
Impairment reviews are carried out if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value of an asset may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement when the 
asset‚Äôs carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. Its recoverable amount is the higher of an asset‚Äôs 
fair value less costs to sell or value in use. Impairment losses are not reversed.
Notes to the financial statements

Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
2. Accounting Policies continued
Inventory
Inventory comprises goods held for resale which are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is calculated using the first in, first out method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Provision is made for slow moving 
and obsolete stock if required. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less any provision for impairment. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all outstanding amounts in full due to the receivables being classified as ‚Äòbad‚Äô or there are 
indications that collection is ‚Äòdoubtful‚Äô.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount 
of the loss is recognised in the income statement within cost of sales. When a trade receivable is 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against cost of sales in the income statement.
Other receivables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at 
amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term 
highly liquid investments maturing within three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services which have been acquired in the commercial 
operations of the Group. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one 
year. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability. 
Dividends
Interim dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid. Final 
dividends on ordinary shares are recognised when they have been approved by the shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Operating leases
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded in the statement of financial position. Rental 
payments are charged directly to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Any 
lease incentives, primarily up-front cash payments or rent-free periods, are capitalised and spread over the 
period of the lease term.  74 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
2. Accounting Policies continued
Leases continued
Finance leases
Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are 
shown in short term and long term borrowings. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the 
finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each 
period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability.
Employee Benefit Trust
The assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) have been included in the Group accounts. 
The assets of the EBT are held separately from those of the company. Any assets held by the EBT cease 
to be recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position when the assets vest unconditionally 
in identified beneficiaries.
Finance cost and administrative expenses of the EBT are recorded in the company‚Äôs income statement 
where material; gains and losses on the purchase, sales, issue or cancellation of the company‚Äôs own shares 
are recorded as movements on reserves. Neither the purchase nor sale of own shares leads to a gain or 
loss being recognised in the Group consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Investments in the company‚Äôs own shares held by the EBT are presented as a deduction from reserves 
and any dividend income received by the EBT is deducted from the aggregate of dividends paid and 
proposed. The number of such shares held by the EBT is deducted from the number of shares in issue 
when calculating earnings per share.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises of current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income 
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income 
or in equity. In this case, the tax is recognised directly in other comprehensive income or in equity.
a. Current taxation
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates and 
laws enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to 
interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid 
to the tax authorities.
b. Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised using the statement of financial position liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the 
historical financial information. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will 
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right 
to set off current assets against current liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
Pension costs
The Group operates a stakeholder defined contribution pension scheme. The total expense recognised in 
the income statement represents contributions payable to the fund by the Group as specified in the rules 
of the scheme. 
Notes to the financial statements
Continued Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017       75
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
2. Accounting Policies continued
Exceptional items
The Group classifies certain items as exceptional where they possess a high degree of abnormality which 
arise from events or transactions that fall outside the ordinary activities of the Group and which are not 
expected to recur.
The Directors apply judgement in assessing the particular items, which by virtue of their scale and nature, 
should be classified as exceptional items. The Directors consider that separate disclosure of these items is 
relevant to an understanding of the Group‚Äôs financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair 
value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, 
recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a 
recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss 
on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion 
of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity and cash settled share-based payments to certain employees and Franchisees. 
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non-market based 
vesting conditions, at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date, is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group‚Äôs estimate of the shares that will eventually 
vest, and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The expected useful life used in the models 
has been adjusted, based on management‚Äôs best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations. For cash settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the portion of 
the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each reporting date. 
National Insurance is accrued periodically in line with the share-based payment charge.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
 - ‚ÄòShare capital‚Äô represents the nominal value of equity shares;
 - ‚ÄòShare premium‚Äô represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for 
equity shares, net of expenses of the share issue;
 - ‚ÄòShare based payment reserve‚Äô represents the IFRS 2 ‚ÄúShare-based payment‚Äù charge for the year;
 - ‚ÄòOther reserves‚Äô incorporates movement in the Group‚Äôs EBT and the hedging reserve created for the 
interest rate hedge;
 - ‚ÄòRetained earnings‚Äô represents cumulative retained earnings. 76 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
2. Accounting Policies continued
New standards and interpretations
The following amendments to accounting standards and interpretations, issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), have been adopted for the first time by the Group in the period with 
no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position:
 - Disclosure Initiative ‚Äì Amendments to IAS1
 - Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 ‚Äì 2014 Cycle
 - Amendments to IAS16 and IAS28 ‚ÄòClarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and 
Amortisation‚Äô
 - Amendments to IFRS11 ‚ÄòAccounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations‚Äô
 - Amendments to IFRS10, IFRS12 and IAS28 ‚ÄòInvestment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception‚Äô
IFRS 9 ‚ÄòFinancial Instruments‚Äô is expected to be applicable after 1 January 2018. If endorsed, this standard 
will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes, but it is not anticipated to have 
a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 15 ‚ÄòRevenue from Contracts with Customers‚Äô is expected for periods that commence on or after 1 
January 2018. The standard will replace IAS18 Revenue and IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. The 
standard introduces a new revenue recognition model that recognises revenue either at a point in time or 
over a period of time. The model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine 
whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. The Group is currently undertaking an impact 
assessment of the likely effect on the Group‚Äôs consolidated results and financial position.
IFRS 16 Leases is effective for periods that commence on or after 1 January 2019 and will significantly 
affect the presentation of the Group financial statements with all leases apart from short term leases being 
recognised as on-balance sheet finance leases with a corresponding liability being the present value 
of lease payments. IFRS 16 is also expected to have a material impact on key components within the 
Consolidated Income Statement as operating lease rental charges will be replaced with depreciation and 
finance costs. The Group is currently undertaking an impact assessment of the likely effect on the Group‚Äôs 
consolidated results and financial position.
The Group continued to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which 
may be endorsed and require adoption by the Group in future reporting periods. The Group does not 
consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet 
applicable, will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
3. Segment information
The Group‚Äôs activities consist of the wholesale and retail distribution of beers, wines, spirits, tobacco, 
grocery and confectionery within the United Kingdom to both the On-Trade and Off-Trade markets. The 
Chief Executive Officer is considered to be the chief operating decision maker (‚ÄúCODM‚Äù). 
Each trading division within Conviviality Plc wholesales to businesses that retail alcohol via stores, pubs, bars, 
restaurants and events. The performance of each division is therefore driven by the UK market for alcohol 
consumption, which is a single market with a single set of economic characteristics and risks. In addition 
90% of the Group‚Äôs sales are of the same products and the sales process is similar in each division and is 
serviced by a single supply chain. Consequently, all activities are reported as one segment. To assist with the 
understanding of performance, however, an analysis of sales is disclosed for each of the business units.

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 17% 
(effective from 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 and 6 September 2016 
respectively. The reductions in rate will reduce the company‚Äôs future tax charge accordingly and the 
relevant deferred tax balances have been re-measured with consideration to the reduction in rate to 17%  
in accordance with the rates enacted at the balance sheet date. 82 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Other acquisitions in the period relate to a number of individual smaller store acquisitions for a total 
cash consideration of ¬£396,000 (2016: ¬£796,000) all of which has been recognised as goodwill. When 
purchasing individual stores the Group is purchasing both the trade and assets of the store.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected 
to benefit from that business combination or are established as a result of the business combination. The 
carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
 2017 2016
 ¬£000 ¬£000

Wine Rack 720 720

Peppermint Events 7,456 7,456
Bibendum PLB Group 30,488 -
KMD Enterprises 2,619 -
 210,994 177,491
Goodwill as at 1 May 2016 has been restated due to an increase of ¬£5,824,000 in an acquisition fair value 
provision in Matthew Clark (Holdings) Limited, offset by a decrease of ¬£1,779,000 relating to the deferred 
tax asset relating to this fair value provision (note 2).
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is subject to annual impairment testing. The recoverable amounts 
of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. The value-in-use is the present value of the 
pre-tax cash flow projections. The key assumptions used in determining value in use are growth rates and 
the discount rate.
For each CGU, cash flow projections are based on the most recent financial budgets approved by 
management for one year. Subsequent cash flows are extrapolated using an estimated annual growth rate 
of 2% for a further four years and terminal growth rates of 1% are then applied to perpetuity. The rate used 
to discount the projected cash flows, being a pre-tax risk-adjusted discount rate, is 7.55% (2016: 7.40%). 
This has been calculated using the Group‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital, taking account of market 
assessment of risks. Risk factors are similar in each of the Group‚Äôs CGUs. All assumptions apply to all CGU‚Äôs 
due to each CGU wholesaling to businesses that retail alcohol via stores, pubs, bars, restaurants and 
events, and the performance of each CGU is therefore driven by the UK market for alcohol consumption 
which is a single market with a single set of economic characteristics and risks.
Management have reviewed the key assumptions in the forecast and have concluded that no impairment 
is required in respect of the carrying values of the goodwill. A sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of 
each CGU‚Äôs carrying value including reducing sales levels and increasing the discount rate has also been 
carried out.

will be ¬£38,706,000 (2016: ¬£22,330,000). Of this amount, ¬£Nil (2016: ¬£270,000) has been provided as a 
guarantee to HRMC.

The ¬£130,000,000 receivables financing facility (note 17) is secured over the trade receivables of Matthew 
Clark (Holdings) Limited, Bibendum PLB Group and Bargain Booze Limited.
The difference between the carrying value and fair value of all receivables is not considered to be material. 
As of 30 April 2017, trade receivables of ¬£42,263,000 (2016: ¬£6,813,000) were past due but not impaired. 
These relate to customers and Franchisees for which there is no recent history of default. 
Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:
 2017 2016
 ¬£000 ¬£000
Opening 1,859 1,385
Charge for receivables impairment 892 297
Provision acquired through business combinations 2,610 956
Receivables written off as uncollectable (2,582) (779)
Closing 2,779 1,859
Provisions are estimated based upon past default experience and management‚Äôs assessment of the 
current economic environment. The creation and release of provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
charged/(credited) to cost of sales in the income statement. Trade receivables consist of a large number 
of Franchisees and customers for whom there is no significant history of default. The credit risk of the 
Franchisees and customers is assessed by taking account of their financial positions, past experiences 
and other relevant factors. Individual Franchisee and customer credit limits are imposed based on these 
factors. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class 
of receivables mentioned above. In the event of a default in payment by a Franchisee, the Group may 
recover unpaid inventory held in the Franchisee‚Äôs store, further reducing the credit risk for this element of 
the Group.

addition the Group had an Accordion option of ¬£15m which is unutilised at 30 April 2017.
The interest margin payable on the two terms loans and the RCF is 2.5% above Libor. A non-utilisation 
fee of 1.0% is payable on the RCF up to the agreement termination date of 7 September 2020. An

18. Financial Risk Management and Financial Instruments
The Group‚Äôs activities expose it to a variety of financial risks. The main financial risks faced by the Group 
relate to the risk of default by counter-parties to financial transactions, the availability of funds to meet 
business needs, interest rate movements and foreign exchange movements. These risks are managed as 
described below.
The Group‚Äôs risk management is coordinated at its headquarters, in close cooperation with the Board of 
Directors, and focuses on actively securing the Group‚Äôs short to medium-term cash flows by minimising 
the exposure to financial risks.
The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes nor does it 
write options. The most significant financial risks to which the Group is exposed are described below.
a. Credit risk
The Group‚Äôs principal assets subject to credit risk are cash deposits, cash and trade receivables. The 
credit risk associated with cash is limited. The principal credit risk arises from non-recovery of trade 
receivables. In order to manage credit risk Franchise agreements specify that collection is by direct 
debit and credit limits are set for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party 
credit references. Credit limits are reviewed by the credit controller on a regular basis in conjunction 
with debt ageing and collection history. In addition, the Group has a receivables financing facility in 
place and any trade receivables owed by its customers, up to a maximum of 85% of the allowable trade 
receivables balance can be sold up to the maximum facility level of ¬£130,000,000.
b. Market risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, ordinary shares, a receivables 
financing facility of ¬£130,000,000, term loans of ¬£95,778,000 and a RCF of ¬£30,000,000. The Group 
also has available a ¬£15,000,000 Accordion option which allows the RCF to be increased at any time. 
At 30 April 2017, the drawdown on receivables financing facility was ¬£10,741,000 (2016: ¬£20,255,000) 
and the drawdown on the RCF was ¬£Nil (2016: ¬£12,500,000 relating to bank-issued guarantees for the 
benefit of certain suppliers). The Accordion option has not been utilised. The term loans have been 
drawn in full to fund the acquisitions of Matthew Clark (Holdings) Limited and Bibendum PLB Group. 
The headroom on the facilities as at 30 April 2017 was ¬£164,259,000 (¬£119,259,000 receivables financing 
facility, ¬£30,000,000 RCF and ¬£15,000,000 Accordian option).
c. Interest rate risk
The Group has interest rate risk on the term loans of ¬£95,778,000. Interest is payable at a discount 
margin plus Libor. The interest rate risk on 80% of the ¬£50,000,000 Term loan B, which is not repayable 
until 7 September 2020, has been mitigated by entering into an interest rate swap dated 25 April 2016 
until 7 September 2020. The interest rate swap fixes the Libor rate at 1%. 90 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Accordion option      15,000 10,000
Total      164,259 69,745
The interest rate swap has been valued at fair value by using the Mark to Market rate and has been 
hedge accounted as a cashflow hedge through other comprehensive income. As at 30 April 2017 the 
Mark to Market valuation of the interest rate swap was ¬£610,000 (2016: ¬£88,000):
 2017 2016
 ¬£000 ¬£000
Opening fair value (88) -
Amounts recognised through equity (522) (88)
Closing fair value (610) (88)
Any change to the fair value is taken through equity except for any part of the hedge which is deemed 
to be ineffective. At 30 April 2017 the hedge was deemed to be 100% effective and therefore all of the 
hedge has been recognised through equity. 
The interest rate swap has been used to hedge the three month Libor interest rate exposure on the 
initial ¬£40,000,000 tranche of term loan B which is repayable in full on 7 September 2020. Under the 
hedge, interest payments are payable every quarter at month end January, April, July and October 
at the discount margin of 2.5% plus the hedged Libor rate of 1.0% until the final repayment on 7 
September 2020.

undiscounted payments.

Sensitivity analysis: A 0.25% increase in the interest rate curve would result in a fair value asset of 
¬£310,000 (2016: ¬£303,000 asset). A 0.25% decrease in the interest rate curve would result in a fair value 
liability of ¬£313,000 (2016: ¬£502,000 liability). 
d. Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to an element of foreign exchange risk, with a number of suppliers from abroad. 
All sales are made from the UK. The Group manages this risk by entering into forward exchange 
contracts. The forward exchange contracts taken out are based on forecasts of purchases for the next 
12 months. The forward exchange contracts are valued at fair value by using the Mark to Market rate. As 
at the 30 April 2017 the Group had 41 forward exchange contracts outstanding with a negative Mark to 
Market valuation of ¬£1,557,000.

18. Financial Risk Management and Financial Instruments continued
e. Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable 
needs and to invest cash safely and profitably. The Group monitors its cash resources through short, 
medium and long-term cash forecasting, against available facilities. Short-term flexibility is achieved by 
the use of a receivables financing facility and an RCF, the details of which are set out in the table above. 
The maturity of borrowings is set out in note 17. 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern 
while maximising the return to shareholders through optimising the debt and equity balance. The capital 
structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of 
the Company comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust 
the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell 
assets to reduce debt. The Group‚Äôs capital is not restricted. Management may seek additional external 
borrowings to fund the future investment and growth of the Group.
In addition the Group has entered into a receivables finance facility agreement under which the maximum 
facility available is 85% of the allowable trade receivables up to ¬£130,000,000 and an RCF agreement 
under which the maximum facility is ¬£30,000,000. The Group draws down on these facilities from time 
to time as required to support short term working capital movements. The amount drawn down on the 
receivables finance facility as at 30 April 2017 is ¬£10,741,000 (2016: ¬£20,255,000) and ¬£Nil on the RCF 
(2016: ¬£12,500,000 relating to bank-issued guarantees for the benefit of certain suppliers). The Group has 
an Accordion option on the RCF that allows the Group to increase the RCF by a further ¬£15,000,000 if 
required. 
The Group has a progressive dividend policy which aims to increase the value of ordinary dividends over 
time, taking into account the results of the past year and the outlook.
Borrowings and cash
The carrying values of cash and short-term borrowings approximate to their fair values because of the 
short-term maturity of these instruments.
The carrying value of long-term borrowings is held at amortised cost which is considered to equate to fair 
value.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The carrying values of all the Group‚Äôs financial assets and financial liabilities approximate to their fair values 
because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of trade receivables and payables is considered to be equal to the carrying values of these 
items due to their short-term nature. All other financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost. 
Cash is held with counterparties with a credit rating of A1, A2 and BBB+.

that it is considered to be recoverable based on forecasts for future periods. As at 30 April 2017, the value 
of the unrecognised deferred tax asset is ¬£Nil (2016: ¬£329,000).
The deferred tax asset as at 1 May 2016 has been restated to reflect a ¬£1,779,000 deferred tax asset

Under the ESOP, the share options are awarded at a price which is determined by the Board but 
is not less than the market value of the shares as at the date of grant. The awards granted on 26 
February 2013 vested on successful admission to AIM. All subsequent grants become exercisable 
between one and ten years after grant and upon the achievement of performance criteria in relation 
to EBITDA targets or service conditions. All options lapse on the day immediately after the expiry 
date to the extent they have not been exercised. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the 
Company in the first three years following grant. The following table provides details of all existing 
grants under the ESOP. None of the options are cash settled.

Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the date of grant is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group‚Äôs estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value for the ESOP is measured by use of the 
Black-Scholes model. The inputs into the option pricing model are provided below:

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the ESOP was 1 pence 
(2016: 152.1 pence). 
Due to the short period of share trading activity, expected volatility was determined by reference to the 
historical volatility of the share price of comparable listed companies over the previous four years. The 
volatility of the Group‚Äôs share price on each date of grant was calculated as the average of annualised 
standard deviations of daily continuously compounded returns on the stock, calculated over four years 
back from the date of the grant.
The risk-free rate is the yield to maturity on the date of grant of a UK Gilt Strip, with term to maturity equal 
to the life of the option. The expected life of each option is equal to the vesting period plus a one year 
exercise period. 98 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

b. Conviviality Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Under the LTIP, annual awards of performance vesting shares are awarded at nil cost and vest based 
on three year growth in adjusted basic EPS. For the existing awards 30% will vest if adjusted basic EPS 
exceeds 20.3p in the year ending April 2019, 60% will vest if adjusted basic EPS exceeds 21.45p in the 
year ending April 2019 and 100% will vest if adjusted basic EPS exceeds 24.25 p in the year ending 
April 2019. No vesting will occur if adjusted basic EPS is below 20.3 p in the year ending April 2019 
and vesting between these points will be on a straight-line basis. Options are forfeited if the employee 
leaves the Company before the options have vested. The following table provides details of all existing 
grants under the ESOP. None of the options are cash settled.

c. Bargain Booze Share Incentive Plan 2013
The Group operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP), approved by HMRC on 14 October 2013, approved 
by the Board on 11 October 2013 and commenced 1 November 2013. All UK resident tax-paying 
employees of Conviviality and its participating subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the SIP subject 
to completing a minimum qualifying period of service of six months.
Under the SIP, the Group can:
a. Give 10% of salary, up to ¬£3,000 worth of free shares in each tax year to an employee (‚ÄúFree Shares‚Äù);
b. Offer an employee the opportunity of buying up to ¬£1,500 of shares a year (‚ÄúPartnership Shares‚Äù);
c. Give an employee a matching share for each Partnership Share bought (‚ÄúMatching Shares‚Äù). Each 
employee must complete three years service before these shares are awarded; and
d. In addition to buying up to ¬£1,500 of Partnership Shares each year, allow employees to purchase 
more shares (‚ÄúDividend Shares‚Äù) using dividends received on Free Shares, Partnership Shares and 
Matching Shares up to percentage limits set by the Company.
Awards of ‚ÄúMatching Shares‚Äù under this scheme are at ¬£Nil cost and therefore their fair value is equal to 
the share price on the date of issue, at the time when each grant is allocated. If a person ceases to be 
an employee prior to the exercise date, the ‚ÄúMatching Shares‚Äù will be forfeited. Details of all ‚ÄúMatching 
Share‚Äù grants in the year are below, none of which are exercisable at the period end: 100 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

d. Franchisee incentive plan (FIP)
The FIP is intended to provide issued ordinary shares as awards to Franchisees subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions and then at the discretion of the Board. There are four 
categories of proposed award all of which are subject to approval, at the discretion of the Board, at the 
end of the third year of measurement:
 - Part 1 ‚Äì Store Standards Incentive Plan ‚Äì All Franchisees could be entitled to one third of their 
maximum allocation on passing each of three annual store audits.
 - Part 2 ‚Äì Group EBITDA Target ‚Äì Awards may be made, at the discretion of the Board, based on 
Group EBITDA targets over a three year period and will be shared between all stores equally.
 - Part 3 ‚Äì Individual Franchisee Performance Awards ‚Äì Annual awards may be made subject to the 
achievement by a store of certain key performance indicators.
 - Part 4 ‚Äì New Franchisee Incentives ‚Äì awards may be made, at the discretion of the Board, three years 
after passing a store audit.
The shares are transferred to the Franchisees for no payment. If a person ceases to be a Franchisee 
prior to the vesting of any award, that award will lapse entirely. The awards are subject to Board 
approval prior to vesting and therefore the service period commences prior to the grant date. The fair 
value of each grant is calculated as the best estimate of the share price on the date of grant, being the 
year end share price.  102 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Bibendum PLB Group
On 20 May 2016, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the entire issued share capital of 
Bibendum PLB Group for a total consideration of ¬£39.7 million in cash. Bibendum PLB Group is a leading 
independent wholesaler in the drinks industry specialising in wines and spirits. This acquisition is consistent 
with the Group‚Äôs ongoing strategy of expanding the Group‚Äôs wholesaling expertise and entering new 
markets and channels. The acquisition, together with the current businesses in the Group, creates a unique 
offering that addresses both the On Trade and Off Trade retailers. Significant synergies across buying 
and distribution, plus organisational efficiencies and additional revenue generation, are expected to be 
achieved by bringing the businesses together. 
The following table summarises the consideration paid for Bibendum PLB Group, and the amount of

The goodwill arising on acquisition represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets 
acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised on 
the acquisition of Bibendum PLB Group; these largely relate to synergy and integration benefits. On 
the acquisition of Bibendum PLB Group, the fair value of assets and liabilities has been assessed and 
adjustments made as shown in the table above. 
Within property, plant and equipment a fair value adjustment of ¬£0.1 million was made to write down 
assets to their fair value. Within inventories, a fair value adjustment of ¬£5.9 million was made which 
represents the adjustment required to bring inventories to their net realisable value. Within intangible 
assets the fair value adjustment of ¬£1.4m predominately related to impairments of IT systems. Within trade 
and other receivables a number of fair value adjustments totalling ¬£3.7 million relating to recoverability of 
recievables were made to write down assets to their fair value. Within trade and other payables a number 
of additional accruals have been made to reflect fair values totalling ¬£4.6 million.
A deferred tax liability of ¬£2.0 million has been recognised on the brand and customer base intangible 
assets, offset by a deferred tax asset of ¬£2.8 million on fair value adjustments.
From the date of acquisition Bibendum PLB Group has contributed revenue of ¬£275.0 million and ¬£4.3 
million to profit before tax to the Group‚Äôs results. Acquisition costs of ¬£1,644,000 have been charged to 
exceptional costs in the consolidated income statement for the period.

and other synergies. Goodwill has been allocated to the KMD CGU. There are no separately identifiable 
intangible assets as the Nisa Local brand name was not acquired and the customer base was deemed to 
have no value.
Management have not yet finalised its assessment of the fair values at the acquisition date. This is 
expected to be completed during 2017.
In addition to the acquisitions set out above, the Group has also completed a number of individual smaller 
store acquisitions for a total cash consideration of ¬£396,000 (2016: ¬£796,000), all of which has been 
recognised as goodwill. When purchasing individual stores the Group is purchasing both the trade and 
assets of the store. 104 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Matthew Clark (Holdings) Limited

of Matthew Clark (Holdings) Limited for a total consideration of ¬£199.0 million in cash. Matthew Clark

with the Group‚Äôs ongoing strategy of expanding the Group‚Äôs wholesaling expertise and entering new 
markets and channels. The acquisition, together with the current businesses in the Group, creates a unique 
offering that addresses both the On Trade and Off Trade retailers. Significant synergies across buying 
and distribution, plus organisational efficiencies and additional revenue generation, are expected to be 
achieved by bringing the businesses together.

Adjustments made to the fair value of assets acquired include the recognition of the deferred tax liability 
relating to the intangible asset (¬£10.1 million), additional provisions and accruals to recognise three onerous 
contracts that were in place at acquisition (¬£11.0 million which has been recalculated this year and uplifted 
by ¬£5.8 million), additional provisions to recognise that renovation works needed to be carried out at 
specific depots (¬£1 million) and impairments for property plant and equipment that is impaired at the point 
of acquisition (¬£0.9 million). A deferred tax asset of ¬£1.8 million has been recognised in these financial 
statements relating to the fair value adjustment of onerous contracts. Goodwill has increased by net ¬£4.0 
million as a result of the measurement period adjustments. The comparative balance sheets have been 
restated to reflect these measurement period adjustments.
The goodwill arising on acquisition represents the premium paid to acquire Matthew Clark (Holdings) 
Limited and the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in the business combination 
that are not individually identified and separately recognised on the acquisition of Matthew Clark 
(Holdings) Limited; these largely relate to synergy and integration benefits. Goodwill has been allocated to 
the Matthew Clark (Holdings) cash-generating unit (‚ÄòCGU‚Äô).

28. Business Combinations continued 
Peppermint Events Limited
On 31 December 2015, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire 61% of issued share capital of 
Peppermint Events Limited for a total consideration of ¬£1.8 million in cash plus contingent consideration 
of ¬£6.2 million. This is contingent on meeting EBITDA targets for financial years ended 2017, 2018 and 
2019. The transaction is subject to an initial earn-out performance based payment during 2017 and 2018 
up to a total of ¬£800,000. There is an earn-out put option in respect of the remaining 39% of the ordinary 
share capital. The put and call option allows the non-controlling shareholder to require sales of their 
shares to the Group at an agreed pricing method between 2019 and 2020 based on EBITDA up to a 
total of ¬£9,200,000. The timing of the final earn-out will depend on whether Peppermint Events exceeds 
an EBITDA target that has been set for financial year 2019. If the target is not met the earn-out moves to 
financial year 2020. 
The company has agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration dependent on the performance 
of Peppermint Events over the subsequent four financial years. The range of the additional consideration 
payment is estimated to be between ¬£Nil and ¬£10,000,000. The Company has included ¬£6,159,000 as 
contingent consideration related to the additional consideration, which represents the amount determined 
at the acquisition date based on forecast EBITDA for the next three years discounted to net present 
value.However, following the end of the 12 month hindsight period the contingent consideration has been 
reassessed as ¬£2,859,000 as at 30 April 2017, with a subsequent release of contingent consideration 
of ¬£3,375,000 which has been included within exceptional items (note 4) and finance costs of ¬£75,000 
representing the unwind of the discount on the contingent consideration (note 6).
The valuation model for the contingent consideration considers the present value of the expected 
payment, discounted using a risk-free rate of 2.7%. The expected payment is determined by considering 
the possible scenarios of forecast revenue and EBITDA, the amount to be paid under each scenario and 
the probability of each scenario. 
The acquisition of Peppermint Events Limited has been accounted for using the anticipated acquisition 
method as if the put and call option has already been exercised and therefore no non-controlling interest 
has been recognised. 
Peppermint Events Limited is an independent events company specialising in bars and events in the 
outdoor event arena including festivals. This acquisition is consistent with the Group‚Äôs ongoing strategy of 
focusing on new markets and channels.

Significant adjustments made to the fair value of assets acquired include the recognition of the 
deferred tax liability relating to the intangible asset, provision for doubtful debts and obsolete stock and 
impairments for property, plant and equipment. 
The goodwill arising on acquisition represents the premium paid to acquire Peppermint Events Limited in 
a key channel providing significant opportunities for increased wholesale sales and cross-selling and other 
synergies. Goodwill has been allocated to the Peppermint Events cash-generating unit (‚ÄòCGU‚Äô).
Acquisition costs of ¬£81,000 have been charged to exceptional items in the consolidated income 
statement for the period (note 4). These represent legal costs incurred during the acquisition.
For the period ended 1 May 2016, Peppermint Events Limited contributed revenue of ¬£0.6 million and ¬£0.4 
million loss before tax to the Group‚Äôs results, from the date of acquisition. If the acquisition had taken place 
at the beginning of the prior financial period, it is estimated that the Group revenue for the period ended 1 
May 2016 would have been ¬£877.0 million and total Group operating profit would have been ¬£12.0 million.

Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation of financial statements
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (‚ÄúIFRS‚Äù). In preparing these financial 
statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‚ÄúAdopted IFRSs‚Äù) but makes 
adjustments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements of Conviviality plc, which are presented separately, have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present 
its own profit and loss account.
Investments
Investments are included at cost less any provision for impairment.
Share based payments
Share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value is measured using the 
Black- Scholes pricing model.
The charge relating to grants to employees of the company is recognised on a straight line basis as an 
expense in the profit and loss account, spread over the vesting period, based on the Company‚Äôs estimate 
of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
Dividends
Dividends are recognised in the Company‚Äôs financial statements in the year in which they are approved 
in general meeting by the Company‚Äôs shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. Final 
dividends are recognised when they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises of current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income 
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income 
or in equity. In this case, the tax is recognised directly in other comprehensive income or in equity.
a. Current taxation
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates and 
laws enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to 
interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid 
to the tax authorities.
b. Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised using the statement of financial position liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the 
historical financial information. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by reporting date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other 
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current assets against current liabilities and it is the 
intention to settle these on a net basis. Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017       111
