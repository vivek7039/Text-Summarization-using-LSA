STRATEGIC REPORT
Results 
The Board is pleased to announce strong results for the year 
ended 30 September 2017. These results reflect our position 
as a leading provider of engineering services to many of the 
UK’s critical infrastructure assets and in particular our 
strength in the nuclear, rail and water markets. 
Group revenue, including £2.2m from a joint venture, 
increased by 6.7% to £560.8m (2016: £525.7m) with operating 
profit prior to impairment, amortisation and exceptional items, 
increasing by 16.4% to £25.6m (2016: £22.0m), an operating 
margin of 4.6% (2016: 4.2%). After accounting for impairment, 
amortisation and exceptional items of £8.9m, operating profit 
was £16.6m (2016: £19.0m). After finance costs and tax, 
earnings per share prior to impairment, amortisation and 
exceptional items increased by 21.6% to 33.36p (2016: 27.43p). 
After accounting for impairment, amortisation and exceptional 
items, basic earnings per share on continuing activities was 
19.88p (2016: 23.53p). 
Exceptional Items
At the end of April 2017, the Group decided to withdraw from 
its loss-making low pressure, small diameter gas pipe 
replacement activities and as a result reviewed the carrying 
value of its investment in that business. The Board 
determined that a non-cash impairment charge of £5.8m 
should be made which is included within exceptional items. 
This was reported in the interim results. Our gas operations 
are now completely focused on medium pressure activities. 
This restructuring has resulted in £0.6m of exceptional 
charges relating to redundancy and other costs. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 6.0p per share, 
increasing the full year dividend by 12.5% to 9.0p (2016: 8.0p). 
The dividend will be paid on 13 March 2018 to shareholders 
on the register as at 2 February 2018.
Order Book
The Group’s order book at 30 September 2017 was £511m 
(2016: £516m), with the Engineering Services order book up 
4% to £438m (2016: £421m). 
Cash
The Board is pleased to record a net cash position of £3.9m 
(2016: £4.8m). This is after expending £7.2m on the acquisition 
of Giffen Holdings Limited (“Giffen”) in November 2016.

THE BOARD LOOKS FORWARD 
WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE 
GROUP CONTINUING TO 
DELIVER FURTHER STRONG 
FINANCIAL RESULTS.” 
Chairman’s statement Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 5
People
Safety remains a top priority and the commitment of our 
employees, and those who work with us, continues to 
improve safe working practices across the Group. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our 
employees for their hard work and commitment which has 
contributed to another successful year for the Group. 
Board Changes 
As previously reported, John Samuel, the Group Finance 
Director, will resign from that position on 29 November 2017 
and will be succeeded by Sean Wyndham-Quin, who joined the 
Group and was appointed to the Board on 8 November 2017.
In April, the Board was pleased to welcome the appointment 
of David Brown as a non-executive Director. 
Having served as a Director since November 2003, I have 
decided to retire at the next Annual General Meeting which 
will be held on 31 January 2018. David Forbes, who has 
served as a non-executive Director since June 2011, will 
assume the position of Chairman providing continuity of 
leadership and I wish David every success going forward. 
Strategy
The Group’s operations focus on delivering essential 
infrastructure maintenance tasks in targeted regulated 
markets within the UK. As a result, we have not experienced 
any adverse impact following the UK’s announcement of its 
intention to withdraw from the European Union nor do we 
expect to. We deliver our services through our clients’ 
non-discretionary operational expenditure programmes 
which provide good visibility of future opportunities and 
sustainable earnings streams. 
We continue to seek out appropriate, earnings enhancing 
acquisitions in our Engineering Services markets. In 
November 2016, we acquired Giffen, a specialist mechanical, 
electrical and power services provider in the rail market. 
Integration with our existing rail business has gone well and 
we believe that our enhanced rail offering strengthens our 
ability to address additional framework opportunities in 
Network Rail’s next funding period, CP6. 
In Specialist Building, the Group focuses on the High Quality 
Residential market in London and the Home Counties where 
we have particular skills in major engineering structural works 
to extend or reconfigure high value properties.
Outlook
The Group is well positioned for the 2017/18 financial year. 
Bank debt will have been completely repaid by 31 March 2018. 
Following a year in which Specialist Building revenue has 
been particularly high, we expect that it will reduce, perhaps 
by as much as £35m, in the 2017/18 financial year. We remain 
confident that we will continue to deliver stable operating 
profits in that business. 
In Engineering Services, the order book provides a solid 
foundation for continued growth.
The Board looks forward with confidence to the Group 
continuing to deliver further strong financial results.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Chief Executive’s review
ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
ENGINEERING 
These strong results demonstrate that our focus on delivering 
essential maintenance services in regulated markets continues 
to provide robust, long-term opportunities.
Operational Review
Engineering Services
Revenue has grown to £452.4m (2016: £436.2m), including 
£2.2m from a joint venture. During the year, activity levels in 
the Environmental market have been strong, particularly on 
the current AMP6 investment programme which has seen 
clients’ programmes move from early planning and design 
phases into delivery. In Energy, revenue was lower than 
2016 as we withdrew from the loss-making small diameter, 
low-pressure gas market and a major scheme we were 
involved with at Sellafield moved into the commissioning 
phase. In Infrastructure, revenue in both Rail and Wireless 
Telecoms increased.
Our integrated multidisciplinary services are essential to 
clients responsible for delivering maintenance and renewals 
programmes in regulated markets. Our selectivity and direct 
delivery model has resulted in an operating profit prior to 
impairment, amortisation and exceptional items, of £25.1m 
(2016: £21.5m), an increase of £3.6m (16.7%). The operating 
margin on this basis improved to 5.6% (2016: 4.9%). After 
accounting for impairment, amortisation and exceptional 
items of £8.9m (2016: £3.0m), operating profit was £16.2m 
(2016: £18.6m) resulting in an operating margin of 3.6% 
(2016: 4.3%). 
Our Engineering Services order book grew 4% in the period 
to £438m (2016: £421m). The order book reflects our 
established position in markets which benefit from long-term, 
non-discretionary programmes supporting the maintenance 
and renewal of key infrastructure assets.
In the year, we extended our range of services in Rail with the 
acquisition of Giffen Holdings Ltd (“Giffen”). The acquisition 
broadened our offering as a major engineering services 
provider to Network Rail, as well as providing services to 
London Underground and Train Operating Companies. 
 • The Group has extensive framework 
positions to deliver infrastructure 
maintenance and renewals across a 
range of regulated market sectors
 • Engineering Services operating profit 
prior to impairment, amortisation 
and exceptional items, of £25.1m
 • We extended our range of services in Rail 
with the acquisition of Giffen Holdings Ltd Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 7
STRATEGIC REPORT
Energy
We operate across the energy market for clients including 
Sellafield Ltd, SSE, Magnox, E.ON and Low Level Waste 
Repository Limited.
We are well positioned on key frameworks associated with 
high hazard risk reduction operations at the Sellafield nuclear 
site in Cumbria. We are strategically placed on all three lots of 
the ten-year Decommissioning Delivery Partnership 
Framework that has an estimated value of £500m with the 
headroom to increase to £1.5bn over the term to 2025. Our 
long-term engagement on high priority programmes provides 
good visibility and we remain strongly positioned for 
participation in future major project programmes at the site. 
As previously reported, our Gas business is now focused on 
the medium pressure market that will benefit from significant 
investment in the coming years to meet regulatory 
requirements for cast iron gas mains replacement. Working 
for Southern Gas Networks, we operate as exclusive provider 
on a regional medium pressure framework that runs to 2021. 
Additionally, we continue to work on large diameter mains 
replacements for tRIIO, the vehicle used by National Grid for 
its mains replacement programmes in the South East. Whilst 
the performance of our gas business has continued to be 
disappointing, structural and commercial measures have been 
implemented to move the business back into growth and 
profitability in the second half of 2018.
Environmental
In Water, we have seen increased activity in the current AMP6 
investment period. Major frameworks include the Sewerage 
Repairs and Maintenance Framework for Northumbrian Water 
and the Civils and EMI Capital Delivery Partners Framework 
for Wessex Water. 
For Welsh Water, we have been reappointed to the 
Pressurised Pipelines Framework. This new seven-year 
framework, which has an advertised value of £329m, covers 
all Welsh regions and incorporates the current Emergency 
Reactive Framework. Additionally, we continue to operate on 
the Major Civils Framework and the Capital Delivery Alliance 
Civils contracts.
In the period we were appointed as sole supplier on the 
national seven-year MEICA Framework for Canal and River 
Trust which will see us support around 1,000 water assets for 
this new client. Work continues as sole provider for the 
Environment Agency on the Northern MEICA Framework and 
through four national Minor Works frameworks.
In Land Remediation, we operate on frameworks to remediate 
the sites of former gasworks for clients including National 
Grid and SGN. These positions are complemented by projects 
for repeat clients and 2017 has seen another major remediation 
contract successfully carried out for Glasgow City Council.
At the Palace of Westminster, the cast iron roof restoration is 
progressing well and puts us in a good position for future 
opportunities at this World Heritage site. During the year, the 
Courtyards Conservation Framework was extended to 2025.
Infrastructure
We work as a leading provider of infrastructure services to 
Network Rail on the current investment period (CP5) that 
runs to March 2019, delivering a high volume of asset 
maintenance and renewals tasks nationally. During the year 
we worked on over 5,000 individual remits with an average 
value of £11,000 as well as approximately 300 larger projects. 
We deliver planned and reactive works across the network as 
well as emergency support responding to some of the most 
challenging emergency events on the rail network. We 
continue to develop our position in Scotland as the major 
structures renewals contractor. 
The Government recently announced an increase in funding 
to £48bn for CP6, the next period of Network Rail 
expenditure, which runs from 2019 to 2024. CP6 will focus on 
both maintenance and renewals on the rail network as key 
priorities. We believe that the Group is particularly strongly 
placed to benefit from this spending profile.
The acquisition of Giffen has increased our opportunities 
in the Rail market including London Underground. Already, 
schemes incorporating the joint skill sets of Giffen and 
Amco Rail have been secured and we expect this to 
represent an increasing proportion of our work in the 
Rail sector going forward.
In Wireless Telecoms, we continue to see profitability 
improve in a market driven by increasing demand for 
capacity and better geographical coverage, particularly 
on the 4G rollout programme.  Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 8
STRATEGIC REPORT
Operational Review continued
Specialist Building
Revenue was £106.8m (2016: £90.5m) with an operating 
profit of £2.4m (2016: £2.3m). At the year end, the order 
book stood at £73m (2016: £95m). In Specialist Building, 
where we focus on the High Quality Residential market in 
London and the Home Counties, the forward order book can 
vary from period to period, dependent on the timing of client 
projects. Renew’s focus remains on delivering stable 
operating profits, whilst reducing risk through contract 
selectivity and management of contract terms. 
Summary
The Group remains committed to the growth of its 
Engineering Services business where appropriate margins 
can be delivered.
Our established strategy focuses on:
 • Infrastructure markets with non-discretionary, 
long-term funding
 • Operational expenditure budgets for renewal and 
maintenance operations
 • Utilising our directly employed workforce to develop 
relationships built on responsiveness
The UK is committed to long-term investment in its critical 
infrastructure networks. The Group has extensive framework 
positions to deliver infrastructure maintenance and renewals 
across a range of regulated market sectors which provide 
good levels of opportunities. 
The Board remains confident that our direct delivery model 
and ability to respond in markets where demand will continue 
to provide the opportunities for sustainable growth.

Business model
HOW WE 
DELIVER VALUE 
Ensuring the consistent delivery of quality
We are committed to ensuring we consistently deliver 
quality. Our businesses focus on maintaining and 
improving standards across their operations including 
in logistics, training, technology, sustainability and 
in the management of their supply chain. We strive 
to continue to develop and improve our 
business processes.
By the effective management and control of our subsidiary 
businesses, we deliver shareholder value through capital growth 
and a progressive dividend policy. 
Safe delivery of our services is paramount
Safety remains the Group’s priority. Our safe operations 
are managed by our subsidiary businesses alongside 
their safety advisors, who have specific knowledge in 
the individual environments. Safety advisors share 
knowledge and best practice, assisting our businesses 
in maintaining their high safety standards. We are 
pleased that our commitment to reducing unsafe 
working practices has resulted in a further improvement 
in the Group’s accident incident rate in the year.
Development of long-term positions 
in target markets
We support the day-to-day operational requirements of 
some of the country’s key infrastructure and, as such, we 
build strong relationships with our clients, many of which 
we have worked with for many years. We provide both 
planned and responsive services where we fulfil a high 
volume of low-cost tasks on a range of assets through 
long-term framework agreements. Our responsive 
engineering services, combined with consistent delivery, 
mean we are well positioned to work on some of the 
largest asset maintenance and renewal frameworks 
nationally, which are largely delivered through our clients’ 
operational expenditure budgets.
Development and delivery of our 
growth strategy
We focus on developing our engineering services both 
organically and by acquisition to broaden our service 
offering to existing and new clients. Organic growth 
is achieved by aligning our operating subsidiaries 
with their clients’ day-to-day service requirements 
on key infrastructure assets. The Group also continues 
to look for complementary acquisition opportunities 
where businesses have strong relationships in 
regulated markets.
Ensuring thorough risk management
Our subsidiary businesses are governed by a system of 
controls that includes our Group minimum standards. 
These standards are monitored by an internal audit 
process to ensure compliance. Minimum requirements 
ensure compliance in areas such as risk management, 
control environment and activities, information and 
communication, and the evaluation of effectiveness to 
deliver robust commercial risk management. Regular 
operational and financial reporting is supported by 
monthly management meetings attended by a Group 
Executive member, Executive Management Committee 
meetings and monthly Main Board meetings. Each 
subsidiary business is required to have a management 
system in place certified to at least ISO 9001. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 11
Investment case
2 
Complementary acquisitions
 The Group seeks to make earnings enhancing 
acquisitions in businesses that operate in 
mainly regulated markets and whose skills 
complement existing capabilities within 
the Group. We focus on broadening our 
skills and market opportunities through 
selective acquisitions.
3 
 Working in markets with 
high barriers to entry
  Many of our businesses work in markets with 
high barriers to entry. The nuclear, rail and 
gas markets demand a highly skilled and 
experienced workforce and a proven track 
record of safe delivery. 
4 
Mainly regulated markets 
provide visibility
   Our target markets are mainly regulated and are 
driven by long-term programmes of spending on 
asset renewal and maintenance, often lasting 
many years. The asset management programmes 
in water and rail are examples of the long-term 
funding requirements associated with national 
infrastructure networks.
5 
 Developing long-term relationships
 Directly delivering an innovative and responsive 
service has proven to be a differentiator in our 
markets. Positioned as a key supplier to our 
clients, we assist them in maintaining their assets 
and providing continuity of service.
6 
Cash generation
 The Group has consistently generated cash from 
operations, enabling it to maximise shareholder 
return. Cash generation assists the Group in 
the fulfilment of its acquisition strategy and is 
a strong indicator of the strength of the 
Group’s operations.
7 
Capital growth
 The Group has grown its market capitalisation 
more than ninefold since 30 September 2005 
without recourse to new equity.
DELIVERING 
GROWTH
The regulated markets in which we operate have high barriers to 
entry and, alongside the Group’s extensive expertise in delivering 
asset care and maintenance, provide strong opportunities for growth.
1 
 Continued sustainable growth
 The Group continues to deliver organic 
growth whilst looking to build on its strengths 
through selective acquisitions in both existing 
and new markets. Margin improvement 
and the development of our strong client 
relationships remain key features of our 
strategy moving forward.
Key growth drivers
STRATEGIC REPORT Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 12
STRATEGIC REPORT
Markets
MARKETS DRIVEN 
BY REGULATION 
Our clients’ infrastructure networks are some of the largest, and oldest, in the country 
and comprise a range of complex and challenging assets. Regulation exists to maintain 
operational standards on these critical networks, with maintenance requirements delivered 
through long-term programmes of care with visible funding.
ENERGY
Nuclear
The UK government’s commitment to dealing with 
the nuclear legacy continues. The latest government 
forecast to manage the whole of the mission is £70bn 
(discounted at today’s prices), with a programme 
lasting until 2120. The Nuclear Decommissioning 
Authority’s medium-term forecasts indicate a rate of 
expenditure of around £3bn per annum, with around 
70% of this commitment at Sellafield.
New nuclear power is an essential part of the 
government’s objective of delivering a sustainable and 
low-carbon energy future to meet increasing demand.
Thermal, renewable and gas infrastructure
There remain good opportunities in the renewable 
energy market as the UK responds to increasing energy 
demand whilst looking to deliver its targets for 
renewable power generation.
In gas, the regulator, Ofgem, has mandated the 
replacement of the ageing gas distribution network 
over a thirty year period to 2032. 
ENVIRONMENTAL
Water
UK water companies, regulated by Ofwat, undertake 
long-term investment programmes on their 
infrastructure networks. In the current five year 
investment period, AMP6, we estimate our clients 
Northumbrian Water, Wessex Water and Dwr Cymru 
Welsh Water will spend around £3.2bn on maintaining 
their water infrastructure assets. The UK government 
has also committed a record £2.3bn investment in 
coastal and river flood risk management to 2021.
Land remediation
The Environment Agency estimates that in England and 
Wales approximately 300,000 hectares of land could 
potentially be affected by historical contamination. 
In the UK, the focus on brownfield land as a potential 
solution to the UK’s land shortage provides 
opportunities for our remediation services. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 13
STRATEGIC REPORT
INFRASTRUCTURE
Rail
Network Rail is investing around £41bn in the current 
control period (“CP5”) to 2019 in running, maintaining 
and improving Britain’s railway. The government 
recently announced an increase in funding to £48bn 
for CP6, which runs from 2019 to 2024. CP6 will focus 
on both maintenance and renewals on the rail network 
as key priorities. 
Wireless telecoms
The wireless telecoms infrastructure market remains 
attractive as demand for mobile internet access and 
communication continues to outstrip the capability and 
capacity of the current networks. Licence obligations 
under the 4G programme continue to demand significant 
investment and our addressable market remains strong.
SPECIALIST BUILDING
High quality residential
The high quality residential market in London and the 
Home Counties remains robust. We have particular 
specialist engineering expertise in major structural

Safety
We work to:
 • ensure a safe working environment for our 
employees and those who work with us; and 
 • promote equal opportunities.
Our priority is to ensure the safety of all our employees 
and those who work alongside us. The Group’s businesses 
develop a range of safety schemes designed to reflect the 
individual markets in which they operate. Safety is managed 
within our subsidiary businesses by our team of locally based 
construction managers and safety advisors and is supported 
centrally by the Safety and Environmental Management 
Group, which co-ordinates safety activities and promotes 
best practice and knowledge sharing.
The type of work the Group undertakes has seen a shift in 
recent years from larger single projects to a high volume of 
smaller value tasks. The Group has identified unexpected 
changes in the working environment on sites as a factor in 
some reported incidents and near misses. To mitigate these 
contributory factors we have introduced a Group-wide 
initiative “Change = STOP” to empower employees to take 
responsibility for their working environment. The initiative is 
supported within the subsidiary businesses as part of their 
individual safety programmes.
Our businesses undertake continual safety training to ensure 
the highest levels of safe working. Behavioural based safety 
training has again been a key area of focus in the year 
alongside traditional courses such as harness awareness, 
manual handling and working in confined spaces.
As part of the continuous drive to improve safety 
performance our businesses undertake a range of initiatives 
including cross-business improvement safety checks, 
stand-down days, safety conferences, near miss reporting, 
“You Said We Did” schemes and internal safety awards to 
enforce the safety message and culture.
Many of our businesses continue to be accredited and 
approved with various health and safety schemes, including 
the Contractors Health and Safety Assessment Scheme, 
Constructionline and SafeContractor.

of £4.4m (2016: £5.3m) resulted in a profit after tax prior to 
amortisation and related deferred taxation for the year of 
£20.9m (2016: £17.1m), an increase of 22%. After deducting 
£8.4m (2016: £2.4m) of amortisation, impairment and 
exceptional costs, the profit for the year from continuing 
activities was £12.4m (2016: £14.6m). 
Impairment, amortisation and exceptional items
The £5.8m impairment to the carrying value of goodwill 
arises from the withdrawal from loss making low pressure, 
small diameter gas pipe replacement activities of Forefront 
Utilities Limited. No tax relief is available in respect of this 
item. The consequent reduction in Forefront’s activities 
has resulted in a charge of £0.6m for redundancy and 
restructuring costs. Following £2.3m of amortisation charges 
in the year, the remaining £2.7m of other intangible assets 
related to contractual rights and customer relationships are 
solely associated with Giffen Holdings Limited. The remaining 
£0.2m of exceptional costs represent professional fees in 
connection with the acquisition of Giffen. A tax credit of 
£0.5m arises in connection with these items.
Restatement of 2016 Balance Sheet
In previous years, the Group has provided for deferred tax 
on its pension scheme surplus at the rate of corporation tax 
expected to be prevailing in the future, provided that the 
relevant legislation had been enacted. In the year ended 
30 September 2016, a rate of 18% was used. It has now 
become clear to the Board that, in line with tax legislation 
which applies in the event of a refund of a surplus on the 
winding up of the pension scheme, that a tax rate of 35% 
should be applied. Consequently, the Board has restated 
the opening Balance Sheet as at 1 October 2015 to reflect 
the above. As at that date, the effect of the correction of 
this prior period error is to increase deferred tax liabilities 
associated with the Retirement Benefit Asset by £2,576,000 
with a corresponding reduction in net assets of the Group. 
As at 30 September 2016, the deferred tax liability has been 
increased by £1,309,000, compared to that previously reported. 
During the preparation of these financial statements, the 
Directors also became aware of inaccuracies in the corporation 
tax creditor at 30 September 2016. Correcting these resulted 
in an £833,000 reduction in the corporation tax creditor at 
that date. The net impact of these adjustments is to reduce net 
assets by £476,000 at 30 September 2016. The amendments 
related to the pension scheme tax primarily relate to movements 
in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). As such, adjustments 
have been made to OCI in 2016 and the total comprehensive 
income for the year ended 30 September 2016 is now 
£1,335,000 compared to the previously recorded loss 
of £765,000.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Cash
The Group’s financial position shows a cash balance of 
£7.0m (2016: £14.1m) at the year end. Consequently, the 
Group’s net cash position as at 30 September 2017 was 
£3.9m (2016: £4.8m). This position has been achieved after 
acquiring Giffen Holdings Ltd for a total cash cost of £7.2m 
including fees during the year. The repayment schedule on 
the Group’s outstanding term loan means that it will be fully 
repaid by 31 March 2018. The Group has complied with the 
covenants associated with the term loan throughout the year. 
Taxation
The tax charge on profit for the year is £3.9m (2016: £4.7m), 
a rate of 24%. This rate is higher than the headline rate of 
19% as the impairment charge of £5.8m is not a taxable item. 
Excluding this item, the tax rate falls to 18% which is slightly 
lower than the headline rate. The Group has been able to 
utilise some brought forward losses which had not previously 
been recognised as deferred tax assets. Due to the tax 
deductibility of pension scheme contributions which are not 
charged to the Income Statement, the rate of corporation tax 
payable in each of the next few years is expected to remain 
below the headline rate. After accounting for deferred tax on 
those pension contributions, the Board expects the Group’s 
future rate of taxation to approximate to the headline rate of 
corporation tax in effect for the relevant accounting period.
Pension schemes
At 30 September 2017, the IAS 19 valuation of the Lovell 
Pension Scheme, which was closed to new members in 2000, 
resulted in an accounting surplus of £6.3m after accounting 
for deferred taxation. The net surplus has increased by £1.3m 
during the year, due to both an increase in the discount rate 
as a result of improving gilt yields and updated mortality 
assumptions. The actuarial movement is accounted for 
through the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
During the year, the Board has continued to work with the 
Trustees of the Lovell Scheme, to reduce the risks associated 
with the scheme’s liabilities by regularly reviewing the 
scheme’s investment strategy which includes a liability driven 
model featuring interest rate hedging techniques. At the year 
end, 56% (2016: 55%) of the scheme’s total liabilities were 
matched by annuities. In accordance with the scheme 
specific funding requirements of the Pensions Act 2005, 
the Board reached an agreement with the Trustees of the 
scheme on the level of future contributions at £4.3m per 
annum. This recovery plan is projected to eliminate the deficit 
under the Statutory Funding Objective of the Pensions Act 
2004 by 31 July 2018. The next triennial valuation is due as 
at 31 March 2018. 
The IAS 19 valuation of the Amco Pension Scheme shows a 
deficit of £0.6m (2016: £1.7m) after accounting for deferred 
taxation. Liabilities have reduced primarily due to an increase 
in the discount rate as a result of improving gilt yields. Similar 
to the Lovell Scheme, the Board has worked closely with the 
Trustees of the Amco Scheme, to reduce the risks associated 
with the liabilities of the scheme. This has included agreeing 
to make £0.6m of additional contributions to provide liquidity 
so that the Trustees could fund transfer values requested by 
a number of members without disturbing the investment 
portfolio of the scheme. It is likely that further contributions 
will be made in 2017/18 for the same purpose. At the year 
end, 44% (2016: 44%) of the scheme’s total liabilities were 
matched by annuities. In the triennial valuation of the scheme 
which was carried out as at 31 December 2013, the scheme 
actuary measured the deficit in the scheme at £2.1m. In 
accordance with the scheme specific funding requirements 
of the Pensions Act 2005, the Board agreed the level of 
future contributions with the Trustees of the scheme at 
£0.3m per annum. This recovery plan is projected to 
eliminate the deficit under the Statutory Funding Objective 
of the Pensions Act 2004 by 31 October 2020. The next 
triennial valuation is in the process of being carried out as 
at 31 December 2016. 
Acquisitions 
On 1 November 2016, the Group acquired Giffen Holdings 
Limited (“Giffen”), a specialist mechanical, electrical and 
power services business within the rail environment. The 
acquisition cost was £7.2m in total including fees. The 
acquisition was funded from the Group’s own cash resources. 
IFRS 15 and 16
These two new international financial reporting standards 
will be applicable to the Group’s results for the years ending 
30 September 2019 and 2020 respectively. Following a 
thorough review of the Group’s current major contracts, the 
Board has determined that there will be no material impact 
from the adoption of IFRS 15 on the reported revenue of the 
Group and no changes to the Group’s accounting procedures 
are required. Regarding IFRS 16, the Board assesses that the 
net impact to the Income Statement will be immaterial. Both 
assets and liabilities on the Balance Sheet are expected to 
increase by corresponding amounts, which as at 30 
September 2017 would have been approximately £10m.
Distributable profits
The distributable profits of Renew Holdings plc are £50.9m 
(2016: £46.6m). The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 6.0p (2016: 5.35p) per share bringing the total for the year 
to 9.0p (2016: 8.0p), an increase of 12.5%.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Risk management
PRINCIPAL RISKS 
AND UNCERTAINTIES
Actual results may differ to those expressed in such statements, depending on a variety of factors. These factors include 
customer acceptance of the Group’s services, levels of demand in the market, restrictions to market access, competitive 
pressure on pricing or additional costs, failure to retain or recruit key personnel and overall economic conditions.
This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the 
Directors in good faith, based on the information available to them up to the time of approval of this report. 
RISK MITIGATION AND RESPONSIBILITY
Contractual conditions 
which exist at the time of 
contract procurement. 
Should initial estimates 
and judgments be 
incorrect, the actual 
financial outcomes may 
ultimately differ from 
that which is indicated.
The Group has a system of pre-contract and pre-tender risk assessment whereby senior 
management, including the Executive Directors where appropriate, review and advise on 
specific issues arising in the contract procurement process. In contracting, management 
is required to estimate the total expected costs on a contract and the stage of contract 
completion in order to determine both the revenue and profit to be recognised in an 
accounting period. The Group has control and review procedures in place to monitor, 
and evaluate regularly, the estimates being made to ensure that they are consistent and 
appropriate. This includes reviewing the independent certification of the value of work done, 
the progress of work against contracted timescales and the costs incurred against plan. The 
Group also seeks to limit its risks by specialising in certain markets where it has extensive 
experience and a particular skills base.
Reliance on a relatively 
small number of major 
customers. If the Group 
was to lose its position 
as a supplier to some of 
these customers then its 
financial position could 
be materially affected.
As the Group has moved progressively into engineering services markets it has fewer, but 
larger, clients. Key clients are Network Rail, Sellafield Ltd, National Grid, Environment Agency, 
CTIL, Northumbrian Water, Wessex Water and Welsh Water. Loss of any of the above could 
potentially affect shareholder value. We mitigate this risk by maintaining strong relationships 
with our clients and by being seen as responsive, innovative and proactive.
The Group could be 
required to make 
substantial payments 
into two closed final 
salary pension schemes 
in accordance with the 
requirements of the 
Pensions Act 1995.
The Group has taken steps to mitigate this risk by working with the schemes’ Trustees 
to develop liability matching investment strategies. These have included both schemes 
entering into annuity policies which match the liabilities in respect of certain of the schemes’ 
beneficiaries. At 30 September 2017, these policies are equivalent to 55% of the combined 
schemes’ liabilities.
The impact of accidents 
on our employees and the 
consequential impact on 
contract performance 
and reputational damage.
Safety is managed across Renew by the Safety and Environmental Management Group, 
which co-ordinates activities and liaises with our team of locally based safety advisors. 
Working as part of an overall safety team, our advisors are encouraged to share specialist 
knowledge and best practice from their individual working environments. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 29

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance
As an AIM listed company, Renew is not required to follow 
the provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
(“the Code”). The Directors, however, recognise the 
importance of, and accordingly support, the principles of 
good corporate governance as contained within the Code. 
The Directors normally seek to follow the Code to the extent 
considered relevant for an AIM listed company but are unable 
to achieve compliance with the Code in a number of areas 
this year, primarily because of the lack of independent 
non-executive Directors. These matters are explained in 
further detail in the sections below. 
The Board of Directors 
The Board currently comprises the Chief Executive Officer, 
the non-executive Chairman, three Executive Directors and 
three independent non-executive Directors. Brief biographies 
of the Directors are given on pages 33 and 34. The Company 
is not compliant with the requirement of the Code that more 
than half of the Board should be comprised of independent 
non-executive Directors. Although the Board believes that 
R J Harrison acts as an independent director, he is not regarded 
as such by the Code due to the period in 2004/2005 when he 
acted as Executive Chairman. D A Brown was appointed as a 
non-executive Director on 3 April 2017 and S Wyndham-Quin 
as an Executive Director on 8 November 2017. J Samuel will 
resign as a Director on 29 November 2017 and be succeeded 
in the roles of Group Finance Director and Company 
Secretary by S Wyndham-Quin. R J Harrison will retire as 
a Director after the 2018 Annual General Meeting and be 
succeeded in the role of Chairman by D M Forbes. The Board 
will then comprise three independent non-executive Directors 
and three executive Directors.
The composition of the Board is reviewed regularly. 
Appropriate training, briefings and induction are available to 
all Directors on appointment and subsequently as necessary, 
taking into account existing qualifications and experience. 
New Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the 
first AGM after their appointment. 
The Board met formally nine times in the year with all 
Directors in attendance other than on two occasions 
when J Bishop was unable to attend. Committee meetings 
dealing with the daily business of the Company were held as 
necessary. The Board receives written and oral reports from 
the Executive Directors ensuring matters are considered fully 
and enabling Directors to discharge their duties properly. 
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board’s decision ensuring the maintenance of control over 
strategic, financial and operational matters. In addition, 
procedures are in place for the Directors to seek independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense. 
Board Committees 
The Board operates with a number of Board Committees. 
J Bishop, the senior independent non-executive Director, 
acts as Chairman of the Audit Committee and D M Forbes, an 
independent non-executive Director, acts as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. The Nominations Committee is 
chaired by R J Harrison. D M Forbes will take over that role 
following R J Harrison’s retirement.
The Board delegates clearly defined powers to its 
Remuneration, Nominations and Audit Committees. 
Each of the Board’s Committees has carefully drafted 
terms of reference. 
The Remuneration Committee, which comprises all of the 
non-executive Directors, determines and agrees with the 
Board the framework and policy of executive remuneration 
packages, including bonuses, incentive payments, share 
options or awards and pension arrangements. Further 
information concerning the Remuneration Committee 
is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The Nominations Committee, which comprises all of 
the non-executive Directors and P Scott, monitors the 
composition of the Board and recommends the appointment 
of new Directors. The Nominations Committee, with all 
Directors present, has held three meetings during the year 
to discuss nomination matters including the appointments 
of D A Brown and S Wyndham-Quin. 
The Nominations Committee terms of reference include: 
(a)  to review the structure, size and composition of 
the Board; 
(b)  to consider succession planning for Directors and 
senior executives; 
(c)  to identify and nominate, for approval by the Board, 
suitable candidates to fill Board vacancies; and 
(d)  to make recommendations to the Board on the 
contents of letters of appointment, Directors’ duties, 
re-appointment or re-election of Directors upon 
conclusion of a specified term or retirement by rotation. 
The Audit Committee has held two meetings to consider 
Audit Committee business. The Audit Committee consists 
of all four non-executive Directors. The Executive Directors 
are invited to attend Audit Committee meetings but at least 
two meetings are held each year with the external Auditor 
at which the Executive Directors are not present. The Audit 
Committee considers the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the risk management and control systems of the Group, 
and reports the results to the Board. It reviews the scope 
and results of the external audit, its cost effectiveness 
and the objectivity of the Auditor. The Audit Committee 
monitors the non-audit work performed by the Auditor 
to help ensure that the independence of the Auditor is 
maintained. All fees paid to the Auditor whether for audit 
or non-audit work are approved by the Audit Committee 
in advance. The Audit Committee also reviews the Interim 
statement, the preliminary announcement, the Annual 
Report and Accounts and accounting policies. 
The Board forms a General Purposes Committee from time 
to time as it deems necessary. This Committee comprises 
any two of the Executive Directors as determined by the 
Board to consider individual business matters, which have 
been specifically delegated to it by the Board. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 31
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Internal controls 
Throughout the financial year ended 30 September 2017 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts, the Group has fully complied with the relevant 
provisions of the Code, other than as disclosed. The Directors 
acknowledge that they have overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing and 
monitoring its effectiveness. The system of internal control is 
designed to manage and mitigate, rather than eliminate, the 
risks to which the Group is exposed and therefore provides a 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against a company 
failing to meet its business objectives or against material 
misstatement or loss. Consequently, the Board confirms that 
there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing significant risks faced by the Group and that it is 
regularly reviewed by the Board. 
The Group operates a risk management process, which is 
embedded in normal management and governance 
processes. There is a system of self-examination of risk areas 
and controls by subsidiaries and departments within the 
Group. Where significant risks are identified, the probability 
of those risks occurring, their potential impact and the plans 
for managing and mitigating each of those risks is reported. 
The Group operates a series of controls which include the 
annual strategic planning and budgeting process, short-term 
cash monitoring achieved by means of weekly forecasts 
which are compared against budget and previous forecasts, 
clearly defined capital investment guidelines and levels of 
authority and a clear organisational structure within which 
individuals’ responsibilities are identified and monitored. 
These results and processes are monitored, updated, 
reviewed and considered by the Board. The Group has 
established a series of minimum standards in a number of 
financial and operational areas with which each business 
within the Group must comply. Group management monitors 
and reviews compliance with these requirements on a 
periodic basis. Due to the size and nature of the Group, the 
Board does not consider that a separate internal audit 
function is necessary. For the last ten years and including 
2017, the Group has carried out a programme of internal audit 
conducted by the Group Commercial Director and by 
members of the various subsidiaries’ finance teams. This 
system of peer review promotes best practice as well as 
ensuring that Group minimum requirements as to procedures 
and internal controls are being complied with. The reports 
from these internal audits are made available both to the 
Board and to the external Auditor. 
Going concern 
The Directors have reviewed the budgets and forecasts 
prepared by the Group and its trading subsidiaries and 
consider that at the time of approving the financial 
statements, there is a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Directors’ remuneration 
The Company’s policy on the remuneration of Executive 
Directors, and information relating to the Directors’ 
remuneration and their interests in share options, is included 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Directors’ and officers’ indemnity 
The Articles of Association provide that each Director or 
other officer or Auditor of the Company shall be indemnified 
by the Company against losses, costs and expenses he may 
sustain or incur in connection with the performance of his 
duties of office, to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
Shareholder relationships 
Members of the Board have dialogue with individual 
shareholders during the year. In addition to the Annual and 
Interim Report and Accounts, the Chairman addresses 
shareholders at the AGM and invites questions to any 
members of the Board. 
The AGM is normally attended by all Directors and provides 
an opportunity for communication with those shareholders 
attending. Notice of the AGM is given to shareholders at least 
21 days in advance and separate resolutions are proposed on 
each substantially separate issue. Where resolutions at the 
AGM are dealt with by show of hands, the results of proxy 
votes for and against are still announced. 
Financial and other information about the Group is available 
on the Company’s website: www.renewholdings.com, from 
which shareholders can also access their shareholding details 
via a link to the website of Link Market Services Limited. 
Annual General Meeting 
The next AGM will be held on 31 January 2018, the Notice for 
which accompanies this Report and Accounts. The Notice 
contains special business relating to the renewal of the 
Board’s power to allot equity shares. Brief details of the 
purpose and effect of the proposed resolutions are enclosed 
with the Notice of AGM. 
Shareholders should complete the proxy form accompanying 
this document in accordance with the notes contained in the 
Notice of AGM.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Directors’ report
The Directors present their report and the audited accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2017. 
Principal activities 
For the year ended 30 September 2017 the principal activity 
of the Group continued to be as contractors in Engineering 
Services and Specialist Building. The main activities are carried 
out in the United Kingdom with some development activities 
in the USA. More details of these activities, the year’s trading 
and future developments are contained in the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Strategic Report 
and the Financial Review. A list of the Group’s subsidiaries as 
at 30 September 2017 is listed in Note T to the Company’s 
financial statements. 
Results and dividends 
The Group profit for the year after accounting for 
discontinued operations was £12,427,000 (2016: 
£10,612,000). The Directors recommend the payment of a 
final dividend on the Ordinary Shares of 6.0p (2016: 5.35p) 
giving a total for the year of 9.0p (2016: 8.0p). 
Business review 
Information that fulfils the business review requirements 
applicable to the Group can be found in this report, the Chief 
Executive’s Review and the Strategic Report. 
Derivatives and other financial instruments 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank 
loans, cash and short-term deposits and obligations under 
finance leases. The main purpose of these financial 
instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations. 
The Group has various other financial instruments such as 
trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from 
its operations. It is, and has been throughout the period 
under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial 
instruments shall be undertaken. The main risks arising from 
the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk. 
Interest rate risk 
Interest bearing assets comprise cash and bank deposits and 
earn interest at floating rates. The Group’s bank loan and 
overdraft facility bear interest at floating rates. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s policy is to ensure availability of operating funds 
by maintaining an appropriate cash balance in both current and 
deposit accounts and, when necessary, to establish appropriate 
levels of borrowing facilities to provide short-term flexibility. 
Foreign currency risk 
As a result of the investment in operations in the United States, 
movements in the US dollar/sterling exchange rate could 
materially affect the Group’s and the Company’s balance sheet. 
As at 30 September 2017 £4,856,000 (2016: £4,363,000) 
of the Group’s net assets are denominated in US dollars. 
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments 
in its management of foreign currency risk. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, 
cash, amounts recoverable on contracts and trade 
receivables, which represent the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its amounts 
recoverable on contracts and trade receivables. Credit risk is 
managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and duration 
of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit 
rating. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net 
of allowances for doubtful debts, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior experience and their 
assessment of the current economic environment. 
Payment of creditors 
The Group recognises the importance of good relationships 
with its suppliers and sub-contractors and has established 
the following payment policy: 
(a)  agree payment terms in advance of any commitment 
being entered into; 
(b)  ensure suppliers are made aware of these terms by 
inclusion of the terms of payment on the order or 
contract; and 
(c)  ensure that payments are made in accordance with the 
terms of the contract or order providing that the 
presented documentation is complete and accurate.
Employees 
The Directors recognise the need for communication with 
employees at every level. All employees have access to a 
copy of the Annual Report and Accounts which, together 
with staff briefings, internal notice-board statements and 
newsletters, keeps them informed of the Group’s progress. 
The Group produces an in-house publication, Renews, which 
provides information to its employees about the activities 
and performance of the Group. 
The Group continues to be committed to the health, safety 
and welfare of its employees and to observe the terms of the 
Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, and all other relevant 
regulatory and legislative requirements.
It is the policy of the Group that there shall be no 
discrimination or less favourable treatment of employees, 
workers or job applicants in respect of race, colour, ethnic 
or national origins, religious beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, 
disability, political beliefs, age or marital status. Full 
consideration will be given to suitable applications for 
employment from disabled persons, where they have the 
necessary abilities and skills for that position, and wherever 
possible to re-train employees who become disabled, so that 
they can continue their employment in another position. 
The Group engages, promotes and trains staff on the basis 
of their capabilities, qualifications and experience, without 
discrimination, giving all employees an equal opportunity 
to progress.  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 33
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Health and safety management 
P Scott, the Chief Executive, was the designated Board 
Director of Health and Safety with Group responsibility for 
safety and environmental management throughout the year. 
Health, safety and environmental management issues and 
reports are reviewed at every Group Board meeting with the 
Head of Department in attendance when necessary. 
The Executive Management Committee, chaired by the 
Chief Executive, discusses and progresses policy, legislative 
changes, best practice, training needs, inspections, audits 
(internal and external), performance measurement and 
statistical information. All topics are discussed with a specific 
focus on improvement. 
Control at business level remains with subsidiary Managing 
Directors who are required to appoint a Director who is 
responsible for safety and environmental matters. Health, 
safety and environmental issues are discussed as the first 
agenda item at monthly Board meetings. Each business 
safety and environmental meeting encourages open 
communication between all employees and is a key part of 
the Group’s efforts to gather and disseminate good practice 
for inclusion in business-based management systems. Our 
safety and environmental standards are contained within 
bespoke business Safety and Environmental Management 
Systems. This system is based on Group activities and 
provides specific standards, procedures, information, forms 
and advice which accommodate changes in legislation 
expected during the coming financial year. Management 
advice is provided by the Group Health, Safety and 
Environmental Director. 
Certain Group companies employ their own specialist 
advisors who liaise directly with the Group HSE Director on 
common issues. The Group maintains its membership with 
the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and locally 
based construction safety groups. All safety and 
environmental department personnel hold membership with 
the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health. 
Attendance on the five day Construction Industry Training 
Board Site Safety Management Training Scheme continues to 
be a requirement for all construction management personnel, 
with a two day refresher required every five years. A one day 
Directors and Senior Managers course is available internally 
and is used to introduce new systems and detail changes to 
construction legislation. Short duration ‘tool box talks’ and 
‘safety briefings’ are used to enhance the knowledge and 
competence of supervisory management. 
Group policy requires each business to report and record all 
injuries, diseases and dangerous occurrences, regardless of 
severity. An incident database is maintained to collate this 
information and provide statistical data allowing performance 
to be measured and determine system amendments and 
future training requirements. A system of Safety and 
Environmental Alerts ensures lessons learnt and changes to 
working practices are rapidly transmitted to our workforce, 
businesses and their contractors. The Accident Incidence 
Rate (“AIR”) for the year measured on the standard base line 
of 100,000 persons at work is a key area where the Group 
measures its performance.

Directors’ remuneration report
The Directors present the Directors’ remuneration report 
(the “Remuneration Report”) for the financial year ended 
30 September 2017. 
As an AIM listed company, Renew is not required to prepare 
this Remuneration Report in accordance with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 or the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (together “the Regulations”). 
However, the Directors recognise the importance, and support 
the principles, of the Regulations and seek to follow them to 
the extent considered relevant for an AIM listed company. The 
Remuneration Committee will continue to monitor market 
practice to ensure that, in future, this report will include 
disclosures at least as good as market practice for AIM 
companies. The Auditor is not required to report to the 
shareholders on the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The Board consults with major shareholders when any 
significant change in the structure or scale of directors’ 
remuneration is being considered and will continue to do 
so. No material matters have been raised by shareholders 
relating to directors’ remuneration during the year. 
D A Brown was appointed to the Board and to the 
Remuneration Committee on 2 April 2017. On 6 February 2017, 
the Company announced that J Samuel had given 12 months’ 
notice of his intention to leave the Company after 11 years’ service. 
As subsequently announced, S Wyndham-Quin will assume 
the role of Group Finance Director on 29 November 2017.
At the last general meeting, votes on the advisory resolution 
relating to the Remuneration Report were cast as follows: 
In favour   – 6,038,854 (98.1 per cent) 
Against    – 1 16,186 (1.9 per cent) 
Total votes cast  – 6,155,040 (100 per cent)
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by D M Forbes and 
also comprises R J Harrison, D A Brown and J Bishop. The 
Committee held three meetings during the financial year to 
discuss remuneration arrangements. 
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference include: 
(a)  to determine and agree with the Board the framework 
and policy for the remuneration packages, including 
bonuses, incentive payments and share options or share 
awards of the Executive Directors and members of the 
Executive Management; 
(b)  to review and approve the design of all share incentive 
plans and performance related pay schemes for approval 
by the Board and shareholders as applicable; 
(c)  to determine targets and awards made under share 
incentive plans and performance related pay schemes; 
(d)  to determine the policy for, and scope of, pension 
arrangements for each Executive Director and other 
senior executives; and 
(e)  to ensure contractual terms and payments made on 
termination are fair to the individual and the Company 
and that failure is not rewarded. 
Non-executive Directors do not have any personal interest 
in the matters to be decided by the Committee other than 
as shareholders, nor any potential conflicts of interest arising 
from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in 
the running of the Company. The Executive Directors and 
other senior personnel may be invited to attend meetings 
when appropriate to provide advice. However, no Director 
is present or takes part in discussions concerning his 
own remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
The Company’s remuneration policy is that the remuneration 
packages of the Executive Directors should be sufficiently 
competitive to attract, retain and motivate those Directors to 
achieve the Company’s objectives, without making excessive 
payments. The remuneration and employment terms of the 
Executive Directors are determined by the Committee by 
comparison with salaries paid to, and terms agreed with, 
directors in similar companies in the same sector and of a similar 
size and after a review of the performance of the individual. 
It is the aim of the Committee to reward Executive Directors 
competitively and on the broad principle that they should 
be in the range of median to upper quartile of remuneration 
paid to senior management of comparable public companies. 
For guidance, the Committee refers to published survey 
data. The Board determines the terms and conditions of 
non-executive Directors. 
There are four main elements to the remuneration packages 
of the Executive Directors and other senior executives: 
 • basic salary and benefits; 
 • annual bonus awards; 
 • long-term equity incentive plans; and 
 • pension arrangements. 
Basic salary and benefits 
Basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration 
Committee, and adjusted where the Committee believes that 
adjustments are appropriate to reflect performance, changed 
responsibilities and/or market conditions. Other benefits 
for Executive Directors include car allowances and certain 
medical cover for Directors and their immediate family. 
The Company also has a permanent health insurance 
policy to provide cover for the Executive Directors.
Annual bonus awards 
It is the Company’s policy to provide a bonus incentive 
scheme for Directors and senior executives of the operating 
companies, linked directly to the performance of the 
businesses for which they are responsible. In the case of the 
Executive Directors other than A.Liebenberg, these relate to 
the performance of the Group as a whole. A.Liebenberg’s 
bonus criteria relate to the performance of the businesses for 
which he is directly responsible. All performance criteria are 
subject to approval by the Remuneration Committee at the 
beginning of a year and all payments are made only when 
approved by the Remuneration Committee. 
Details of the annual bonus scheme for the year under review 
and the following year are set out below. 
Long-term equity incentive plans 
The Remuneration Committee implemented a new long term 
incentive plan (“LTIP”) which was approved at an Extraordinary 
General Meeting (“EGM”) held on 25 January 2012. The LTIP 
has been designed so as to comply with ABI guidelines in all 
material respects and to align a material part of a Director’s 
remuneration more closely with shareholders. 
The performance criteria to be achieved by the Company in 
respect of the LTIP are as follows: 
Vesting of one half of the options is dependent on absolute growth 
in the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), and the other 
half dependent on the Company’s TSR performance as compared 
to the TSR achieved by other companies in a comparator group 
of companies selected by the Remuneration Committee.  Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 36
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy continued
Long-term equity incentive plans continued
The constituents of the comparator group are reconsidered by 
the Remuneration Committee each year. All TSR calculations 
are based on the average of the opening and closing share 
price over a 30 day period prior to the commencement and 
end of the performance period. 
The absolute TSR growth target requires the Company’s TSR over 
the three year performance period to have grown by more than 
25 per cent. For TSR growth between 25 per cent and 100 per 
cent, the half of the option which is subject to the absolute TSR 
growth target vests on a straight-line basis from nil vesting at 25 
per cent growth, to 100 per cent vesting at 100 per cent growth. 
There is no vesting if TSR growth is 25 per cent or less. The 
Remuneration Committee consider this mechanism important 
to ensure that it meets the overall objectives of the LTIP.
In the event of a material correction of any accounts of the 
Company used to assess satisfaction of any performance 
conditions, or in the event of a participant’s gross misconduct, 
options may be reduced, adjusted or cancelled as determined 
by the Remuneration Committee. To the extent that options 
have already been exercised, the Remuneration Committee 
may (having considered all the circumstances) require the 
participant to return any shares received, or the amounts of 
any proceeds of the sale of such shares (net of tax). 
The Renew Holdings plc Executive Share Option Scheme 
(“ESOS”) and the Renew Holdings plc Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme were approved at an EGM held on 11 March 
2004. There are 31,467 options outstanding under the ESOS. 
The Remuneration Committee does not currently intend to 
grant any further options under the Renew Holdings plc Savings 
Related Share Option Scheme. The Company’s policy to grant 
options or awards under the above schemes is at the Remuneration 
Committee’s discretion as and when considered appropriate. 
The Remuneration Committee is empowered to grant a 
maximum number of LTIP options over 10p Ordinary Shares 
equivalent in value to 150 per cent of basic salary per financial 
year. The options may be granted with an exercise price equal 
to their nominal value or as nil cost options. The Company 
also has the ability, but not the obligation, to provide a cash 
alternative to participants equal to the net benefit of their 
LTIP option. This simplifies the settlement process, reducing 
complexity and cost to both the Company and the participant 
and reducing dilution to the shareholders, all whilst preserving 
the overall economic effect of the LTIP award. 
Remuneration for the year ending 
30 September 2017
Service contracts and letters of appointment 
The Company’s policy is for all of the Executive Directors to 
have rolling service contracts that provide for a twelve month 
notice period. 
The fees of non-executive Directors are determined by the 
full Board within the limits set out in the Articles of Association. 
The non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, 
pension benefits, share options or other benefits. The 
Directors are indemnified to the full extent permitted by 
statute under the Articles of Association. All non-executive 
Directors are subject to re-election every 3 years. 
The service contracts of the Directors, who served during the 
year ended 30 September 2017 and were in post on that 
date, include the following terms: 
Directors Executive/Non-executive Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period (months) 
R J Harrison Non-executive 1 February 2009 Rolling one month 1 
J Bishop Non-executive 1 September 2008 Rolling one month 1 
D M Forbes Non-executive 1 June 2011 Rolling one month 1 
D A Brown Non-executive 2 April 2017 Rolling one month 1 
P Scott Executive 1 July 2014 Rolling one year 12 
A Liebenberg Executive 31 March 2016 Rolling one year 12
J Samuel Executive 17 May 2006 Four months 12
Notwithstanding the unexpired term above, it has been agreed that J Samuel will resign from the Board on 29 November 2017 
and will cease employment with the Group at 31 December 2017. S Wyndham-Quin, who was appointed to the Board on 
8 November 2017, also has a rolling one year contract with a twelve month notice period.

Directors’ remuneration continued
Notes:
1.  The highest paid Director for 2017 was J Samuel who 
received emoluments of £946,000. In 2016, the highest 
paid Director was B W May who received emoluments of 
£1,476,000 that year. He retired on 30 September 2016. 
2.  Bonuses were earned by P Scott, A Liebenberg and 
J Samuel during the current financial year and will be 
paid in the year ending 30 September 2018. 
3.  During the year, J Samuel exercised 112,518 LTIPs and 
received a bonus based on notional dividends relating 
to those LTIPs. The gain of £486,000 and the bonus of 
£19,000 totalling £505,000 is included in the table above.
4.  Benefits include car allowances and certain medical cover 
for the Director and immediate family. 
5.  P Scott, A Liebenberg and J Samuel received payments 
amounting to 15 per cent of their basic salary, in lieu 
of Company pension contributions. These were paid 
through payroll and taxed as salary and are included 
in Benefits above. 
6.  D A Brown was appointed as a Director with effect 
from 2 April 2017 and so the emoluments shown above 
represent the six month period ended 30 September 2017. 
7.  All of A Liebenberg’s emoluments were borne by a 
subsidiary undertaking. A Liebenberg was appointed to the 
Board on 31 March 2016 and so the comparative figures 
represent a six month period only.
Annual bonus awards
The Company provides a bonus incentive scheme for 
Executive Directors (other than A Liebenberg) linked to the 
performance of the Group. 
At the beginning of each year, the Remuneration Committee 
agrees a target for operating profit before exceptional items 
for the Group. If the Group meets that target, then the 
Executive Directors receive an annual bonus equal to 
50 per cent of their salary. The level of over and under 
performance causes the level of annual bonus to vary on a 
straight-line basis, with the maximum bonus of 100 per cent 
of salary being paid if the performance exceeds the target 
by 30 per cent with no bonus being payable if performance 
is 50 per cent or more below target. The Remuneration 
Committee makes such adjustments to the target and/or 
results to remove distortions such as acquisitions and disposals 
during the year and other items as they believe are necessary. 
At the beginning of the year ended 30 September 2017, the 
Remuneration Committee agreed a target for operating 
profit before exceptional items for the Group based on the 
structure of the Group on that date. The target was increased 
in November 2016 to £25,318,000 following the acquisition of 
Giffen Holdings Limited. The operating profit before 
exceptional items for the Group exceeded this target by 
approximately 1 per cent. Accordingly, under the terms of the 
scheme, the Executive Directors are entitled to receive an 
annual bonus equal to 51.5 per cent of salary. 
A Liebenberg’s annual bonus arrangements were set in 
relation to the business unit over which he has direct 
responsibility. That business unit’s performance was such 
that A Liebenberg is entitled to receive a bonus of 100% of 
his salary.
Long-term equity incentive plans 
The market price of the Company’s shares at 30 September 2017 
was 414p and the range of market prices during the year was 
between 366p and 487p. 
Information is provided below for Directors who served 
during the financial year and as at 30 September 2017. 
Directors’ share options 
Pursuant to the LTIP and the ESOS, the Board has 
granted options to the Executive Directors as set out 
in the following table. 
The LTIP options are exercisable at a nominal cost but are 
only exercisable to the extent that certain performance 
criteria are achieved by the Company over a three year 
performance period. 
The ESOS options, which have an exercise price of 286p 
per share, are used solely to enable beneficiaries to take 
advantage of the approved nature of the ESOS for a limited 
proportion of the LTIP award. The same performance criteria 
apply to the ESOS options, which cannot be exercised until 
the same date as the related LTIP options. To the extent that 
there is a gain arising on the ESOS options at the date of 
exercise, the option holder will forfeit LTIP options to the 
same value immediately.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Directors’ share options continued
During the year, options awarded on 3 January 2014 and 
27 January 2016 amounting to 273,503 shares in aggregate, 
vested in accordance with their vesting conditions. These 
options were subsequently exercised on 13 January 2017 
and 160,985 shares were issued to B W May and 112,518 
shares to J Samuel at 434p per share prior to dealing costs. 
Additionally, following his retirement from the Board, B W 
May was entitled to exercise a proportion of LTIP and CSOP 
options which had been awarded on 7 January 2015. He 
exercised these options on 17 March 2017 which resulted in 
his acquiring a further 42,158 shares at 458p. All of B W May’s 
option entitlements have now been exercised. The level of 
vesting reflects the substantial rise in earnings per share, 
share price and total shareholder return during the vesting 
period. In addition, and in accordance with the rules of the 
LTIP, payments of £30,000 and £19,000 were made to 
B W May and J Samuel respectively representing dividends 
accrued during the vesting period on the shares vested 
as detailed above. 
Following the notice of resignation of J Samuel, the 
number of options granted to him on 27 January 2016 and on 
24 November 2016 has been prorated to reflect the reduced 
vesting period, in accordance with the rules of the LTIP. 
The reduced entitlements have been reflected in the table 
above and show the maximum number of options to which 
J Samuel is entitled. They remain subject to performance 
criteria. All of J Samuel’s outstanding options must be 
exercised by 30 June 2018.

No Director has pension entitlements under the Group’s 
defined benefit pension scheme arrangements. The Group 
has established individual stakeholder plans for each 
employee who elects to join into which the Group makes 
contributions; P Scott, A Liebenberg and J Samuel receive a 
sum equivalent to 15 per cent of their basic salary in lieu of 
pension contributions from the Company.
Following the adoption of new Articles of Association at the 
AGM on 28 January 2009, the restriction on the retirement 
age of the Executive Directors was removed. 
Directors’ share interests
Those Directors serving at the end of the year and their 
immediate families had interests in the share capital of the 
Company at 30 September 2017 as follows:

Remuneration for the year ending 
30th September 2018
Basic salary and benefits
The basic salaries of P Scott, A Liebenberg and J Samuel 
have increased by 3% to £283,250, £210,120 and £260,786 
respectively with effect from 1 October 2017. The increases 
for the executive Directors are very closely aligned to the 
average annual pay award across the Group as a whole 
excluding rises for promotions or other changes in 
responsibility. There have been no material changes in the 
benefits which the Directors are entitled to receive. 
Annual bonus awards 
The annual bonus scheme for the year ending 30 September 
2018 is close to agreement. The structure of the scheme is 
similar to the scheme for the previous year as set out above, 
in all material respects (except for the targets). Executive 
Directors will therefore be entitled to receive a bonus of 
50 per cent of their basic salary if the Group achieves target 
operating profit and a maximum of 100 per cent of their basic 
salary if the Group achieves 130 per cent of target operating 
profit. No bonus will be paid if the Group achieves 50 per cent 
or less of target operating profit. Targets for A Liebenberg will 
relate to the business unit(s) over which he has direct 
management responsibility as was the case last year. 
Long-term equity incentive plan 
The Remuneration Committee have made annual awards under 
the LTIP since it was set up in 2012 and will do so again this 
year. Each award has been made shortly after the publication 
of the Company’s annual results, or in circumstances where 
the rules are being amended at the company’s AGM, then 
shortly after that meeting. It is expected that the next 
award will be announced shortly after the publication of the 
Company’s annual results. Awards for each participant in 
the Scheme are limited in amount to 150 per cent of that 
participants basic salary. The fourth tranche of options 
granted under the LTIP, granted on 8 January 2015 as 
detailed above, will vest during the coming year subject 
to the performance criteria contained therein. 
Approval
The Directors’ Remuneration Report was approved by the 
Board on 21 November 2017 and signed on its behalf by:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
in respect of the Strategic report, the Annual Report and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
As required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU) and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable 
law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including 
FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the 
UK and Republic of Ireland.
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and Parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
 • make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, 
relevant, reliable and prudent; 
 • for the Group financial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU;
 • for the parent Company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; 
 • assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern; and 
 • use the going concern basis of accounting unless they 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report and a Directors’ 
Report that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40

Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Renew Holdings plc
1. Our opinion is unmodified

Equity, Group Balance Sheet, Group Cashflow Statement, 
Company Balance Sheet, Company Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, Company Statement of Changes 
in Equity and the related notes, including the accounting 
policies in note 1.
In our opinion:

state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as 
at 30 September 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
 • the group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial

properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting 
standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland; and

with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified 
by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In 
arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Carrying value of contract 
balances 
(£111.9 million; 2016: £87.4 million)
Refer to page 49 
(accounting policy) and 
page 62 (financial disclosures)
Subjective Estimate:
The Group’s operating activities are 
primarily long-term contracts.
The carrying value of the contract 
balance is based on estimates of 
costs to complete and the level of 
contract variations.
Estimated contract costs are 
impacted by a variety of 
uncertainties that depend on the 
outcome of future events, that could 
result in revisions throughout the 
contract period.
Our procedures included: 
 • Test of detail: Identifying a sample of contracts 
with risk indicators including: low margin or 
loss-making contracts, high values of variations 
and large carrying value of amounts receivable 
on contracts. For these contracts, where 
possible, we agreed the year-end contract 
balance to the cash recovered post period end 
and/or the third party work certified to date;
 • Test of detail: Where cash has not been 
received or work has not been certified post 
year end, challenging the directors in respect of 
contract balances in the sample identified, by 
obtaining the detailed project review papers 
from the Group to support the estimates made 
and challenged the judgements underlying 
those papers with senior operational, 
commercial and financial management, 
compared to our knowledge of the business;
 • Test of detail: Assessing the forecasted cost to 
complete in the sample identified by 
considering contract performance and costs 
incurred post year-end along with discussions 
and challenge of the judgements underlying the 
positions taken with senior operational, 
commercial and financial management, 
compared to our knowledge of the business; 
 • H i s t or i ca l c om p a r i s on s : Assessing the 
forecasting accuracy of contract margins by 
evaluating initial forecasted margins for a 
sample of contracts across the portfolio against 
actual margins achieved; and
 • Assessing transparency: Assessing the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of the accounting policies on long-term 
contracts and judgements and estimates, set 
out in notes 1 and 1(a). Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 42

to contracts 
(£558.6 million; 2016: 
£525.7 million)
Refer to page 50 (accounting 
policy) and pages 53 and 54 
(financial disclosures).
Subjective Estimate:
Group revenue and profit recognition 
involves judgement in interpreting 
margin expectation and final 
account conclusions.
The application of long-term 
contract accounting results in the 
need for regularly assessing the 
forecast costs to complete over the 
life of a contract. The subjectivity 
involved in such decisions results in a 
significant risk of misstatement of the 
forecast costs to complete, such that 
recognised revenue and profit could 
be incorrectly accounted for.
Our procedures included: 
 • Test of detail: For a sample of contracts we 
agreed the year-end contract balance to the 
cash recovered post period end and/or the third 
party work certified to date, in order to 
determine whether the revenue was recognised 
accurately and in the correct period;
 • Test of detail: Challenging the directors in 
respect of revenue recognised in the sample 
identified, where cash has not been received or 
work has not been certified post year-end, by 
obtaining the detailed project review papers 
from the Group to support the estimates made 
and challenged the judgements underlying 
those papers with senior operational, 
commercial and financial management, 
compared to our knowledge of the business;
 • H i s t or i ca l c om p a r i s on s : Performing a 
retrospective review for contracts completed 
during the current year by comparing the final 
outcome of the contracts with previous estimates 
made for those contracts to assess the reliability 
of the directors’ forecasting process; 
 • Test of detail: Inspecting a sample of contract 
agreements with customers to identify key 
terms and conditions, including contracting 
parties, the contract period, contract sum, the 
scope of work and evaluating whether these 
key terms and conditions had been 
appropriately reflected in the total estimated 
revenue and costs to complete in the forecast 
of the outcome of the contract; and
 • Assessing transparency: assessing the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of the accounting policies on revenue 
recognition set out in note 1(iii).

Refer to page 76 
(accounting policy) and

Forecast-based subjective 
valuation (parent Company 
key audit matter):
The recoverable amount of company 
investments is subjective due to the 
inherent uncertainty involved in 
forecasting and discounting their 
future cash flows. 
The discounted expected future 
cashflows are based on assumptions 
of forecast future financial 
performance, which inherently 
contain an element of judgement 
and uncertainty. 
Significant assumptions in the 
forecast future financial performance 
include sales growth rates, operating 
margins and the discount rate 
applied to future cash flows.
Our procedures included: 
 • Our sector experience: Evaluating the 
assumptions used, in particular those relating to 
forecast revenue growth and profit margins to 
our knowledge of the business and external 
benchmarks where appropriate;
 • B e n c h ma r k i n g a s s u m p ti o ns: Comparing 
the assumptions to externally derived data 
in relation to key inputs such as projected 
economic growth, cost inflation and 
discount rates;
 • Sen si t i v i t y a n a l y si s Performing breakeven 
analysis on the assumptions noted above; and
 • C om p a r i n g v a lu a t i on s : Comparing the 
carrying value of the company’s investments 
to the market capitalisation to assess the 
reasonableness of those valuations.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3. Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £0.8 million (2016: £1.0 million), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Group Profit Before Income Tax 
(of which it represents 4.9% (2016: 5.2%)). 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements 
as a whole was set at £0.75 million (2016: £0.95 million), 
determined with a reference to a benchmark of company 
net assets of which it represents 1.0% (2016: 1.4%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any 
corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements 
exceeding £0.04 million (2016: £0.05 million), in addition 
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 28 (2016: 28) reporting components, 
we subjected 26 (2016: 27) to full scope audits for 
group purposes. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted 
for the percentages illustrated opposite. 
The work on 26 of the 28 components (2016: 27 of the 28 
components), including the audit of the parent company,

statements. We have nothing to report in these respects.
5. We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements 
audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit 
knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information.
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
 • we have not identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report and the directors’ report; 
 • in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 • in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
6.  We have nothing to report on the other 
matters on which we are required to report 
by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:

agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
 • we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7 .  Respectiv e responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 39, 
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
assessing the Group and, parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on 
the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom 
we owe our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the accounts
1 Accounting policies 
Presentation of consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU (“adopted IFRSs”). The financial statements are presented in sterling since this is the currency 
in which the majority of the Group’s transactions are denominated.
Accounting estimates and judgements
In the preparation of these financial statements the Board has made certain judgements and estimates which impact the 
measurement of various assets and liabilities in the Group balance sheet, the value of transactions recorded in the Group 
income statement and the movements in equity as shown in the Group statement of changes in equity. The actual financial 
outcomes may ultimately differ from that which is indicated by these judgements and estimates. Estimates and judgements 
are reviewed by management and the Board on an ongoing basis and changes which may arise in them are reflected in the 
financial statements for the period in which such changes are made.
The Board has determined that the following areas are those in which estimates and judgements have been made and where 
material impacts could arise in the financial statements were such estimates and judgements to be varied.
a) Accounting for construction contracts in accordance with IAS 11 “Construction Contracts”
IAS 11 requires management to estimate the total expected costs on a contract and the stage of contract completion in order 
to determine both the revenue and profit to be recognised in an accounting period. The Group has control and review 
procedures in place to monitor, and evaluate regularly, the estimates being made to ensure that they are consistent and 
appropriate. This includes reviewing the independent certification of the value of work done, the progress of work against 
contracted timescales and the costs incurred against plan. 
b) Impairment of goodwill in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”
In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is tested annually for impairment by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the 
recoverable amount which is determined by an estimation of the value in use of the related cash generating unit to which the 
goodwill is attributed. The calculation of the value in use requires estimates to be made of the future cash flows of the cash 
generating unit and the timescale over which they will arise. Estimated growth rates and discount factors are also used in the 
calculation to estimate the net present value of the cash flows. More information is given in Note 10 to these financial statements.
c) Accounting for the defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”
Independent actuaries calculate the Group’s asset/liability in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes. The actuaries 
make assumptions as to discount rates, salary escalations, net interest on scheme assets/liabilities, future pension increases, 
mortality rates applicable to members and future rates of inflation. These assumptions are made under the Board’s direction. 
The Board determines the appropriateness of these assumptions by benchmarking them against those used by other schemes 
and by taking advice from the independent actuaries. If the actual experience of the schemes is different from the assumptions 
used then the pension asset/liability may differ from that shown in these financial statements. More information is given in 
Note 27 to these financial statements.
d) Accounting for provisions in accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets”
The Group makes provisions where the Board determines that liabilities exist but where judgements have to be made as to the 
quantification of such liabilities. A provision has been made for onerous lease contracts in respect of property leases where the 
Board has determined that the expected economic benefits to be derived from the leases are less than the unavoidable cost of 
meeting the Group’s obligations under the lease contract. This arises where the Group is the head lessee for a property lease 
contract where the property is not used by the Group and where the Group has not been able to sublet the property or has 
only been able to do so on terms which are less favourable than those of the head lease. 
e) Accounting for deferred taxation in accordance with IAS 12 “Income Taxes”
The Group provides for deferred taxation using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognised in 
respect of tax losses where the Directors believe that it is probable that future profits will be relieved by the benefit of tax 
losses brought forward. The Board considers the likely utilisation of such losses by reviewing budgets and medium term plans 
for each taxable entity within the Group. If the actual profits earned by the Group’s taxable entities are different from the 
budgets and forecasts used then the value of such deferred tax assets may differ from that shown in these financial statements.
f) Accounting for discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current assets held 
for sale and discontinued operations”
A non-current asset or a group of assets containing a non-current asset (a disposal group) is classified as held for sale if its 
carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale 
and sale is highly probable within one year. On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are 
measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss. 
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent re-measurement although gains are not recognised in excess of any 
cumulative impairment loss. Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining 
assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, 
employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policies. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale or distribution are not amortised 
or depreciated. In accordance with IFRS 5, the above policy is effective from the start of the accounting period in which the 
operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 50
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the accounts continued
1 Accounting policies continued
f) Accounting for discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current assets held for 
sale and discontinued operations” continued
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view 
to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be 
classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income 
statement is restated as if the operation has been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
(i) Basis of accounting and preparation
The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with applicable accounting standards under 
the historical cost convention. In determining that the going concern basis is appropriate the Directors have reviewed budgets, 
including cashflow forecasts, and concluded that the Group has adequate cash resources to continue trading for the 
foreseeable future.
Prior Year Adjustment
In previous years, the Group has provided for deferred tax on its pension scheme surplus at the rate of corporation tax expected 
to be prevailing in the future, provided that the relevant legislation had been enacted. In the year ended 30 September 2016, a 
rate of 18% was used. It has now become clear to the Board that, in line with tax legislation which applies in the event of a refund 
of a surplus on the winding up of the pension scheme, that a tax rate of 35% should be applied. Consequently, the Board has 
restated the opening Balance Sheet as at 1 October 2015 to reflect the above. As at that date, the effect of the correction of 
this prior period error is to increase deferred tax liabilities associated with the Retirement Benefit Asset by £2,576,000 with a 
corresponding reduction in net assets of the Group. As at 30 September 2016, for the same reason, the deferred tax liability 
has been increased by £1,309,000 compared to that previously reported. During the preparation of these financial statements, 
the Directors also became aware of inaccuracies in the corporation tax creditor at that date. Correcting these resulted in an 
£833,000 reduction in the corporation tax creditor at that date. The net impact of these adjustments is to reduce net assets 
by £476,000 at 30 September 2016. 
The amendments related to the pension scheme tax primarily relate to movements in Other Comprehensive Income. As such 
adjustments have been made to Other Comprehensive Income in 2016 and the total comprehensive income for the year ended 
30 September 2016 is now £1,335,000 compared to the previously recorded loss of £765,000. Following the adjustments made 
in respect of this matter, there has been no change in income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2016 and as a 
result there has been no change to either the Income Statement or the Cash Flow Statement for 2016.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted for use in the EU. The Group 
has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and the International Financial Reporting 
Committee relevant to its operations and which are effective in respect of these financial statements.
The following new or revised International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted, where 
applicable, for the purpose of preparing future financial statements. The Group has carried out a systematic review to ensure 
that the impact and effects of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 are fully understood and any necessary changes to current accounting 
procedures can be implemented in time. In respect of IFRS 15 the Group has reviewed all of its existing major contracts and 
does not consider that any material adjustments to recorded revenue or to its accounting policies are required. In respect 
of IFRS 16, no material net impact from the adoption of this new standard is expected, although assets and liabilities will 
increase correspondingly. IFRS 9 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The Group has chosen not to adopt any of the standards and interpretations noted below earlier than required.
International Financial Reporting Standards Applies to periods beginning after
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with customers January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases January 2019
(ii) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. The results and net assets 
of undertakings acquired are included in the Group income statement and balance sheet using the acquisition method of 
accounting. The results of undertakings acquired/disposed of are included from the date the Group obtains/loses control 
as defined in IFRS 10.
The Group’s interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method the Group’s share of the 
profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement and its interest in their net assets is included 
in Investment in joint venture in the consolidated balance sheet. Where the share of losses exceeds the Group’s interest in the 
entity and there is no obligation to fund these losses, the carrying value is reduced to nil, following which no further losses are 
recognised. 
(iii) Revenue
Revenue, which excludes intra-group revenue and Value Added Tax, comprises:
 • value of work executed during the year on construction contracts based on monthly valuations; and
 • sales of land which are recorded upon legal completion. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 51
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies continued
(iv) Construction contracts
Contract revenue includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract work and claims to the 
extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue and expenses are 
recognised in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion is determined by surveys of 
work performed. Contract costs incurred that relate to future activities are deferred and recognised as amounts recoverable 
on contracts. When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised 
as an expense immediately. To the extent that progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised 
losses) they are recognised as amounts due to construction contract customers.
(v) Segment reporting
The operating segments are based on the components that the Board, the Group’s principal decision-making body (the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker), monitors in making decisions about operating matters. Such components are identified on the 
basis of information that is provided internally in the form of monthly management account reporting, budgets and forecasts 
to formulate allocation of resources to segments and to assess performance. Revenue from reportable segments is measured 
on a basis consistent with the income statement. Revenue is principally generated from within the UK, the Group’s country of 
domicile. Segment results show the contribution directly attributable to each segment in arriving at the Group’s operating 
profit. Segment assets and liabilities comprise those assets and liabilities directly attributable to each segment. Group 
eliminations represent such consolidation adjustments that are necessary to determine the Group’s assets and liabilities.
(vi) Intangible assets
a)  Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value 
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date 
of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is tested for impairment annually, or on such other occasions that 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
  On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill which has not been subject to 
impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
b)  Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The cost of intangible 
assets is amortised over their expected useful lives. These intangibles relate to customer relationships and contractual rights 
and are amortised over the period over which the Board has determined that future cash flows are likely to arise from these 
relationships and rights.
(vii) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less provision for impairment if required.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land. Provision is made at rates calculated 
to write off the cost of each asset, less estimated residual value, evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold land  - no depreciation charge
Freehold buildings - fifty years
Plant, vehicles and equipment - three to ten years
(viii) Impairments
Goodwill arising on acquisitions and other assets that has an indefinite useful life and is therefore not subject to amortisation, is 
reviewed at least annually for impairment. Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment 
whenever there is any indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of any 
asset is less than its carrying amount, a loss on impairment is recognised. Recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the 
asset less any costs which would be incurred in selling the asset and its value in use. Value in use is assessed by discounting the 
estimated future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. For this purpose, assets are grouped into cash generating units 
which represent the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are 
not reversed in future accounting periods. Reversals of other impairment losses are recognised in income when they arise. 
(ix) Inventories
Inventories comprise land and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes 
appropriate attributable overheads and excludes interest. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and 
defective inventories.
(x) Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at their fair value and then at amortised cost.
(xi) Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at their fair value and then at amortised cost.
(xii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original 
maturities of less than three months, net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings within current 
liabilities in the balance sheet. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 52
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the accounts continued
1 Accounting policies continued
(xiii) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and where 
it is probable that an outflow will be required to settle that obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated.
(xiv) Leasing commitments
Assets held under finance leases, where substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset have been transferred 
to the Group, are capitalised and are depreciated in accordance with the depreciation policy for the relevant class of asset. 
The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the income statement and represents a constant proportion of 
the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on 
a straight-line basis the term of the lease.
(xv) Defined benefit pension schemes
Pension scheme assets are measured using market values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit 
actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and 
currency to the liability. Any increase in the present value of liabilities within the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes 
expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to the income statement. The Group determines the net 
interest income/(expense) on the net defined benefit asset/(liability) for the period by applying the discount rate as determined 
at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit asset/(liability) taking account of changes arising as a result 
of contributions and benefit payments. This is recognised in the income statement. Movements in actuarial measurement of 
the net defined benefit asset/(liability) is recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Pension 
scheme surpluses, to the extent they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face 
of the Group balance sheet.
(xvi) Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
(xvii) Taxation
The tax charge is composed of current tax and deferred tax, calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Current tax and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income statement, except 
when they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the relevant tax is also dealt with in equity.
Current tax is based on the profit for the year. Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. 
Deferred tax on such assets and liabilities is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the 
Group intends to settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis.
(xviii) Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The income 
statements of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rate of exchange ruling throughout the financial 
year. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Exchange differences arising from this policy and arising on the retranslation of the opening net assets are taken directly 
to reserves. All other exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
(xix) Financial instruments
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: trade receivables and financial assets at fair value. The Board assigns 
financial assets to each category on initial recognition dependant on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The 
categorisation of these assets is reconsidered at each reporting date at which a choice of categorisation or accounting 
treatment is available. All financial assets are recognised whenever the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions 
of the financial instrument. All such assets are initially recognised at fair value. Derecognition of such assets occurs when the 
Group’s right to receive cash flows from the asset ceases or the rights and rewards of ownership have been transferred. All 
such assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Interest and other cash flows which arise from holding a financial 
asset are recognised in the income statement in accordance with IAS39. Financial assets at fair value include assets classified 
as held for trading, and changes in fair value are recognised through the income statement. Trade receivables are non-
derivative financial assets with expected receipts which are not quoted in an active market and they arise when the Group 
provides goods or services. A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective 
evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more 
events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. An impairment loss in respect of a financial 
asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying value amount, and the present value of 
the estimated cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. All impairment losses are recognised in the income 
statement. Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial 
instrument. All interest related charges are recognised as an expense in the income statement. Bank loans and hire purchase 
liabilities are entered into to provide financing for the Group’s operations and are recognised as funds are received. Financial 
liabilities are measured at amortised cost. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 53
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies continued
(xx) Share based payments
IFRS 2 “Share Based Payment” requires a fair value to be established for any equity settled share based payments. Fair value 
has been independently measured using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Directors’ 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
(xxi) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing 
the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding in the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which 
comprise share options granted to employees.
(xxii) Rental income
Rental income from property is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income, over the term of the lease.
(xxiii) Finance income and expense
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in income or 
expense. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in income or expense, using the effective interest method. Finance expense 
comprises interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and losses on hedging instruments that are 
recognised in income or expense. All borrowing costs are recognised in income or expense using the effective interest method.
2 Segmental analysis
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is responsible for the overall resource allocation and performance assessment 
of the Group. The Board approves major capital expenditure and assesses the performance of the Group and its progress 
against the strategic plan through monitoring key performance indicators. The Board also determines key financing decisions 
such as raising equity, all loan or bank borrowing arrangements and the granting of security over the Group’s assets. As such 
the Group considers that the Board is the CODM.
Operating segments have been identified based on the internal reporting information provided to the CODM. From such 
information Engineering Services and Specialist Building have been determined to represent operating segments. Following 
the identification of the operating segments the Group has assessed the similarity of the characteristics of the operating 
segments. Given the different performance targets and markets operated within each operating segment it is not appropriate 
to aggregate the operating segments for reporting purposes and therefore both of the identified operating segments are 
disclosed as reportable segments. The information received by the CODM shows results both pre and post exceptional items. 
The Group had one customer within the Engineering Services sector which represented 34.3% (2016: 38.2%) of Group revenue. 
No other customer represented more than 10% of the Group’s revenue.
The segments are:
 • Engineering Services, which comprises the Group’s engineering activities which are characterised by the use of the Group’s 
skilled engineering workforce, supplemented by specialist subcontractors where appropriate, in a range of civil, mechanical 
and electrical engineering applications and;
 • Specialist Building, which comprises the Group’s building activities which are characterised by the use of a supply chain of 
subcontractors to carry out building works under the control of the Group as principal contractor and;
 • Central activities, which include the sale of land, the leasing and sub-leasing of some UK properties and the provision of 
central services to the operating subsidiaries.
On 31 October 2014, the Group entered into a contract to dispose of part of its Specialist Building segment. The results of that 
business are shown as a discontinued operation.  Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 54

Following the decision in April 2017 to withdraw from the loss-making low pressure, small diameter gas pipe replacement 
activities of Forefront Utilities Ltd, the Board has carried out a review of the carrying value of goodwill attributable to that 
cash generating unit which has resulted in an impairment charge of £5,800,000.
The Board has separately identified the charge of £2,280,000 (2016: £2,954,000) for the amortisation of the fair value 
ascribed to certain intangible assets, other than goodwill, arising from the acquisitions of Amco Group Holdings Ltd, Lewis 
Civil Engineering Ltd, Clarke Telecom Ltd, Forefront Group Ltd and Giffen Holdings Ltd. Further details are given in Note 10.

Directors’ share options
Pursuant to the long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) and Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”), the Board has granted 
options to the Executive Directors as set out in the following table.
The LTIP options are exercisable at a nominal cost but are only exercisable to the extent that certain performance criteria are 
achieved by the Company over a three year performance period.
The ESOS options, which have an exercise price of 286p per share, are used solely to enable beneficiaries to take advantage of 
the approved nature of the ESOS for a limited proportion of the LTIP award. The same performance criteria apply to the ESOS 
options, which cannot be exercised until the same date as the related LTIP options. To the extent that there is a gain arising on 
the ESOS options at the date of exercise, the option holder will forfeit LTIP options to the same value immediately.

Timing differences not provided for in deferred tax arise principally from the utilisation of tax losses not previously recognised.
Finance (No 2) Bill 2017 includes legislation, effective from 1 April 2017, that limits the use of brought forward losses in any year. 
The bill was substantively enacted on 31 October 2017. Had the bill been enacted on 30 September 2017 or earlier, the effect of 
the legislation would have been to increase the Group’s current tax charge and liability at 30 September 2017 (which has been 
calculated without reference to the annual restriction on the use of brought forward losses) by £0.2m. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 58

(b) Factors affecting income tax expense for the year continued
Deferred tax has been provided at a rate of 17% (2016: 18%) which will be the effective corporation tax rate from 1 April 2020. 
The Group has available further unused UK tax losses of £36m (2016: £39m) to carry forward against future taxable profits. 
The Group also has unused USA tax losses of $20m (£14.9m) (2016: $18m (£14.2m)) to carry forward against future taxable profits 
in the USA. A substantial element of these losses relates to activities which are not forecast to generate the level of profits needed 
to utilise these losses. A deferred tax asset has been provided to the extent considered reasonable by the Directors, where recovery 
is expected to be recognisable within the foreseeable future. The unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of these losses 
amounts to £8.6m (2016: £9.9m).

Goodwill of £7,523,000 was acquired on the acquisition of Giffen Holdings Ltd and was reviewed for impairment one year after 
the acquisition and then will be on an ongoing basis as required by IFRS 3. No impairment was identified. Further details are 
given in Note 29.
Goodwill impairment
Following the decision in April 2017 to withdraw from the loss-making low pressure, small diameter gas pipe replacement 
activities of Forefront Utilities Ltd, the Board has carried out a review of the carrying value of goodwill attributable to that cash 
generating unit which has resulted in an impairment charge of £5,800,000. Forefront Utilities Ltd forms part of the Engineering 
Services segment.
Amortisation charges in respect of intangible assets with a finite life are recorded within administrative expenses in the income 
statement. The amortisation policy is disclosed in the accounting policies and approximates to a period of four years.
In order to test goodwill for impairment the Group performs value in use calculations by preparing cash flow forecasts for each 
cash generating unit derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management going 
forward three years, and then extrapolates cash flows based on conservative estimated growth rates according to 
management’s view of longer term prospects for each CGU. The CGUs are deemed to be the subsidiaries to which the 
goodwill relates. Management used growth rates deemed to be appropriate to each CGU after reviewing the particular market 
conditions related to the sector in which each CGU operates. A growth rate of 3% (2016: 3%-5%) per annum has been used. 
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 8% (2016: 8%). The Board considers the rate appropriate as, based on 
publicly available information, it represents the rate that a market participant would require for these assets. The Board does 
not consider that there is any material difference between the markets of the CGUs to require different discount rates to be 
used. The Board has chosen the discount rate having taken into account the cost of funds to the Group and the risks 
associated with the markets in which the CGUs operate. Other than changes to the discount rate, the key assumption which 
would impact the carrying value of goodwill is the margin generated by each CGU. Whilst the sensitivities vary according to 
CGU, for a material impairment to take place the discount rate would have to increase by 20% (2016: 10%) or the assumed 
operating margins would have to decrease by more than 10% (2016: 10%) before any impact on any single CGU.  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 61

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain of its plant, vehicles and equipment under finance leases. The average outstanding 
lease term is 3 years (2016: 3 years). For the year ended 30 September 2017, the average effective borrowing rate was 3% 
(2016: 3%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangement has 
been entered into for contingent rental payments.
All lease obligations are denominated in sterling. The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates to their carrying 
amount. The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured on the asset to which the lease relates. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 64

Financial risks
The Group has exposure to a number of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. Risk management is governed by 
the Group’s operational policies, guidelines and authorisation procedures which are outlined in the Corporate governance 
statement. The key financial risks resulting from financial instruments are credit, liquidity, currency and market risk.
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss if a customer fails to meet its financial obligations and results primarily from the Group’s trade and 
other receivables. The degree to which the Group is exposed to this risk depends on the individual financial situation of each 
specific customer. The Group assesses the credit worthiness of every customer prior to entering into any contract and requires 
appropriate evidence of financial capability on a case by case basis. The Group reviews trade and other receivables for 
impairment on a regular basis and information relating to the ageing of receivables is provided in Note 15. The Group does not 
use any form of invoice discounting or debt factoring.
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Board is responsible 
for ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due and does so by monitoring 
cashflow forecasts and budgets. The Board has considered the cashflow forecasts for the next twelve months which show 
that the Group expects to operate within its working capital facilities throughout the year.
The Board aims to maintain a strong capital base so as to ensure investor and market confidence and to sustain the future of 
the business. The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the Company as disclosed 
in Note 23 and reserves as disclosed in Note 24. The Group arranges loans and short term overdraft facilities and hire purchase 
facilities as the Board deems necessary. The Group does not have any derivative or non-derivative financial liabilities other 
than those disclosed in Notes 19 and 20 and the retirement benefit obligations disclosed in Note 27. An analysis of the maturity 
profile for finance lease liabilities is given in Note 20.
c) Currency risk
The principal exposure of the Group to currency risk (i.e. exposure to gains or losses on foreign exchange which would be 
recognised in the income statement) is in respect of an inter-company loan. At 30 September 2017 the loan was $4,521,000 
(2016: $2,771,000). The dollar closing exchange rate was $1.34: £1 (2016: $1.30: £1) resulting in a foreign exchange charge of 
£121,000 (2016: gain of £323,000) being charged/(credited) to finance costs. Consequently, since the loan is not hedged, the 
income statement is impacted by exchange rate movements. Exchange rate movements on translation of Lovell America, Inc’s 
net assets are charged to the cumulative translation adjustment within total equity. The exchange loss arising on the 
translation of Lovell America Inc’s net assets was £42,000. The total equity statement would be impacted by £18,000 for each 
$0.01 movement in exchange rates.
All functional currencies of the Group operations are denominated in sterling, with the exception of the US operations whose 
functional currency is the US dollar.
d) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Group’s income or the carrying amount of its holding of 
financial instruments. The principal risk relates to interest rates where the Group’s risk is limited to the rates applying to its 
interest bearing short-term deposits and its bank loan. A reduction in market interest rates could lead to a reduction in the 
Group’s interest income and a reduction in its interest costs. Consequently a 1% decrease in market interest rates would reduce 
annual finance costs by £10,000 for every £1m of outstanding loan. 
The Group’s hire purchase financial liabilities are all at fixed rates of interest.

Share options
Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme
The Group operates a share option scheme, the Renew Holdings plc 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme. The scheme has 
both an Approved and Unapproved element. The difference between the two elements is that the Approved scheme has the 
advantage of certain HMRC approved tax benefits.
Both elements have the same general terms and conditions. Options issued under the scheme must be held for three years 
before they can vest and become exercisable. They must be exercised within ten years from the date of grant. 
As at 30 September 2017, there were 31,467 options outstanding under the scheme. During the year 10,489 options were 
exercised. 31,467 options are in issue under the Approved scheme at an exercise price of 286p. These options are subject to 
the same performance criteria as options issued under the long term incentive plan described below. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 66

Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan
At the Annual General Meeting held on 25 January 2012 the shareholders approved a new long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) 
which succeeded the Renew Holdings plc 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme as the Directors believed that the LTIP was a 
more effective method of aligning executive and shareholder interests. 
As at 30 September 2017, there were 550,133 options outstanding under the scheme. On 24 November 2016, options to 
subscribe for a further 243,100 Ordinary Shares were granted. During the year 305,172 options were exercised. 137,995 options 
lapsed during the year.
The options are exercisable at a nominal cost or at the par value of an Ordinary Share three years after the date of grant subject 
to the achievement of certain performance criteria. Details of the options are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
To the extent that there is a gain arising in respect of the approved options noted above, the option holder will forfeit LTIP 
options to the same value.
Vesting of one half of the options is dependant on absolute growth in the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), and the 
other half is dependant on the Company’s TSR performance as compared to the TSR achieved by other companies in a 
comparator group of companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. All TSR calculations are based on the average of 
the opening and closing share price over a 30 day period prior to the commencement and the end of the performance period.
The absolute TSR growth target requires the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period to grow by more than 
25%. For TSR growth between 25% and 100%, the half of the option which is subject to the absolute TSR growth target vests on 
a straight-line basis from nil vesting at 25% growth, to 100% vesting at 100% growth. There will be no vesting if TSR growth is 
25% or less.
The comparator group TSR performance target measures the Company’s TSR over the 3 year performance period against the 
TSR of a group of companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. If the Company’s TSR performance falls below the 
median performance of the comparator group then the options lapse forthwith. If the Company is ranked within the top decile 
of the comparator group the options shall vest in full. If the Company’s TSR performance is ranked between the median position 
and the top decile of the comparator group then the options shall vest on a straight line basis from nil, at or below the median 
position, to 100% at the top decile.

Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan
Fair value has been independently measured by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP using a Monte Carlo model methodology. The 
fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Board’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
£109,000 (2016: £244,000) has been charged to administrative expenses in accordance with IFRS 2. There is no impact on net 
assets since an equivalent amount has been credited to the share based payments reserve. 305,172 options were exercised 
during the year. The value per option represents the fair value of the option less the consideration payable.
The expected volatility has been calculated based on weekly historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the 
three years prior to the date of grant. The risk free rate of return has been based on the yields available on three year 
UK government bonds as at the date of grant.

Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, the Lovell Pension Scheme and the Amco Pension Scheme. Both 
schemes have been closed to new members and to further benefits accrual for many years.
IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”
The Directors have adopted the accounting required by IAS 19 with effect from the transition date. The Directors have discussed 
the assumptions used in determining the actuarial valuations set out below with independent pensions advisors and have 
determined that they are appropriate. The Lovell scheme’s valuation at 30 September 2017 shows a surplus of £9,692,000 based 
on the assumptions set out below. The Amco scheme shows a deficit of £760,000 based on the assumptions used in its valuation 
which are similar to those used for the Lovell scheme except where the Directors, in consultation with the scheme’s advisors, 
consider it appropriate to vary them due to the different characteristics of the Amco scheme and its membership profile. The 
Directors have determined that it is appropriate to recognise the surplus as, having reviewed the rules of the Lovell scheme, they 
are of the view that the employer has an unconditional right to that surplus.
The following disclosures required by IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2017 
carried out by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, Consulting Actuaries, in respect of the Lovell scheme and Capita Employee Benefits 
(Consulting) Limited in respect of the Amco scheme using the following assumptions:

The mortality tables adopted for the valuation of the Lovell scheme are the S2NA tables with future improvements in line with 
the Continuing Mortality Investigations 2016 model with long term improvement rates of 1.25% per annum for both males and 
females. The Directors believe that this analysis provides a more reliable estimate of the mortality characteristics of the 
scheme’s membership. Under these assumptions, a 60 year old male pensioner is forecast to live for a further 27.4 years and the 
further life expectancy of a male aged 60 in 2037 is 28.9 years. 
The mortality tables adopted for the valuation of the Amco scheme are the S2PA Mortality tables with future improvements 
in line with the Continuing Mortality Investigations 2016 model with long term improvement rates of 1.25% per annum for both

the scheme’s membership. Under these assumptions, a 65 year old male pensioner is forecast to live for a further 22.1 years and 
the further life expectancy of a male aged 65 in 2037 is 23.5 years.

Scheme Funding Levels and Actuarial Valuations 
Lovell Pension Scheme
The scheme actuary carried out the triennial valuation of the Lovell Pension Scheme as at 31 March 2015. The scheme showed 
a deficit of £12.1m compared to £24.1m when measured as at 31 March 2012. The Group has agreed a revised recovery plan with 
the Trustees which commits the Group to paying annual contributions of £4,260,000 which is expected to result in the 
elimination of this deficit by 31 July 2018. This recovery plan aims to eliminate the deficit under the Statutory Funding 
Objective of the Pensions Act 2004. The Group may be required to make further contributions to achieve a buy out of all 
pension liabilities and the Group has agreed to continue to make such contributions under a secondary funding objective. The 
necessity and quantum of these contributions will be remeasured by the scheme actuary at the next triennial valuation which 
is due as at 31 March 2018.
For accounting purposes under IAS19, actuaries use different assumptions than for the triennial valuation. The major difference 
relates to assumptions concerning the future return on assets of the scheme which includes a number of return seeking assets 
invested with BlackRock Asset Management. The key sensitivity for the valuation of the scheme under IAS19 is the selection of 
the discount rate which is the major determinant in measuring scheme liabilities. A reduction of 0.1% in the discount rate would 
increase scheme liabilities by £2.7m.
Amco Pension Scheme
The scheme actuary carried out the triennial valuation of the Amco Pension Scheme as at 31 December 2013. The scheme 
showed a deficit of £2.1m compared to £2.5m when measured as at 31 December 2010. A subsidiary undertaking has agreed 
a revised recovery plan with the Trustees which commits the subsidiary undertaking to paying annual contributions of 
£385,000 which is expected to result in the elimination of this deficit by 31 October 2020. This recovery plan aims to eliminate 
the deficit under the Statutory Funding Objective of the Pensions Act 2004. The subsidiary undertaking may be required to 
make further contributions to achieve a buy out of all pension liabilities. The necessity and quantum of these contributions will 
be remeasured by the scheme actuary at the next triennial valuation which is being measured as at 31 December 2016, and is 
expected to be completed in early 2018. 
For accounting purposes under IAS19, actuaries use different assumptions than for the triennial valuation. The major difference 
relates to assumptions concerning the future return on assets of the scheme which includes a number of return seeking assets 
invested with BlackRock Asset Management. The key sensitivity for the valuation of the scheme under IAS19 is the selection of 
the discount rate which is the major determinant in measuring scheme liabilities. A reduction of 0.1% in the discount rate would 
increase scheme liabilities by £0.2m.
Scheme Governance
Both the Lovell Pension Scheme and the Amco Pension Scheme have boards of trustees chaired by an independent professional 
trustee, Capital Cranfield Trustees Ltd. Each scheme also has member-elected trustees who must be members of the scheme. 
Both Renew Holdings plc for the Lovell Pension Scheme, and Amalgamated Construction Ltd for the Amco Pension Scheme 
have the right to appoint employer-nominated trustees although neither has elected to do so other than to appoint Capital 
Cranfield Trustees Ltd. 
The Lovell Pension Scheme trustees are advised by Lane, Clark & Peacock LLP on both actuarial and investment matters. 
The Lovell Scheme investments are independently managed by BlackRock Asset Management who are set a target return 
against which the trustees monitor their performance on a regular basis. Annuities purchased in both 2011 and 2016 are held 
by Legal & General and Just Retirement.
The Amco Pension Scheme trustees are advised by Capita Employee Benefits (Consulting) Ltd on both actuarial and 
investment matters. The Amco Scheme investments are independently managed by BlackRock Asset Management who are 
set a target return against which the trustees monitor their performance on a regular basis.

Goodwill of £7,523,000 arises on acquisition and has been reviewed for impairment one year after the acquisition as required 
by IFRS 3. The goodwill is attributable to the expertise and workforce of the acquired business. Other intangible assets valued 
at £3,679,000, which represent customer relationships and contractual rights, were also acquired and will be amortised over 
their useful economic lives in accordance with IFRS 3. Deferred tax has been provided on this amount. Amortisation of this 
intangible asset commenced from November 2016.
Fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition
In accordance with IFRS 3, the Board has reviewed the fair value of assets and liabilities using information available 
up to 12 months after the date of acquisition. Fair value has been calculated using Level 3 inputs as defined by IFRS 13.
Deferred tax assets
The Directors reviewed the timing of recognition of tax losses available on acquisition and have recognised an additional 
£567,000 deferred tax asset. A £626,000 deferred tax liability has been recognised in relation to the amortisation of other 
intangible assets.
Trade and other payables
A loan note transferred on acquisition will not be called and therefore has a fair value of £nil.
Goodwill impairment review
The Board has reviewed the goodwill arising on acquisition for impairment as required by IFRS 3. No such impairment 
was identified. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 74

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the company accounts
A Accounting policies
(i) Basis of accounting
Renew Holdings plc (the “Company”) is a company limited by shares and domiciled in the UK.
The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with FRS 102, under the historical cost convention. 
In determining that the going concern basis is appropriate the Directors have reviewed budgets, including cash flow forecasts, and 
concluded that the Company has adequate cash resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future.
Prior Year Adjustment
In previous years, the Company has provided for deferred tax on its pension scheme surplus at the rate of corporation tax expected 
to be prevailing in the future provided that the relevant legislation had been enacted. In the year ended 30 September 2016, a 
rate of 18% was used. It has now become clear to the Board that, in line with tax legislation which applies in the event of a refund 
of a surplus on the winding up of the pension scheme, that a tax rate of 35% should be applied. Consequently, the Board has 
restated the opening Balance Sheet as at 1 October 2015 to reflect the above. As at that date, the effect of the correction of 
this prior period error is to increase deferred tax liabilities associated with the Pension Scheme Asset by £2,576,000 with a 
corresponding reduction in net assets of the Company. As at 30 September 2016, for the same reason, the deferred tax liability 
has been increased by £1,309,000 compared to that previously reported. During the preparation of these financial statements, 
the Directors also became aware of inaccuracies in the corporation tax debtor at 30 September 2016. Correcting these resulted 
in an £833,000 increase in the corporation tax debtor at that date. The net impact of these adjustments is to reduce net assets 
by £476,000 at 30 September 2016. 
The amendments related to the pension scheme tax primarily relate to movements in Other Comprehensive Income. As such 
adjustments have been made to Other Comprehensive Income in 2016 and the total comprehensive income for the year ended 
30 September 2016 is now £3,938,000 compared to the £1,838,000 previously recorded. Following the adjustments made in 
respect of this matter, there has been no change in income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2016 and as a result 
there has been no change to the Company’s profit for the year ended 30 September 2016.
The presentation currency of these financial statements is sterling. All amounts in the financial statements have been rounded 
to the nearest £1,000.
The Company’s results are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial 
statements of Renew Holdings plc are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the EU. In these financial statements, the Company is considered to be a qualifying entity (for the purposes of this FRS) and 
has applied the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of the following disclosures:
 • Cash Flow Statement and related notes.
  As the consolidated financial statements of Renew Holdings plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also 
taken the exemptions under FRS 102 available in respect of the following disclosures:
 • the disclosure required by FRS 102.11 Basic Financial Instruments and FRS 102.12 Other Financial Instrument Issues in respect 
of financial instruments not falling within the fair value accounting rules of Paragraph 36(4) of Schedule 1.
A summary of the more important Company accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is set out below:
(ii) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less provision for impairment.
(iii) Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Where parts of an item of tangible fixed assets have 
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of tangible fixed assets, for example land is treated separately 
from buildings. The Company assesses at each reporting date whether tangible fixed assets are impaired. 
Provision is made at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset, less estimated residual value, evenly over its expected 
useful life as follows:
Freehold land  - no depreciation charge
Freehold buildings - fifty years
Plant, vehicles and equipment - three to ten years
(iv) Leasing commitments
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 77
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A Accounting policies continued
(v) Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income. Current tax is the 
expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided, except as noted below, on timing differences that have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet 
date, where the timing differences result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future. Timing 
differences arise because of differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes.
In accordance with FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard’, deferred tax is not provided on permanent timing differences. 
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered 
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
(vi) Basic financial instruments - trade and other debtors/creditors
Trade and other debtors are recognised initially at transaction price less attributable transaction costs. Trade and other 
creditors are recognised initially at transaction price plus attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition they 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses in the case of trade debtors.
(vii) Stocks and work in progress
Stocks comprise land and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes appropriate attributable 
overheads and excludes interest. 
(viii) Related party transactions
Interest is neither recognised nor charged on balances outstanding with fellow subsidiaries as they are repayable on demand.
(ix) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
(x) Employee benefits
Defined benefit pension scheme
The Company’s net asset/(liability) in respect of the defined benefit scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present 
value. The fair value of any scheme assets is deducted. The Company determines the net interest income/(expense) on the net 
defined benefit asset/(liability) for the period by applying the discount rate as determined at the beginning of the annual period to 
the net defined benefit asset/(liability) taking account of changes arising as a result of contributions and benefit payments. The 
discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and having maturity 
dates approximating to the terms of, the Company’s obligations. A valuation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. The Company recognises net defined benefit scheme assets to the extent that it is able to recover 
the surplus. Changes in the net defined benefit asset/(liability) arising from employee service rendered during the period, net interest 
on net defined benefit asset/(liability), and the cost of scheme introductions, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements during 
the period are recognised in profit or loss. Remeasurement of the net defined benefit asset/(liability) is recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs.
Defined contribution pension schemes
A defined contribution scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme under which the Company pays fixed contributions into 
a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to 
defined contribution pension schemes are recognised in expense in the profit and loss account in the periods during which 
services are rendered by employees.
Share based payments
FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard’ requires a fair value to be established for any equity settled share based 
payments. Fair value has been independently measured using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on 
the Directors’ estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
(xi) Dividends
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are 
appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria 
are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 78

During the year 273,503 Ordinary Shares were issued following the exercise of options under the Renew Holdings plc 
Long Term Incentive Plan.
Share options
Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme
The Company operates a share option scheme, the Renew Holdings plc 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme. The scheme 
has both an Approved and Unapproved element. The difference between the two elements is that the Approved scheme 
has the advantage of certain HMRC approved tax benefits.
Both elements have the same general terms and conditions. Options issued under the scheme must be held for three years 
before they can vest and become exercisable. They must be exercised within ten years from the date of grant. 
As at 30 September 2017, there were 31,467 options outstanding under the scheme. During the year 10,489 options were 
exercised. 31,467 options are in issue under the Approved scheme at an exercise price of 286p. These options are subject 
to the same performance criteria as options issued under the long term incentive plan described below. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 81
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
M Share capital continued
Share options continued
Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan
At the Annual General Meeting held on 25 January 2012 the shareholders approved a new long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) 
which succeeded the Renew Holdings plc 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme as the Directors believed that the LTIP was a 
more effective method of aligning executive and shareholder interests.
As at 30 September 2017, there were 550,133 options outstanding under the scheme. On 24 November 2016, options to 
subscribe for a further 243,100 Ordinary Shares were granted. During the year 305,172 options were exercised. 137,995 options 
lapsed during the year. 
The options are exercisable at a nominal cost or at the par value of an Ordinary Share three years after the date of grant 
subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria. Details of the options are given in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. To the extent that there is a gain arising in respect of the approved options noted above, the option holder will forfeit 
LTIP options to the same value. 
Vesting of one half of the options is dependant on absolute growth in the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), and the 
other half is dependant on the Company’s TSR performance as compared to the TSR achieved by other companies in a 
comparator group of companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. All TSR calculations are based on the average of 
the opening and closing share price over a 30 day period prior to the commencement and the end of the performance period. 
The absolute TSR growth target requires the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period to grow by more than 
25%. For TSR growth between 25% and 100%, the half of the option which is subject to the absolute TSR growth target vests 
on a straight-line basis from nil vesting at 25% growth, to 100% vesting at 100% growth. There will be no vesting if TSR growth 
is 25% or less. 
The comparator group TSR performance target measures the Company’s TSR over the 3 year performance period against the 
TSR of a group of companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. If the Company’s TSR performance falls below the 
median performance of the comparator group then the options lapse forthwith. If the Company is ranked within the top decile 
of the comparator group the options shall vest in full. If the Company’s TSR performance is ranked between the median 
position and the top decile of the comparator group then the options shall vest on a straight line basis from nil, at or below the 
median position, to 100% at the top decile.
N Share based payments reserve
Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan
Fair value has been independently measured by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP using a Monte Carlo model methodology. The 
fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Board’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
£109,000 (2016: £244,000) has been charged to administrative expenses in accordance with FRS 102. There is no impact on 
net assets since an equivalent amount has been credited to the share based payments reserve. 305,172 options were exercised 
during the year. The value per option represents the fair value of the option less the consideration payable. 
The expected volatility has been calculated based on weekly historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the 
three years prior to the date of grant. The risk free rate of return has been based on the yields available on three year 
UK government bonds as at the date of grant. 
Options granted under the Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan over the Company’s Ordinary Shares at 
30 September 2017 were as follows:

P Contingent liabilities
The Company has guaranteed performance bonds in respect of certain contracts and leasing arrangements in the normal 
course of business of its subsidiary undertakings. 
Under the terms of the Group’s banking agreement, security over the Company’s assets has been granted to the 
Group’s bankers. 
The Company is a participant together with a number of subsidiary undertakings in the Group’s banking arrangements, 
and as a result has risks associated with the financial status and performance of the other companies within the Group.
Q Defined contribution pension scheme
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme with individual stakeholder pension plans for its employees.
The Company made contributions of £241,000 (2016: £318,000) into these plans during the year. There are also £11,000 
(2016: £17,000) of accruals relating to these plans.
R Related parties
The Company has a related party relationship with its key management personnel who are the Main Board Directors: P Scott, 
J Samuel, A Liebenberg, RJ Harrison, J Bishop, DM Forbes and DA Brown, whose total compensation amounted to £2,131,000 
(2016: £3,558,000) all of which was represented by short-term employment benefits including £109,000 (2016: £244,000) 
relating to share option charges in accordance with FRS 102. An analysis of this compensation is given in Note 6 of the 
consolidated accounts. 
J Samuel is a director of Yorkshire Air Ambulance Ltd. In the year ended 30 September 2017 the Company made a charitable 
donation of £5,000 (2016: £5,000) to sponsor the charity’s annual recognition awards dinner.
There were no other transactions with key management personnel in the year.
S Employee benefits: Retirement benefit obligations 
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, the Lovell Pension Scheme. The scheme has been closed to new 
members and to further benefits accrual for many years.
FRS 102
The Directors have adopted the accounting required by FRS 102 with effect from the transition date. The Directors have 
discussed the assumptions used in determining the actuarial valuation set out below with independent pensions advisors 
and have determined that they are appropriate. The Lovell scheme’s valuation at 30 September 2017 shows a surplus of 
£9,692,000 based on the assumptions set out below. 
The Directors have determined that it is appropriate to recognise the surplus as, having reviewed the rules of the 
Lovell scheme, they are of the view that the employer has an unconditional right to that surplus. 
The following disclosures required by FRS 102 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2017 
carried out by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, Consulting Actuaries, using the following assumptions:
As at As at As at

Increases in deferred pensions 3.1% 2.9% 2.9% Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 83
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
S Employee benefits: Retirement benefit obligations continued
FRS 102 continued
The mortality tables adopted for the valuation of the Lovell scheme are the S2NA tables with future improvements in line with 
the Continuing Mortality Investigations 2016 model with long term improvement rates of 1.25% per annum for both males and 
females. The Directors believe that this analysis provides a more reliable estimate of the mortality characteristics of the 
scheme’s membership. Under these assumptions, a 60 year old male pensioner is forecast to live for a further 27.4 years and 
the further life expectancy of a male aged 60 in 2037 is 23.5 years.
The assets in the Lovell scheme were:

Total 173,451 100% 190,524 100% 165,603 100%
During 2011 and 2016, the Trustees of the Lovell scheme, in consultation with the Directors, used scheme assets to purchase 
annuities which match certain pension liabilities in a transaction known as a “buy in”. This asset provides protection against 
falls in gilt yields and risks in the performance of other asset classes. 
Scheme Funding Level and Actuarial Valuation 
The scheme actuary carried out the triennial valuation of the Lovell Pension Scheme as at 31 March 2015. The scheme showed 
a deficit of £12.1m compared to £24.1m when measured as at 31 March 2012. The Company has agreed a revised recovery plan 
with the Trustees which commits the Company to paying annual contributions of £4,260,000 which is expected to result in the 
elimination of this deficit by 31 July 2018. This recovery plan aims to eliminate the deficit under the Statutory Funding 
Objective of the Pensions Act 2004. The Company may be required to make further contributions to achieve a buy out of all 
pension liabilities and the Company has agreed to continue to make such contributions under a secondary funding objective. 
The necessity and quantum of these contributions will be remeasured by the scheme actuary at the next triennial valuation 
which is due as at 31 March 2018. 
For accounting purposes under FRS 102, actuaries use different assumptions than for the triennial valuation. The major 
difference relates to assumptions concerning the future return on assets of the scheme which includes a number of return 
seeking assets invested with BlackRock Asset Management. The key sensitivity for the valuation of the scheme under FRS 102 
is the selection of the discount rate which is the major determinant in measuring scheme liabilities. A reduction of 0.1% in the 
discount rate would increase scheme liabilities by £2.7m. 
The scheme rules permit the return of any surplus funds to the Company on the winding up of the scheme.
