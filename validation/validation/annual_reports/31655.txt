STRATEGIC  
REPORT
15 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chairman’s statement
A successful year for Hollywood Bowl 
peter boddy
Following our first full year as a listed company, 
I am pleased to report that FY2017 was another 
very successful and exciting one for the Group. 
Revenue continued to grow as more than 
13 million customers came through our doors 
and enjoyed the high-quality, family friendly 
experience we offer. 
Revenue increased by 8.8 per cent to £114.0m, 
driven through like-for-like (LFL) sales growth 
in the core estate, continued investment in 
refurbishments and rebrands, and the opening 
of three new centres – Derby, Southampton 
and The London O2. Our strong balance sheet 
has been further strengthened on the back of 
positive trading, and net debt has reduced to 
£8.1m with the net debt to Group adjusted 
EBITDA ratio at 0.24 times. 
This sector-leading performance, combined 
with our excellence in operations, has enabled 
the Board to recommend a final dividend of 
3.95p per share, as well as a special dividend 
of 3.33p per share. The combination of these 
two dividends, along with our interim dividend, 
means that the business will have returned, 
subject to shareholder approval of the final 
dividend at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, £13.6m (9.08p per share) to 
shareholders in respect of FY2017. With our 
strong balance sheet, we are extremely well 
positioned for continued growth through both 
the existing estate and future openings.
I have taken enormous pleasure in seeing this 
business continue to grow and develop over the 
past 12 months. Focusing on offering a high-
quality bowling experience, with the emphasis 
on family friendly entertainment, has led to 
increased revenue on a LFL basis, with more 
customers than ever before choosing to spend 
their leisure time with us.
I am delighted at the progress we have 
made with our centre investment programme 
with the completion of four transformational 
refurbishments and six rebrands during the year. 
Basingstoke is an excellent example of our 
success. Following a £250,000 refurbishment, 
completed inside just four weeks, the Centre 
Manager has delivered one of the highest 
rates of EBITDA growth within the business. 
“ We are well-positioned to continue to 
create value for all our shareholders.”
hollywood bowl group plc 16
Strategic Report We have now completed seven of the Bowlplex 
rebrands, with the final four planned for FY2018. 
The success of the Bowlplex rebrands reinforces 
what an excellent investment Bowlplex was. 
Good corporate governance continues to 
be a focus for the Board as we complete our 
evolution from private equity to PLC ownership. 
Following the Group’s IPO in FY2016, Epiris 
sold its remaining interest (17.8 per cent) in the 
business and we thank Bill Priestley and Ian 
Wood for their continued support through the first 
eight months of listing. Further details on this can 
be found in our Corporate Governance report, 
on page 50, which describes the work completed 
during the year and outlines our areas of focus 
and development for the year ahead. 
The Board recruited an additional independent 
NED, Ivan Schofield, and I was delighted to 
welcome Ivan to our Board with effect from 
1 October. Ivan brings a wealth of European 
and UK knowledge from several multi-site leisure 
businesses. He has completed a thorough 
induction programme and is providing support 
and new perspective, as well as giving challenge, 
to an already high-performing Board. 
A key component of our success is our executive 
leadership team which has done an outstanding 
job during FY2017. The four senior Directors – 
Stephen Burns (CEO), Laurence Keen (CFO), 
Mat Hart (Commercial Director) and Melanie 
Dickinson (Talent Director), have led the company 
with courage, conviction and a relentless desire 
to remain on purpose. The behaviour of the 
senior team provide the leadership and example 
for all colleagues to follow which, coupled with 
team member inductions and our ways of working, 
provides a clear cultural framework for the 
company to operate within. The strength of our 
culture delivers industry-leading performance 
in financial measures as well as the softer, 
subjective measures of customer experience 
and satisfaction.
I am also pleased to report that we have a 
high calibre management team supporting 
the executive leadership team and senior Directors. 
We have recently completed a Senior Leadership 
Development Programme with ten members of the 
team who exhibit the potential and talent to occupy 
senior executive roles. My participation in the 
reviewing and assessing of the final stages of the 
programme gave me great encouragement that 
our succession planning, and future talent 
are being successfully developed.
Our ability to adapt and modify has kept us 
relevant and accurate in delivering customer 
satisfaction, measured by our net promotor 
score and our own customer engagement 
programme. This success can be seen by 
the continual improvement in both measures 
of customer satisfaction.
Outlook
The business continues to invest across 
all parts of the Group – its people, estate, 
technology and brands. We have a strong estate 
which will continue to grow (with one centre, our 
58th, already opened in the new financial year) 
and a number of refurbishments and rebrands 
planned. Our strong balance sheet will allow 
us to undertake our strategic purpose, and 
the Group continues to perform in line with 
the Board’s expectations for the full year. I 
thoroughly enjoy my role as Chairman and feel 
enthused and confident about the year ahead. 
We are well-positioned to continue to create 
value for all our shareholders, with the whole 
team working every day to generate the right 
levels of positive energy to deliver the best 
possible experience for our customers.
I would like to conclude by expressing my thanks 
to all team members across the Group for what 
has been another successful year.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT Chief Executive Officer’s review 
our strategy is delivering profitable growth
stephen burns 
 “ Our enhanced 
offer and 
continued 
development 
of our brands 
is widening the 
appeal to our 
core family 
customer group.”
I am delighted to report on another very 
successful year for the Hollywood Bowl Group. 
We achieved revenue of £114.0m, representing 
growth of 8.8 per cent on FY2016, and 3.5 per 
cent on a like for like basis (LFL). We achieved 
this through the execution of our customer-led 
strategy by: improving game volumes and spend 
per game by delivering great value for money 
experiences; investing in our refurbishment 
programme; and growing the estate through 
our new openings and acquisition programme. 
Through all of this, we have seen Group adjusted 
EBITDA grow to £33.4m, a 13.7 per cent 
increase over the prior year, while operating 
profits grew by 54.4 per cent.
Hollywood Bowl Group is the UK’s ten-pin 
bowling market leader. We have a high quality, 
leasehold property portfolio of 58 centres across 
the UK and lead the market in profitability and 
margin. The Group is well placed to benefit 
from the widely reported and notable shift 
in behaviour of customers seeking to spend 
disposable income on experiences rather than 
material items. Our enhanced and evolving offer, 
as well as the continued development of our 
brands, is widening the appeal to our core family 
customer group, who are spending longer 
in our centres, and to our landlords, who are 
looking for high-quality leisure operators to 
supplement their retail offers. 
Strategic progress
Our simple strategy focuses on growing the 
business organically and driving growth through 
the effective deployment of capital, and we are 
very pleased with the progress we have made 
in FY2017.
Like-for-like growth
Improvements in LFL revenue performance 
have been underpinned by a number of factors, 
including increased customer visits year-on-year. 
Game volumes in the year were up 3.1 per cent 
LFL (and 8.5 per cent total). More of our target 
market sought out our high-quality family 
entertainment centres, and we were able 
to leverage our sector leading CRM system 
to encourage customers on our database to 
visit us again via targeted marketing activity. 
We have worked hard expanding the roll out 
of proven initiatives and on introducing new 
concepts to enhance the customer experience. 
The continuing roll out of the Hollywood Diner 
menu has enhanced the quality of our products, 
as well as drive dwell time in our diners. The new 
menu is now in 30 centres and will be rolled out 
to the rest of the estate over the coming year. 
The highly successful VIP concept is now in 
40 centres and is a fantastic upgrade for our 
customers at just an extra £1 per player per 
game. Our high-quality amusement offer has 
been further enhanced with the test of virtual 
reality gaming in three of our centres, an 
exciting new experience. We are also testing 
our new cashless amusement offer as we look 
to proactively anticipate customer needs 
and demands.
The dynamic pricing model we introduced in 
July enabled us to strategically increase prices 
without impacting the Group’s relative price 
competitiveness or damaging our reputation 
for being a great value-for-money experience 
(our prices remain amongst the lowest of the 
major ten-pin bowling operators).
Strategic Report
hollywood bowl group plc 18
Strategic Report All of these initiatives, as well as the fantastic 
teams we have in our centres, have contributed 
to our spend per game growing from £8.63 
to £8.70 in FY2017. 
Refurbishment and rebrand 
programme
Ten full refurbishments were completed 
in FY2017 including the rebranding of four 
Bowlplex and two AMF centres (Tunbridge 
Wells, Cwmbran, Portsmouth, Brighton, Tolworth 
and Ashford). Over 60 per cent of the estate has 
now been refurbished with each project benefiting 
from those that have gone before, resulting in 
exceptional industry leading environments. In 
consequence, we continue to deliver impressive 
returns from the capital deployed, with the ten 
refurbishments on track to outperform their 
targeted 33 per cent return on investment.
New centre openings
Our disciplined approach to centre roll out 
has been key to delivering the high returns 
and sustained performance we have seen from 
our mature centres. One of our key success 
criteria is being co-located with the top cinema 
in town. Over 70% of our current estate fulfils this 
criterion, and our recent openings have 
continued on this path. 
We opened three centres in FY2017, two 
of which – Southampton and Derby – were 
organic openings, while The London O2 was 
an acquisition. Each property negotiation is 
based on its own merits and we continue to 
be a sought-after tenant for both leisure parks 
and retail developments. 
Hollywood Bowl Southampton opened as 
part of a new Hammerson leisure development. 
It is one of our smaller format concept centres 
designed to fit within a retail/leisure offer. 
Trading since the opening in December 2016 
has been extremely positive, and it is on course 
to pay back 50 per cent of the invested capital 
within year one. 
Our second new opening is part of intu Derby 
and complements the site’s high-quality offering 
of a cinema, casual dining restaurants, retail and 
an adventure golf centre. Derby is trading very 
well and is ahead of expectation.
Both of these new centres included the 
operational trials of ‘Pins on strings’ technology 
– an innovation to improve machine reliability 
and cut downtime – and cashless amusements, 
a trial of digital payment card readers that can 
facilitate price changes and greater customer 
engagement.
Acquisitions 
In June, we refurbished and rebranded Brooklyn 
Bowl at The London O2, taking a three-year 
management contract to operate the venue. 
Early trading has been in line with our expectations. 
In FY2017 we also acquired the Namco Bowl 
in Dagenham, a 30,000 square foot centre in a 
prime spot co-located with a cinema and casual 
dining. This centre started trading on 4 October 
2017 and is performing in line with expectations.
Pipeline
We have secured a strong pipeline of new 
centres enabling us to deliver on our plan of 
an average of two new openings per year. The 
high-quality product we deliver for our landlords, 
coupled with our strong covenant and reputation 
for top-quality operating standards, have created 
new opportunities. Leases have been signed 
with intu for the leisure extension at its flagship 
Lakeside centre and for the leisure extension 
of intu Watford. 
Legal work is progressing on a number of other 
exciting new developments, giving us confidence 
in our longer term growth opportunities.
Our people
Our people are instrumental to the success 
of our business and I am enormously grateful 
to be supported by a talented, enthusiastic and 
motivated team who are incredibly professional, 
customer-focused and commercially driven.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT We are proud to provide an inclusive and 
supportive environment for all team members, 
including good opportunities to develop 
rewarding careers. 127 of the team have 
undertaken our internal talent development 
programmes, with 36 team members being 
promoted to assistant manager, seven to 
Centre Manager and five to a senior support 
role as a consequence.
Given the diversity of our portfolio, and the 
unique markets in which we operate, we take 
care to recruit only the most engaging and 
energetic team members, strong people 
with an entrepreneurial approach. Our centre 
management teams are rewarded for work well 
done through our uncapped bonus scheme.
Technology-driven growth
We continue to invest in our technology 
platforms which are a key enabler of our 
growth. We have moved our core reservation 
and CRM system infrastructure on to a cloud-
based service, improving its resilience, 
scalability and performance.
Our proprietary scoring system is now in 
24 centres. The system was upgraded earlier 
in the year to increase in-centre data capture 
and enhance customer engagement levels through 
the inclusion of additional personalised content in 
our automated post-bowling email programmes 
which generated an overall 41 per cent increase in 
revenue year-on-year. Our contactable customer 
marketing database has grown by nine per cent in 
the last 12 months. Along with our automated and 
tactical programmes, it is a key revenue driving 
asset as it facilitates the promotion of short term, 
closed user-group offers that deliver incremental 
revenues in more challenging trading periods.
Our online channel continues to perform 
well and take share from our walk-up channel. 
Revenues are up 26 per cent year-on-year 
supported by increased and cost-effective 
investment in digital advertising and the 
introduction of dynamic pricing. Alongside this, 
our ongoing focus on improving our customers’ 
booking journey saw mobile conversion levels 
increase. Mobile accounted for 54 per cent 
of our online revenue.
Outlook
Off the back of another successful year, we 
are well positioned to continue the delivery of 
our strategy in FY2018. We have a high-quality 
estate, we have added four new centres in the 
last 12 months and we continue to invest capital 
to enhance our offering across the portfolio. 
With continued investment into our teams, 
including multiple management training/talent 
programmes, we are well placed to further 
enhance our customer proposition. Our growing 
scale and revenues mean that we can continue 
to leverage operational efficiencies, increasing 
our profits as a percentage of revenue.
My team and I invest a great deal of time and 
effort in assessing new centre opportunities 
as well as ensuring we continue to invest in 
the most appropriate parts of our estate to 
provide the latest innovation and technology 
to our customers.
There is much talk in the press and elsewhere 
of the impact of ‘Brexit’. We do not believe that 
the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU will 
have an impact on the underlying performance 
of our business because Hollywood Bowl, and 
the activities we offer, have great customer 
appeal throughout the country and through 
all economic cycles.
Finally, I would like to thank all of our team 
members for their hard work during FY2017 
and I look forward to working alongside them 
to deliver our priorities for FY2018. 
Stephen Burns
Chief Executive Officer
11 December 2017
Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Strategic Report
hollywood bowl group plc 20 Q.  What keeps you awake at night?
SB. Not having the right team in place in our centres to deliver 
the consistent experience our customers expect. A high-quality 
management team makes all the difference in the successful 
operation of our business, which is why attracting and retaining 
talent is at the top of the leadership agenda.
Q.  Could you accelerate the rate 
of centre openings?
SB. While we can be flexible in the design of our centres, we do 
need a reasonable amount of open space (columns, for example, 
are difficult to bowl around!). This can limit our opportunities. We are 
also careful to open in only those locations that will complement our 
existing portfolio, rather than detract from it. It’s no fun running 
loss-making centres and we are in the enviable position of not 
having any of those. We have identified a very healthy pipeline, but 
these new openings are part of some very big schemes that take 
time to come out of the ground, so we are sticking to our forecast 
of an average of two openings per annum.
Q.  Have you the management bandwidth to match 
your ambitions for growth? 
SB. Absolutely! I am fortunate to be surrounded by a talented, 
supportive and motivated senior leadership team who not only 
are experts in their respective function, but are also extremely 
knowledgeable about the overall business.
Q.  Could you further increase the rate of the 
refurbishment programme?
SB. It’s important to understand that each centre operates in its 
own marketplace and we don’t adopt a ‘cookie cutter’ approach 
when it comes to refurbishments and investments. Each centre 
is designed around customer feedback, with input from the 
management and support team. Combining this with the fact that 
we wouldn’t undertake a refurbishment during a school holiday 
period, for example, and that Laurence (CFO) and I visit every 
centre before, during and after investment, we believe that 
between seven and ten investments per annum allows the 
business to maximise the returns on each. 
Q.  Are you concerned about the consumer outlook?
SB. It is, of course, prudent to keep one eye on consumer trends. 
We recognise that leisure activities rely on disposable income and 
that our customers are not immune to inflation. We do, however, 
operate the kind of all-inclusive family leisure experience that we 
know our customers prioritise. 
Q.  Will you ever look beyond bowling?
SB. Our short to medium-term focus is on delivering against our 
growth plan through the successful execution of our bowling-led 
strategy. There are a number of indoor leisure-based offerings we 
know could benefit from our customer-led operating model, but 
we feel there is still significant opportunity to remain focused on 
growing our bowling business.
Q.  What impact will Brexit have on 
Hollywood Bowl?
SB. In terms of our team, we have limited exposure with less than 
four per cent of team members coming from EU countries outside 
of the UK. Our supply chain is mostly UK-based. Although we 
haven’t been immune to the cost increases of certain food lines, 
they form a relatively small part of our business and, at this stage, 
we haven’t had to pass any price rises on to our customers. The 
likely economic impact of Brexit will become clearer over the next 
18 months and is something we will watch closely as regards the 
business and the impact on our customers. 
Q.  What differentiates Hollywood Bowl from other 
leisure investment opportunities?
SB. We have a unique product that has wide appeal across 
all ages, demographics and geographies. There are few such 
businesses that offer activities you can safely enjoy with your 
family, friends and business colleagues – and all have fun! As an 
investment, we differentiate by continuing to operate this business 
for the long term and by not taking short-term decisions which 
could harm long-term profitability. Our portfolio of entirely 
profitable centres is operated by business leaders, not just 
managers, and a senior team that are not only long-term 
shareholders of the business, but also its customers.

Strategic Report as market leader, we are best placed 
to capitalise on opportunities in the sector
Hollywood Bowl Group has led growth in 
the market by investing consistently and  
re-invigorating the customer proposition. 
This has helped reposition bowling back 
into the mainstream.
A growth sector 
The UK leisure sector was worth an estimated 
£85.4bn in 2016, of which ten-pin bowling had 
a market share of just over 0.3 per cent
1
. It is 
estimated that the UK ten-pin bowling market 
in 2016 grew by 6.7 per cent. This marked the 
fourth consecutive year of growth
1
.
As with the wider UK leisure market, growth in ten- 
pin bowling has been driven by macroeconomic 
factors, such as increases in GDP, consumer 
confidence and disposable income. 
Alongside this, a key historical growth factor 
has been corporate consolidation and significant 
investment by leading branded operators, 
primarily in the refurbishment of existing centres 
and, in part, in the opening of new venues.
Hollywood Bowl Group has driven much 
of the market growth through our investment 
in reinvigorating customer engagement through 
CRM platforms, refocusing the bowling 
proposition towards family leisure, improving 
ancillary product offerings and driving operating 
improvements. From 2013–2016, the Group 
delivered a compound annual growth rate of 
14.9% per cent.
Outlook
Growth in the value of the ten-pin bowling market 
is expected to continue over the coming years, 
stimulated by ongoing investment and an overall 
improvement in the quality of the customer 
proposition.
Consumer leisure spend could be tempered as 
rising inflation and slowing wage growth begin 
to impact household budgets and UK economic 
growth slows amid uncertainty over the impact 
of ‘Brexit’. However, barring a more severe 
economic slowdown than currently anticipated, 
it is expected that the value of the ten-pin 
bowling market will grow by an estimated 
23 per cent between 2016 and 2021
1
. 
It is anticipated that this growth will be 
underpinned by the development of new centres, 
the continued refurbishment of existing centres 
and associated improvement in the customer 
experience. It is expected that participation in 
ten-pin bowling, visit frequency and spend per 
game will all increase in line with these activities. 
A significant opportunity
By comparing visits to ten-pin bowling centres 
with visits to the cinema, it is evident that the 
opportunity to increase the size of the ten-pin 
bowling market in the UK is significant, in terms 
of both numbers of centres and frequency of visits. 
In the UK, ten-pin bowling is a relatively low-
frequency activity compared to other forms 
of leisure such as the cinema. Almost 70 per 
cent of consumers have not participated in 
ten-pin bowling over the past 12 months, 
compared to 32 per cent for cinemas
1
. 
The ten-pin bowling market forms a small, but fast growing, part of  
the UK’s ‘out of home’ leisure sector offering a competitively-priced 
experience and broad customer appeal.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 23
STRATEGIC  
REPORT The accessibility of bowling locations is also 
lower – an estimated 47 per cent of the UK’s 
population lives within a 15-minute drive of 
a bowling centre, compared to 69 per cent living 
within a 15-minute drive of a cinema
1
. Distance 
may be a factor in deterring some consumers 
from visiting centres and may also impact 
negatively on repeat visits.
These figures, and the fact that in the UK 
there is low penetration of bowling centres 
per head of population relative to some other 
international markets, indicate that there is 
significant potential for further ten-pin bowling 
centre roll out. Opportunities also exist to 
increase participation through improved 
customer propositions and competitive 
pricing relative to other leisure experiences.
An affordable leisure offering
Ten-pin bowling is a competitively priced and 
highly accessible form of family entertainment. 
The cost to a family of a visit to a bowling centre 
compares favourably to other leisure activities 
and gives bowling more resilience to any 
challenges posed by the wider economic 
situation.
Our position in the market
Hollywood Bowl Group is the clear market leader 
in terms of centres, lane numbers, customer 
proposition and revenues and has driven much 
of the growth in the market through its 
investment-led strategy.
As at 30 September 2017, the UK had 319 ten-
pin bowling venues. The number of centres has 
remained almost static over the past decade, 
but there has been a decline in the number 
of available lanes since 2007. While some 
independently owned centres have closed, 
the process of consolidation and reinvestment 
among some of the leading players has led 
to the branded centres offering more lanes 
than previously. 
The market remains relatively fragmented but 
has seen significant consolidation since 2014. 
There are four types of operator
2
 identified 
within the UK ten-pin bowling market:
• Major multiples (estimated 71 per cent market 
share) operating five or more centres. The 
leading three operators control 40 per cent 
of all UK centres and over 50 per cent of all 
available lanes. Hollywood Bowl Group is 
in this category.
• Other multiples (estimated five per cent 
market share), operating fewer than 
five centres.

Strategic Report
hollywood bowl group plc 24 • Urban bowling operators (estimated seven 
per cent market share) catering primarily for 
professionals, operating smaller sites with a 
focus on the ‘urban’ market and an emphasis 
on food and beverage sales.
• Independent operators (estimated 17 per cent 
market share) operating single centres, 
which are typically smaller and situated 
in tertiary locations.
There is scope for the major multiples to 
increase their share of the ten-pin bowling 
market as weaker operators, particularly the 
independents and other multiples, become 
less competitive or exit the market.
Changing retail landscape
Traditional retail outlets are under increasing 
pressure from online channels and the rise 
of the ‘experience economy’, with customers 
increasingly seeking to invest in experiences 
rather than possessions. As a result, larger retail 
developers are having to fight back and are 
increasingly looking to create a wider customer 
experience through the expansion of their leisure 
offering to increase footfall and extend dwell 
time. Leisure areas are created by reformatting 
existing space or via purpose-built extensions.
Within these new retail and leisure developments 
ten-pin bowling is currently underrepresented 
as shown in the table above. 
As the UK’s market-leading operator, Hollywood 
Bowl is the ‘go-to’ tenant in the sector securing 
attractive developer contributions on new 
centres, most recently at the Southampton 
Hammerson development and at the intu Derby 
centre, and has secured a strong pipeline of 
centres until FY2019.
From our established operating model, 
relationships with landlords, strong covenant 
and continued maintenance programme across 
the estate, Hollywood Bowl Group is well-
positioned to capitalise on the potential 
growth within the merging of retail and 
leisure customer propositions.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT Our business model
Multiple levers to deliver value and 
drive sustainable growth 
Multiple levers:
Brands
Hollywood Bowl is the Group’s 
flagship brand. It has centres in 
prime locations and benefits from 
the highest levels of investment.
AMF centres are generally located in 
secondary locations. The Bowlplex 
brand is being phased out as these 
centres migrate to the Hollywood 
Bowl brand.
High-quality estate
Our centres are predominantly 
located in out-of-town multi-use 
leisure parks, typically alongside 
cinema and casual dining sites 
and large retail parks. On average, 
centres are just under 30,000 square 
feet and have 24 bowling lanes. 
Revenue streams
We have a diverse offering comprised 
of bowling, amusements and food and 
beverages. These combine to give our 
customers an all-round entertainment 
experience and serve to increase 
reasons to visit, dwell time and 
secondary spend.
Operations
We operate high-quality centres 
with innovative, exciting, fun-
filled products delivered by our 
enthusiastic and engaging team. 
Our central support team includes a 
55-seat customer contact centre that 
manages all calls and takes bookings, 
allowing our on-site teams to focus on 
the in-centre customer experience.
Outputs that deliver value:
Great customer 
experience
Delivering a fun-filled, safe and 
great-value experience on each 
visit helps us attract new customers. 
It also increases the likelihood of 
customers recommending us to 
friends and family and visiting 
us time and again.
Motivated and 
engaged teams
Our team members are key to 
delivering a positive customer 
experience. We invest consistently 
in ensuring they are motivated 
and engaged with our culture 
and behaviours.
Financial and 
KPI performance 
The Group’s financial performance 
and the progress we are making 
against our key performance 
indicator (KPI) metrics are the 
principal measures against which 
we assess our achievements.
Shareholder returns
We are focused on sustainable, 
profitable growth through 
consistently driving revenues, 
managing our margins and 
managing our cash position 
to provide attractive returns 
to shareholders.
Our business model is underpinned by:
People and culture
Our people are the face of our business. They are focused and incentivised 
to ensure our customers have the best possible experience. Management 
programmes are in place to attract, retain and nurture top talent. We have 
a highly targeted incentive structure for our Centre Managers which is based 
on not only financial performance, but also customer feedback. Our positive 
culture promotes consistent behaviours and attitudes across the business.
Technology and customer insight
We invest in market research and ongoing customer experience programmes 
to continually monitor customer satisfaction. This means we can quickly react 
to any operational issue or respond to wider customer trends.
Our sector leading CRM systems and our proprietary scoring system are used 
to facilitate targeted marketing programmes pre and post customer visits. Our 
digital channels are a strategic key focus area and are an increasing source 
of revenue for the Group. Dynamic pricing, based on available capacity and 
booking lead time, has been introduced to improve yield management.
Capital investment programme
As well as delivering our new centres, our capital investment programme 
supports centre refurbishments and our ongoing maintenance spend. 
We like to keep all our centres looking good.
To enhance the quality of our customer offering and to improve 
our commercial performance, we continually invest in technology-led 
innovation including our CRM and reservation system, our scoring 
system, our back-of-house equipment and our amusements offering. 
Property and supplier relationships
We have strong relationships with developers and landlords to ensure that 
we maintain a pipeline of new sites for the future and are starting to see the 
benefits of wider strategic partnerships with organisations such as intu. 
We work closely with our technology suppliers to ensure that we are 
delivering the best possible experience across the customer journey. Strong 
relationships with our principal product suppliers, such as Namco, Molson 
Coors, Brakes and Coca-Cola, enable us to deliver promotions that help drive 
retail sales and ensure we have the latest product offerings in our centres. 
Strong balance sheet
By driving revenues, continuing to achieve healthy margins and maintaining 
a strong balance sheet, we can continue to invest in all areas of our business, 
expanding and improving our estate, rewarding our team members and 
making returns to our shareholders.
Risk management and governance
Through our Board governance the Group maintains an effective system of risk 
management and appropriate internal controls to ensure that our business is 
always operated to deliver long term, sustainable growth.

SIX STEPS TO Opening 
a new Hollywood Bowl
The opening of new centres is a key strategic focus for 
the Group and is the responsibility of the new centre and 
refurbishment team, which consists of representatives from 
all business functions including the executive team. Using 
the case study of our recent centre opening in Derby, we 
outline the comprehensive process that is undertaken 
to bring a new centre into play, from location selection 
to opening our doors in a new market and welcoming 
our first customers.
Potential new locations are analysed in detail. 
We select geographical target areas based on 
population catchment and a range of specific 
demographic measures.
Derby
Derby had very strong scores in the key customer 
areas we target. We agreed that a city centre 
location would work well, because high existing 
footfall was paramount.
Selecting 
the location

Strategic Report
30 hollywood bowl group plc
Strategic Report Our strategy is to look for sites that are co-located 
with cinema and casual dining establishments. 
This creates a critical mass of leisure opportunities 
and provides customers with ways to extend their 
visit. Our focus is on space between 14,000 square 
feet and 30,000 square feet. 
We target new centres to be EBITDA-enhancing 
to the Group’s business.
Merging leisure with retail
The intu scheme in Derby provided an 
opportunity as part of a new leisure extension, 
along with indoor golf, in a creatively converted 
internal third-floor car park. The site is situated 
below the top trading cinema in the city and 
is in close proximity to more than ten casual 
dining restaurants. 
Our experience in property deals, our strong 
financial trading history, our desirable lease 
covenant and our high-quality customer 
proposition puts us in a solid position to 
negotiate with landlords.
We look to build partnerships with landlords to 
identify future opportunities as well as the one 
under consideration. An example is our multi 
centre relationship with intu, which currently 
shows a further three new centres in our 
opening pipeline. We also work closely with 
landlords on pre-launch marketing support.

Hollywood Bowl Group has led the way 
in modernising bowling and upgrading the 
customer experience. A new centre opening 
gives us the chance to showcase our latest 
innovations and create a real ‘Wow’ factor right 
across the customer journey. Our financial model 
is based on expected ROI levels and lifetime of 
assets. Our internal marketing and operations 
teams work closely with our architects and 
contractors to deliver a high quality, well-
designed scheme on time and on budget.
A new centre creates an average of 40 new 
jobs in its community. We recruit only the most 
enthusiastic and engaging people for our team 
to deliver the best experience for our customers 
and there is always healthy competition to join us. 
Our people-support team are very busy running 
recruitment events and organising comprehensive 
cultural inductions and operational training. These 
are supported by experienced team members and 
management from our other centres. A key hire 
is Centre Manager, a position which could be filled 
by internal promotion or by an external candidate. 
The new manager has a comprehensive incentive 
programme in place which covers financial, 
operational and customer measures.
Showcasing innovation
Our Derby Hollywood Bowl includes

STRATEGIC  
REPORT Principal risks
Effective risk management
The Board retains ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management framework and annually reviews the Group’s 
principal risks.
The Board takes responsibility for the management of risk 
throughout the business. It believes that risk is best managed 
by a combination of the following:
• a formal risk management process, as described below;
• senior management and executives leading by example;
• alignment through centre managers acting as owners 
of their businesses; and
• embedding our culture and values throughout the 
Group’s operations
Each department head is responsible for evaluating risk 
controls in place and for drawing up plans to improve them where 
appropriate. Details of risks and their controls are recorded in the 
Group’s risk register, a working document which is presented to 
the Board half-yearly.
The Board confirms that it has carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. The Board’s assessment of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group and the mitigation in place is set 
out below. Risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, 
or which we currently believe to be immaterial, may also have 
an adverse effect on the Group.
While the principal risks and uncertainties could impact future 
performance, none of them are considered likely, individually 
or collectively, to affect the viability of the Group during the 
assessment period.
TYPE OF RISK RISK POTENTIAL EFFECT MITIGATION
Financial 
Impact compared 
to FY2016
Adverse economic conditions 
may have an effect on 
Group results.
A decline in spend on 
discretionary leisure activity 
could lead to a reduction 
in profits.
The majority of sites are based in 
high footfall areas that should withstand 
an economic downturn. The Board 
continually reviews its revenue streams 
for opportunities to enhance 
the customer experience, introducing 
VIP lanes in 40 centres, trialling Virtual 
Reality and also cashless amusements.
Financial 
Impact compared

A failure to review funding 
arrangements when they 
become due, or a failure to 
meet banking covenants may 
have adverse impact.
Covenant breach. The Group has considerable headroom 
on its current facilities, with gross debt 
significantly below market opportunity for 
funding. Further uncommitted borrowing 
facilities exist for both capital investment 
and working capital requirements. Net

firewalls to ensure their integrity. The 
Group plans to move to a new analytics 
system allowing the IT team to see 
real-time or historical threat analytics.
The Group does not hold any customer 
financial payment information.

Potential financial penalties 
and reputational damage.
Expert opinion is sought where 
relevant. We run continuous training and 
development courses for appropriately-

with their roles.
The Board has oversight of the 
management of regulatory risk and 
ensures that each member of the 
Board is aware of their responsibilities.

REPORT Principal risks continued
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, in addition to the going concern statement 
the Directors have also assessed the prospects of the Group 
over a three-year period. This period reflects the investment 
cycle of our refurbishment programme and also our outlook 
in terms of projected new centre openings.
The Directors confirm that the Group has considerable 
financial strength, and therefore they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due for the three years ending 
September 2020.
The three-year plan considers the Group’s earnings growth 
potential, its cash flows, financing options and covenant 
tests, taking into account the economic outlook as well as the 
principal risks and mitigating factors affecting the Group. The 
assessment of viability has been made with reference to the 
Group’s current position and future projections, its strategy 
and principal risks. These were reviewed by the Directors at 
their strategy day in July 2017, when the three-year financial 
plan was considered, and during the budget consideration 
at September’s Board meeting.
As a result of this, sensitivities against the three-year plan have 
also been reviewed as has the Group’s strong balance sheet 
and low levels of debt.
Going concern
The Group has considerable financial resources. At 
30 September 2017, it had cash balances of £21.9m and 
undrawn financing facilities of £10.0m which are available 
to fund new centres, capital expenditure and working capital.
In their consideration of going concern, the Directors 
have reviewed the Group’s future cash forecasts and profit 
projections, which are based on past experience and the 
projected opening programme of an average of two new 
centres per annum. The Directors are of the opinion that 
the Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group is able to operate within its current facilities and 
comply with its banking covenants for the foreseeable future.
Taking the above into consideration and also the principal 
risks faced by the Group, the Directors consider it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the Group’s financial information. Further information regarding 
the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future growth, performance and position is set 
out in the Strategic Report on pages 16 to 45. The financial 
position, cash flows and borrowing facilities are shown in 
the Financial review on pages 39 to 42.

hollywood bowl group plc 38 Financial review
A strong performance in the year
Laurence keen
“ The strength of the Group’s 
strategy is reflected in our 
revenue performance and 
EBITDA margin for the year.”
We are pleased to have delivered another strong set of financial 
results in the first full year following our IPO, with revenue growth 
of 8.8 per cent and Group adjusted EBITDA growth of 13.7 per cent.
This growth has contributed to profit after tax of £18.3m 
compared to £1.2m in FY2016. Group adjusted operating cash 
flow increased by 12.5 per cent as a result of the increase in 
Group adjusted EBITDA offset by a slight increase in maintenance 
capital and corporation tax paid in the financial year.

2 Management conducted a review of its key contracts and revenue recognition 
policies; as a result of this and in anticipation of IFRS 15, we have identified that 
certain transactions have been recognised as revenue and cost of sales in previous 
periods, when it is more appropriate to recognise them net.
3 Group adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) 
reflects the underlying trade of the overall business and excludes any exceptional 
costs as noted in this section. It is our view that these are not recurring costs.
4 Group adjusted operating cash flow is calculated as Group adjusted EBITDA less 
working capital and maintenance capital expenditure.
Revenue growth
We are extremely proud to have delivered a record sales 
performance over the 12 months to 30 September 2017 
and are encouraged by the performance of our new centres.
The continued strength of the Group is reflected in its revenue and 
profit performance for the year compared to the prior year. The 
total 8.8 per cent revenue growth has been driven through like for 
like (LFL) revenues growing at 3.5 per cent as well as 5.8 per cent 
from new openings. Group revenue for FY2017 is £114.0m, up 
from £104.8m in the previous year
2
. 
Game volumes grew to 13.1m (8.5 per cent up on prior year) 
and by 3.1 per cent on a LFL basis. This was driven by our 
continued focus on providing excellent customer satisfaction and 
environments that people want to visit more often. Total spend 
per game grew by 0.8 per cent as customers continued to spend 
more across all areas of the business during their visits.
Over the past year, we have invested in refurbishing four centres 
(one completed first week of October), which are realising a return 
on capital employed of over 60 per cent, and rebranded four 
Bowlplex centres (Tunbridge Wells was completed in the first 
week of October 2017) and two AMF centres to Hollywood Bowl. 
These rebrands are transformational for the customer and the 
average returns continue to be above our 33 per cent hurdle rate. 
We will complete the final four Bowlplex rebrands during FY2018, 
as well as undertake three to six other refurbishments.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 39
STRATEGIC  
REPORT LFL revenue is defined as total revenue excluding any new centre 
openings (FY2017: £2.7m), pre-acquisition periods in relation to 
the Bowlplex acquisition on 9 December 2015 (FY2017: £3.4m), 
closed centres (FY2016: £0.3m) from the current or prior year, and 
any other non like-for-like income (leap year effect FY2016: £0.2m) 
and is used as a key measure of constant centre growth.
Gross margin
Gross profit margin improved from 85.3 per cent to 86.5 per cent 
due to the full-year effect of the new drinks contract (January 2016), 
improved terms on amusements (February 2016) and a marginal 
increase in bowling mix seen in the year. As well as these factors, 
our teams in-centre continue to receive on the job training to deliver 
food and drink product to specification each and every time. Gross 
profit margin has improved from 84.0 per cent in FY2015.
Administration expenses
Administration expenses were flat year-on-year due to the 
significant reduction in exceptional items. 
Excluding exceptional items and property disposals, 
administration expenses increased £5.1m (7.3 per cent). The 
majority of this increase is split between new centres at £1.5m, the 
full-year effect of the Bowlplex centres at £2.1m and depreciation 
of £0.7m, while constant centre costs decreased by £0.3m. The 
largest cost within administration expenses is property costs, 
of which rent accounts for £13.7m. Property costs increased by 
£1.2m due to an increase in the number of centres we operate, 
as well as a small increase, less than 0.1 per cent, in property 
rates on the back of the rating revaluation in April 2017. Employee 
costs also form a significant proportion of administration expenses 
– £21.6m, and in total increased by £1.5m, however on a constant 
centre basis the increase was just over £0.1m, to £17.0m.
Support centre costs increased from £8.8m to £10.9m. 
This was largely due to the administrative and employee costs 
associated with being a fully listed company, increased spend 
on marketing activity, as well as increased training and travel costs 
associated with our Centre Management leadership programmes. 
The support centre cost is not expected to increase significantly 
in FY2018.
Group adjusted EBITDA
Group adjusted EBITDA increased by 13.7 per cent during the 
year mainly due to revenue growth over this period, as well as 
an improvement in the gross profit margin as noted above. 
Growth in EBITDA from our constant centres has contributed 
significantly towards the growth in Group adjusted EBITDA. 
Constant centre EBITDA grew by 8.9 per cent year-on-year, 
to an average of £786,000 per centre.
EBITDA from new centres was encouraging this year, 
with both Southampton and Derby performing significantly 
above expectations. 
Management use EBITDA adjusted for exceptional items (Group 
adjusted EBITDA) as a key performance measure of the business.

1 The Group was able to make a one-off retrospective reclaim in respect of 
overpaid VAT relating to customers who were ‘no-shows’ and children’s shoe 
hire. This VAT rebate relates to a rebate for FY2012 to FY2015. This has been 
classified as other income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income for the year ended 30 September 2016. The amount recognised in 
FY2017 relates to a historic claim for no shows from FY2015 to FY2016.
2 There was a sector wide property rating appeal which was settled during FY2015 
and resulted in a majority of the Group’s centres receiving one-off rebates for the 
period from April 2010 onwards. Most of this was received in FY2015. With the 
new rating effective from April 2017, the normal rates appeals process will be 
followed and in-year refunds have not been included within exceptional costs. 
3 For FY2016 this includes profit for the sale of the Avonmeads Centre (£0.8m) 
and a reverse premium (£1.6m) for exiting a lease rental contract for the

7 Allocation of shares to employees on IPO date. Shares issued to employees were 
recorded at fair value, being the strike price at IPO. This comprised the fair value 
of the shares (£527,000) and the employers’ national insurance expense (£73,000). 
This was a one-off allocation of shares to employees as part of the IPO. Share-
based payments and other LTIPs have not been included in exceptional items as 
these are envisaged to be recurring and part of the normal course of business.
8 Costs (comprising legal and professional fees) relating to review of a strategic

9 Card payment processing fees relating to prior periods that were not 
previously invoiced.
10  The release of a dilapidation provision for a site that will be exited in FY2018 
with no associated costs expected.
Finance costs
Finance costs decreased from £11.9m in FY2016 to £1.1m as 
a result of the Group’s post IPO financing structure. The Group 
currently has gross debt of £30m with the first debt repayment 
of £0.75m due in December 2017. The Group also has an undrawn 
revolving credit facility of £5m and capital expenditure facility 
of £5m.
Taxation
The Group has incurred a tax charge of £2.8m for the year which 
represents an effective tax rate on statutory profit before tax of 
13.5 per cent. Excluding the deferred tax element, the effective 
rate would be 20.5 per cent.
Earnings
Profit before tax for the year was £21.1m which was higher 
than the prior year by £18.5m as a result of the factors discussed.
The Group delivered a profit after tax of £18.3m.
Basic and adjusted earnings per share was 12.17 pence.
Dividend
As stated at the time of the IPO, we expect to maintain a 
progressive dividend policy which reflects the Group’s 
strong earnings potential and cash generative characteristics, 
while allowing us to retain sufficient capital to fund ongoing 
operating requirements and invest in the Group’s long-term 
growth plans. 
For the year ended 30 September 2017, the Board is 
recommending a final ordinary dividend of 3.95 pence per share, 
giving a total ordinary dividend for the year of 5.75 pence per 
share, and dividend cover of 2.0 times underlying earnings 
per share.
The final dividend will be paid, subject to shareholder approval at 
the Company’s AGM on 30 January 2018, on 27 February 2018 
to shareholders on the register on 2 February 2018.
The Board expects to maintain leverage below 1.0 times net 
debt to underlying historic last twelve months EBITDA. Whilst 
this leverage ratio will typically vary during the financial year, 
the Board’s current intention is to maintain average leverage 
around this level.
To the extent that there is surplus cash within the business and, 
as outlined in the capital structure section on page 42, other 
priorities having been satisfied, the Board expects to return 
the surplus to shareholders. In line with this strategy, a special 
dividend of 3.33 pence per share, will be paid to shareholders 
alongside the ordinary dividend. This will mean that the Group 
has returned a total of £13.6m in cash to shareholders for the 
year, equating to 9.08 pence per share.
Cash flows
The Group continues to deliver strong cash generation with 
Group adjusted operating cash flow 12.5 per cent higher at 
£26.7m due to an increase in EBITDA and efficient use of working 
capital, offset by increased tax payments. This resulted in Group 
adjusted operating cash flow conversion of 79.9 per cent.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT Capital structure and cash allocation
Our top priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet. The debt 
target of 1x net debt to underlying last twelve months EBITDA has 
been set at a level the Board believes to be appropriate, taking 
into account the Group’s strong, regular cash flow generation, 
property commitments and lack of pension deficit. 
Our priorities for use of cash, based on the balance sheet 
described above, will be:
• capital investment in existing centres as well as new centre 
opportunities; 
• appropriate acquisition opportunities; 
• to pay and grow the ordinary dividend every year within a cover 
ratio of approximately 2x; and 
• thereafter, any excess cash will be available for additional 
distribution to shareholders as the Board deems appropriate. 
The debt target is intended as guidance rather than a hard and 
fast rule. Our clear priority at present is investment to deliver our 
strategy. As at 30 September 2017, net debt stood at 0.24x 
underlying EBITDA.
Capital expenditure
Total capital expenditure was up 69.8 per cent year-on-year, 
to £13.3m. The largest increase was in respect of new centres, 
where during FY2017 we spent £3.9m (net of landlord contributions) 
compared to £0.6m in the prior year. FY2017 includes all capital 
for the three new centres opened in the year, plus over 60 per 
cent of the expected capital for our new centre in Dagenham, 
which opened in early October 2017. As we continued on our 
refurbishment and rebrand programme, this expenditure 
increased marginally year-on-year, by £0.1m, to £3.0m.

Strategic Report
hollywood bowl group plc 42 Sustainability
Our approach to sustainability
Outside of the experience and environments we provide, 
we understand that how we behave as a business has 
a major part in shaping how people view us. 
A key element of the Group’s culture is the promotion 
of sustainability, which we believe enhances our ability 
to execute our strategy and deliver value for our customers, 
team and shareholders.
As a nationwide multi-site business we seek to enhance the 
wellbeing of our people, our customers and the communities 
in which we operate.
Customers
Bowling is an activity that promotes healthy competition and 
provides an inclusive, interactive experience, enabling families 
and friends to spend quality social time together and improve 
their general wellbeing.
All of our centres have access for the disabled and we are 
committed to delivering an inclusive fun-filled experience for 
customers of all abilities. In FY2017, over £1.5m of concessionary 
discounts were redeemed across a number of user groups. 
We recognise that the consequences of a poor diet are an 
important health challenge in the UK and continue to work with 
our suppliers to reduce the salt and sugar content of their products. 
Our new Hollywood Diner menu offers a range of healthier eating 
options, including salads and, for children, vegetable options in their 
range. Alongside this, we introduced a sugar-free option across 
a range of drinks categories including carbonated soft drinks, 
slush and mixers.
We maintain contact with regulatory bodies and our suppliers to 
ensure the correct decisions are taken in terms of our amusement 
area game content, quantity and age-appropriate mix.
Our people
Hollywood Bowl Group employs over 2,000 team members and 
is a business that likes to develop its own talent and promote from 
within. It is part of our culture and strategy to constantly challenge 
our ways of working.
It is our teams that deliver the fun to our customers and we 
continually invest in their training and development to enhance 
this, with an average spend per head of £130 in 2017. On joining 
the company, team members follow a structured induction 
covering our culture, customer service and health and safety. 
We launched our new online learning system in 2017 to support 
all team members’ continuous development.
We seek to further engage our teams by offering rewarding career 
paths and opportunities. We run several top talent development 
programmes, including our Assistant Manager in Training programme 
for team members who wish to progress into management. Almost 
100 team members enrolled on this programme in 2017 , with 36 
internal assistant manager appointments being made as a result. 
We also have our Centre Manager Top Talent Programme for junior 
managers who wish to run their own centres – 14 managers enrolled 
on the programme last year and we are delighted that seven have 
been appointed Centre Manager. 
Centre Managers are key to the success of the company. We 
give them the autonomy to run their own business and share their 
centre’s success via a significant bonus scheme. We ran a senior 
leadership programme for the first time in 2017. This was attended 
by ten of our future leaders, five of whom have been promoted 
to new roles. 
A highlight of the year is our annual awards conference. Six of 
our 2017 Centre Manager winners attended a major amusements 
convention in the USA. 
We are excited about the launch of our save as you earn share 
save scheme (SAYE) in January 2018. This will give all of our team 
the opportunity to share in the financial success of the business.
We are committed to providing an inclusive environment and firmly 
believe that no-one should suffer discrimination on the grounds of 
race, colour, ethnicity, religious belief, political affiliation, gender, 
sexual orientation, age or disability.

Community engagement
As a business spread over 58 locations around the UK, we seek 
to support the communities we operate in by offering support 
through fundraising, awareness and access. 
This year we worked with Neighbourly.com to connect with 
charities and community projects local to each of our centres 
and our Hemel Hempstead support centre. 
Each centre chose a charity that would benefit families or younger 
people. Many fantastic events took place including ‘Togetherness 
Days’ and ‘Hero Pin’ evenings, during which strike-scoring 
customers earned a donation to their centre’s charity.
Through donations and fundraising activities, more than £50,000 
has been raised for our charities and projects and the top-performing 
centres were honoured at our annual manager’s conference.
We are pleased to be continuing with this community engagement 
programme in FY2018.
Health and safety
Bowling is a fun and safe way to keep active and we like to 
keep it that way. We design our centres and train our teams with 
this in mind, both for our customers’ and our teams’ welfare. We 
comply with all safety legislation and act on all reported incidents. 
As part of our internal audit reviews, we undertake safety audits. 
The output from these reviews, as well as any incident reports, 
are reviewed by the Board on a monthly basis.
Hollywood Bowl Group Plc has a Primary Authority agreement 
with South Gloucestershire Council covering both health and 
safety and food safety.
Sustainability continued
Local charity relationships
An example of our work with local charities is the team at 
the Glasgow Springfield Quay centre who developed a wide 
ranging community programme to support Calum’s Cabin – 
an amazing charity which runs a holiday retreat for children 
with cancer.
The team built up a great relationship with charity volunteers 
and everyone pulled together to deliver a successful year 
of fundraising activity. This all raised the profile of the 
charity’s great work with our customers.
Several events were held including a charity bowling evening, 
raffles, cake sales and bucket collections and the team have 
committed to further help with volunteering alongside 
continued fundraising support in 2018.
Strategic Report
hollywood bowl group plc 44 Environment
Hollywood Bowl Group has a strong and genuine commitment 
to conduct all operations in an ethical and responsible manner 
and this is also demonstrated in our environmental and energy 
achievements.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for FY2017 have been 
measured under the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended 
in 2013. The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standards (revised edition) and the data has been provided by 
Schneider Electric through analysis of our utility invoices.
Scope 1 emissions 807.75 tCO 2e 
Scope 2 emissions 6,532.6 tCO 2e
Total scope 1 and 2 emissions 7,340.35 tCO 2e
Intensity ratio (tCO 2e per centre) 132.9
Electricity usage
Our commitment to efficiently and ethically use natural resources 
is ongoing. We have reduced our intensity ratio for Scope 2 
(electricity) by 33 per cent since 2010 (on a like-for-like basis using 
2017 conversion factors for both figures).
We have reduced our emission ratio for scope 1 and 2 emissions 
by 29.4 per cent and 18 per cent respectively, for FY2017 
compared to the base year (FY2016).
Scope 1 Scope 2 Scope 1+2 Intensity Ratio
FY2016 8,195.0 895.7 9,090.7 162.3
FY2017 6,532.6 807.5 7,340.1 132.9
The reductions in electricity usage have been achieved by a range 
of methods, including:
• maximising efficiency of control strategies for air-handling plant 
and investing in new plant and machinery;
• continuing our transition to LED lighting. At the start of FY2016, 
we had converted 75 per cent of our lighting to LED and had 
targeted 80 per cent by the end of FY2017. We are ahead of 
schedule in this area and have now converted almost 95 per 
cent of our lighting to LED. The majority of the lamps not 
converted are in low footfall areas and are activated by motion 
sensors; and
• advising our teams of the benefits of reducing electricity usage.
Recycling
We recycle our waste to help minimise our environmental impact. 
At the end of FY2016, we were recycling 59 per cent of our 
waste and we set a target of 70 per cent by end of FY2017 – 
we achieved this target in August 2017.
We have also cut the amount of waste we generate by reducing 
the use of straws and napkins and we are working with our 
suppliers to introduce reduced packaging products across 
our business.

Peter boddy
“ We have made good progress in a 
number of areas during the course 
of the year, our first full year as 
a listed company.”
Dear Shareholders
The Board is committed to ensuring that the Company operates 
to high standards of corporate governance and complies with 
the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) 
as it applies to smaller companies (ie those below the FTSE 350).
We have made good progress in a number of areas during 
the course of the year, our first full year as a listed company. 
In particular, we have focused on Board composition and 
succession planning (supported by the Nomination Committee); 
Board effectiveness, through our first Board and committee 
performance evaluation process (described in more detail on 
page 53); and on further developing our oversight (supported 
by the Audit Committee) of risk management and internal 
control systems.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to reiterate our thanks to 
Bill Priestley, who resigned as a Director in April when Epiris 
sold its remaining shareholding in the Company. Following Bill’s 
resignation, we initiated a search (described in the Nomination 
Committee report on page 55) for a new independent Non-
Executive Director and were delighted to welcome Ivan Schofield 
to the Board on 1 October. We are already benefiting from Ivan’s 
significant experience as a CEO in the retail and leisure sector. 
Following Ivan’s appointment, the Board (excluding me as 
Chairman) comprises a majority of independent Non-
Executive Directors.
We continue to watch with interest the developments in the UK’s 
corporate governance regime. We will consider what action may 
be required to ensure continued compliance once the new version 
of the Code is settled. 
The following report, and the reports of the Board Committees, 
describe how we have applied the principles of the 2016 version 
of the Code in the period since our 2016 Annual Report. In doing 
so, they also set out our governance structure and summarise the 
key activities of the Board and Committees in the period since our 
last Annual Report.

GOVERNANCE
49 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate Governance report
UK Corporate Governance Code – 
Compliance Statement
The Company has applied all of the main principles of the Code 
as they apply to it as a ‘smaller company’ (defined in the Code 
as being a company below the FTSE 350) and has complied 
with all relevant provisions of the Code during the year. 
Governance structure
The Company’s governance framework, designed, supported 
and monitored by the Board and its Committees, is structured 
around clearly defined roles, responsibilities and accountabilities, 
and aims to ensure that appropriate systems, procedures, 
controls and assurances are in place to enable the effective 
assessment and management of risk and the delivery of the 
Group’s strategic objectives. 
Schedule of matters reserved to the Board 
and delegated authorities
The Board retains control of certain key decisions through the 
schedule of matters reserved to the Board which is available to 
view on the Group’s website www.hollywoodbowlgroup.com. The 
Board has delegated other matters, responsibilities and authorities 
to each of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees, 
and these are documented in the terms of reference of each 
of those Committees, which are also available on the website. 
Anything falling outside of the schedule of matters reserved or the 
Committee terms of reference, falls within the responsibility and 
authority of the CEO, including all executive management matters. 
Key Board roles and responsibilities 
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer. The key responsibilities of members 
of the Board are set out below. Biographies of each director, 
which describe the skills and experience he or she brings to 
the Board, can be found on pages 48 and 49.
Non-Executive Chairman – Peter Boddy
Peter is responsible for the leadership and overall effectiveness 
of the Board and for setting the Board’s agenda. He promotes 
a culture of openness and facilitates the effective contribution 
of the Non-Executive Directors in Board debates and discussion. 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) – Stephen Burns
Stephen is responsible for all executive management matters, 
including: performance against the Group’s strategy and 
objectives; leading the executive leadership team in dealing 
with the day to day operations of the Group; and ensuring 
that the culture, values and standards set by the Board are 
embedded throughout the organisation.
Senior Independent Director (SID) – Nick Backhouse
Nick provides a valuable sounding board for the Chairman 
and leads the Non-Executive Directors’ annual appraisal of the 
Chairman. Nick is available to shareholders if they have concerns 
which are not resolved through the normal channels of the CEO 
or Chairman, or where such contact is inappropriate.
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) – Laurence Keen
Laurence works with the CEO to develop and implement 
the Group’s strategic objectives. He is also responsible for 
the financial performance of the Group, the Group’s property 
interests and supports the CEO in all investor relations’ activities. 
Non-Executive Directors – Nick Backhouse, 
Claire Tiney, Ivan Schofield
Nick, Claire and Ivan provide objective and constructive challenge 
to management, and help to develop proposals on strategy. They 
also scrutinise and monitor financial and operational performance, 
and support the executive leadership team, drawing on their 
background and experience from previous roles.
During the year, Bill Priestley served as a non-independent 
Non-Executive Director pursuant to the Relationship Agreement 
entered into between Electra Private Equity Partners 2006 
Scottish LP, its manager, Electra Partners LLP (together the 
Electra Shareholders), and the Company at the time of the IPO. 
The Relationship Agreement entitled the Electra Shareholders 
to appoint one Non-Executive nominee Director to the Board for 
as long as the Electra Shareholders were entitled to exercise or 
control, directly or indirectly, ten per cent or more of the votes able 
to be cast on all, or substantially all, matters at general meetings 
of the Company. The Relationship Agreement terminated in April 
when the Electra Shareholders disposed of their interest in the 
shares of the Company, and Bill Priestley therefore resigned as 
a Director of the Company on 7 April 2017.

Membership and attendance of Board Committees
The Company has complied with provision B.1.2 of the Code (as 
it  applies to smaller companies) throughout the year as it has had 
at least two independent Non-Executive Directors. Since 7 April 
2017, more than half the Board (excluding the Chairman) has 
comprised independent Directors. 
As noted on IPO and explained in the 2016 Annual Report, 
the Company does not comply with provision A.3.1 of the Code 
which requires that the Chairman should, on appointment, meet 
the independence criteria set out in provision B.1.1 of the Code. 
It is our view that provision A.3.1 is only relevant in the year of 
the Chairman’s appointment and we therefore do not intend to 
repeat the explanation for non-compliance each year.
Board and Committee attendance
The Board meets formally at least ten times per year. Ad hoc 
meetings are called as and when appropriate, but no such ad-hoc 
meetings were required during FY2017. The table below shows

GOVERNANCE
51 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 In addition to the formal scheduled meetings, all Directors 
attended a full strategy review session in July 2017, and the 
Company’s annual conference and awards in September 2017. 
Non-Executive Directors remain in regular contact with the 
Chairman, whether in face to face meetings or by telephone, 
to discuss matters relating to the Company without the 
Executives present.
Where Directors are unable to attend a meeting, they are 
encouraged to submit to the Chairman any comments on papers 
to be considered at the meeting to ensure that their views are 
recorded and taken into account during the meeting. 
Activity during the year
The Board approves an annual calendar of agenda items to 
ensure that all matters are given due consideration and are 
reviewed at the appropriate point in the regulatory and financial 
cycle. At each meeting, the Executive Directors provide the 
Board with updates on the Company’s operational and financial 
performance, and regular updates are also provided on business 
development, HR and health and safety matters. At the Board’s 
meeting in September, the Board received budget presentations 
from each of the Regional Support Managers as part of its 
oversight and approval of the annual budgeting process.
The Board has a clear role in developing the Company’s strategy. 
In addition to the strategy day held in June, the Board discussed 
and monitored the impact of various specific strategic initiatives 
at its meetings during the year including:
• the development, trial and roll-out of dynamic pricing;
• virtual reality and cashless amusement trials;
• the single diner menu; and
• the ongoing centre refurbishment programme.
Regular updates on legal, regulatory and governance 
developments are provided by the Company Secretary. Updated 
terms of reference of the Board committees, the Anti-Bribery and 
Anti-Corruption Policy, and the Company’s Slavery and Human 
Trafficking Statement were reviewed and approved by the Board 
during the year.
Outside of formal Board meetings, the Chairman and the Non-
Executive Directors have visited the Company’s centres, including 
attending new or refurbished centre openings, to meet local 
management teams and further develop their knowledge and 
understanding of the Company’s operations.
Information and support
Agendas and accompanying papers are distributed to the Board and 
Committee members well in advance of each Board or Committee 
meeting. These include reports from Executive Directors, other 
members of senior management and external advisers. All Directors 
have direct access to senior management should they require 
additional information on any of the items to be discussed. 
The Board and the Audit Committee receive further regular and 
specific reports to allow the monitoring of the adequacy of the 
Company’s systems of internal controls (described in more 
detail in the Audit Committee report on page 56). 
Appointment and election
The Non-Executive Directors are expected to devote sufficient 
time to the Company’s affairs to fulfil their duties as Directors. 
Their letter of appointment anticipates that they will need to 
commit a minimum of two days per month to the Company, 
clarifying that more time may be required. This time commitment 
was reviewed and confirmed as appropriate by the Nomination 
Committee during the year, and each of the Non-Executive 
Directors has confirmed that they continue to be able to 
devote sufficient time to discharge their duties as Directors 
of the Company.
The Board considers all Directors to be effective and committed 
to their roles. The Board has decided to comply with provision 
B.7.1 of the code and accordingly all members of the Board will 
be offering themselves for re-election, or election in the case of 
Ivan Schofield, at the Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
on 30 January 2018.

Induction
A tailored induction was provided to Ivan Schofield on his 
appointment to the Board. The induction was designed by 
the Chairman and Executive Directors, with assistance from 
the Company Secretary. The induction’s purpose was to give 
Ivan an overview of the Company, focusing on our culture, 
operations and governance structure. The induction involved:
• meetings with the Chairman and the Board;
• discussions with the executive leadership team, covering topics 
such as strategy and business plan, culture and values, 
investor relations and communications, and risk management 
systems and controls;
• site visits to a number of centres with the opportunity to meet 
their teams; and
• attendance at the Company’s annual conference.
Ivan was provided with an appointment pack which includes key 
governance policies and procedures and information relating to the 
activities of the Board and Committees. Additionally, he was briefed on 
the responsibilities and obligations of a Director of a listed company.
Performance evaluation
As with any successful organisation, there is a continual need to 
monitor and improve performance. The Board recognises this can 
be achieved through regular Board evaluations, which provide 
valuable feedback for improving Board effectiveness. 
The 2017 evaluation was conducted by the Chairman through a 
combination of one-to-one interviews with all Board members and 
the completion of detailed questionnaires designed to assess the 
effectiveness and assist in the objective review of the performance of 
the Board, individual Directors and the Committees. Separately, the 
Senior Independent Director conducted interviews with other Board 
members in order to evaluate the performance of the Chairman.
The findings of these meetings and questionnaires were reviewed 
and discussed at a Board meeting, and the key action points set out 
below were agreed. The outcomes of the evaluation process were 
both pleasing and encouraging, concluding that the Board and the 
Committees are all performing effectively and at a standard matching 
the high performance of our Executives. Three specific actions have 
been agreed to further improve the effectiveness of the Board:
• to increase the amount of discussion time devoted 
to developing the medium term strategy;
• to work with our company secretarial service provider 
to enhance the Board’s knowledge and awareness of the 
forthcoming changes to the UK corporate governance 
landscape; and
• to arrange for some Board meetings to be held regionally 
at our centres. 
These actions will be reviewed and monitored by the Board and 
Nomination Committee, and progress assessed as part of the Board 
evaluation exercise next year. We anticipate that future performance 
evaluation processes will be carried out on a similar basis, led either 
by the Chairman or the Senior Independent Director. 
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Board-approved procedure relating to 
Directors’ conflicts of interest, all Directors have confirmed that they 
did not have any conflicts of interest with the Group during the year.
Relations with shareholders
As part of its ongoing investor relations programme, the Group 
aims to maintain an active dialogue with its shareholders, including 
institutional investors, to discuss issues relating to the performance 
of the Group, including strategy and new developments. 
The Non-Executive Directors are available to discuss any matter 
shareholders might wish to raise and to attend meetings with 
investors and analysts, as required. Investor relations activity is a 
standing item on the Board’s agenda and ensuring a satisfactory 
dialogue with shareholders, and receiving reports on the views 
of shareholders, is a matter reserved to the Board.
The Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) will take place 
on 30 January 2018 at Investec Bank plc, 2 Gresham Street, 
London EC2V 7QP. The Chairman, and the Chairs of the Audit and 
Remuneration committees, will be present to answer questions put 
to them by shareholders. Electronic proxy voting will be available to 
shareholders through both our registrar’s website and the CREST 
service. Voting at the AGM will be conducted by way of a poll and 
the results will be announced through the Regulatory News Service 
and made available on the Company’s website.

Role and responsibilities
The role of the Nomination Committee is set out in its terms 
of reference, which are available on the Company’s website. The 
Committee’s primary purpose is to develop and maintain a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure for identifying appropriate 
candidates for Board appointment and re-appointment and to 
make recommendations to the Board. 
Specific duties of the Nomination Committee include:
• regularly reviewing the structure, size and composition 
(including the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) of the 
Board and making recommendations to the Board with regard 
to any changes;
• keeping under review the leadership needs of the organisation, 
both executive and non-executive, with a view to ensuring the 
continued ability of the organisation to compete effectively in the 
marketplace; and
• reviewing annually the time required from Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee is also responsible for keeping under 
review Board succession plans and for making recommendations 
on the composition of the Board Committees.
Activity during the year
The Nomination Committee has met on two occasions during 
the year and once since the year end. The meetings focused 
on succession planning within the Group as a whole, the 
composition of the Board and its Committees (including diversity), 
a review of the independence of the Non-Executive Directors and 
the appointment of Ivan Schofield as a Non-Executive Director.

“ The Board recognises the benefits 
of diversity, although it believes 
that all appointments should be 
made on merit.”
Governance
54 hollywood bowl group plc Diversity
The Company’s policy is that no individual should be discriminated 
against on the ground of race, ethnicity, religious belief, political 
affiliation, gender, age or disability, and this extends to Board 
appointments. The Board recognises the benefits of diversity, 
including gender diversity, on the Board, although it believes that 
all appointments should be made on merit, whilst ensuring that 
there is an appropriate balance of skills and experience within the 
Board. The Board currently consists of one female (17%) and five 
male (83%) Directors.
Non-Executive Director appointment
Following Bill Priestley’s resignation in April 2017, the Nomination 
Committee, with particular input from the Chairman, led the 
process to identify and appoint a new Non-Executive Director. 
The process consisted of:
Identifying and agreeing the 
key skills, experience and 
attributes of the desired 
candidate
It was decided that the desired 
candidate should have recent 
operational (ideally CEO) 
experience in the retail and 
leisure sector
Identifying and instructing an 
executive search agency 
Following meetings with several 
executive search agencies, 
Osprey Clarke was engaged. 
Osprey Clarke has no other

Following Ivan Schofield’s appointment, including as a member 
of the Remuneration and Nomination Committees, the Nomination 
Committee is satisfied that the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge on the Board and Committees 
is appropriate.
Succession planning
During the year, the Nomination Committee has reviewed detailed 
succession plans developed by the executive team covering all 
key executive roles (including those of the Executive Directors). 
The Committee is satisfied that the succession plans in place for 
senior executive positions are appropriate, and agreed that the 
Group’s succession planning should be kept under review and 
further developed over time to cover the Chairman and Non-
Executive Director roles.
Annual evaluation
The Nomination Committee has evaluated its own performance 
during the year by way of a questionnaire completed by each 
member of the Committee and key contributors to Nomination 
Committee meetings. The evaluation indicated that the Committee’s 
composition is appropriate, and that the process adopted for the 
appointment of Ivan Schofield during the year was effective. As 
noted above, Board succession planning was indicated as an 
area for further development.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
Chairman: Nick Backhouse
Committee member: Claire Tiney
Number of meetings held in the year: 4
Nick Backhouse
“ We have continued to develop our 
oversight and monitoring of the 
company’s internal control and risk 
management systems.”
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Audit 
Committee report for the period ended 30 September 2017. 
As noted in our 2016 Annual Report, the Committee has been 
comprised wholly of independent Non-Executive Directors since 
Bill Priestley stepped down as a member in November 2016. The 
Board is satisfied that by virtue of my qualification as a chartered 
accountant, my executive background in finance roles, and my 
experience as an audit committee chair in other non-executive 
positions, I have recent and relevant financial experience as 
recommended under provision C.3.1 of the Code. As both Claire 
Tiney and I have experience as Directors of other companies in 
the retail and leisure sector, the Board is also satisfied that the 
Audit Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the 
sector in which the company operates.
During the year, the Committee’s focus has been on the Group’s 
financial reporting, in particular the significant financial judgements 
identified by the finance team and external audit, and on the 
internal financial control systems. We discussed Management’s 
identification of certain transactions that were recognised as 
revenue and cost of sales in previous periods, when it is our 
view it is now more appropriate to recognise the amounts net 
as described in note 2 to the Financial Statements on page 84.
We have also continued to develop our oversight and monitoring 
of the Company’s internal control and risk management systems. 
This has been done primarily through review and challenge of the 
Company’s risk register, review (by the Committee and the Board) 
of various internal policies and procedures (including whistleblowing 
arrangements and the anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy), and 
updates on the activities of the internal audit function and its testing 
of processes and controls implemented at our centres. It is our view 
that the risk management and internal control systems continue to 
work effectively, and it is our intention to ensure that the effectiveness 
of these systems continues to evolve and improve over time.
We have reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit process 
through discussions with our external auditor (KPMG LLP), the CFO 
and key members of the finance team. We have also reviewed KPMG 
LLP’s continuing independence, and oversaw the selection process 
for the new lead audit partner. The Committee is satisfied that KPMG 
LLP continues to be independent and provides an effective audit 
service, and recommends its re-appointment at the 2018 AGM. 
The Audit Committee has evaluated its own performance by way of 
a questionnaire completed by each member of the Committee and 
other regular attendees. We discussed the outcome of the evaluation 
process at our meeting in November 2017 . The evaluation confirmed 
that the Committee continues to operate effectively and identified 
certain areas for improvement during the coming year, in particular 
a further increase in engagement with the internal audit function.

Governance Duties and responsibilities
The Audit Committee’s duties and responsibilities are set 
out in full in its terms of reference, which are available on 
the Company’s website and which were reviewed by the 
Committee during the year, and updated with the approval 
of the Board.
Meetings and attendees
The Audit Committee meets at least three times per year. 
Attendance at Audit Committee meetings held during the year 
is set out in the table on page 51. 
The external auditors have the right to attend meetings. Outside 
of the formal regular meeting programme, the Audit Committee 
chairman maintains a dialogue with key individuals involved in 
the Company’s governance, including the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the external 
audit lead partner.
Activity during the year
The Audit Committee met on four occasions during the year and has 
met once since the year end. The key areas of focus of the Committee 
are discussed in more detail in the rest of this report. Additional items 
on the Committee’s agenda during the year included:
• annual review of the Committee’s terms of reference and 
recommending changes (mainly to better reflect the operation 
of the Group’s internal audit function) to the Board;
• regular review of the Company’s risk register and consideration 
of the process to support the long-term viability statement;
• reviewing the interim results and the Annual Report, Financial 
Statements and recommending their approval by the Board; 
and
• considering the potential impact of future changes in 
accounting standards, in particular in relation to lease 
accounting (which will be effective from FY2020).
Significant issues considered in relation to the Financial Statements
Significant issues and accounting judgements are identified by the finance team and the external audit process and are reviewed by 
the Audit Committee. The significant issues considered by the Committee in respect of the year ended 30 September 2017 are set out 
in the table below.
Significant issues and judgement How the issues were addressed
Goodwill impairment assessment and carrying value of Parent 
Company investments and receivables – impairment assessment
Impairment reviews have been performed by management 
at 30 September 2017, using cash flow forecasts based on the 
budget and three year plan approved by the board. The Audit 
Committee reviewed and considered the key assumptions around 
future growth rates and discount rates used, and is satisfied that 
there is no impairment as at 30 September 2017. Refer to note 13 
to the Financial Statements for further information.
Recoverability of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) The Audit Committee reviewed management’s estimate of the 
useful life of PPE. In particular, the Committee considered 
management’s assumptions used in determining the value in use 
at individual centres. The Audit Committee was satisfied that PPE 
is fairly stated as at 30 September 2017.
GOVERNANCE
57 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for setting the Group’s risk 
appetite and ensuring that there is an effective risk management 
framework to maintain appropriate levels of risk. The Board 
has, however, delegated responsibility for review of the risk 
management methodology and effectiveness of internal control 
to the Audit Committee. 
The Group’s system of internal control comprises entity-wide, 
high-level controls, controls over business processes and 
centre-level controls. Policies and procedures, including clearly 
defined levels of delegated authority, have been communicated 
across the Group. Internal controls have been implemented in 
respect of the key operational and financial processes which exist 
within the business. These policies are designed to ensure the 
accuracy and reliability of financial reporting and govern the 
preparation of the Financial Statements. The Board is ultimately 
responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and risk 
management and discharges its duties in this area by:
• holding regular Board meetings to consider the matters 
reserved for its consideration;
• receiving regular management reports which provide an 
assessment of key risks and controls;
• scheduling annual Board reviews of strategy including reviews 
of the material risks and uncertainties facing the business;
• ensuring there is a clear organisational structure with defined 
responsibilities and levels of authority;
• ensuring there are documented policies and procedures 
in place; and
• reviewing regular reports containing detailed information 
regarding financial performance, rolling forecasts, actual 
and forecast covenant compliance and financial and  
non-financial KPIs.
The process by which the Audit Committee has monitored and 
reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal controls and 
risk management during the year has included: 
• regular reviews of the Group’s risk register compiled and 
maintained by senior managers within the Group. The Audit 
Committee has challenged management to ensure that the risk 
register continues to be developed as a tool to assist in the day 
to day operation of the business; 
• reviewing the system of financial and accounting controls, and 
considering the view of the external auditor in relation to the 
effectiveness of such controls; 
• reporting to the Board on the risk and control culture within the 
Group; and
• considering the Financial Reporting Council’s 2014 ‘Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting’.
The Audit Committee has not identified, nor been made aware 
of, any significant failings or weaknesses in the risk management 
and internal control systems and is satisfied that the systems are 
effective. The Committee will continue to challenge management 
to further improve risk identification, evaluation and management 
processes across the Group.
Internal audit
The Group has an internal audit function which focuses on 
performing regular testing of the processes and controls 
implemented across centres. Internal audit findings are presented 
to the relevant Centre Manager and the Chief Financial Officer for 
review. The Chief Financial Officer provides regular updates to the 
Audit Committee on the activities of the internal audit function so 
that the Committee can assess its effectiveness, and a member 
of the internal audit team reports to the Audit Committee at 
least annually.
Report of the Audit Committee continued
Governance
58 hollywood bowl group plc External auditor
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
relationship with its external auditor, KPMG LLP (KPMG). During the 
year, the Audit Committee has discharged this responsibility by:
• agreeing the scope of the external audit and negotiating the 
remuneration of the external auditor;
• receiving regular reports from the external auditor, including 
with regard to audit strategy and findings from the interim 
review and year-end audits;
• regularly meeting the external auditor without management 
present; and
• assessing the auditor’s independence and the effectiveness 
of the external audit process.
Non-audit services
The engagement of the external audit firm to provide non-
audit services to the Group can impact on the independence 
assessment. The Company has therefore adopted a policy which 
requires Audit Committee approval for any non-audit services 
which exceed £25,000 in value. The engagement of the external 
auditor to provide any non-audit services for less than £25,000 
must be discussed with the Audit Committee Chairman in 
advance. All requests to use the external auditor for non-audit 
services must be reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer. The 
policy recognises that certain non-audit services may not be 
carried out by the external auditor (in accordance with the EU 
Statutory Audit regime). 
During the year ended 30 September 2017, KPMG were engaged 
to provide non-audit services relating to the issuance of a turnover 
certificate for a total fee of £1,500.
Appointment and tenure
KPMG was first appointed as the Group’s external auditor in 2007. 
In line with KPMG’s policy to change the lead audit partner at least 
every five years for listed clients, Mike Woodward was replaced by 
Peter Selvey as lead audit partner during the year. Peter has been in 
post for both the half year review and the September 2017 audit.
The Audit Committee continues to be satisfied with the scope 
of the external auditor’s work, the effectiveness of the external 
audit process, and that KPMG continues to be independent and 
objective. The Committee is therefore pleased to recommend that 
KPMG be re-appointed as the Group’s auditor at the 2018 AGM.
In accordance with the Code and EU legislation, it is the 
Committee’s intention that the external audit contract will 
be put out to tender at least every ten years.
Whistleblowing
The Company has adopted procedures by which employees may, 
in confidence, raise concerns relating to possible improprieties in 
matters of financial reporting, financial control or any other matter. 
The whistleblowing policy applies to all employees of the Group, 
who are required to confirm that they have read the policy and 
are aware of how the procedure operates as part of an ongoing 
internal training programme. The Audit Committee has received 
regular updates with respect to the whistleblowing procedures 
during the year, with only one incident reported, which was, 
in fact, an HR matter and dealt with through the appropriate 
channels. It is intended that more detailed incident reporting 
will be provided to the Audit Committee (including matters 
reported otherwise than through the formal whistleblowing 
procedure) during the year ending 30 September 2018.

60 hollywood bowl group plc Performance in FY2017 and remuneration 
outcomes
It has been a strong year of performance for Hollywood Bowl 
Group. The aim at the time of listing was to ensure that 
appropriate remuneration arrangements were in place to support 
the next phase of the Company’s growth strategy. This included:
• transitioning successfully from a private equity-backed 
business to a listed company; 
• linking the remuneration of Executive Directors to the 
performance of the Company with a remuneration policy 
which supports a high-performance culture; and
• the launching of the new long-term incentive plan (LTIP) with 
the first grants made during the 2017 financial year. Awards 
will vest at the end of three years, subject to satisfaction of 
a performance condition measuring earnings per share in 
the final year of the performance period.
The Remuneration Committee is committed to a policy that aligns all 
stakeholders and the business strategy, enables us to retain and 
recruit executives in a competitive sector, sets challenging targets 
and is fair to all concerned. As described in the Financial Review 
section of this Annual Report, the Company has delivered an 8.8% 
increase in overall revenues, which resulted in an increase in 
adjusted EBITDA to £33.4m. In addition, the Board is recommending 
a final ordinary dividend of 3.95p per share to shareholders. 
The annual bonus plan for Executive Directors was based 
on target performance of EBITDA of £31.8m with a maximum 
payment of 100% of salary for achieving an EDITDA of £32.9m 
in FY2017. Consequently, the Executive Directors will receive a 
payment of 100 per cent of salary which will be paid 65 per cent 
in cash and 35 per cent in shares deferred for two years.
As the earliest vesting date for awards made under the LTIP 
scheme is December 2019, no LTIP awards vested during 
the year. 
Remuneration decisions for FY2018
During the period, the Committee reviewed the base salary 
levels of the Executive Directors and it was deemed appropriate 
to increase base pay in line with the 1.6 per cent salary increase 
across the Group which took effect from 1 November 2017.
We continue to monitor executive remuneration to take account 
of evolving market practice and remain committed to a responsible 
approach. Accordingly, the fundamental structure of the package 
remains largely unchanged. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank shareholders for their 
continued support and I look forward to meeting you at the Annual 
General Meeting on 30 January 2018.
In the meantime, I am always happy to hear from the Company’s 
shareholders. You can contact me via the Company Secretary if 
you have any questions on this report or more generally in relation 
to the Company’s remuneration.

The table below sets out the total remuneration delivered to the Chief Executive Officer over the last two years, valued using the 
methodology applied to the single total figure of remuneration. The Remuneration Committee does not believe that the remuneration 
paid in earlier years as a private company bears any comparative value to that paid in its later years and, therefore, the Remuneration 
Committee has chosen to disclose remuneration only for the two most recent financial years:

Annual bonus plan
The maximum bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors is 100 per cent of salary.
Annual bonus outcomes will be determined based on achievement of financial targets alone.
The Remuneration Committee considered that the detailed performance targets for the FY2017 annual bonus awards were 
commercially sensitive. It decided that disclosing precise targets for the annual bonus plan in advance would not be in shareholder 
interests, but committed to disclosing actual targets, performance achieved and awards made at the end of the performance period 
so that shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts under the annual bonus plan. 
Performance for the FY2017 annual bonus awards was measured against an adjusted EBITDA target, since the Remuneration 
Committee considers this to be an important measure of Group performance and it is consistent with how business performance is 
assessed internally by the Board. 
As set out in the table below, based on the Group’s excellent adjusted EBITDA performance over the year, the Remuneration Committee 
determined that the Executive Directors should be awarded 100 per cent of the maximum opportunity under the annual bonus plan.

Composition and terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee, under agreed terms of reference, responsibility for the Policy and for 
determining specific packages for the Chairman, Executive Directors and such other senior employees of the Group as the Board 
may determine from time to time. The terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee are available on the Company’s website, 
www.hollywoodbowlgroup.com, and from the Company Secretary at the registered office.
All members of the Remuneration Committee are Non-Executive Directors. Claire Tiney (Chair) and Nick Backhouse, who are both 
independent Non-Executive Directors, were appointed on 14 June 2016. Bill Priestley was appointed as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee on 24 June 2016, but stepped down with effect from 24 November 2016 to ensure that the Committee is fully independent 
in line with the Code and investor expectations. Ivan Schofield joined the Remuneration Committee effective 1 October 2017. The 
Remuneration Committee receives assistance from the CEO, CFO and Company Secretary, who attend meetings by invitation, except 
when issues relating to their own remuneration are being discussed. The Remuneration Committee met four times during the year. 
All members attended each meeting.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
During the financial year, the Committee received advice from PWC who were retained as external independent advisers to the 
Committee. PwC advised the Company on all aspects of the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and members of the 
executive team, including the grant of the LTIP award. 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice received was objective and independent. PwC is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure objective and independent 
advice is given to remuneration committees.
PWC received fees of £11,500 for its advice during the year to 30 September 2017.

Articles of Association
The rules governing the appointment and replacement of 
Directors are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association. 
The Articles of Association may be amended by a special 
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital, including changes during 
the year, are set out in note 22 to the Financial Statements. As 
at 30 September 2017, the Company’s share capital consisted 
of  150,000,000 Ordinary shares of one pence each.
Ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice of, and to attend 
and speak at, any general meeting of the Company. On a show of 
hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy (or being a 
corporation represented by a duly authorised representative) shall 
have one vote, and on a poll every shareholder who is present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which 
he or she is the holder. The Notice of Annual General Meeting 
specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing 
a proxy or proxies.
Other than the general provisions of the Articles of Association 
(and prevailing legislation), there are no specific restrictions on the 
size of a holding or on the transfer of the Ordinary shares except 
for restrictions on certain Directors and senior managers of the 
Company (the Management Selling Shareholders) as a result of the 
Management Selling Shareholders entering into a lock-in deed with 
the Company and its sponsor (Investec) restricting the transfer of 
the legal and/or beneficial interest in Ordinary shares held by the 
Management Selling Shareholders immediately after admission for 
a period of two years ending on 16 September 2018.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between 
holders of the Company’s shares that may result in the restriction 
of the transfer of securities or of voting rights. No shareholder 
holds securities carrying any special rights or control over the 
Company’s share capital. Shares held by the Company’s 
Employee Benefit Trust rank pari passu with the shares in 
issue and have no special rights, but voting rights and rights 
of acceptance of any offer relating to the shares rest with the 
plan’s Trustees and are not exercisable by employees.

by its shareholders to make market purchases (within the meaning 
of section 693 of the Companies Act 2006) of up to a maximum

repurchased any of its Ordinary shares under this authority, 
which is due to expire at the AGM to be held on 30 January 2018,

71 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Employee involvement and policy regarding 
disabled persons 
The Company actively encourages employee involvement and 
consultation and places emphasis on keeping its employees 
informed of the Group’s activities and financial performance 
by such means as employee briefings and publication (via the 
Group’s intranet) to all staff of relevant information and corporate 
announcements. The Company also publishes a weekly staff 
bulletin. Further information about employees, including how they 
are incentivised, can be found in the Sustainability section on 
page 43.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always 
fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant 
concerned. In the event of a member of staff becoming disabled, 
every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the 
Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is 
the policy of the Group that the training, career development 
and promotion of a disabled member of staff should, as far 
as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Political donations
The Company did not make any political donations during 
the year.
Change of control – significant agreements
There are a number of agreements that may take effect after, 
or terminate upon, a change of control of the Company, such as 
commercial contracts, bank loan agreements and property lease 
arrangements. None of these are considered to be significant in 
terms of their likely impact on the business as a whole.
Relationship Agreement
Details of the Relationship Agreement entered into between 
the Principal Selling Shareholder, Electra Partners LLP and the 
Company can be found in the Corporate Governance Report 
on page 50. The Relationship Agreement ceased to apply with 
effect from 11 April 2017 as the collective holding of the Electra 
Shareholders (the Principal Selling Shareholder and Electra 
Partners LLP) and any of their associates fell below ten per cent 
of the issued share capital of the Company on that date.

Directors’ report continued
Governance
72 hollywood bowl group plc The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that 
law, they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards, including FRS 102 the Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors 
are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, 
reliable and prudent; 
• for the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU; 
• for the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether 
applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Parent Company Financial Statements; and 
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and that 
enable them to ensure that its Financial Statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.

73 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Hollywood Bowl Group plc only
1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Hollywood Bowl Group 
plc (“the Company”) for the year ended 30 September 2017 which 
comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Statement of 
Cash Flows, Company Statement of Financial Position, Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity, Company Statement of Cash 
Flows and the related notes, including the accounting policies 
in note 2. 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 September 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU’); 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, 
including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable 
in the UK and Republic of Ireland; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis 
for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report 
to the audit committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the directors on 2 June 2016. 
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 2 financial 
years ended 30 September 2017. Prior to that we were also 
auditor to the Group’s previous Parent Company, but which, 
being unlisted, was not a public-interest entity. We have fulfilled 
our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of 
the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including 
the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard 
were provided.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks 
of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise 
below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2016), in decreasing 
order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, 
together with our key audit procedures to address those matters 
and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those 
procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are 
based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for 
the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are 
incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.

(Group: £75 million; 
2016: £75 million
Parent: £123 million; 
2016: £123 million)
Refer to page 57 Audit 
Committee Report), page 87 
and 111 (accounting policy) 
and page 98 and 113 (financial 
disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
Goodwill in the Group and the 
carrying amount of the Parent 
Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries/ intra-group debtor 
balances are the most 
quantitatively significant items on 
the Group and Parent Company 
balance sheet respectively, and 
their recoverability is subjective 
due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting and 
discounting future cash flows.
This is considered to be the area 
that had the greatest effect on 
our overall Group and Parent 
Company audits due to their 
materiality in the context of the 
Group and Parent Company 
financial statements, although 
the recoverability itself is not 
at a high risk of significant 
misstatement or subject 
to significant judgement.
Our procedures included: 
• Historical comparisons: We assessed the reasonableness 
of the budgets by considering the historical accuracy of the 
previous forecasts;
• Evaluating assumptions: We compared the Group’s 
assumptions to externally derived and historical data, as well 
as our own assessments in relation to key inputs, in particular 
the growth and discount rates; 
• Sensitivity analysis: We performed breakeven analysis 
on the key assumptions noted above to assess whether 
a reasonably possible change in these assumptions could 
trigger an impairment charge;
• Comparing valuations: We compared the sum of the 
discounted cash flows to the Group’s market capitalisation 
to assess the reasonableness of those cash flows; and 
• Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the Group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of impairment 
assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected the risks 
inherent in the valuation.
Our results
We found the Group’s assessment of the recoverable amount 
of goodwill in the Group and the Parent Company’s investment 
in subsidiaries and Group debtor balances to be acceptable.
Recoverability of Property, 
Plant & Equipment (‘PPE’)
(£40 million; 2016: £37 million)
Refer to page 57 Audit 
Committee Report), page 87 
(accounting policy) and page 97 
(financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
Property, plant and equipment 
are the second most 
quantitatively significant item on 
the Group balance sheet, and, 
therefore, an area of our audit 
focus due to its size and the 
nature of the Group’s business.
Our procedures included: 
• Assessing impairment indicators: We examined the most 
recent years’ profitability of individual bowling sites to identify 
any indicators of PPE impairment;
• Assessing forecasts: We assessed the forecasts and value 
in use of any underperforming site to consider if an impairment 
charge needed to be recognised; 
• Evaluating assumptions: We compared the Group’s 
assumptions used, to historical and externally derived data, 
as well as our own assessments in relation to key inputs such 
as growth and discount rates; and
• Sensitivity analysis: We performed breakeven analysis 
on the assumptions noted above.
Our results
We found the Group’s assessment of the recoverable amount 
of property, plant and equipment to be acceptable.

75 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3. Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £0.8 million (2016: £0.6m), determined with reference to 
a benchmark of Group profit before tax normalised to exclude 
the write-down of property, plant and equipment of £0.3 million, 
of which it represents 4% (2016: 4%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £40,000 
in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
For both the current and prior year, the Group audit team 
performed the audit of the Group (including the Parent Company 
financial information) as if it was a single aggregated set of financial 
information, at the Group’s head office in Hemel Hempstead. 
The Parent Company materiality, was therefore lower than the 
materiality we would otherwise have determined with reference to 
a benchmark of the Parent Company net assets, and represents 
0.7% (2016: 0.5%) of this benchmark. 
Both the current and prior year audit was performed using the 
materiality level set out on this page and covered 100% of the 
Group’s profit before tax, total revenues and total assets.

4. We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if:
• we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to the directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements 
on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no 
material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the 
Group and Parent Company’s use of that basis for a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; or 
• the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 
38 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5. We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report 
The directors are responsible for the other information presented 
in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion 
or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, 
the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on 
that work we have not identified material misstatements in the 
other information.
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report; 
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ remuneration report 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

Governance
76 hollywood bowl group plc Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation within the Viability Statement 
on page 38 that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity;
• the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and 
explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and 
• the directors’ explanation in the Viability Statement of how they 
have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they considered that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Viability 
Statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit 
and the directors’ statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy; or 
• the section of the annual report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance 
Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the eleven 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by 
the Listing Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters 
on which we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 73, 
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing 
the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or 
to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
GOVERNANCE
77 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud, other irregularities, or error, 
and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of the financial statements. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud or other irregularities 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as they may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control and may involve any area of law and 
regulation not just those directly affecting the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom 
we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for 
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Financial Statements 
hollywood bowl group plc 82 1. General information
Hollywood Bowl Group plc (together with its subsidiaries, the Group) is a public limited company whose shares are publicly traded on 
the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The registered office of the Parent Company is 
Focus 31, West Wing, Cleveland Road, Hemel Hempstead, HP2 7BW, United Kingdom. The registered Company number is 10229630. 
A list of the company’s subsidiaries is presented in note 14.
The Group’s principal activities are that of the operation of ten-pin bowling centres as well as the development of new centres and other 
associated activities.
The Directors of the Group are responsible for the consolidated Financial Statements.
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the consolidated Financial Statements are set out below. These accounting policies have, 
unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated Financial Statements. The financial 
information presented is as at and for the financial years ended 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2016.
Hollywood Bowl Group plc was incorporated on 13 June 2016 as an acquisition vehicle for the purposes of achieving listing on the London 
Stock Exchange and the Company had no significant transactions prior to Admission on 21 September 2016, apart from the acquisition of 
the entire share capital of Kanyeco Limited on 16 September 2016 in a share-for-share exchange. Consequently, for the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group, prepared under IFRS, the principles of reverse acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ were 
applied for the year ended 30 September 2016. The steps to restructure the Group had the effect of Hollywood Bowl Group plc being inserted 
above Kanyeco Limited, of which the shareholders exchanged their shares and loan notes for shares in Hollywood Bowl Group plc.
By applying the principles of reverse acquisition accounting, the Group is presented as if Hollywood Bowl Group plc has always 
owned the Kanyeco Group. The comparative year consolidated reserves of the Group are adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, 
share premium and merger reserve of Hollywood Bowl Group plc, as if it had always existed. The steps taken to restructure the Group 
are explained in more detail in note 22. 
Pursuant to a resolution of the shareholders of the Company passed on 16 September 2016, the Company has completed a reduction 
of capital, cancellation of share premium account and cancellation of capital redemption reserve (the Reduction and Cancellation). 
The Reduction and Cancellation became effective on 9 November 2016.
Statement of compliance
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
for use in the EU (EU-IFRS), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and with those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under EU-IFRS. The functional currency of each entity in the Group is 
Pounds Sterling. The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest 
thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified 
by the recognition of certain financial assets/liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through the statement of 
comprehensive income.
The Company has elected to prepare its Financial Statements in accordance with FRS 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable 
in the UK and Republic of Ireland. On publishing the parent Company Financial Statements here together with the Group Financial 
Statements, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual 
statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these approved Financial Statements.
Judgements made by the Directors, in the application of these accounting policies, that have significant effect on the Financial 
Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed on page 57.
The Group beneath Hollywood Bowl Group plc, headed by Kanyeco Limited, previously first-time adopted EU-IFRS in the year 
ended 30 September 2014. In preparing the consolidated Financial Statements for Hollywood Bowl Group plc for the year ended 
30 September 2016, the Directors reflected, under reverse acquisition accounting, the amounts reported in the Group headed 
by Kanyeco Limited.

Restatement of the statement of comprehensive income
Management conducted a recent process of reviewing its key contracts and revenue recognition policies; as a result of this process, 
and in anticipation of IFRS 15 adoption on 1 October 2018, have identified that certain transactions have been recognised as revenue 
and costs of sales in previous periods, when it is more appropriate to recognise the amounts net. 
Accordingly, these revenues and cost of sales have been netted off in the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 
30 September 2017. Further, considering its significant impact on prior year financial statements, they have been restated as below:
It should be noted there is no impact on gross profit, operating profit, profit after tax, net assets or net cash flow.

Standards issued not yet effective
During the year, a number of amendments to IFRS became effective and were adopted by the Group, none of which had a material 
impact on the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share. 
At the date of authorisation of this financial information, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards 
applicable to the Group have been published but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group. The impact 
of these standards is not expected to be material. These are listed below:
Standard/interpretation Content
Applicable for 
financial years

on/after
IFRS 9 ‘Financial 
Instruments’ (2009) 
and amendment
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is effective for periods commencing on or after 
1 January 2018. IFRS 9 is a replacement for IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’ and 
covers three distinct areas. Phase 1 contains new requirements for the classification 
and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. Phase 2 relates to the impairment 
of financial assets and requires the calculation of impairment on an expected loss 
basis rather than the current incurred loss basis. Phase 3 relates to less stringent 
requirements for general hedge accounting. There will be no significant impact 
on the Group’s accounting for financial assets or liabilities as a result of IFRS 9. 
1 January 2018
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue 
from Contracts 
with Customers’
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenues’, 
and introduces a five-step approach to revenue recognition based on performance 
obligations in customer contracts. The International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) has proposed to issue some clarifications and to defer the standard’s effective 
date of 1 January 2017 to 1 January 2018. Management has assessed the effects 
of applying the new standard on the Group’s Financial Statements and apart from 
the restatement above, has not identified any further significant areas that will 
be affected.
1 January 2018
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, ie the customer (lessee) and the 
supplier (lessor). It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, 
as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new 
standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals 
are recognised. The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Group’s 
operating leases and will result in a material decrease in operating lease rental costs; 
material increases in depreciation and finance costs; a decrease in profit before and 
after tax; a decrease in net assets and recognition of lease assets and liabilities.
As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease 
commitments of £213.8m, see note 24.

Financial Statements

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information incorporates the Financial Statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings. 
The Financial Statements of all Group companies are adjusted, where necessary, to ensure the use of consistent accounting policies. 
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method from the date control passes to the Group. On acquisition, the assets 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Going concern
The Group has considerable financial resources. At 30 September 2017, it had cash balances of £21.9m and undrawn financing facilities 
of £10.0m which are available to fund new centres, capital expenditure and working capital.
In their consideration of going concern, the Directors have reviewed the Group’s future cash forecasts and profit projections, which are 
based on past experience and the projected opening programme of an average of two new centres per annum. The Directors are of the 
opinion that the Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that 
the Group is able to operate within its current facilities and comply with its banking covenants for the foreseeable future.
Taking the above into consideration and also the principal risks, the Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements. 
The Directors have made this assessment after consideration of three-year budgeted cash flows and related assumptions, and 
in accordance with the FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and related Financial and Business Reporting.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is the total amount receivable by the Group for goods supplied, excluding VAT and discounts.
Revenue for food and drink is recognised when the risks and rewards of owning the product have been transferred to the buyer at the 
point of sale, which is when cash is received. Revenue arising from bowling and amusements is recognised when the customer actually 
plays, with deposits paid in advance being held on the balance sheet until that time and then recognised as income.
Given the nature of the Group’s revenue streams, recognition of revenue is not considered to be a significant area of judgement.
Employee benefits
(i) Short-term benefits
Wages, salaries, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the period in which the 
associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
(ii) Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those 
of the Group. The annual contributions payable are charged to the statement of comprehensive income. The Group also contributes 
to the personal pension plans of the Directors.
(iii) Share-based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based payment plan for its employees, under which the employees are granted equity 
instruments of Hollywood Bowl Group plc. The fair value of the services received in exchange for the equity instrument is recognised 
as an expense. The total amount expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the instruments granted:
• including any market performance conditions; and
• excluding the impact of any service and non-performance vesting conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.

STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements continued

Leases
(i) Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals applicable to operating leases are charged against profits on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
• Onerous leases are where the unavoidable costs of a lease exceed the economic benefit expected to be received from it. In these 
circumstances, a provision is made for the present value of the obligation under lease.
• Dilapidation provisions relate to potential rectification costs expected should the Group vacate any of its leased locations.
(ii) Hire purchase agreements and finance leases
Assets held under hire purchase agreements and finance leases are capitalised and disclosed under property, plant and equipment 
at their fair value. The capital element of the future payments is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the statement 
of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis.
Dilapidation provision
A provision will be recorded if as lessee, the Group has a commitment to make good the property at the end of the lease, which would 
be for the cost of returning the leased property to its original state.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost, including expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquired item, less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment, except for investment 
properties and freehold land, evenly over their expected useful lives, calculated at the following rates:
Leasehold property  – lesser of lease period and 25 years 
Bowling lanes and pinspotters – over 40 years
Plant and machinery  –  over 8 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment –  over 8 years
Office equipment –  over 3 years
The carrying value of the property, plant and equipment is compared to the higher of value-in-use and the fair value less costs to sell. 
If the carrying value exceeds the higher of the value-in-use and fair value less the costs to sell the asset, then the asset is impaired and 
its value reduced by recognising an impairment provision.
Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair 
value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Positive goodwill is capitalised. Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment losses. Impairment 
tests on the carrying value of goodwill are undertaken:
• at the end of the first full financial period following acquisition and at the end of every subsequent financial period; and
• in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be receivable.
Software which is not an integral part of hardware assets is stated at historic cost, including expenditure that is directly attributable 
to the acquired item, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is provided to write off cost, less estimated residual values, of all intangible assets, except for goodwill, evenly over their 
expected useful lives, calculated at the following rates:
Software  – over 3 years 
Hollywood Bowl brand – over 20 years
Trademark  – over 20 years
The amortisation charge is recognised in administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Financial Statements 
hollywood bowl group plc 86 2. Accounting policies continued
Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Net realisable value is calculated based on the revenue from sale 
in the normal course of business less any costs to sell. Due allowance is made for obsolete and slow moving items.
Impairment
(i) Impairment of financial assets
All financial assets (other than those categorised at fair value charged through the statement of comprehensive income) are assessed 
at the end of each reporting period as to whether there is any objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events having 
an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
An impairment loss in respect of loans and receivables financial assets is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and 
is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted 
at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
In a subsequent period, if the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the statement of comprehensive 
income to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised 
cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
(ii) Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period for impairment when there is an indication that 
the assets might be impaired. Impairment is measured by comparing the carrying values of the assets with their recoverable amounts. 
The recoverable amount of the assets is the higher of the assets’ fair value less costs to sell and their value in use, which is measured 
by reference to discounted future cash flow. A sensitivity analysis is also performed (see note 13). An impairment loss is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income immediately. 
In respect of assets other than goodwill, and when there is a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, 
a subsequent increase in the recoverable amount of an asset is treated as a reversal of the previous impairment loss and is recognised 
to the extent of the carrying amount of the asset that would have been determined (net of amortisation and depreciation) had no 
impairment loss been recognised. The reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income immediately.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised 
directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement 
of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and
• investments in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the difference can be utilised.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 87
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements continued
2. Accounting policies continued
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are settled or recovered. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
• the same taxable Group company; or
• different entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be 
settled or recovered.
Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The chief 
operating decision-makers have been identified as the management team including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses. The Board considers that the Group’s activity constitutes one operating and one reporting segment, as defined under IFRS 
8. Management reviews the performance of the Group by reference to total results against budget.
The total profit measures are operating profit and profit after tax for the period, both disclosed on the face of the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. No differences exist between the basis of preparation of the performance measures used by management 
and the figures in the Group’s financial information, as adjusted where appropriate.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
• share capital: the nominal value of equity shares;
• share premium reserve;
• retained earnings;
• merger reserve; and
• capital redemption reserve. 
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument 
is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt instrument, those 
financial instruments are classified as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the statement of financial position.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability this is classified as an 
equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited directly to equity.
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, interest-
bearing borrowings and trade and other payables.
Financial assets
On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through the statement of comprehensive 
income, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables financial assets, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans 
and receivables financial assets. Loans and receivables financial assets are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment loss. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective 
interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. The Group’s loans and receivables 
financial assets comprise trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statement of 
financial position.
Financial Statements 
hollywood bowl group plc 88 2. Accounting policies continued 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, which are not subject to significant changes in value and 
have original maturities of less than three months. The Group’s bank facilities are provided under a Group facility.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method other than those categorised as fair value through the statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value through the statement of comprehensive income category comprises financial liabilities that are either held for trading or are 
designated to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise. Derivatives are 
also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same party on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, 
and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially measured at fair value less attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently carried at 
amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Equity instruments
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds. Dividends on Ordinary Shares are recognised as liabilities when approved for distribution.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Derivatives are initially recognised 
at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the end of each 
reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss account immediately. Derivatives are carried as financial 
assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and 
is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or liabilities.
Exceptional items and other adjustments
Exceptional items and other adjustments are those that in management’s judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature 
or incidence, in order to draw the attention of the reader and to show the underlying business performance of the Group more accurately. 
Such items are included within the statement of comprehensive income caption to which they relate and are separately disclosed either 
in the notes to the consolidated Financial Statements or on the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Adjusted measures
The Group uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (non-GAAP) financial measures in addition to those reported 
in accordance with IFRS. The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures, listed below, are important when assessing the 
underlying financial and operating performance of the Group.
These non-GAAP measures comprise of like-for-like revenue growth, net debt and group adjusted operating cash flow.

2. Accounting policies continued 
Group adjusted EBITDA, group adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share are, 
as appropriate, each stated before; exceptional and other adjusting items and the related tax effect of these exceptional and other 
adjusting items, as management do not consider these items when reviewing the underlying performance of the Group as a whole. 
A reconciliation between key adjusted and statutory measures is provided on page 39 of the Financial Review which details the impact 
of exceptional and other adjusted items when comparing to the non-GAAP financial measures in addition to those reported in 
accordance with IFRS. 
Summary of critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial information in conformity with EU-IFRS’s requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires the Directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies which are detailed above. These 
judgements are continually evaluated by the Directors and management, and are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The key estimates and underlying assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement 
of financial position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial period, are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
The estimates and judgements which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities are discussed below:
• Useful lives of depreciable assets
Management reviews the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date to ensure that the useful lives represent a 
reasonable estimate of the likely period of benefit to the Group. Actual useful lives, however, may vary due to unforeseen events. 
• Impairment of assets
EU-IFRS require management to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite life assets and, for finite life assets, to test 
for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Impairment testing is an area involving management judgement, requiring assessment as to whether the carrying value of assets 
can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash flow projections which have 
been discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain assumptions are 
required to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters, including management’s expectations of:
 – growth in EBITDA, calculated as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;
 – long-term growth rates; and
 – the selection of discount rates to reflect the risks involved.
The Group prepares financial budgets on an annual basis, and monitors predicted financial performance and cash flow on a rolling 
monthly basis. These budgets and analyses are used in the calculations.
Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the cash flow 
projections, could affect the Group’s impairment evaluation and hence results.
Financial Statements 
hollywood bowl group plc 90 2. Accounting policies continued 
• Valuation of intangible assets
The determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities including goodwill and other intangibles arising on the acquisition of 
businesses which are expected to generate future economic benefits, is based, to a considerable extent, on management’s judgement.
The fair value of these assets is determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset where no active 
market for the assets exists. The use of different assumptions for the expectations of future cash flows and the discount rate would 
change the valuation of the intangible assets.
Allocation of the purchase price affects the results of the Group as finite-life intangible assets are amortised, whereas indefinite life 
intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortised and could result in differing amortisation charges based on the allocation 
to indefinite life and finite life intangible assets.
3. Segmental reporting
Management consider that the Group consists of a single segment, and operates within the UK. No single customer provides more than 
ten per cent of the Group’s revenue.

1 The Group was able to make a one-off retrospective reclaim in respect of overpaid VAT relating to customers who were ‘no-shows’ and children’s shoe hire. This VAT 
rebate relates to a rebate for FY12 to FY15. This has been classified as other income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 
30 September 2016. The amount recognised in FY17 relates to a historic claim for no shows from FY15 to FY16.
2 There was a sector wide property rating appeal which was settled during FY15 and resulted in a majority of the Group’s centres receiving one-off rebates for the period 
from April 2010 onwards. Most of this was received in FY15. With the new rating effective from April 2017, the normal rates appeals process has been followed and in year 
refunds have not been included within exceptional costs. 
3 For FY16 this includes profit from the sale of the Avonmeads Centre (£0.8m) and a reverse premium (£1.6m) for exiting a lease rental contract for the Liverpool centre.
4 Costs relating to the acquisition of Bowlplex in December 2015. These costs include legal and research fees in connection with the lengthy CMA process which was part 
of the acquisition.
5 In FY16, costs relate to the acquisition of Bowlplex in December 2015, and costs for the management of the Group by Electra. 
6 Costs associated with the IPO of Hollywood Bowl Group plc on the London Stock Exchange on 21 September 2016. Costs include legal and accounting transaction fees 
along with corporate banking costs.
7 Allocation of shares to employees on IPO date. Shares issued to employees were recorded at fair value, being the strike price at IPO. This comprised the fair value of 
the shares (£527,000) and the employers’ national insurance expense (£73,000). This was a one-off allocation of shares to employees as part of the IPO. Share based 
payments and other LTIPs have not been included in exceptional items as these are envisaged to be recurring and part of the normal course of business going forward.
8 Costs (comprising legal and professional fees) relating to review of a strategic acquisition which was not pursued.
9 Card payment processing fees relating to prior periods that were not previously invoiced.

Tax exempt revenues (34) (44)
Adjustment in respect of prior years (1,021) (42)
Total tax expense included in profit or loss 2,848 1,387
The Group’s standard tax rate for the year ended 30 September 2017 was 19.5 per cent (2016: 20 per cent).
The adjustment in respect of prior years for deferred taxation relates to the reduction of overstated deferred tax liabilities created in prior 
years, due to a higher estimate of qualifying net book value of fixed assets against its corresponding tax base.
Factors that may affect future current and total tax charges
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20 per cent to 19 per cent (effective from 1 April 2017) was substantially enacted on 
26 October 2015. A further reduction to 17 per cent (effective from 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016. 
This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly and the deferred tax liability at 30 September 2017 has been 
calculated based on these rates.

11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of Hollywood Bowl Group plc by the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding invested shares held pursuant to a Long Term Incentive Plan 
(note 27). The weighted average number of shares for the preceding year has been stated as if the Group share-for-share exchange 
(note 22) had occurred at the beginning of the comparative year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. During the year ended 30 September 2017, the Group had potentially dilutive 
shares in the form of unvested shares pursuant to a Long Term Incentive Plan (note 27).

Impairment
Impairment testing is carried out at the cash-generating unit (CGU) level on an annual basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group 
of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Each 
individual centre is considered to be a CGU.
The Group determines whether property, plant and equipment are impaired when indicators of impairments exist or based on the 
annual impairment assessment. The annual assessment requires an estimate of the value in use of the CGU to which the property, 
plant and equipment are allocated.

1 This relates to the Hollywood Bowl brand and trademark only.
Impairment testing is carried out at the cash-generating unit (CGU) level on an annual basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group 
of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Each 
individual centre is considered to be a CGU. However, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, it is acceptable under IAS36 
to group CGUs, in order to reflect the level at which goodwill is monitored by management. The whole Group is considered to be one 
CGU, for the purposes of goodwill impairment test, on the basis of the level at which goodwill is monitored by management and 
historical allocation of goodwill upon acquisition.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial 
budgets approved by the Board covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated 
growth rates stated in the key assumptions. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are:
2017 2016
Discount rate (pre-tax) 8.9% 9.8%
Growth rate 2.0% 2.0%
Discount rates reflect management’s estimate of return on capital employed required. This is the benchmark used by management to 
assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals. These discount rates are derived from the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital. Changes in the discount rates over the years are calculated with reference to latest market 
assumptions for the risk free rate, equity market risk premium and the cost of debt.
The key assumptions are number of games and spend per game. Based on these assumptions there is no impairment required.
Financial Statements 
hollywood bowl group plc 98 13. Intangible assets continued
Goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstance indicate that 
the carrying value may be impaired. In the years under review management’s value-in-use calculations have indicated no requirement 
to impair.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The estimates of the recoverable amounts associated with the CGU affords reasonable headroom over the carrying value.
Management have sensitised the key assumptions in the goodwill impairment tests and under both the base case and sensitised cases 
no impairment exists. The key assumptions used and sensitised were forecast growth rates and the discount rate, which were selected 
as they are the key variable elements of the value in use calculation. 
A reduction of 1% or 2% in growth rates for each CGU or an increase in the discount rate applied to the cashflows of each CGU of 1% 
would not cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount. Therefore, management believe that any reasonably possible 
change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge.

The share capital of the Group is represented by the share capital of the Parent Company, Hollywood Bowl Group plc. This company 
was incorporated on 13 June 2016 to act as a holding company of the Group. 
The ‘A’ Ordinary Shares conferred on each holder a right to attend, speak and vote at all meetings of the Company with one vote per 
share on a poll or written resolution. The Deferred Shares did not confer any right to vote, receive notice of or attend general meetings 
of the Company.
The Ordinary Shares are entitled to dividends. The Deferred Share did not entitle any participation in the profits of the Company.
Pursuant to a resolution of the shareholders of the Company passed on 16 September 2016, the Company has completed a reduction 
of capital, cancellation of share premium account and cancellation of capital redemption reserve (the Reduction and Cancellation).
The Reduction and Cancellation was formally approved by the High Court of Justice on 9 November 2016. Following registration of the 
order of the High Court with Companies House, the Reduction and Cancellation became effective on 9 November 2016.
Following the Reduction and Cancellation the issued share capital of the Company consists of 150,000,000 Ordinary Shares of £0.01, 
as at 9 November 2016.
The effect of the Reduction and Cancellation was to create distributable reserves to support the Board’s future dividend policy.

27. Share-based payments
Long term employee incentive costs
The Group operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for certain key management. In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments, 
the value of the awards is measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value is written off on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on management’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. 
A summary of the movement in the LTIP is outlined below:

In accordance with the LTIP scheme outlined in the Group’s remuneration policy, the vesting of these awards is conditional upon the 
achievement of an EPS target set at the time of grant, measured at the end of a three year period ending 30 September 2019, and the 
Executive Directors’ continued employment at the date of vesting.
The awards will vest based on the following adjusted EPS targets:

During the year ended 30 September 2017, 428,113 share awards were granted under the LTIP. For this grant, the Group recognised 
a charge of £122,503 and related employer national insurance of £16,905.
The following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the LTIP granted during the year:

Interest rate swap – 55
The interest rate swap is classified as a Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts are calculated by 
management based on external valuations received from the Group’s bankers and is based on anticipated future interest rate yields. 
The interest rate swap expired on 9 September 2017.
The Group entered into the following interest rate contract with the following terms:
Trade date Type Fixed rate Notional amount Start date End date
03/12/2014 Swap 1.082% 8,000,000 03/12/2014 09/09/2017
Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used 
in the value measurements.
Level 1: inputs are quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2: a valuation that uses observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices in active markets.
Level 3: a valuation using unobservable inputs ie a valuation technique.
There were no transfers between levels throughout the periods under review.
Fair values
All financial assets at the balance sheet dates, which comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents are classified as 
loans and receivables. All financial liabilities which comprise trade and other payables and borrowings are classified as financial liabilities 
at amortised costs except for derivative financial instruments which are carried at fair value.

29. Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (fair value interest rate risk, price risk); credit risk; and liquidity risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. In order 
to minimise this risk the Group endeavours only to deal with companies which are demonstrably creditworthy. In addition, a significant 
proportion of revenue results from cash transactions. The aggregate financial exposure is continuously monitored. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk is the value of the outstanding amount of trade receivables. The management does not consider that there is any 
concentration of risk within either trade or other receivables.
Trade and other receivables are primarily current balances and there are no material balances that are past due and are not impaired. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as is possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both 
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s borrowings are variable rate bank loans. Cash flow risk is therefore the Group’s bank borrowings. The Directors monitor the 
Group’s funding requirements and external debt markets to ensure that the Group’s borrowings are appropriate to its requirements in 
terms of quantum, rate and duration. 
The Group currently holds cash balances to provide funding for normal trading activity. The Group also has access to both short-term 
and long-term borrowings to finance individual projects. Trade and other payables are monitored as part of normal management routine.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities:

hollywood bowl group plc 106 29. Financial risk management continued
Capital risk management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
(i) to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits 
for other stakeholders; and
(ii) to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurate with the level of risk.
To meet these objectives, the Group reviews the budgets and forecasts on a regular basis to ensure there is sufficient capital to meet 
the needs of the Group through to profitability and positive cash flow.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
All working capital requirements are financed from existing cash resources and borrowings.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control 
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt 
obligations with floating interest rates. 
The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into interest rate derivatives when it is considered appropriate to do so by 
management. At 30 September 2017, none of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates of interest. At 30 September 2016 and 2015, 
after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, 25 per cent and 67 per cent of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates of 
interest respectively. 
The effect on the profit after tax of a notional 1 per cent movement in interest rates is as follows:
2017 
£’000
2016

Increase in interest rate of 1% (184) (128)

IFRS 3 looks into the existence of any intangible assets that meet the identifiable criteria for recognition other than as goodwill. These 
include marketing-related (including brands), customer-related, contract-based and technology-based intangible assets. Each was 
considered separately by the Board and it was concluded that no value was attributable to other intangibles. 
The goodwill arising from this acquisition included the various expected business synergies. The business was purchased with potential 
synergy cost benefits of circa £2.6m per annum (£2m from central support and the rest from contractual Group benefits). It was also 
identified that the potential within the Bowlplex sites was significant given their revenue performance versus the Hollywood Bowl centre 
revenue performance.

hollywood bowl group plc 110 1. General information
Hollywood Bowl Group plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is domiciled and 
incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The Company was incorporated on 12 June 2016.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
A summary of the significant accounting policies are set out below, these have been consistently applied throughout the period.
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) as issued in August 2014. The functional and presentational currency of the 
Company is Pounds Sterling. The Financial Statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest 
thousand, except where otherwise indicated. 
The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention.
The financial information presented is at and for the year ended 30 September 2017. The comparative financial information presented 
is at and for a 104-day period ended 30 September 2016.
As the consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has taken the exemptions 
under FRS 102 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• certain disclosures required by FRS 102.26 Share Based Payments; and,
• certain disclosures required by FRS 102.11 Basic Financial Instruments and FRS 102.12 Other Financial Instrument Issues in respect 
of financial instruments not falling within the fair value accounting rules of Paragraph 36(4) of Schedule 1.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, an entity statement of comprehensive income is not included as part of the 
published consolidated Financial Statements of Hollywood Bowl Group plc. The loss for the financial period dealt within the Financial 
Statements of the Parent Company is £951,000 (2016: loss £2,401,000).
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration paid. Where consideration is paid by the way 
of shares, the excess of fair value of the shares over the nominal value of those shares is recorded in share premium. Investments 
in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment at the end of each reporting date with any impairment charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Employee benefits
Share-based payments
The Company operates an equity-settled share based payment plan for its Directors, under which the Directors are granted equity 
instruments of Hollywood Bowl Group plc. The fair value of the services received in exchange for the equity instrument is recognised 
as an expense. The total amount expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the instruments granted:
• including any market performance conditions; and
• excluding the impact of any service and non-performance vesting conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Notes to the Company Financial Statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 111
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly 
in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position 
differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and
• investments in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are settled or recovered. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities 
and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Company intends to either settle 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period 
in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.

The Group’s standard tax rate for the year ended 30 September 2017 was 19.5 per cent (2016: 20 per cent).
Factors that may affect future current and total tax charges
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20 per cent to 19 per cent (effective from 1 April 2017) was substantially enacted on 
26 October 2015. A further reduction to 17 per cent (effective from 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016. 
This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly and the deferred tax asset at 30 September 2017 has been 
calculated based on these rates.

11. Share-based payments
Long-term employee incentive costs
The Company operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for the Directors. In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments, the 
value of the awards is measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value is written off on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on management’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. 
A summary of the movement in the LTIP is outlined below:

LTIP 2017 Equity – 268,370 – – 268,370 –
In accordance with the LTIP scheme outlined in the Group’s remuneration policy, the vesting of these awards is conditional upon the 
achievement of a Group EPS target set at the time of grant, measured at the end of a three year period ending 30 September 2019 and 
the Executive Directors’ continued employment at the date of vesting.
The awards will vest based on the following adjusted EPS targets:
Adjusted EPS in the final year of the performance period (pence) Vesting
12.25 25%
12.25 – 13.75 Vesting determined on 
a straight line basis
13.75 100%
During the year ended 30 September 2017, 268,370 share awards were granted under the LTIP. For this grant, the Company recognised 
a charge of £76,793 and related employer national insurance of £10,597.
The following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the LTIP granted during the year:
Financial year LTIP granted 2017
Share price at date of grant 1.565
Discount rate/dividend yield 3%
12. Guarantee
The Company has given a guarantee over certain subsidiaries under S479A CA 2006 such that the Financial Statements of these 
subsidiaries for the year ended 30 September 2017 will be exempt for audit (note 14 of the Group Financial Statements).
