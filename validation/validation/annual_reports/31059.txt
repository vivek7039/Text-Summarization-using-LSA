WHAT IS TELERADIOLOGY? WHAT WE DO
t eleradiology is the electronic transmission of 
radiological patient images, including plain film x-rays 
(pF), computerised tomography (ct ) scans and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, from one 
location to another, for the purposes of diagnostic 
interpretation and reporting. t hrough teleradiology, 
images can be transmitted from the hospital setting, 
where the images are created, to a radiologist who can 
review and report on the images remotely. In the case of 
Medica, these are c onsultant Radiologists specialising in 
the relevant field, who typically report on the image 
from their own home or from one of Medica’s dedicated 
reporting centres. t eleradiology improves patient care 
by enabling radiologists to provide their services 
remotely, thereby facilitating the rapid availability of 
trained specialists 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
24/7 365
RAPID AVAILABILITY OF  
TRAINED SPECIALISTS
Medica provides outsourced interpretation and 
reporting on MRI, CT and plain film images. The

HOW WE DO IT
Medica has a bespoke IT platform 
that provides market-leading 
linkage between a hospital’s 
Radiology Information System (RIS) 
and Consultant Radiologists who 
contract with Medica. 
t his link to the hospital RIs is a key 
advantage Medica has over 
competitors in the teleradiology 
market. t his unique linkage offers 
Medica’s contracted radiologists 
equivalence to n Hs in-house 
reporting by providing the same 
radiology history and previous 
images that an in-house radiologist 
would have access to.
What this means 
direct access to the hospital’s RIs 
system and thus to a patients’ 
historical clinical records allows 
Medica radiologists to give the most 
complete and accurate reports 
adhering to the highest standards, 
in the same way that the hospital-
based radiologist does.
Among other benefits, Medica offers 
hospital radiology departments the 
ability to manage their workflow 
more efficiently and flexibly, and 
provides rapid access to specialist 
c onsultant Radiologists, who may
not be available to that hospital at 
the relevant time, or at all.

In 2017, Medica continued to grow 
strongly and achieved another 
impressive set of results. t he Group 
saw growth across its main 
teleradiology offerings with revenue 
increasing by 18% on last year. t his 
growth has been underpinned by 
strong recruitment in the period 
which saw a net increase of 58 
radiologists on the prior year.
In March 2017, Medica successfully 
listed on the Main Market of the 
l ondon stock exchange, raising 
gross proceeds of £15m for the 
c ompany, which were used to pay 
down the net debt of the Group to 
approximately £10m. By the end of 
the year cash generation had further 
reduced the net debt to £5m and 
Medica’s strengthened financial 
position provides us with a strong 
platform to support growth and 
future development of the Group. 
Medica is well placed to pursue 
further organic and other growth 
opportunities to generate long-term 
value for shareholders.
t he teleradiology market continued 
to develop and demand from clients 
grew strongly as n Hs t rusts 
continued to face capacity pressure 
and seek efficient solutions of high 
clinical quality.
Medica’s strategy remains to 
provide the highest quality clinical 
services and to promote 
improvements in clinical quality 
across the u K. Medica’s goal is to 
work in partnership with n Hs t rusts 
and independent providers to 
reduce waiting times and improve 
patient outcomes. t hrough this 
approach, Medica can continue to 
lead the growth of teleradiology in 
the u K.
Medica’s key focus is to support 
n Hs t rusts at a time when they are 
dealing with increased demands for 
reporting against a backdrop of 
limited in-house capacity. t hrough 
investments in clinical process and 
technology Medica is able to 
provide a high quality clinical 
service to its clients’ patients in a 
timely and cost-effective manner. 
Increasingly Medica is able to 
partner with clients to bridge 
geographical and specialist gaps 
across the u K.
Recruitment of radiologists has 
been strong in 2017 and is expected 
to continue to be so as Medica 
focuses on improving the radiologist 
reporting experience with Medica 
through strong technical support 
and robust clinical governance. 
despite the relatively low 
proportion of reporting currently 
outsourced, the c ompany’s 
investment to increase the 
productivity of its radiologists is 
important in increasing the overall 
reporting capacity in the u K.
Medica’s employees have performed 
exceptionally well again in 2017 
supporting clients and radiologists 
and always focused on trying to 
ensure the best patient care. I have 
been impressed with the level of 
professionalism and dedication 
since joining Medica and express my 
gratitude on behalf of the Board to 
all of our staff for their contributions 
during the year.
t he Board has adopted a 
progressive dividend policy for the 
c ompany from Admission, which 
seeks to maximise shareholder value 
and reflect Medica’s strong earnings 
and cash flow characteristics, while 
allowing it to retain sufficient capital 
to fund ongoing operating 
requirements and to invest in the 
Group’s long-term growth. 
Following the interim dividend of 
0.55 pence for the period to 30 
June 2017, the Board proposes a 
final dividend of 1.10 pence for the 
year ended 31 december 2017.
t he Group has performed well in 
2017 and I believe we are well 
positioned to continue to create 
value for all shareholders by 
delivering high levels of service to 
our clients and helping to improve 
patient outcomes.

FAVOURABLE MACRO 
MARKET DYNAMICS 
t he number of scans is increasing, underpinned by 
the drive for early diagnosis and preventative 
healthcare. t he shortage of radiologist capacity in 
hospitals is supporting the trend towards 
outsourcing, as is the increasing cultural acceptance 
of teleradiology. 
CASH GENERATION 
t he Group continues to deliver strong cash 
generation with operating cash flow before tax and 
exceptional costs at £8.7m (2016: £7.7m) due to an 
increase in eBItd A and efficient use of working 
capital, offset by expansionary capex incurred in 
order to deploy additional radiologists and new 
customers. All of this resulted in eBItd A cash flow 
conversion of 82% (2016: 84%).
STRONG 
FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE
Medica has enjoyed strong growth in recent 
years, and this continued throughout 2016, 
with Group revenues growing by 18.2% 
to £33.7m (2016: £28.5m) and eBItd A 
growing by 15% to £10.6m (2016: £9.2m).
HIGH LEVELS OF 
REPEAT REVENUES 
o ver 80% of revenue in the financial year ended 
31 december 2017 was derived from customers 
who had worked with Medica for more than 
three years, with strong revenue growth even 
from customers who have worked with Medica 
for over five years.

An increase in volume and complexity of diagnostic 
imaging examinations, a shortfall in the supply of 
specialist radiologists and a requirement to update 
working practices to support a 7 day NHS combine to 
drive growth in teleradiology.

 early diagnosis 
Resulting in improved patient outcomes and reduction 
in overall cost. 
 Industry expectations 
For increased diagnostic response and reduced 
turnaround time, particularly for stroke and cancer care, 
becoming more demanding.
Demand has been  
highlighted with the news  
that Clinical Radiology is now  
on the national shortage  
occupation list.
The need for examinations continues to grow
t he overall market by number of examinations is growing, 
with cross-sectional ct and MRI scans growing 
significantly faster than plain film examinations. t he Royal 
c ollege of Radiologists has forecast significant growth in 
demand for examinations. In england from 2013-2016 the 
number of ct and MRI scans respectively rose by more 
than 30% – three times more than the rate of 
workforce growth.
Structural shortage of radiologists 
Hospitals have struggled to add sufficient specialist 
radiologist capacity, particularly in certain areas within 
the u K. t he national shortage of radiologist capacity in 
the market to meet rising demand, exacerbated at a 
local level due to geographical nuances has resulted in 
the increased need to use existing radiologist capacity 
within the market more efficiently – Medica Group offer 
this solution.
While new c onsultant Radiologists are being trained, 
the net increase (after retirement of existing 
radiologists) is not sufficient to meet the demand. 
According to the Rc R* the u K has the third lowest 
number of radiologist per population in the eu , with 7.5 
radiologists per 100,000 patients – the eu average is 
12.7 per 100,000. In addition, increased regional 
shortages can be an issue, as can access to c onsultant 
Radiologists who are experts in specialist areas.

even with our support the Royal c ollege of Radiologists 
stated 230,000 patients are currently waiting over a 
month for their radiology reports. Key findings from the 
Rc R c linical Radiology u K Workforce c ensus 2016 
report show that 8.5% of n Hs radiologist posts were 
vacant in 2016, of which 61% were unfilled for more than 
a year. t he resulting shortage means that in 2016, 97% 
of n Hs radiology departments were unable to meet 
their reporting requirements. Medica Group are well 
placed to support the n Hs to meet this capacity gap. 
Demand for radiographer reporting
Radiologists are increasingly required to change their job 
plans away from plain film, towards c ross-s ectional and 
Interventional work to meet local needs. Retiring 
radiologists also often undertake a higher than average 
percentage of plain Film reporting. t hese factors 
combine to result in a decrease of radiologist plain film 
reporting capacity. Radiographer Reporting is widely 
adopted within the n Hs and Medica Group are working 
with Radiographers to offer high quality capacity and 
expertise. In 2017 the percentage of our plain Film 
reporting undertaken by radiographers rose to 14%.
Demand for specialist services
t he range of diagnostic imaging examinations being 
performed increases each year as technology improves. 
Working alongside our clients Medica are developing a 
range of s pecialist Reporting s ervices. t hese allow us 
to provide additional capacity to supplement local 
resources, or to provide reporting capability which is 
not available from local staff. s ervices such as ct

Routine: Routine teleradiology reporting of cross-sectional and plain film images – 48 hour turnaround time.
NightHawk: o ut-of-hours emergency ct and MR reporting – less than 60 minutes.
t imely and accurate reporting of images is the most critical aspect of emergency teleradiology. t o achieve 
this, Medica has invested heavily in its technical platform and this has enabled the achievement of an 
average turnaround time of 24 minutes, which compares favourably with a typical contracted service level 
turnaround time of 60 minutes; the Group’s average turnaround time for n ightHawk reports is believed by 
the directors to be considerably shorter than the industry average.
DayHawk: Fast day-time reporting (<60 minutes).
Radiographer reporting: Quality assured radiographer plain film reporting service 14% of plain Film 
Reporting completed by Radiographers in 2017.
Radiographer Reporting, utilising highly skilled and qualified radiographers, in addition to Medica 
Radiologists, to conduct pF reporting.
Medica’s deployment of Advanced practitioner Radiographers for pF reporting is focused on areas where 
radiographers are already widely utilised for this purpose in the n Hs . u nderpinned by the Group’s reputation for 
clinical excellence, the service has now been introduced to a number of clients. t he introduction of Radiographer 
plain Film Reporting allows more Medica Radiologist capacity to be focused on cross-sectional reporting.

HOW WE CREATE VALUE OUTCOMES
What sets us apart: 
strong clinical governance
o ur scale and breadth of speciality interests
o ur link to the hospital RIs system allows Medica’s 
Radiologists not only to view the scan in question,  
but also to see a patient’s radiology history, including 
previous scans
We contract with the largest pool of c onsultant 
Radiologists outside of the n Hs , all of whom have a 
minimum of two years’ experience
o ur average turnaround time is believed to be 
considerably shorter than the average (including 
in-house radiology departments)
For Our clients:  
t imely turnaround, including out-of-hours, 
assisting hospitals to manage workloads across a 
wide range of subspecialist expertise, and helping 
patient outcomes via the rapid availability of 
trained specialists 24 hours per day, 365 days per 
year.
For Our radiologists:  
Attractive and flexible terms, with ability to work 
from home and to focus on speciality interests.
Our Clinical governance  
As the provider of a highly skilled clinical service, 
Medica places clinical governance and quality 
assurance and improvement at the heart of its 
service offering. t he Group has an established 
Medical Advisory Board (MAB) and a separate 
c linical Advisory Group (c AG). t he clinical 
governance processes and outputs are overseen 
by the c linical Governance c ommittee.
A role of clinical governance is to review 
radiologist performance and in doing so, strive for 
continuous improvement in the standard of 
reporting of Medica Radiologists. An example of 
this is the regular sharing of case reviews among 
the entire radiologist reporting group, detailing 
complex cases and acting as learning and 
development tool for Medica Radiologists. t here 
are also a number of clinical speciality leads 
within the Group, who specialise in a particular 
field of radiology, and who help the Group 
maintain best-in-class service.

MEDICAL DIRECTOR
c linical quality is a cornerstone of the clinical governance in Medica. peer review and 
client feedback provides data that guides the continuous learning approach that 
Medica encourages its radiologists to adopt. t his is in line with the Royal c ollege of 
Radiologists guidance on ‘l earning from discrepancies’.
Medica works in partnership with its clients in the investigation and reporting of 
clinical incidents. Where there are individual or organisational learning points, 
Medica’s learning culture and processes provides a path for quality improvement.
c linical collaboration and development is evident in our n ightHawk service and in the 
development of special service lines. n ightHawk services are embracing national 
initiatives in the areas of acute stroke and major trauma management. Key service 
developments underway are in the special service lines for cardiac and prostate 
imaging. We expect to see further developments in the next 12 months in the special 
service lines.
Working in partnership with our client healthcare providers to deliver an effective 
clinical service has been a key focus in 2017 and will continue. the clinical leadership 
has taken a ‘hands-on’ approach visiting clients and understanding at first hand the 
key success factors for each client. t he quality assurance processes provide 
opportunities for Medica to provide support and advice in areas such as  
image quality and protocols.
Medica has invested in growing the c linical Advisory structure in 2017 with further 
development plans in 2018. this is to support the growth and diversification of our 
clinical service and meet the expected clinical quality standards of our clients.
STATEMENT FROM THE  
MEDICAL DIRECTOR DR STEPHEN DAVIES 14
Medica Group Plc
Annu Al RepoR t And Accounts 2017 14
Medica Group Plc
Annu Al RepoR t And Accounts 2017
What is your role within Medica and tell us a little 
more about what you do?
I have several different roles at Medica. I have been a 
reporter for three years, mostly reporting neurology and 
chest scans, but I am also an auditor and arbitrator, 
providing feedback to other radiologists on their 
discrepancies. until recently, I was also clinical lead for 
chest radiology, providing educational reviews to share 
interesting cases and learning points with other Medica 
radiologists and providing a second opinion on difficult/
complex cases. I was also involved in assessing potential 
new areas for development in Medica including the use of 
artificial intelligence (AI) to measure and monitor lung 
nodules and to assess severity of disease in patients with 
emphysema.
I am a trained appraiser and carry out regular appraisals 
on Medica radiologists for whom Medica is their designated 
body. I am also involved in writing annual reports for 
Medica radiologists to present at their n Hs appraisals.
I sit on the clinical governance committee which meets 
fortnightly to review all serious discrepancies, root cause 
analyses and any concerns about performance of 
radiologists or radiographers.
I was appointed as clinical audit lead on 1st January 2018.
It’s true to say now that NHS radiologists balance a 
variety of responsibilities – working in the NHS, 
out-of-hours, in private practice, for teleradiology 
providers and teaching and research. You’ve also 
chosen to adopt the modern concept of a ‘portfolio 
career’ why was this attractive to you?
I enjoy the variety of my job. I can report from the 
convenience of my own home without constant interruptions 
which means I can really focus on what I am doing and 
provide timely and accurate reports. My reporting lists are 
tailored to my areas of expertise and by reporting for a 
number of specialist neurological centres, I feel I have been 
able to develop my expertise. t here is no pressure to hurry 
the reports and I have the time to look up interesting cases 
as I go along which is great for learning. It can be quite 
isolating working as a teleradiologist, but Medica has a 
panel of clinical leads who are available to discuss interesting 
or difficult cases, which is a great support. I get to meet 
other radiologists in my role as appraiser and I work as part 
of a team with regular video-conferencing for the 
governance committee. My hours for Medica are flexible 
which means that I have been able to take up a post at 
Brighton and sussex Medical school teaching the year two 
students which I thoroughly enjoy.
How important is it to strike work/life balance as a 
consultant radiologist and how has teleradiology 
helped you achieve that?
Having commuted to work for 15 years in the nHs, I now 
report from home which means that I don’t waste 2–3 
hours per day travelling. t he hours that I decide to work 
are flexible and I frequently have afternoons free, having 
reported in the morning. this flexibility has been 
particularly important to me owing to serious illness in a 
close family member.
With the majority of your doctors being remote 
how do you manage performance and quality and 
how do you quality assure your service?
the performance of all Medica radiologists is reviewed 
annually by a member of the clinical governance 
committee. this involves ensuring that continuing 
professional development (cpd ) is up to date and relevant 
to the doctor’s scope of practice, a review of their job plan 
to ensure that the doctor is not working excessive hours, 
and a review of discrepancies with the learning points 
which have arisen through reflection.
Medica also provide monthly educational reviews for 
radiologists which are based around interesting and 
informative cases which have been reviewed at the clinical 
governance committee. Medica radiologists are also asked 
to submit interesting cases to an educational folder for 
inclusion in these reviews.

Does Medica’s approach to Clinical Governance and 
Quality Assurance differ from the NHS and how?
All Medica radiologists undertake an entry audit in which 
all of their initial reports are audited for discrepancies. 
provided this is satisfactory they are then subjected to an 
ongoing background audit of a set percentage of their 
reporting. 
Medica radiologists receive a monthly report which details 
their level of discrepancy and compares this with the 
Medica average. All radiologists also receive an annual 
written report concerning their volume of reporting and 
discrepancy details for them to present at their nHs 
appraisal.
In the nHs it is unusual to have regular audit of a 
radiologist’s work and most discrepancies are raised on an 
informal, ad hoc basis, often through discrepancy review 
meetings. Most nHs radiologists are not aware of their 
individual discrepancy rates. 
Even the best doctors make some mistakes, how do 
you reduce this risk and manage errors when they 
do occur?
Mistakes are an inevitable part of clinical practice. By 
tailoring reporting lists to a particular radiologist’s 
experience, Medica is able to reduce the risk of radiologists 
reporting beyond their expertise. However, when mistakes 
are made, it is important to learn from them. errors can be 
raised by individual trusts or through the Medica audit 
process. Medica radiologists are asked to reflect in writing 
upon their errors and to identify specific areas where they 
could improve their practice. At the end of the year, Medica 
radiologists are asked to review all of their discrepancies, 
looking for patterns or trends which might be amenable to 
improvement. this might, for example, involve using a 
checklist to ensure that reports are comprehensive or may 
identify areas of the literature to review.
Tell us about the support network for doctors who 
work for Medica?
Working as a teleradiologist can be quite isolating but 
Medica provides a number of levels of support for 
radiologists. o n a daily basis, there is access to technical 
support by telephone 24 hours a day. t he support team 
are courteous and efficient and are able to escalate 
technical issues that they themselves are unable to deal 
with. t here is also a system whereby radiologists can seek 
a second opinion from specialist radiologists for difficult or 
unusual cases. In terms of clinical governance, all 
radiologists are provided with a monthly summary of their 
discrepancy rates but there is also a bespoke appraisal 
system for those radiologists that work outside the nHs 
for whom Medica is their designated body. Appraisals are 
conducted annually by trained appraisers and are signed 
off by dr stephen davies as Responsible o fficer.
The demand for teleradiology is growing and we 
have touched upon how this set-up benefits the 
NHS and doctors, tell us how the teleradiology  
set-up impacts patient care?
Radiology is becoming increasingly sub-specialised and 
individual trusts may have difficulty providing an expert 
opinion, particularly at short notice. teleradiology 
companies have access to a broad cross-section of 
expertise amongst their reporting radiologists and are in 
an excellent position to provide timely, expert advice. 
u rgent cases can be turned around in less than 24 minutes, 
which is clearly of benefit to patients.
Urgent cases can be turned around 
in less than 24 minutes, which is 
clearly of benefit to patients. 16

ANOTHER YEAR OF 
STRONG GROWTH
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
I am proud to present my  
Chief Executive’s review for 
Medica Group Plc’s first year 
as a public company.
Jo Hn GRAHAM
CHIEF EXECUTIVE 17
Medica Group Plc
Annu Al RepoR t And Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements o verview
Introduction
I am delighted to present my c hief 
executive’s Review statement for 
Medica’s first year as a public 
company. 2017 has been a milestone 
year in the development of the 
Group with the successful listing on 
the Main Market of the l ondon 
stock exchange an important step 
in Medica’s development.
t he business has continued to 
develop throughout the year, 
improving services to clients, 
growing volumes and engaging with 
increasing numbers of radiologists 
whilst at the same time adapting to 
life as a public company.
I would like to thank the whole 
Medica team for their hard work  
and dedication this year and we are 
well positioned to take advantage of 
the many growth opportunities we 
see before us. o ur clinical, technical 
and operational excellence 
combined with financial strength 
and our new profile as a public 
company give Medica a great 
platform to develop its services in 
teleradiology and beyond.
Delivered robust volume growth
t his has been another strong year of 
double-digit growth for Medica with 
revenue increasing by 18.2% from 
last year. t he Group has successfully 
grown organically year-on-year 
through the continued successful 
deployment of new clients and by 
increasing the revenue generated 
from existing customers, which has 
been the main driver of revenue 
growth in the year.
s ignificantly volume growth was 
driven by both n ightHawk and 
Routine c ross-s ectional (cs ), 
computerised tomography (ct ) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
reporting which saw scan volumes 
increase by 31.1% and 23.8% 
respectively. Routine plain Film 
x-ray (pF) decreased by 5.9%.
t his growth in volume is being 
driven by several factors. t he overall 
market dynamics remain a key 
driver with the number of ct and 
MRI scans performed across the u K 
increasing year-on-year and 
continued shortages of radiologists 
to provide increasingly complex 
diagnostic reports. Medica, as the 
market leader in teleradiology, are 
leading the way to support the n Hs 
through the use of technology to 
bridge geographical and specialist 
gaps in resource and using its 
technical and clinical infrastructure 
to increase reporting productivity.
t he high quality of Medica’s clinical 
governance process has given 
clients more confidence in 
outsourcing. Increasingly n Hs 
t rusts are planning their activities 
around a deeper partnership with 
Medica and our services are more 
embedded within departments than 
ever before. Although the overall 
proportion of scans outsourced 
remains modest the proportion is 
growing as the market develops. 
Medica continues to attract new 
clients but the primary reason for 
growth is through additional 
reporting for existing customers.
Gross profit margin edged down 
from 49.8% to 48.7% as anticipated, 
reflecting the ongoing renewal of 
the Group’s contracts at marginally 
lower prices as the teleradiology 
market develops and outsourcing 
becomes normal practice. Increases 
in sales volume for our n Hs services 
more than offset the reduction in 
average price in 2017 from 
anticipated pricing pressures.
Recruitment
Recruitment remained a key focus 
during 2017 and we significantly 
increased the number of radiologists 
from 248 at the start of the year to 
306 at 31st december to meet 
growing market demand. Investment 
in recruitment, retention and training 
are priorities for the business as we 
seek to ensure radiologists are 
supported at all times, that the 
reporting experience is as smooth 
and efficient as possible and that 
radiologists can work in a high 
quality clinical environment.
Word of mouth recommendations 
from existing Medica radiologists 
who contract with the Group has 
become the most significant factor 
in bringing new radiologists into the 
recruitment process to be converted 
by our skilled recruitment team. In 
addition, the Group maintains a 
presence at many specialist and 
national events and maintains a 
database of candidates for 
recruitment. Medica’s recruitment 
pipeline remains stronger than ever.
Continued investment 
and development
during 2017 we have continued to 
invest in our clinical governance, 
technical and operational 
infrastructure and processes and we 
continue to raise the bar for the 
quality of teleradiology services in 
the u K.
t he clinical governance base is 
arguably the strongest element of 
Medica’s offering giving clients the 
confidence to outsource greater 
volumes and more complex work. 
Work in this area has continued 
apace in 2017 with particular 
emphasis on improving the quality 
of clinical internal audit and 
managing clinical issues. 18
Medica Group Plc
Annu Al RepoR t And Accounts 2017
As volumes grow it is important to 
continue to improve the operational 
processes so as to be able to deal 
with increasing volume whilst 
minimising cost increases. 
c onsiderable effort has gone into 
refining workflow management 
processes and as the proportion of 
more specialist exams increases, the 
balancing of capacity and demand 
in a timely manner is more 
important than ever.
t here has been considerable 
investment in Medica’s technical 
platform in recent years which 
continued in 2017. As the volume of 
scans and the number of clients and 
radiologists continued to grow the 
scalable platform has expanded but 
it has been important that Medica 
has continued to innovate and 
improve its systems and that 
information security has remained 
at the heart of all we do.
Strategy
t he directors have to date focused 
on building a platform that can 
deliver a high quality teleradiology 
service to the Group’s core 
customer base of n Hs hospitals, 
centred on its n ightHawk and 
Routine offerings.
t he Group’s strategy can be broadly 
categorised into three areas: 
developing the core business; 
accelerating the expansion into 
areas closely related to the core 
business; and broader 
diversification.
Developing the core business 
t he Group’s core strategy remains 
to develop and grow its business by 
adding additional Medica reporting 
capacity to meet growing demand, 
maintaining the highest clinical 
standards and continuing to win 
new work for its existing 
service lines.
Having invested in the Group’s It 
and services platform, both in terms 
of the technical and clinical aspects 
and the ongoing recruitment of 
Medica radiologists, the directors 
believe that the business can 
continue to grow strongly within its 
existing service lines. continual 
development of the current core 
services, improving the offering to 
clients and the radiologist 
experience as well as improving the 
efficiency of Medica’s internal 
infrastructure are a key part of 
Medica’s strategy.
Medica will continue to improve the 
workflow for clients and radiologists 
and a good example is the 
forthcoming launch of a new 
n ightHawk portal and process. t his 
will bring considerable advances for 
both clients and our radiologists 
and enable improved efficiency and 
performance in the specialist 
emergency services Medica can 
offer.
Increasing specialisation of 
radiologists and demand from 
clients will evolve the Routine cs 
service line and using Medica’s 
substantial and growing pool of 
specialist radiologists, Medica can 
offer national cover to the n Hs for 
specialist reporting services.
Radiographer reporting is a key 
growth area for the core business. 
l aunched in August 2016 this 
service has been grown in a steady 
and controlled way and advanced 
practitioner radiographers represent 
an increasing part of Medica’s 
routine pF capacity, representing 
14% of the total pF exams in 2017. 
u nderpinned by strong clinical 
governance growing this service can 
play an important role in the n Hs 
managing their waiting times and 
minimising backlogs.
t here are also further opportunities 
in the independent sector and 
internationally that can expand 
Medica’s core business.
Accelerating expansion into 
related areas
Medica has developed specialist 
reporting lines including virtual 
colonoscopy and dual energy x-ray 
absorptiometry (dXA) o steoporosis 
scanning. t he service lines have 
been developed with specialists but 
currently form a small part of 
Medica’s business and the next 
stage is to increase the number of 
clients using these services.
Most recently we have developed a 
c ardiac reporting service, which has 
launched in the first quarter of 2018 
and there are other specialist 
services currently under 
development. After an initial piloting 
stage these services can be 
expanded to new and existing 
clients.
t he Group has a strong clinical 
governance structure, including an 
internal clinical audit function 
focused on maintaining the high 
clinical and service standards of 
Medica radiologists. Having been 
approached by our customers and 
others to audit their own in-house 
radiology departments, there is a 
clear opportunity to market this 
service to existing and new clients. 
Medica has developed bespoke 
software in 2017 to facilitate this 
service with a view to growing 
demand in 2018.
Broader Opportunities
t he directors believe that there are 
a number of wider tele-health and 
broader healthcare opportunities 
that the Group would be well-placed 
to take advantage of.

t hese are considered longer-term 
opportunities and would likely 
require investment in additional 
expertise to augment that already in 
place and, in some circumstances, 
may be better achieved through 
acquisition. t he Board intends to 
develop plans for some of these 
opportunities in coming periods.
Outlook
l ooking forward to 2018, the year 
has started well, with trading in line 
with the Board’s expectations. t he 
prospects for new work from 
existing and new clients and the 
pipeline for recruiting radiologists in 
the new financial year continues to 
be strong which gives me 
confidence in our outlook for 2018.
As the market evolves the Board is 
confident that, in the short to 
medium term, Medica will continue 
to grow revenues at a double-digit 
rate similar to that seen in 2017.

A review of the business during the 
year, its strategy and business 
model, future developments, and its 
position at the year-end is included 
within the c hairman and c hief 
executive’s Reviews on pages 4-5 
and 16-19. Both these reports form 
an integral part of the 
strategic Report.
Trading results
Medica has enjoyed strong growth 
in recent years, and this continued 
throughout 2017, with Group 
revenues growing by 18.2% to 
£33.7m (2016: £28.5m) and adjusted 
operating profit growing by 16.4% to 
£9.5m (2016: £8.1m).
n et profit increased by 30.6% from 
£3.32m to £4.33m and adjusted basic 
earnings per share increased by 
20.2% from 3.32 pence to 3.99 pence. 
Adjusted profit after tax increased  
by 51% from £4.98m to £7.52m and 
adjusted basic earnings per share 
increased by 39.0% from 4.98 pence 
to 6.92 pence. A full reconciliation 
between statutory and adjusted 
profit metrics is shown in n ote 31.
Revenue
Revenue growth has been driven by 
an increase in the number of 
n ightHawk and Routine cs scans 
which Medica has reported upon.
• n ightHawk revenues increased to 
£16.8m, a 24.1% increase from 
2016 revenue of £13.5m. the 
increase in volumes and revenue 
was due to continued growth in 
existing clients’ emergency 
service requirements as the 
number of A&e admissions and 
the proportion of patients 
requiring a scan both increase 
and t rusts expand the scope of 
the services they procure, as well 
as new client wins. 
• Routine c ross-sectional revenues 
increased to £12.5m, a 19.4% 
increase from 2016 revenue of 
£10.5m. similarly to n ightHawk, 
growth has been driven primarily 
through existing customers as their 
scan volumes increased and Medica 
enhanced its partnership with 
t rusts reporting a greater quantity 
and proportion of their work, as 
well as new customer wins. 
• plain Film revenues decreased to 
£3.7m, a 5.4% decrease from 2016 
revenue of £3.9m. d uring the 
period, plain Film volumes were 
actively managed so as to focus 
on the faster growing Routine 
c ross-s ectional service. 
Radiographer reporting, from 
launching in August 2016, started in 
a controlled way but increased 
during the year.
o ur continued ability to recruit and 
retain radiologists is a key driver of 
revenue growth. Medica added an 
additional net 58 reporters in 2017 
and at 31 december 2017 there were 
a total of 306 with whom Medica 
contracted, which is a record high 
for the c ompany.
Gross margins
Gross profit margin for the year was 
48.7% (2016: 49.8%).
Gross profit margin edged down in 
the year as expected. t here are a 
number of contributing factors with 
the main reason being ongoing 
renewal of contracts often through 
migration to framework agreements. 
t here has been downward pressure 
on prices for some time as volumes 
increase and this is expected to 
continue. t he reduction in average 
price has been more than 
compensated by increases in volume.
t he c ompany looks to achieve a 
similar gross margin across each of 
its service lines. In 2017, the gross 
margins for each service line were 
as follows:
• nightHawk: 50.5%
• Routine c ross-s ectional: 52.1%
• Routine plain Film: 49.4%
t he only costs included within cost 
of sales relate to the costs of paying 
Medica’s radiologists and internal 
clinical audit costs. Internal clinical 
audit costs which can be significant 
are not included within the 
individual service line gross profit 
figures above.
Adjusted operating profit
Adjusted operating profit for the 
year grew to £9.5m, a 16.4% 
increase from 2016 levels of £8.1m. 
t he successful listing in March 2017 
led to customary additional costs 
which represented 7% of total 
overheads in the year. o verheads 
remained controlled in the period, 
increasing only 10% on a like for like 
basis on the prior year compared to 
an increase in revenues of 18% with 
adjusted operating profit growth 
constrained by margin contraction.
t he adjusted operating profit for the 
period of £9.5m was 16.4% higher 
than 2016 (£8.1m), which represents 
continuing good progress for the 
business. despite the additional 
costs of being a public company the 
adjusted operating profit margin 
only reduced moderately from 
28.5% in 2016 to 28.1% in 2017.
Exceptional costs 
t he total costs of listing on the 
l ondon stock exchange were 
£2.6m, of which £0.8m were 
recognised in 2016 and £1.8m in 
2017. of these costs £0.2m was 
deducted from the share premium 
account and £2.4m over the two 
years has been presented as 
exceptional items on the income 
statement. t hese costs have been 
added back in to calculate adjusted 
operating profit and adjusted 
earnings per share.
In addition, part of the proceeds 
were used to repay bank debt, and 
previously capitalised fees of £0.6m 
have been presented as exceptional 
financing costs and have also been 
added back in to calculate adjusted 
profit before tax and adjusted 
earnings per share.
 
Net finance expense
Finance costs were £0.7m for the 
year (2016: £2.2m). t he Group 
refinanced its existing debt facility 
at listing post the year end, with the 
net proceeds of the Ipo used to pay 
net debt down to approximately 
£10m, reducing its bank debt and 
repaying loan notes from c Bpe 
c apital llp , the majority owners of 
Medica prior to the Ipo, in full.
Taxation
t he Group has incurred a tax charge 
of £1.3m in the year ended 31 
december 2017, compared with 
£1.0m in the year ended 
31 december 2016.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share 
increased by 39.0% to 6.92 pence, 
reflecting the growth in the business 
and the altered capital structure post 
listing. n ormal earnings per share 
increased by 20.2% to 3.99 pence. 22
Medica Group Plc
Annu Al RepoR t And Accounts 2017
Dividends
t he Board has adopted a progressive 
dividend policy, following the interim 
dividend of 0.55 pence the Board 
proposes a maiden final dividend of 
1.10 pence per share to give a total 
dividend for the year ended 31 
december 2017 of 1.65p per share. 
t his will, subject to approval by 
shareholders at the annual general 
meeting on 23 May 2018, be paid on 
22 June to shareholders listed on the 
register on 1 June.
Cash flow
t he Group continues to deliver 
strong cash generation with 
operating cash flow before tax and 
exceptional Ipo costs of £8.7m 
(2016: £7.7m).
eBItd A cash flow conversion was 
82% (2016: 84%). c ash flow from 
operating activities was £5.5m (2016: 
£6.8m), the reduction being due to 
exceptional costs. t here was a 
moderate increase in trade debtors 
caused by small delays in clients 
settling their invoices. t his was limited 
in number and delays due to changes 
in their administrative processes. t he 
business continues to generate strong 
cash flows from its core business. 
c apex for the year was £1.8m (2016: 
£1.2m) as the business continued to 
invest in its infrastructure to support 
volume growth and to improve its 
efficiency and service offering.
Net debt
t he c ompany used the net 
proceeds of the Ipo to fund the 
repayment of the £6.9m of 
outstanding loan notes held by 
c Bpe as well as contributing to the 
repayment of £8.6m of the Group’s 
outstanding indebtedness under the 
Group’s existing term loan and 
revolving credit facilities, which the 
directors believe will result in an 
appropriate level of gearing going 
forward, given the size of the Group 
and the c ompany’s status as a listed 
company. Following this repayment, 
the c ompany had net debt of 
approximately £10m which reduced 
to £5m as the business generated 
cash during the year.
o n 7 March 2017, the Group entered 
into a new facilities agreement (the 
‘n ew Facilities’) for the purpose of 
refinancing that part of the facilities 
that were not repaid out of the 
proceeds of the o ffer. u nder the 
n ew Facilities, up to £13m in 
aggregate is available to the Group 
under a £12m term loan facility and 
a £1m revolving credit facility. Both 
facilities will mature on 6 March 
2022, being the fifth anniversary of 
entry into the n ew Facilities. Interest 
is payable under the n ew Facilities 
at the rate of l IBo R + 1.75. As at the 
balance sheet date, the revolving 
credit facility was undrawn.
Intangible assets
As at the year-end, total intangible 
assets were £25.2m (31 december 
2016: £25.3m). t he Group’s 
intangible assets are the goodwill of 
£15.9m and other intangible assets 
from the acquisition by the 
c ompany of Medica Reporting 
l imited in May 2013. In addition, 
there is a small proportion, which at 
the year-end was £1.3m (year ended 
31 december 2015: £0.6m), in 
relation to purchased software and 
certain capitalised development 
software and licences. t he main 
addition during the year was the 
renewal of Medica’s pAc s system 
contract for a five-year period.
Property, plant and equipment
As at the year-end, total value of 
property, plant and equipment was 
£1.9m (31 d ecember 2016: £1.8m). 
property, plant and equipment 
primarily relate to computer 
equipment, the majority of which is 
the servers installed with customers, 
radiologists’ workstations and 
infrastructure technology. t he 
growth in property, plant and 
equipment reflects the net increase, 
i.e. after depreciation, of additional 
capital expenditure for new 
customers and new radiologists and 
software for new projects.
Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs)
t he Board receives monthly KpIs on 
the Group. t hese include clinical and 
operational performance 
measurements such as turnaround 
times and clinical audit results as 
well as financial KpIs.
As noted above 2017 was a year of 
record volume and as the business 
grows a key challenge for the Group 
is to maintain turnaround times 
ahead of contractual agreements 
with clients. during 2017 turnaround 
times remained consistent with 
2016’s performance. 
c linical quality is a key part of 
Medica’s performance and we have  
a robust system of internal clinical 
audit where 10% of n ightHawk and 
c ross-s ectional exams and 2% of 
plain Film exams are reviewed. 
during 2017 the Group continued  
to meet its targets for clinical audit 
rates.
t he key financial KpI is adjusted 
eBItd A which was £10.6m for the 
year to 31 december 2017 (£9.2m 
for the year to 31 december 2016).

2017 COMMENTARY
Clinical quality risk
Medica provides radiology reports 
which form an integral and essential 
part of the clinical management 
process for patients. Inaccurate 
reporting could lead to patient harm 
and reputational impairment for the 
c ompany. error is inherent in all

RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATING ACTIVITIES AND 
COUNTERMEASURES
2017 COMMENTARY
Operating risk
t he Group currently derives 
substantially all of its revenue from the 
n Hs through n Hs t rusts and the 
reduction of such revenue could 
adversely impact the Group’s business, 
results of operations and financial 
condition. t he Group’s revenue from 
n Hs t rusts is not subject to any 
minimum purchase commitment and 
any reduction in demand for the 
Group’s services could have a material 
adverse effect on its business, results 
of operations and financial condition. 
t here is a risk of increased pricing 
pressure from the n Hs for 
teleradiology services.

condition and prospects.
t he Group focuses on providing a high 
quality, value for money service and 
maintains close communication with 
clients through its account management 
team.
t he Group continues to

Financial risk management
t he directors have outlined the key 
financial risks facing the business 
and have discussed the processes in 
place to mitigate these risks, in n ote 
25.
Social, community and human 
rights issues
Medica is committed to the 
principles of responsible business; 
this is achieved by acting in an 
ethical manner, developing positive 
relationships with suppliers, and 
recruiting and retaining successful 
and responsible employees.
Whilst Medica does not have a 
specific human rights policy, it does 
have policies covering equal 
o pportunities and Anti-bribery that 
adhere to internationally proclaimed 
human rights principles.
Environment
Medica actively considers its 
environmental impact and we are 
conscious of playing our part in 
tackling climate change. As a 
technology-based Group with most 
staff employed in one office location 
and radiologists contracted mainly 
from their own homes, we believe 
our own environmental footprint is 
small.
t his is the first year the Group has 
measured greenhouse gas emissions 
and has reviewed and applied the 
scope of the Greenhouse Gas 
protocol in accordance with the 
companies Act 2006.
s cope 1: direct emissions that result 
from activities with the Group’s 
control in connection with the 
combustion of fuel.
s cope 2: Indirect emissions from any 
electricity, heat or steam the Group 
purchases and uses.
s cope 3: Any other indirect 
emissions from sources outside the 
Group’s direct control.
t he Group does not purchase or 
combust fuel directly so the s cope 1 
emission for the year is zero. s cope 
2 emissions are limited to the 
Group’s head office building and the 
calculations are derived from 
electricity meter readings. t he 
s cope 2 GHG emissions for 2017 are 
22.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent. t he Group has chosen 
this year not to make the voluntary 
disclosure for s cope 3 emissions. 
o ur greenhouse gas emissions have 
been calculated on a per full time 
equivalent employee ratio. t his 
intensity metric is the best measure 
available to the Group given the 
nature of the business, and the 
absence of a similar business to 
benchmark against. 
t he emissions per employee for 
2017 are 0.25 tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent.
Employees
o ur people are our most valued 
asset, they are vital to Medica’s 
success and growth and we are 
proud of the mixture of talent and 
experience they bring. We strive to 
make Medica a great place to work 
and this enables us to attract and 
retain the best talent and provide 
the best service for both our clients 
and radiologists.
Medica has a firm commitment to 
equality of opportunity in all our 
employment policies, practices and 
procedures. o ur recruitment and 
selection processes are geared to 
selecting the best candidate 
regardless of their age, gender, 
sexuality, full or part-time status, 
disability and marital status. We 
recognise that a diverse workforce 
will provide a wide range of 
perspectives that promotes 
innovation and business success. 
t he Group has a formal equal 
opportunities policy to ensure no 
employee or applicant is 
discriminated against.
At 31 december 2017, the Group had 
88 full time employees and 5 part 
time staff of which 66 were male 
and 27 were female. o f the senior 
members of management, four were 
male and one was female.

Principal activities for the year
during 2017 the primary activities of the committee 
were in relation to the Group’s reporting cycle. 
• It reviewed the financial statements in the 2016 and 
2017 Annual Report and Accounts and the 2017 
Interim Report. As part of this review the c ommittee 
received reports from the external auditors on their 
audit of that Annual Report and their review of the 
interim results. It also reviewed the preliminary and 
Interim Announcements made to the l ondon 
stock exchange.
• Formally reviewed the going concern assumptions 
adopted in the preparation of the 2016 and 2017 
financial statements.
• t he c ommittee discussed the annual external audit 
plan in advance of the period end with the external 
auditors, which addressed the planned audit 
approach to key accounting areas.
• t he c ommittee discussed the auditor’s views on key 
judgement areas and audit findings relating to key 
accounting matters at the conclusion of the audit.
t he c ommittee considered the main audit risk raised by 
Grant t hornton in the audit of the 2017 financial 
statements as revenue recognition and discussed with 
them how this was to be addressed. t he c ommittee 
noted the transactional nature of the business and 
considered the treatment of Ipo related transaction 
costs. t hey also noted that revenue recognition was not 
an area that relied on significant judgement and also 
considered the potential impact of new accounting 
standards effective in 2018. the c ommittee supported 
Grant t hornton’s approach and detailed transactional 
testing.
Non-audit services provided by the external auditor
n on-audit services provided by the c ompany’s auditor 
are kept under review by the c ommittee. t hese will 
generally be compliance services but for the 2017 
financial year the auditors acted as Reporting 
accountants in relation to the Group’s listing. t he 
c ommittee ensures that the auditor’s objectivity and 
independence are safeguarded by means of the use of 
separate teams of staff and by ensuring that the level  
of fees is not material to either the c ompany or the 
auditors.
t he report from Grant t hornton u K llp confirming 
their independence and objectivity was reviewed by the 
c hairman of the Audit c ommittee and the Finance 
director. t he level of fees paid to Grant t hornton u K 
llp for non-audit services is not regarded to conflict 
with auditor independence.
Fees payable to the auditors are set out in n ote 6 on 
page 72.
Effectiveness and independence of external auditor
Grant t hornton u K llp has been the external auditor to 
Medica Group plc since 2013. As part of this year’s 
decision to recommend the reappointment of the 
auditor, the c ommittee has taken into account the 
tenure of the auditor and the need to consider at least 
every ten years whether there should be a full tender 
process.
t here are no contractual obligations that restrict the 
Audit c ommittee’s choice of external auditor.
In accordance with the auditor independence 
requirements of the revised ethical standard effective  
11 June 2016, Grant t hornton u K llp ’s appointment as 
auditor cannot be extended beyond the year ending  
31 december 2027 without an open tender process 
taking place. s ubject to reappointment as part of such 
an open tender process. Grant t hornton u K llp could 
serve as auditor for a further ten years subsequent to 
the audit for the year ending 31 december 2027. 
Grant t hornton u K llp no longer provide corporation 
tax compliance services to the c ompany.
t he c ommittee is also responsible for advising the 
Board on the appointment of the auditor, assessing their 
independence and formulating policy on the award of 
non-audit work. n on-audit work is only awarded to the 
auditors after due consideration of matters of 
objectivity, independence, costs, quality of service and 
efficiency. As a consequence of its satisfaction with the 
results of its review of the activities outlined above, the 
c ommittee has recommended to the Board that the 
external auditors are reappointed by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting.
At the conclusion of each year’s audit, the performance 
of the external auditor is reviewed by the c ommittee 
with the executive directors covering such areas as 
quality of audit team, business understanding, audit 
approach and process management. Where 
appropriate, actions are agreed against the points 
raised and subsequently monitored for progress.
t he c hair of the c ommittee meets with the external 
auditors without management present at least twice a 
year.
Internal audit function
t he c ommittee concluded in 2017 that there was no 
requirement for the Group to have an internal audit 
function due to its size and complexity. t he c ommittee 
will consider the need for an internal audit function on 
an annual basis.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
lette R FRo M t He ReMune RAt Ion co MMIttee c HAIRMAn
Dear Shareholder
As c hairman of the Remuneration c ommittee (the 
‘c ommittee’), I am pleased to present Medica Group’s 
first Remuneration c ommittee report (‘Report’) as a 
listed company, for the financial year ended 31 
december 2017. In line with the reporting Regulations, 
this Report is split into the following three sections:
t his Annual statement and high level summary (‘o ur 
Remuneration policy at a glance’).
t he directors’ Remuneration policy, which will be put to 
a binding shareholder vote at the Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) to be held on 23 May 2018.
o ur Annual Report on Remuneration, detailing director 
remuneration for the financial year ending on 31 
december 2017, and the proposed implementation of 
our Remuneration policy for 2018, which is subject to an 
advisory shareholder vote at our AGM.
Committee members and independence
I chair the c ommittee, and my fellow c ommittee members 
are Roy davis and steve Whittern. t he members of the 
c ommittee and any person attending its meetings do not 
participate in any decision on their own remuneration. In 
accordance with the u K c orporate Governance c ode, at 
least two members of the c ommittee are independent 
n on-executive directors. t he c ommittee will meet up to 
three times per year in the ordinary course and otherwise 
as circumstances require.
Key areas of responsibility
t he c ommittee’s key areas of responsibility include to:
• develop and recommend Medica’s policy on 
executive remuneration.
• determine the levels of remuneration for executive 
directors and the c ompany s ecretary.
• prepare an annual remuneration report for approval 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
• ensure compliance with the u K Governance c ode in 
relation to remuneration wherever possible.
detailed responsibilities are set out in the c ommittee’s 
terms of reference which can be found on the investor 
section of the Medica website.
Activities of the Committee during the period
t he c ommittee met formally once during the period 
from l isting to 31 december 2017, and also spent a 
significant amount of time during the period (including 
before l isting) in finalising executive remuneration 
arrangements to ensure these were appropriate for 
Medica and reflect best practice.
Our approach to developing Medica’s 
Remuneration Policy
o ur aim is for remuneration at Medica to reflect its 
culture and support the delivery of its business strategy. 
t he aim of the remuneration strategy is to attract, retain 
and motivate the best talent to help ensure continued 
growth and success as Medica enters its next stage of 
its development, operating in a listed company 
environment. Remuneration levels for the executive 
directors and senior management have been set at the 
lower quartile levels that are considered by the 
c ommittee to be adequate for the size and nature of the 
business. As the business matures, the committee 
anticipates that it will consider increasing pay levels 
commensurate with the size and complexity of the 
business. performance related pay will form a significant 
part of the remuneration package of the executive 
directors and senior managers and will be based on 
performance targets, as relevant. t he c ommittee have 
taken specialist, independent advice,  
in order to ensure that the policies and remuneration 
structure are appropriate for the listed company 
environment and reflects current best practice. 
o ur Remuneration policy (the ‘policy’) is intended to 
operate for a three-year period from the 2018 AGM. the 
c ommittee believes that its approach to remuneration 
will support the delivery of Medica’s aims during its initial 
years as a public company, and will continue to evolve in 
the future as Medica establishes itself as a listed 
company. t he key features of our policy are summarised 
on pages 36 to 38 (‘o ur Remuneration policy at a 
glance’) and the details are set out on pages 39 to 48.
t he c ommittee intends that the proposed approach to 
implementing the policy set out in this report will 
continue to ensure close alignment of executive pay 
outcomes with Medica’s performance in 2018 and the 
longer-term success of Medica. performance related pay 
will form a significant part of the remuneration package 
of the executive directors and senior management to 
achieve a high performance culture without undue 
risk-taking or unsustainable company performance.
t he annual bonus for 2018 will be based on achievement 
of financial targets relating to c ompany profit.
t he vesting of psp awards to be made in 2018 will be 
based on two performance measures selected to 
reinforce our strategic drivers and support alignment of 
executive director pay outcomes with shareholder 
interests through direct linkage to longer-term 
shareholder value creation. 50% of the 2017 psp award 
will vest based on three-year eps growth, with the 
remaining 50% vesting based on Medica’s absolute 
t otal s hareholder Return over a three-year period. eps 
growth for the calculation of psp awards is adjusted for 
exceptional items, details of which are on n ote 7 of the 
Financial statements.
We hope that you find this report sets out clearly our 
proposed policy and how we intend to implement it, as 
well as the rationale for our decisions. t he policy will be 
submitted for shareholder approval at the AGM. t he 
c ommittee believes that the policy and the approach to 
its implementation in 2018 are in the best interests of all 
shareholders, and we hope that you will support it at 
our AGM.

Developing our remuneration policy
t he c ommittee has developed the proposed policy set 
out on pages 39 to 48, the key elements of which are 
set out below. t he basic elements of Medica’s proposed 
policy were outlined in Medica’s prospectus dated 16 
March 2017. since l isting, the c ommittee reviewed and 
further developed the proposed policy based on 
external advice from its independent remuneration 
consultants, Mercer l imited, and having regard to the 
delivery of Medica’s strategy and its long-term success. 
n o changes have been made to the broad policy 
elements outlined in the prospectus, except that Medica 
is proposing to adopt a tax advantaged c ompany s hare 
o ption plan. 
t he proposed policy is intended to become effective 
from the 2018 AGM (subject to shareholder approval).
Remuneration principles
t he proposed policy is based on the remuneration 
principles (see page 39) adopted by the c ommittee. t he 
application of these principles ensures that remuneration 
outcomes are aligned with Medica’s strategy and 
performance both in the short and long term.
Shareholder consultation
t he views of shareholders are important to us and the 
proposed policy will be subject to a binding vote at the 
AGM on 23 May 2018. the c ommittee is aware of the 
guidelines issued by investor bodies on corporate 
governance, in particular the importance of aligning 
remuneration with performance, and ensuring that 
policies are broadly consistent with those applying to 
the wider workforce. t he c ommittee is keen to foster an 
open and transparent approach to setting and 
determining outcomes against its policy and will review 
voting outcomes from our first AGM and engage with 
our largest shareholders on any proposed changes to 
our policy in the future. 
t his report has been prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the c ompanies Act 2006 and s chedule 8 
of the l arge and Medium-sized c ompanies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as 
amended). It also meets the requirements of the u Kl A’s 
l isting Rules.
In accordance with the Regulations, the following 
sections of the Remuneration Report are subject to 
audit: the single total figure of remuneration for 
executive directors and n on-executive directors, and 
accompanying notes (pages 49 to 53), scheme interests 
awarded during the financial year (page 50), exit 
payments made in the year (page 51), payments to past 
directors (page 51) and the statement of directors’ 
shareholdings (page 53). t he remaining sections of  
the report are not subject to audit.

comprises both fixed and variable elements consistent 
with our remuneration principles.

into discussion on the levels of variable remuneration as 
well as being factored into future salary increases.

Policy
Maximum bonus opportunities for the financial year ending 31 december 2018 will be 100%, and for future awards 
this will not exceed 150% other than in exceptional circumstances. For e xecutive directors, it is expected that not 
more than 75% of any annual bonus will be payable in cash and the balance will be made in the form of an award 
over Medica’s shares granted under the deferred Bonus plan (‘dBp’), which will then vest after a period not 
expected to be less than two years, broadly subject to continued employment. c ash bonuses will be subject to 
clawback provisions as will dBp awards, as set out in the rules of the annual bonus plan and dBp. t he level of 
deferral and period for deferral may change in relation to future financial years.

Policy
Awards granted under the psp (‘ psp Awards’) will take the form of an option to acquire shares for nil consideration.
t he maximum award opportunity is normally 100% of base salary. A psp Award may be granted in excess of this 
limit, but only in circumstances which the c ommittee in its absolute discretion considers to be sufficiently 
exceptional to justify the grant of a psp Award in excess of such limit and any such psp Award will not, in any 
circumstances, exceed 200% of the individual’s basic salary at the date of grant. psp Awards granted on l isting in 
March 2017 were at 150% of basic salary.
prior to awards being granted each year the performance conditions and targets are set by the c ommittee to 
ensure they are stretching and aligned with Medica’s strategy. For psp Awards granted in 2017, 25% of an award 
will vest at threshold performance, 70% at median and 100% vesting at maximum (and a straight-line sliding scale 
between these points). Future psp Awards granted to e xecutive directors will normally have a performance period 
of at least three years and normally a minimum normal vesting period of three years. t hey will also normally be 
subject to a further holding period, after the end of the normal vesting period of a minimum of two years. 
Malus and clawback provisions apply under certain circumstances. 38

Remuneration for the wider workforce 
Remuneration for the wider workforce is determined based on broadly consistent principles as those for executive 
directors. Annual salary reviews take into account Medica’s performance, local pay and market conditions to 
ensure that reward at Medica remains competitive. Incentive arrangements are in place for some employees below 
the executive level. Medica operates a tax-advantaged s ave-As-You-earn option plan in which participation is 
offered to all employees (including executive directors) of the group who are eligible to participate. Medica is  
also proposing to adopt a tax-advantaged c ompany s hare o ption plan under which awards of market value 
options over shares worth not more than £30,000 can be granted to employees (including e xecutive directors)  
of the group. 39

Medica’s strategy, by 
ensuring base 
salaries and the

Base salaries will be reviewed by  
the c ommittee annually, and

t he executive directors’ salary is

Base salary increases for the executive

in responsibilities, size or complexity of 
the role, or if a director was intentionally 
appointed on a below-market salary. t he

Medica provides death in service 
benefits to its executive directors.
Medica may provide benefits in kind 
where the Remuneration c ommittee 
considers appropriate. executive 
directors may also be provided certain 
other benefits to take account of 
individual circumstances such as, but 
not limited to, payment of tax, financial, 
and/or legal adviser fees, relocation 
expenses and housing allowance 
(including associated interest, penalties 
or fees plus, in certain circumstances 
or where the c ommittee consider it 
appropriate, any tax incurred on such 
benefits). 
executive directors may also be 
offered any other future benefits made 
available to all senior employees. t his 
may include participation in any s hare 
Incentive plan that is offered to all 
employees (or all employees who meet 
certain qualifying criteria) on the same 
terms.
Benefits for executive 
directors are set at  
a level which the 
committee considers 
appropriate compared to 
wider employee benefits, 
as well as competitive 
practices in relevant 
markets.
t he value of annual 
benefits will normally not 
exceed 10% of salary, and 
it is not anticipated that 
the costs of benefits 
provided will increase 
significantly in the 
financial years over which 
this policy will apply,

increases in cost. In 
addition, the c ommittee 
retains discretion to 
approve a higher cost 
in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. to 
facilitate recruitment, 
relocation, expatriation, 
etc.) or in circumstances 
where factors outside 
Medica’s control have 
changed (e.g. market 
increases in insurance 
costs).

Notes to the Policy Table
Approach to target setting and performance measure selection
t he c ommittee considers carefully the selection of performance measures at the start of each performance cycle, 
taking into consideration Medica’s strategic objectives and the macroeconomic environment.
Annual bonus measures are selected to align with Medica’s short-term KpIs. Measures may change from year to year 
(subject to the policy), and the rationale for any changes to the bonus measures selected will therefore be disclosed in 
the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
psp performance measures are selected to ensure they reward delivery of Medica’s strategy and growth in 
shareholder value over a multi-year period, and are intended to align executive directors’ interests with those of 
shareholders. t he performance measures applicable to the psp awards to be granted in 2018 (subject to 
shareholder approval of the policy) will be based as to 50% on eps growth and as to 50% on absolute t otal 
s hareholder Return over a three-year period. t he c ommittee considers these measures align executive incentives 
to Medica’s strategy and shareholder interests.
t argets are set to be stretching but achievable over the three-year performance period. eps targets are set taking 
account of multiple relevant reference points, including internal forecasts, external expectations for future 
performance at both Medica and its closest sector peers, and typical performance ranges for those measures at 
other Ftse companies of comparable size and complexity.
u ntil an award over shares under the dBp or psp has been exercised and the shares which are subject to the 
relevant award have been issued or transferred to the award holder, the award holder has no entitlement to 
dividends or other distributions payable by reference to a record date preceding the date of such issue or transfer. 
t he c ommittee can, however, determine that dividend equivalents will be awarded. If dividend equivalents are 
awarded, whenever a dividend or other distribution is paid by Medica in respect of its shares and the vesting date 
of the dBp or psp award (including any additional holding period that applies to the psp award) has not passed, 
the number of shares which are subject to the dBp or psp award will be increased to reflect the value of the 
dividend. t he c ommittee can determine that dividend equivalents will be paid in either shares or in cash. 
Share ownership guidelines
t he c ommittee recognises the importance of aligning executive directors’ and shareholders’ interests through 
significant shareholdings in Medica. Medica’s shareholding policy is 100% of base salary for e xecutive directors. 
t he executive directors will have five years in which to build up the required ordinary shareholding after 
commencing employment. 
details of the executive directors’ current personal shareholdings are provided in on page 53. 44

Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis
t he charts below provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the executive directors, and 
the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: 
‘Maximum’, ‘o n-target’ and ‘Minimum’.
potential reward opportunities are based on the forward-looking policy applied to 2018 base salaries and incentive 
opportunities. n ote that the psp awards granted to e xecutive directors will not normally vest until the third 
anniversary of the date of grant, and will then normally be subject to an additional two-year holding period before 
the awards can be exercised. t he projected value excludes the impact of share price movement or dividend 
equivalent payments.

Executive Director service contracts
In accordance with general market practice, each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract. t he 
executive directors’ service contracts (copies of which are available to view at Medica’s registered office) are each 
terminable on 12 months’ notice from either party. this practice will also apply for any new executive directors. t he 
following table shows the date of the service contract for each executive director that served during the year:

 Anthony l ee c Fo 14 May 2013 15 March 2017

Exit payments policy
Medica’s policy on termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into 
account the relevant contractual terms in the executive’s service contract and the circumstances of termination. 
executive directors’ contracts provide for the payment of a pre-determined sum in the event of termination of 
employment in certain circumstances (but excluding circumstances where Medica is entitled to dismiss without 
compensation), comprising base salary, pension allowance and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the 
notice period. t ermination payments may take the form of payments in lieu of notice. 
If the employment is terminated by Medica, the c ommittee retains the discretion to settle any other amount the 
c ommittee considers reasonable to the executive director including in settlement of claims, in respect of legal fees 
incurred in connection with the termination and fees for outplacement services and relocation costs.
In additional to contractual provisions, the table below summarises how awards under each discretionary incentive 
plan are typically treated in specific circumstances, with (where relevant) the final treatment remaining subject to 
the c ommittee’s discretion as provided under the rules of the plan. In the event of termination, any outstanding 
options granted under the sAYe scheme and any awards made under a s hare Incentive plan that may be 
established by Medica will be treated in accordance with the rules of the scheme, which do not include discretion.
disclosure in relation to any departing executive director, including details of any remuneration payment made to 
him after he ceases will be made in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration. 45

Approach to remuneration on recruitment
External appointments
In cases of hiring or appointing a new executive director from outside Medica, the c ommittee may make use of all 
existing components of remuneration set out in the policy table, up to the disclosed maximum opportunities 
(where applicable).
When determining the remuneration package for a new executive director, the c ommittee will take into account all 
relevant factors based on the circumstances at that time to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of 
Medica and its shareholders. t his may include factors such as the experience and skills of the individual, internal 
comparisons and relevant market data. 
t he c ommittee may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i.e. over and above the maximum limits on incentive opportunities set out 
in the policy table. In doing so, the c ommittee will consider relevant factors, including any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the time over which they would have 
vested. t he intention is that the expected value of any buy-out award would be no higher than the expected value 
of the forfeited arrangements, and that the structure will replicate (as far as reasonably possible) that of the awards 
being forfeited. t he c ommittee may consider it appropriate to structure ‘buy-out’ awards differently from the 
structure described in the policy table, exercising the discretion available under u Kl A l isting Rule 9.4.2R where 
necessary to make a one-off award to an executive director in this context. t he c ommittee may also permit 
Medica to indemnify a new appointment as executive director for any claims that may be made against him by a 
previous employer in connection with a breach of restrictive covenants or similar restrictions that the new 
appointment may have breached by taking up employment with Medica.
Internal promotion
Where a new executive director is appointed by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that 
for external appointees, as detailed above (other than in relation to ‘buy-out’ awards). Any commitments made 
prior to an individual’s promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent  
with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although Medica may, where appropriate, seek to  
revise an individual’s existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and 
good practice.
disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director, including details of any ‘buy-out’ awards, 
will be disclosed in the Rns notification made at the time of appointment and in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration for the year in which recruitment occurred.
External appointments held by Executive Directors
executive directors may accept up to one external appointment subject to approval by the Board, there being no 
conflicts of interest and the appointment not leading to deterioration in the individual’s performance. executive 
directors may retain the fees paid for such roles. details of external appointments and the associated fees received 
will be included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in Medica
t he c ommittee seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employees as part of its broader employee 
engagement strategy, considers pay practices across Medica and is mindful of the salary increases applying across 
the rest of the business in relevant markets when considering any increases to salaries for executive directors. 
However, the c ommittee does not currently consult with employees on its executive remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholder views
t he c ommittee will take into consideration all shareholder views received during the year and at the Annual 
General Meeting each year, as well as guidance from shareholder representative bodies more broadly, in shaping 
Medica’s implementation of its policy, as well as any future changes to policy. It is the c ommittee’s intention to 
consult with major shareholders in advance of making any material changes to remuneration arrangements. 48

details of disclosure of targets – to be confirmed:
Although targets in relation to the 2017 financial year are not disclosed, it is the committee’s intention going 
forward to disclose annual bonus targets retrospectively, at the same time as the performance outcome is 
disclosed in the remuneration report after the end of each financial year, but only to the extent they are not

Share incentive awards awarded in 2017 (audited)
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
o n the date of l isting, executive directors and other key executives were granted awards under the psp, 
comprising a grant of options to acquire shares at nil cost. Awards granted to executive directors under the psp on 
the date of l isting were granted in respect of shares with a market value equal to 150% of base salary, determined 
using the price of Medica’s shares on l isting (135 pence). the c ommittee regarded this level of award as necessary 
to incentivise executive directors while base salaries remained below market levels. t hese awards will vest after a 
three-year period, broadly subject to continued employment and the achievement of performance measures, and 
will also be subject to a further two-year holding period after the end of the normal vesting period. t hey will vest 
50% depending on eps growth and 50% on absolute ts R over the performance period.
If the minimum eps growth target is met, 12.5% of the psp Award will vest. If the minimum ts R growth target is 
met, 12.5% of the psp Award will vest.

2. t he face value of the awards has been calculating using the share price at the date of grant, being the listing price of Medica’s shares on l isting 
(135 pence). this assumes that the performance targets are met in full. Actual value at vesting will depend on the extent to which the awards vest, 
the share price at the date of vesting, and any dividend equivalents payable on vested shares.

Implementation of Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2018
Base salary
Base salaries were set on l isting taking into account each individual’s professional experience and level of 
responsibility in their role. t he c ommittee considers that base salaries remain significantly below market levels, 
and this will be factored into discussion on the levels of variable remuneration as well as being factored into 
future salary increases. t he current salaries of the executive directors, effective from l isting, are set out below:
director Base salary
John Graham £200,000
Anthony l ee £140,000
dr stephen davies £200,000
executive director salary levels will remain at these levels for 2018, but may be increased in future years.
Pension
John Graham receives pension contributions of 7% of his salary. Anthony l ee receives pension contributions of 6% 
of his salary. dr stephen davies receives a cash allowance equal to 6% of his salary in lieu of pension contributions. 
Annual bonus
For 2018, the executive directors will have a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of salary. n o more than 75% of 
any annual bonus will be payable in cash and the balance will be made in the form of a dBp award over s hares, 
which will then vest after a period of not less than two years, broadly subject to continued employment. c ash 
bonuses will be subject to clawback provisions as will dBp awards, as set out in the rules of the annual bonus plan 
and dBp. t he level of deferral and period for deferral may change in relation to future financial years.
t he annual bonus for 2018 will be based 100% on achievement of c ompany financial targets relating to profits.
t he c ommittee will normally disclose the annual bonus targets retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration. In the event the Board considers these targets to remain commercially sensitive, they will be 
disclosed as soon as possible once they are no longer considered to be sensitive.
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
In 2018, the executive directors will receive nil cost options under the Medica Group psp, with face values of 150% 
of salary.
t he 2018 psp awards will vest after three years, subject to the following performance measures and will be subject 
to a further 2 year holding period following the end of the normal vesting period:
performance measures Weighting
3-year eps growth 50%
3-year absolute ts R growth 50%
Absolute ts R growth has been selected by the c ommittee to closely align executive interests with those of 
shareholders. Medica’s ts R performance will be measured over the three-year period commencing 1 January 2018.
eps growth has been selected by the c ommittee because it closely aligns with, and incentivises delivery of, 
Medica’s strategy. t he eps growth will be measured over the three-year period commencing 1 January 2018.
t he performance target ranges have been set at stretching levels taking into account both internal and external 
forecasts. t he maximum vesting level is set to represent very stretching performance.
In line with our policy, psp awards will also be subject to Medica’s malus and clawback provisions. 53

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Going concern assessment
t he consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis on the assumption that the 
Group continues in existence for the foreseeable future. t he directors of Medica Group plc have assessed the 
current financial position of the Group, along with future cash flow requirements, to determine if the Group has the 
financial resources to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the approval of the 
accounts. t he directors have concluded that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due for the foreseeable future and are satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of preparation in the financial statements.

In accordance with provision c .2.2 of the u K c orporate Governance c ode, the directors have assessed the viability 
of the c ompany over a three-year period to 31 december 2020. t he directors believe this period to be appropriate 
as the Group’s strategic review considered by the Board encompasses this period. In making their assessment, the 
directors have considered the Group’s current financial position and performance, cash flow projections, including 
future capital expenditure, in relation to the availability of finance and funding facilities and have considered these 
factors in relation to the principal risks and uncertainties which are included in the directors’ Report.
during the year to 31 december 2017, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. t he 
directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully, having taken into account 
the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the Board believes that, taking into account the Group’s 
current position, and subject to the principal risks faced by the business, the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the period up to 31 december 2020.

understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the c ompany’s position and

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International standards on Auditing (u K) (IsAs (u K)) and applicable 
law. o ur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the Financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the parent c ompany in

including the FRc ’s ethical standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Who we are reporting to
t his report is made solely to the c ompany’s members, as a body, in accordance with c hapter 3 of part 16 of the 
c ompanies Act 2006. o ur audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the c ompany’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditor’s Report and for no other purpose. t o the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the c ompany and the 
c ompany’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the Annual Report, in relation to which the 
IsAs (u K) require us to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the strategic Report set out on pages 23 to 24 that describe the principal risks and explain 
how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation, set out on page 56 of the d irectors’ Report that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 56 of the d irectors’ Report about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial statements and the 
directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group and the parent c ompany’s ability to continue 
to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the Financial statements;
• whether the directors’ statement relating to going concern required under the l isting Rules in accordance with 
l isting Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• the directors’ explanation, set out on page 56 of the d irectors’ Report as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 58

Overview of our audit approach
• t he key audit matter was identified as revenue recognition, particularly the risk around the 
occurrence of revenue;
• o verall Group materiality: £476,000 which represents 4.5% of the Group’s Adjusted e BItd A; 
and
• We performed full scope audit procedures over all Group entities at the sole operating location  
in the u nited Kingdom.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
Financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. t hese matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the 
overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
t hese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the audit – Group
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised 
throughout the Group as the fair 
value of consideration receivable 
in respect of the provision of 
services in relation to the 
completion of radiology reports. 
Revenue is recognised at the 
point at which the radiology 
report is submitted to the 
hospital’s RIs (Radiology 
Information system) and, as 
such, revenue is recognised once 
the service has been provided 
and delivered to the customer.
determining the amount of 
revenue to be recognised does 
not require significant 
management judgement or 
estimation, due to the stage of 
completion being final at the 
time the report is submitted.
However, due to the volume of 
transactions that occur during 
the year, we identified the 
occurrence of revenue and the 
existence of the associated 
receivables as a significant risk. 
t his was the most significant 
assessed risk of material 
misstatement.
o ur audit work included, but was not restricted to:
• gaining an understanding of the processes and controls implemented by the 
Group to identify, measure and recognise revenue, and assessing the design 
effectiveness of those processes and controls, particularly in relation to the 
accurate extraction of data from the picture Archiving and c ommunications 
system (‘pAcs ’), as relevant to the recognition of revenue;
• testing the validity of the data extracted from the pAcs , including: (i) an It 
specialist review of the coding of the computer algorithm used to extract data 
to gain comfort over the accuracy of the extracted data; (ii) for a sample of 
the extracted data, verifying that the underlying radiology reports have been 
included on the applicable hospital’s Radiology Information system and that 
they had therefore been appropriately submitted; and (iii) for a sample of the 
extracted data, verifying through examination of customer contracts and 
other correspondence that the pricing rates applied were in accordance with 
contractual agreements as appropriate;
• considering the appropriateness of the Group’s revenue recognition policy in 
accordance with International Accounting standard 18: ‘Revenue’ and testing 
a sample of revenue items to verify that they were recorded in line with that 
policy;
• testing a sample of revenue items recognised during the year to determine the 
existence and occurrence of that revenue by agreeing each item to an 
underlying customer contract or relationship and to pAcs data;
• testing a sample of year end receivables by directly obtaining confirmations 
from the customers; and where such a confirmation response was not 
received, conducting alternative procedures, including the verification of 
subsequent cash receipts and examination of source documents to gain 
comfort over the existence of year end receivables.
t he Group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition is disclosed in n ote 3.2 to 
the Financial statements and related disclosures are included in n ote 5. t he 
Audit c ommittee identified revenue recognition as a significant matter in its
report on page 33, where the Audit c ommittee also described the consideration 
that it has given to address this matter.
Key observations
o verall, based on our audit work, our assessment is that the processes applied in 
recording radiology reporting transactions resulted in appropriate recognition of 
revenue and associated receivables in the financial statements and our testing 
did not identify any material misstatements.
n o key audit matters were identified in respect of the parent c ompany Financial statements.

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the Financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in 
determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work.
Materiality was determined as follows:
Materiality measure Group Parent Company
Financial statements  
as a whole
£476,000 which is 4.5% of the Group’s 
earnings Before Interest, t axes, 
depreciation, and Amortisation excluding 
exceptional Items (‘Adjusted eBItd A’). t his 
benchmark is considered the most 
appropriate because this is the key 
performance measure used by the Board of 
directors to report to investors on the 
financial performance of the Group.
Materiality for the current year is higher 
than the level that we determined for the 
year ended 31 december 2016 to reflect the 
increase in the Group’s Adjusted eBItd A in 
the year ended 31 december 2017.
£428,000 which is 2% of the p arent 
c ompany’s t otal Assets, capped at 90% of 
the Group materiality. t otal Assets is 
considered the most appropriate 
benchmark because the c ompany is 
primarily an investment holding entity.
Materiality for the current year is higher 
than the level that we determined for the 
year ended 31 december 2016 to reflect the 
increase in the c ompany’s t otal Assets in 
the year ended 31 december 2017.

An overview of the scope of our audit
As all Group operations are based in the u K and subject to statutory audit, all components of the Group were 
subjected to a comprehensive audit approach. o ur audit approach was based on a thorough understanding of the 
Group’s business and is risk-based, and in particular included:
• performing an evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls over key financial statement risks identified as 
part of our risk assessment process;
• gaining an understanding of the financial reporting and accounts production process; and
• undertaking substantive testing on significant transactions, balances and disclosures, the extent of which was 
based on various factors such as our overall assessment of the control environment, the effectiveness of controls 
over individual systems and the management of specific risks.
t he scope of the current year audit has remained consistent with that of the prior year.
Other information
t he directors are responsible for the other information. t he other information comprises the information included 
in the Annual Report set out on pages 1 to 56, other than the Financial statements and our Auditor’s Report 
thereon. o ur opinion on the Financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material 
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the Financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to 
report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following 
items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where 
we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 31 – the statement given by the directors that they consider 
the Annual Report and Financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit c ommittee reporting set out on pages 32 and 33 – the section describing the work of the Audit c ommittee 
does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit c ommittee; or
• directors’ statement of compliance with the u K c orporate Governance c ode set out on page 28 – the parts of 
the directors’ statement required under the l isting Rules relating to the c ompany’s compliance with the u K 
c orporate Governance c ode containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with l isting 
Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the uK c orporate Governance 
code.
Our opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 are unmodified
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the c ompanies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic Report and the directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
Financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Financial statements; and
• the strategic Report and the directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent c ompany and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic Report or the 
directors’ Report.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the c ompanies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent c ompany, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent c ompany Financial statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors for the Financial Statements
As explained more fully in the directors’ Responsibilities statement set out on page 54, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the Financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent 
c ompany’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent 
c ompany or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements
o ur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with IsAs (u K) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial statements.
We are responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that the Financial statements taken as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. o wing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is 
an unavoidable risk that material misstatements of the Financial statements may not be detected, even though the 
audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with the IsAs (u K). o ur audit approach is a risk-based 
approach and is explained more fully in the ‘An overview of the scope of our audit’ section of our Audit Report.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial statements is located on the Financial 
Reporting c ouncil’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. t his description forms part of our Auditor’s 
Report.
Other matters which we are required to address
We were appointed by the Board of directors on 6 August 2013 to audit the Financial statements for the period 
ending 31 december 2013 and subsequent financial periods.
t he period of total uninterrupted engagement is five years, covering the periods ending 31 december 2013 to 31 
december 2017.
t he non-audit services prohibited by the FRc ’s ethical standard were not provided to the Group or the parent 
c ompany and we remain independent of the Group and the parent c ompany in conducting our audit.
o ur audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit c ommittee.

For the year ended 31 december 2017 66
Medica Group Plc
Annu Al RepoR t And Accounts 2017
1 Medica Group Plc
Medica Group plc (‘the c ompany’) was incorporated in england and Wales on 22 April 2013 under the companies 
Act 2006 (registration number 08497963) and is domiciled in the u nited Kingdom. Its registered office and 
principal place of business is Havelock place, Havelock Road, Hastings, east s ussex, tn 34 1BG.
t he consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 december 2017 (including comparatives) 
comprise the c ompany and its subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘the Group’). t he Group’s principal activity is 
the provision of teleradiology reporting and it is the leading independent provider in the u K. t he Group’s business 
activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in 
the c hairman’s and c hief executive’s Reports on pages 4–5 and 16–19. In addition, n ote 25 to the financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial instruments and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
2 Basis of preparation
2.1. Basis of preparation
t he c onsolidated financial statements of Medica Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (together ‘the Group’) 
for the 12 months ended 31 d ecember 2017 have been prepared by the directors of Medica Group plc.
t he consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting standards (‘IFRs ’) and IFRIc interpretations as adopted by the e uropean u nion (eu ) and the c ompanies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFR s .
t he preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRs requires the use of certain critical 
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies. t he areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in n ote 4 to the 
financial statements.
t he consolidated financial statements are presented in £ (sterling), the presentational and functional currency of 
the c ompany, rounded to the nearest £’000.
2.2. Going concern
t he directors of Medica Group plc have assessed the current financial position of the Group, along with future cash 
flow requirements to determine if the Group has the financial resources to continue as a going concern for a period 
of at least 12 months from the approval of the accounts. As a result of this review the directors of Medica Group plc 
have concluded that it is appropriate that Medica Group plc be considered a going concern. For this reason, they 
have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. t he financial statements do not 
include any adjustments that would result in the going concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.
2.3. Adoption of new and revised standards
n ew and amended standards issued in the year have not had a significant impact on the financial statements. At 
the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to 
existing standards have been published by the IAs B and adopted by the eu but are not yet effective, and have not 
been adopted early by the Group. Management anticipates that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted 
in the Group’s accounting policies for the first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. 
Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Group’s 
financial statements is provided below. c ertain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are 
not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
• IFRs 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, effective 1 January 2018. 
• IFRs 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, effective date 1 January 2018. 
• IFRs 16 ‘l eases’, effective date 1 January 2019 (endorsed by the eu). 
Based on the Group’s historic transaction history and anticipated future transaction profile IFRs 9 is not expected 
to have a significant impact on the measurement financial instruments, however there will be minor changes to the 
disclosures in the financial statements in order to comply with the new standard. 
t he impact of IFRs 15 has been assessed and is not expected to have an impact on revenue recognition, however 
there will be minor changes to the disclosures in the financial statements in order to comply with the new standard. 
If the standard had been applied to the financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 there would have 
been no impact on revenue recognition. IFRs 16 will impact the measurement and disclosure of lease liabilities, and 
the liabilities shown on the Group’s balance sheet.
A number of IFRs and IFRI c interpretations are also currently in issue which are not relevant for the Group’s 
activities and which have not therefore been adopted in preparing these financial statements.

3. Summary of accounting policies
t hese accounting policies have been used throughout all periods presented in the financial statements, except 
where the Group has applied certain accounting policies and exemptions upon transition to IFRs .
3.1. Basis of consolidation
t he Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent c ompany and all of its subsidiary undertakings 
drawn up to 31 december 2017. All subsidiaries have the same reporting date and use accounting policies 
consistent with those of the parent c ompany. Medica Group plc (‘the Group’) controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. s ubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group.
u nrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Amounts reported in the 
financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting 
policies adopted by the Group.
Business combinations are dealt with by the acquisition method. t he acquisition method involves the recognition at 
fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition 
date, regardless of whether or not they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to 
acquisition. o n initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the consolidated 
statement of financial position at their fair values, which are also used as the basis for subsequent measurement in 
accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable intangible 
assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
recognised from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.
3.2. Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts 
receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes.
Revenue is recognised when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity, the costs incurred or to be incurred can be 
measured reliably and when the criteria for each of the Group’s different activities have been met.
Radiology image submissions: the service is deemed to have been provided, and subsequent revenue recognised, 
when the c ompany submits its radiology report to the customer. Revenue for all service lines are recognised on the 
same basis.
3.3. Interest income/Interest expense
Interest income and expenses are reported on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
3.4. Segment reporting
IFRs 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of 
performance and allocation of resources by the Group c hief executive (chief operating decision maker – cod M).
t he Board has reviewed the Group and all revenues are functional activities of teleradiology reporting and these 
activities take place on an integrated basis. t he senior executive team reviews the financial information on an 
integrated basis for the Group as a whole.
3.5. Leasing
Management applies judgement in considering the substance of a lease agreement and whether it transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset. Key factors considered include 
the length of the lease term in relation to the economic life of the asset, the present value of the minimum lease 
payments in relation to the asset’s fair value, and whether the Group obtains ownership of the asset at the end of 
the lease term.
Operating leases
All other leases are treated as operating leases. Where the Group is a lessee, payments on operating lease 
agreements are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Associated costs, such as 
maintenance and insurance, are expensed as incurred. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into 
an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 68

3. Summary of accounting policies continued
3.6. Property, plant and equipment
property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. 
depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment 
by equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives less estimated residual values, using the straight-line 
method. t he rates generally applicable are:
c omputer equipment  – 25% per annum
l easehold improvements – o ver the life of the lease term 
t he gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as 
the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
t he assets’ residual value and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if required, at each balance sheet date. t he 
carrying amount of an asset is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
3.7. Impairment of property, plant and equipment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if 
any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the 
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant assets are carried at 
a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
3.8. Goodwill and other intangible assets
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group 
and that its cost can be measured reliably. t he asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it 
arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, are shown at fair value at the date of the acquisition 
less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis through the profit or loss. t he rates 
applicable, which represent the directors’ best estimate of the useful economic life, are:
• c ustomer relationships – 15 years.
• s oftware and technology – 10 years for assets purchased as part of the acquisition of Medica Reporting l imited 
in 2013, software licences purchased since then are amortised over their term.
• Brands – 20 years.
Internal development costs
expenditure on the research phase of projects to develop new projects is recognised as an expense as incurred.
c osts that are directly attributable to a project’s development phase are recognised as intangible assets, provided 
they meet the following recognition requirements:
• the development costs can be measured reliably;
• the project is technically and commercially feasible; 
• the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the project;
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

Medica Group Plc
Annu Al RepoR t And Accounts 2017

• the Group has the ability to use or sell the software; and
• the software will generate probable future economic benefits. 
3.8. Goodwill and other intangible assets
development costs not meeting these criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
directly attributable costs include employee costs incurred on software development along with an appropriate 
portion of relevant overheads and borrowing costs.
3.9. Impairment of intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units 
and is not amortised but tested annually for impairment. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill cannot be 
subsequently reversed.
At each balance sheet date, the Group performs an annual impairment review of goodwill and any intangible assets 
with an indefinite useful economic life. t he recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual 
asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
An impairment loss is reversed if the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying 
amount.
Other intangible assets
o ther intangible assets are not tested for impairment annually, only when there is an objective indicator of 
impairment. Where an impairment indicator is identified an impairment test is carried out by comparing the 
carrying of the assets with its recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less 
than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
3.10. Taxation
t ax expenses recognised in profit or loss comprise the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax not 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax
t he tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. t axable profit differs from profit as reported in the 
statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible 
in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. t he Group’s liability for current tax 
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using 
the liability method. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and 
deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be 
recognised. s uch assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. deferred tax assets arising from deductible 
temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to recognise the benefits of the temporary differences and 
they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. 70
Medica Group Plc
Annu Al RepoR t And Accounts 2017
t he carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which 
the liability is settled or the asset recognised based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. t he measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the 
tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover 
or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the 
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
3. Summary of accounting policies continued
3.11. Financial instruments
Recognition, initial measurement and derecognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the financial instrument and are measured initially at fair value adjusted for transaction costs, except 
for those carried at fair value through profit or loss which are measured initially at fair value. s ubsequent 
measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities is described below.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or 
when the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or 
expires. An exchange between an existing borrower and lender of debt instruments with substantially different 
terms shall be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new 
financial liability. s imilarly, substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability shall be accounted 
for as an extinguishment of the original liability and the recognition of a financial liability. A substantial modification 
of terms occurs when the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms is at least 10% different 
from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original facility.
t he only types of financial assets held by the Group are loans, receivables and derivative financial instruments.
Loans and receivables
l oans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market. After initial recognition, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. t he 
Group’s cash and cash equivalents, trade and most other receivables fall into this category of financial instruments.
Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective 
evidence is received that a specific counterparty will default. Receivables that are not considered to be individually 
impaired are reviewed for impairment in groups, which are determined by reference to the industry and region of 
the counterparty and other shared credit risk characteristics. t he impairment loss estimate is then based on recent 
historical counterparty default rates for each identified group.
Derivative financial instruments
t he Group utilises interest rate swaps, derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value at the end of the 
year with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities
t he Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables and derivative financial instruments. 
Financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for 
derivatives. t he only derivatives held by the Group are interest rate swaps which have been included at fair value. 
Financial liabilities designated at FVtpl , which are carried subsequently at fair value with gains or losses 
recognised in profit or loss. please see n ote 24 for the fair value hierarchy.
3.12. Equity, reserves and dividend payments
s hare capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
s hare premium includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the 
issuing of shares are deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period retained profits or losses.

Annu Al RepoR t And Accounts 2017
strategic Report Governance Financial Statements o verview
dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in ‘other liabilities’ when the dividends have 
been approved in a general meeting prior to the reporting date.
3.13. Exceptional items
exceptional items are items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence and which the directors 
consider should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.
3.14. Employee benefits
s hort-term employee benefits and contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the 
period in which they are incurred.
3.15. Share based payments
t he Group has applied the requirements of IFRs share based payments.
t he Group issues share based payments to certain employees. t he fair value determined at the grant date is 
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate valuation model. t he Black-s choles option pricing 
model has been used to value the non-market based conditions part of the performance s hare plan (psp) and a 
Binomial model has been used to value the market based conditions part.
4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
t he preparation of financial statements under IFRs requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts. estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. t he estimates and 
assumptions which have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are 
discussed below.
4.1. Key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty
The useful life of acquired intangible assets
t he Group recognises the intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of 
acquisition. t he determination of these fair values were determined by experts engaged by management and 
based upon management’s and the directors’ judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of 
future incremental cash flows generated by the assets and selection of an appropriate discount rate. Furthermore, 
management have estimated the expected useful lives of intangible assets and charged amortisation on these 
assets accordingly. At the reporting date no impairments to other intangible assets were recognised in the period.
t he directors considered the estimates of the useful economic life of intangible assets acquired in May 2013 as part 
of the purchase of Medica Reporting l imited. t he directors considered the strength of the Medica brand in the 
teleradiology and wider healthcare sector and noted that the transaction was limited to a change of equity 
ownership. t he brand is expected to continue to be used for the foreseeable future. In assessing the useful 
economic life of customer relationships the directors considered the importance of long term relationships given 
the limited number of n Hs t rusts and the fact that the majority of revenue came from long standing clients. In 
assessing the useful economic life of the technology purchased the directors considered that the technology was 
core to the business and whilst requiring ongoing investment was not expected to fundamentally change for a 
considerable period.
5 Segment reporting
Management prepare and monitor financial information for the Group’s three primary service lines (Routine 
c ross-s ectional, Routine plain Film and n ightHawk) on a regular basis. t his financial information is reviewed and 
used by the c hief o perational decisions Maker (considered to be the c hief executive o fficer) in managing the 
operating activities of the Group. IFRs 8 sets out certain thresholds in determining whether reportable operating 
segments exist, and all of the three primary service lines exceed these thresholds. However, IFRs 8 permits the 
aggregation of operating segments where these services lines are similar in nature, service delivery processes, 
types or classes of customers, and regulatory factors. Management consider it is most appropriate to aggregate 
the three service lines into one t eleradiology operating segment due to the similarities in respect of these factors. 
As a result all teleradiology activities are presented as one operating segment.
Medica Group plc has identified only one geographic area, the u K. As a result of this and there being only one 
operating segment as described above, no analysis has been provided. n o customer accounted for more than 10% 
of the Group’s revenues. 72

Goodwill is not amortised, but tested annually for impairment. t he directors have assessed goodwill for

relates entirely to the acquisition of Medica Reporting l imited (MRl ) in 2013, and MRl accounts for all of the 
Group’s revenue and operating activity (other than finance charges relating to the bank loans and loan notes which 
are recorded in intermediate parent entities). t he fair value of the Group as indicated by the market value of its 
equity at the balance sheet date is in excess of £150m, providing substantial headroom over the carrying amount of

24.1. Fair value measurement of financial instruments
t he methods used to measure financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value are described below.
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into 
three levels of fair value hierarchy. t he three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to 
the measurement as follows:
l evel 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
l evel 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
l evel 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
t he fair values of interest rate swaps are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. t he Group’s interest 
rate swaps are not traded in active markets. t hese have been fair valued using observable interest rates 
corresponding to the maturity of the contract. o utstanding derivatives at the reporting date are included under the 
appropriate format heading depending on the nature of the derivative.
25 Financial instruments risk
25.1. Risk management objectives and policies
t he Group is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. t he Group’s financial assets and liabilities 
by category are summarised in n ote 24. t he Group’s financial instruments (other than derivatives) comprise cash 
and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its 
operations. t he main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. t he 
principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity, credit and interest rate risks. t he Group is not exposed to 
transactional foreign currency risks, as all of its activities are based in the u K.
t he Group’s risk management is coordinated at its headquarters, in close cooperation with the Board of directors, 
and focuses on actively securing the Group’s short to medium-term cash flows by minimising the exposure to 
volatile financial markets. l ong-term financial investments are managed to generate lasting returns.
t he Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes nor does it write 
options. t he most significant financial risks to which the Group is exposed are described below.
Credit risk
t he Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. t he Group 
has no significant credit risk. t he maximum exposure to credit risk is that shown within the balance sheet. All 
amounts are short term and management consider the amounts to be of good credit quality. For a summary of 
financial assets past due, but not impaired, please see n ote 17.
Liquidity/funding risk
t he Group’s funding strategy is to ensure a mix of funding sources offering flexibility and cost-effectiveness to 
match the requirements of the Group. o perating subsidiaries are financed by retained profits. t he Group manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and agreed committed banking facilities. For a summary of non-
derivative financial liabilities that have contractual maturities (including interest payment where applicable) please 
see n ote 20.
Interest rate risk
t he Group holds the majority of its cash and cash equivalents in corporate current accounts. t hese accounts offer 
a competitive interest rate with the advantage of quick access to the funds. At the end of the year all of the Group’s 
bank loans bore a variable rate of interest of l IBo R plus 1.75%. However part of the interest rate risk was mitigated 
as £6.7m is subject to an interest rate swap, effectively fixing the l IBo R at 0.7675% and the interest rate paid at 
approximately 2.5% for this part of the loan.
Capital risk management
t he Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure 
that optimises the cost of capital.
t he Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
t he capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes loans, other borrowings and the loan notes 
disclosed in n otes 19 and 20; cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in the statement of financial position; and

n et debt to total capital 17% 78%
debt is defined as long- and short-term borrowings (excluding derivatives). equity includes all capital and reserves 
of the Group that are managed as capital.
Sensitivity analysis
t he £12m in bank loans is at a variable interest rate of l IBo R plus 1.75% and therefore represents a potential risk 
that the fair value of the Group’s future cash flows may fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. 
Interest rate swap arrangements were used throughout the year ending 31 december 2017 and as at that date, 
which had the effect of fixing £6.7m of bank loans at an approximate fixed interest rate 2.5% per annum. t he effect 
of changes in market interest rates did not have a material effect on valuation of the interest rate swaps 
themselves. Accordingly, the amount of debt outstanding as at 31 december 2017 considered to be exposed to 
interest rate risk was limited to £5.3m. A sensitivity analysis based upon this amount has been prepared and is 
presented below.
At 31 december 2017, if l IBo R had been 100 basis points higher, with all other variables held constant, post-tax 
profit for the year and total equity would have been reduced by £53,000, arising as a result of higher interest 
expense on variable borrowings.

Performance share plan
t he performance share plan is a ‘free’ share award with an effective exercise price of £nil. For scheme participants, 
half the award is based on earnings per share (eps ) and half is based on t otal s hareholder Return (ts R). t he 
performance period is three years and there is an additional holding period of two years. Accordingly the vesting 
period is deemed to be five years. Further information is set out in the report of the Remuneration c ommittee on

t he Group engaged external consultants to calculate the fair value of the awards at the date of grant. t he valuation

and a binomial model for market based awards.

SAYE scheme
t he sAYe scheme is an all-employee HMRc approved tax-advantaged share scheme. t he scheme involves 
employees saving a set amount from their salary for a period of three years. At the end of the three years the 
employee is offered an opportunity to purchase shares based on the amount saved at an option price set at the 
start of the period. t he exercise price for awards granted in 2017 was £1.86 and by the end of the year employees 
have saved a total of £40,000 into the scheme. In light of this the d irectors have concluded that any share based 
payments charge arising in 2017 are not material and therefore not accounted for it.

£178,000 (31 december 2016: £882,000), have been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income.
All transactions with related parties were on an arm’s length basis.

31 Reconciliation of non-IFRS financial KPIs
t he Group uses a number of key performance indicators to monitor the performance of its business. t his n ote 
reconciles these key performance indicators to individual lines in the financial statements.
In the directors’ view it is important to consider the underlying performance of the business during the year. 
t herefore the directors have used certain Alternative performance Measures (ApMs) which are not IFRs -compliant 
metrics. t he main effect has been that the exceptional items relating to the Ipo in March 2017 have been excluded 
from the ApMs. t he ApMs are consistent with those established within the Ipo prospectus and the prior year 
annual report. It is the directors’ intention to monitor and reassess the appropriateness of the ApMs in future years.

32 Accounting policies
t he financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards including 
Financial Reporting standard 101, the Financial Reporting standard Applicable in the u K and Republic of Ireland 
(FRs 101), and the companies Act 2006. t he financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis 
under the historical cost convention, modified to include certain items at fair value. t he financial statements are 
prepared in sterling which is the functional currency of the c ompany.
Exemptions
t he directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the c ompanies Act 2006  
and not presented a profit and loss account for the c ompany alone. In addition, the directors have taken 
exemption from providing a cash flow statement and financial instruments disclosures as these are provided  
within the Group accounts.
In preparing these financial statements the c ompany has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions conferred 
by FRs 101. therefore, these c ompany financial statements do not include: 
• A statement of cash flows and related notes 
• t he requirements of IAs 24 related party disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered in to 
between two or more members of the group as they are wholly owned within the group 
• t he effect of future accounting standards not adopted 
• disclosure of key management personnel compensation 
• disclosure in respect of financial instruments (other than disclosures required as a result of recording financial 
instruments at fair value)
• s hare based payment disclosures required under IFRs 2
Going concern
t he directors of Medica Group plc have assessed the current financial position of the Group, along with future cash 
flow requirements, to determine if the Group has the financial resources to continue as a going concern for the 
foreseeable future. t he directors of Medica Group plc have concluded that it is appropriate that Medica Group plc 
be considered a going concern. For this reason, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. t he financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result in the going 
concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.
Investments
Investments are recognised initially at fair value which is normally the transaction price excluding transaction costs. 
s ubsequently, they are measured at cost less impairment.
Financial instruments
s ee n ote 3.11 of the Group accounts.
Share capital and reserves
s hare capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
s hare premium includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the 
issuing of shares are deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period retained profits or losses. t hey also include charges related 
to share based employee remuneration.
dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in ‘other liabilities’ when the dividends have 
been approved in a general meeting prior to the reporting date.
Significant judgements and estimates
t he directors review annually whether there have been any indicators of impairment of investments. Where an 
impairment indicator is identified an impairment test is carried out by comparing the carrying of the assets with its 
recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or 
loss.
33 Directors and employees
t he directors and other key management personnel were the only employees of the c ompany during the year. t he 
disclosures in respect of key management personnel have been provided in n ote 12 of the Group financial 
statements.
