Commenting on the results, Tom Burnet, Executive Chairman of accesso, said:  
 
“This has been another strong year. We continue to execute on our strategy with precision and focus, and we are continuing to see the 
rewards.  
 
Our financial performance was ahead of our expectations, and our resilience as a global business is becoming more evident. Our clients 
are increasingly seeing the benefit we bring to their customers, and in turn their own profitability. This is evidenced by today’s results 
with another profitable period for our own growth at Accesso. 
 
We have pushed boundaries this year as we continued to focus on investment, building and improving our business, and finding new 
ways to support the digital customer journey. Two important strategic acquisitions present us with many more opportunities, and we 
are excited about the new markets they open up for us as well as how they can support our existing customer base.  
 
I am excited by where we are as an organisation, and I see enormous growth opportunities in our future.” 
 
Commenting on the results, Steve Brown, Chief Executive Officer of accesso, said: 
 
“These results speak to the quality of our technology and our ability to create innovative solutions for our customers. Ensuring the 
quality of our product offering in terms of both functionality and security remains a key part of our ongoing plan and we will invest 
behind our platform to make certain of our continued leadership in this area. 
 
The acquisitions we made in 2017 have both broadened and strengthened our offering, and our approach to M&A reflects our continued 
ambition to bring the best technology, people and ideas to Accesso. 
 
Having decided to step down from my role as CEO, I know I am leaving the Group in fantastic hands. Accesso has an extremely bright 
future ahead with Paul Noland at the helm.”

Chairman’s Statement 
 
Redefining the guest journey 
 
2017 was another year of growth and expansion for accesso as we integrated new acquisitions, rolled-out market-leading technology 
and won new business across the world. At the heart of our success remains our focus on the digital guest journey: helping our 
customers improve their guests’ experience and in turn driving increased revenues. From the initial online research and buying decision 
to arrival and at the attraction itself, to the feedback and follow-up processes operators use to better understand their customers, 
accesso’s technology continues to help clients upgrade the experiences they can offer. Our ambition to support the largest operators 
has taken our business to every corner of the globe and it is pleasing to see that our solutions are as applicable in different geographies 
as they are across a number of vertical markets is being proven as we expand.    
 
The year’s financial results reflect the progress being made across the business. During the year we delivered revenue of $133.4m up 
from $102.5m last year, while operating profit was $9.2m in 2017, from $10.5m in 2016, as the income statement absorbed the 
acquisition expenses of the two acquisitions made in the period and ongoing non-cash charges related to the acquisition strategy that 
the Group has followed over recent years. More importantly, adjusted EBITDA was $24.6m up from $19.1m, which is more 
representative of the Group’s underlying performance. These revenue and adjusted EBITDA numbers translate into 30.1% and 28.8% 
growth respectively, indicating our ability to deliver meaningful profit from our revenue despite ongoing investment in R&D to ensure 
our product remains the best in our industry.  We are proud to have now delivered a 7-year revenue CAGR of 23.9% and a 7-year 
adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 32.2%. 
 
Broad thinking focused on solutions 
At accesso we think in terms of solutions rather than individual product lines. Over the past years, we have evolved our offering to 
include a range of complementary technologies designed to meet a wide range of client needs, and we engage with existing and 
prospective customers on this basis. We continue to increase the number of combined deployments of accesso technologies, with the 
addition of Ingresso and TE2 strengthening our hand still further.  
 
Looking through a different lens 
The range and flexibility of our solutions also makes accesso particularly well placed to expand into new and exciting industry verticals. 
We are increasingly establishing ourselves beyond our traditional theme and water park markets, making particular progress in ski and 
snow sports, cultural attractions, museums, sports stadia, live music events and many more areas where we see the opportunity to 
expand. Gradually, we have come to see our business progress more in terms of these established, adjacent and greenfield areas than 
we have in terms of our individual products in isolation. This review of our 2017 results reflects that evolution in our thinking, and lays 
out how accesso technology is helping operators in each of these three areas meet the challenges that mean the most to them.  
 
One Team 
accesso’s people are the bedrock of the Company’s success. Our culture of self-improvement and passionate innovation delivers results 
for our customers year after year, and it is our nearly 500 dedicated employees that translate the spirit of that idea into action. On 
behalf of the Board, I thank them all wholeheartedly for their efforts.  
 
Opening 2018 
accesso has started 2018 with a number of new business wins, a significant contract extension with our long-term partner Cedar Fair 
and an exciting new partnership with the Henry Ford Health System, accesso’s initial step into a material Greenfield opportunity, 
Healthcare. We have also announced that Steve Brown will be stepping down as accesso’s CEO in April 2018 to be replaced by Paul 
Noland. Steve has made an outstanding contribution to the Group since 2012 and we wish him all the very best for the future.  We are 
delighted to be welcoming Paul to accesso.  He brings a wealth of industry experience from heading up IAAPA, the largest international 
trade association for amusement facilities and attractions worldwide, a range of senior executive roles with Walt Disney Parks and 
Resorts during a 16-year tenure and at Marriott.  I am confident he is exactly the right leader for the next phase of development for 
our company and along with the rest of the Board, I’m very much looking forward to working with him.

Chief Executive’s Statement 
 
Operational Review 
accesso has once again made significant strides in 2017. We continue to win a range of business across the Group and geographic 
expansion continues at a good pace. New clients of varying size have deployed accesso technology for this first time this year, while 
on a geographic view, deployments have also gone live for the first time in India, Singapore, Thailand, Ireland, Portugal and New 
Zealand.  
 
We also continue to progress well with the rollout of technology related to our agreement with Merlin Entertainments Group Ltd 
(“Merlin”). With the majority of the initial investment required to deliver on that project now behind us, we are well placed to begin 
benefiting from the longer-term international expansion opportunities that we always envisaged would be available as a result of 
enhancing our global technology offering, establishing regional support networks and integrating with local payment and regulatory 
systems.  
 
We have also spent part of the year ensuring the smooth integration of Ingresso and TE2 into the accesso family. These acquisitions 
have improved both the breadth and impact of our offering and are already being set to work with our existing products to improve 
the range of solutions we can offer our customers.  
 
People 
We are acutely aware that our ability to attract and retain the best available talent across our organisation is vital to our ongoing 
success, and during the year we have introduced a number of initiatives with this goal in mind. We continue to expand our workforce 
to meet the growing demands of our scaling business and, our year end non-seasonal employee count, including those who joined as 
part of the acquisitions, totaled nearly 500 at the end of the year, up from 362 in 2016. To better integrate our functional teams we 
are currently combining three of our US East Coast offices into our largest office in Lake Mary, Florida, and we have also launched a 
substantial computer-based training initiative available for all staff. I want to thank the whole team for its commitment and endeavour 
during 2017, and we look forward to welcoming many more new faces in 2018.    
 
Established Verticals 
accesso sees its traditional verticals as theme and water park operators. We are proud to have many of the largest operators in this 
area as clients, deploying multiple product offerings across what remains a vital and growing part of our business.  
 
During 2017 we saw a number of positive developments in these verticals, with none more important than the continued roll out of 
accesso Prism, our state-of-the-art in-park wearable device. In May, accesso Prism was successfully installed as the backbone of the 
world’s first 100% queueless water park, bringing to life a long-held company ambition that has the potential to redefine our industry 
with long queue lines remaining the single greatest dissatisfaction metric amongst theme park attendees worldwide. The device has 
been well received across the board and was recognised as the most impactful new product globally by IAAPA at its Attractions Expo 
event in Florida in November. During the period accesso Prism also proved its ability to act as a replacement for our Qbot device in a 
number of successful trials, and we expect the device to be rolled out across large parts of our existing accesso LoQueue customer 
base over the next 12 to 24 months. We are excited about the opportunities that this should present to enhance revenue within our 
existing estate.  
 
Another important dynamic in these markets is the growing desire among some operators to move substantial parts of their guest 
bases to pre-committed season pass arrangements. Supported by accesso Passport, their ability to utilise monthly payment plans 
accelerated the trend. While the adjustment has led to certain changes in guest visitation behaviour, the strength and versatility of 
accesso Prism’s commercial model opens up a range of new in-park revenue opportunities. 
 
In addition to the continued deployment of our technology to Merlin, we were delighted to secure an agreement with Village 
Roadshow Theme Parks in Queensland, Australia, with four of their attractions now live with accesso Passport for ticketing, 
eCommerce and point-of-sale. This installation also included Ingresso to support the client’s third-party ticket distribution efforts, 
underscoring the value of our combined solution offering.  Wins like these are particularly important as we seek to broaden our reach 
in the Asia-Pacific region, which is now supported by offices and technology infrastructure in the region and provides a good example 
of our ability to add incremental new business on the back of global investments undertaken in recent years. The proportion of our 
queuing revenues coming from Europe also continues to increase and we have secured a commitment to add the Qsmart mobile app 
to three European properties, ensuring that all of our European queueing clients can now access our services through their mobile 
device.  
 
Adjacent Verticals 
The acquisitions of accesso Siriusware and accesso ShoWare supported both our technology offering within our established vertical 
and provided the impetus for accesso to break out beyond its traditional markets into new verticals including ski resorts, cultural 
attractions, tours and live event ticketing. Our ambition is to increase penetration in these areas and we were able to make excellent 
progress against this aim during 2017. 
 
accesso ShoWare continued to make excellent strides adding 55 new customers during the period, with 38 coming from North America 
and 17 coming from Latin America. Among these new customers were Welk Resorts, a collection of premiere destination and travel 
resorts in California; SLS Las Vegas, a luxury boutique hotel and Casino; Charleston Battery, a football club from South Carolina; and 
Museo Anahuacalli, a museum in Coyocan, Mexico. Also in Mexico, accesso Siriusware secured its largest ever agreement with 
Experiencias Xcaret, which is rolling out 400 salespoints across its 6 luxury ecotourism venues. accesso Siriusware also won its second 
European contract during the period with Watercourse Distillery Limited in Ireland, which owns the Jameson whiskey brand. This   accesso Technology Group plc 
7 
 
Chief Executive’s Statement (continued) 
 
represented a joint win with accesso Passport, which also is now used by the NFL Experience in Times Square, New York and The CNN 
Studio Tour in Atlanta, Georgia. 
 
Within accesso ShoWare we continue to make good progress in the live event ticketing space, supporting concerts given by Ed Sheeran, 
Bruno Mars, John Mayer, Green Day and Jack Johnson among others during the period. We also rolled out our complete solution for 
Toluca FC and its new 31,000 seat football stadium.  
 
Greenfield Opportunities  
Last year’s acquisitions of Ingresso and TE2 have brought a range of new capability to accesso and, in addition to supporting our 
product offerings in our existing verticals, have enabled the Group to make its first steps into a new set of entirely greenfield areas 
including London’s West End Theatre market and the Healthcare space.  
 
With Ingresso as part of our offering, we are now able to tap in to the vast third-party distribution market, helping our clients find new 
routes to buyers for their tickets while increasing the platform’s ability to serve its existing clients by significantly enhancing the range 
of inventory it can access. We have established connectivity between Ingresso and pre-existing accesso systems and the initial accesso 
clients’ inventory is now available via Ingresso’s global distribution system. This acquisition has also helped us reach further into 
London’s fragmented West End Theatre market and will, over time, allow accesso to exploit the significant inefficiencies that exist 
within the travel and leisure industry.  
 
Ingresso delivered calendar year-on-year growth of 67%, achieved with a strong showing across all its major channels and we continue 
to invest in their distribution technology paying particular attention to its high-volume, high-speed sale capabilities. Whilst our 
distribution partner, Amazon, announced post-period end that they are discontinuing their ticketing distribution business, we have 
been delighted to welcome major customer wins from Ticketmaster UK and Superbreak.com, a major UK tour operator. We see 
broader future opportunity with the focus we have made on integrating with our other accesso offerings and facilitating access to the 
wide range of third-party distribution channels that are important to our customers. As the distribution landscape continues to evolve 
and modernise, a key part of our strategy is to underpin our core ticketing technologies with multi-point distribution capabilities and 
Ingresso provides that critical infrastructure and know-how. 
 
The July acquisition of TE2 enables accesso to offer highly personalised user experiences to our customers, leveraging data-led insights 
to capture, model and anticipate guest behaviour and preferences. As previously reported, TE2 has performed well ahead of its 
business plan since acquisition, generating greater than expected levels of non-recurring services revenue and operating with lower 
costs than expected. We have made significant progress with the integration of our HR, payroll and sales & marketing teams and have 
focused on a range of product integrations initially with accesso Passport. We expect to see tangible signs of progress on this combined 
offering later in 2018.  
 
After the period end we also announced a significant win for TE2 with the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS), a six-hospital system in 
Detroit, Michigan. HFHS will leverage TE2 to digitalise and personalise the entire patient journey, using its technology to build unique 
patient profiles which can be easily integrated with existing electronic medical records. This process will enable healthcare providers 
to offer convenient and frictionless experiences in real-time, with features such as wayfinding support, concierge services, smartphone 
bill-payments and patient feedback and communication. This groundbreaking partnership will begin with technology pilots in Autumn 
2018, in preparation for full launch to coincide with the grand opening of the Brigitte Harris Cancer Pavilion, the new home of the 
Henry Ford Cancer Institute, expected in 2020.   
 
This agreement marks a bold new step for accesso beyond the leisure, entertainment and cultural markets that has been its home, 
and provides a significant endorsement of the versatility and range of technology within the Group’s portfolio.  
 
Investing in technology 
accesso aspires to be the premier technology solutions provider to the verticals it serves. To maintain this position, we continue to 
invest heavily to expand the functionality, effectiveness and robustness of our technology across our full range of offerings. In addition 
to development work carried out during the period on accesso Prism and a range of longer-term initiatives to support our growth into 
the future, 2017 saw a host of significant enhancements to our platforms. 
 
In particular, we continue to invest in readying our products for the international expansion driving our growth. During the year we 
introduced localised user-interface elements that now allows for distribution of accesso Passport in 20 languages, and added enhanced 
support for Global Sales Tax configuration including tax tiers, tax percentages and GL code linking. We also expanded our support of 
alternative payment solutions, added true-multi-language support for accesso Siriusware and opened a new datacentre in Sydney.  
 
In accesso Passport we launched Passport Exchange: our new platform enabling fully integrated third-party ticket sales, and introduced 
a full-featured API for clients desiring more direct integration. Through a new booking portal, we also now offer service management 
of date and time-based tickets helping to mitigate risk for whose operations may be impacted by cancellations due to weather or other 
external factors. 
 
We also continued to improve our accesso ShoWare product, enhancing our dynamic pricing capability, completing an important 
PayPal integration including PayPal Credits, improving event messaging technology and seatmap wizards. 
 
  accesso Technology Group plc

Chief Executive’s Statement (continued) 
 
Information Security 
Another increasingly important element of our business relates to information security, which is at the heart of all development 
decisions. The business continues to focus increasing levels of resource and technology on initiatives to ensure data minimization, 
more robust monitoring of our applications, enhanced response capabilities and increased staff training across the whole business. 
 
The start of 2018 
accesso is pleased to report that the Group is showing good momentum at the start of 2018. We look forward to a promising year 
ahead.  
 
Financial Review 
accesso continues to deliver strong financial performance as a result of our increasingly global revenue base and diversified product 
portfolio. Our business continues to be driven forward by long term transaction-based agreements with several of the world’s leading 
operators that deliver high-quality and highly-visible revenue underpinned by long-term relationships.  
 
Alternative Performance Measures 
The Board utilises consistent alternative performance measures (“APMs”) in evaluating and presenting the results of the business. 
APMs include adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating profit, adjusted administrative expenses, adjusted net debt, and adjusted cash from 
operations. A reconciliation of these measures from IFRS is provided below. 
 
The Board views these APMs as more representative of the Group’s performance as they remove certain items which are not reflective 
of the underlying business, including acquisition expenses, amortisation related to acquired intangibles, deferred and contingent 
payments related to acquisitions, changes to earn-out considerations and share-based payments. The APMs help ensure the Group is 
focused on translating sales growth into profit. By making these adjustments, the Group is more readily comparable against a business 
that does not have the same acquisition history and share-based payment policy. Additionally, these are the measures commonly used 
by the Group’s investor base. 
 
Key Financial Metrics 
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 was $133.4m, an increase of 30.1% on the previous year’s result of $102.5m, 
benefitting from our increased global footprint, the broader range of markets we now serve and the acquisition of Ingresso at the end 
of March and TE2 in July. This growth was delivered despite challenging weather events impacting certain clients, an earthquake in 
Mexico City, unprecedented forest fires in California and to a lesser extent, European terror-related incidents. The impact of foreign 
exchange movements on revenue, or costs, was not material. 
 
accesso tracks a number of specific operational metrics that influence Group revenue as follows: 
 
• Total transactional ticket sales, including Ingresso distribution, increased 20.2%, with like for like increasing 14.8% 
• Total ticket volumes, processed via our hosted solutions, increased 30.9%, exceeding 100m for the first time. On a like for 
like basis the increase was 28.0% 
• North America now accounts for 70% of eCommerce ticket volume (2016: 89%), with Europe accelerating to 25% (2016: 9%) 
• 42% of eCommerce volume now takes place via a mobile device (2016: 35%) 
• accesso LoQueue like for like attendance data was broadly flat 
 
The gross profit margin in 2017 was 55.0%, compared to 54.0% in 2016, reflecting the improvement in our mix of revenue towards 
higher margin offerings and a higher level of non-recurring services revenues than in the comparative period. 
 
We estimate that for the full year 81% (2016: 91%) of Group revenue is repeatable in nature. This represents the proportion of Group 
revenue that is derived on a transactional basis plus annual support and annual license revenue. The decrease from 2016 is largely 
driven by the acquisition of TE2, which currently derives the majority of its revenues from professional services, but remains at a level 
that gives the Board the continued confidence to innovate to extend our product leadership and provides the opportunity to 
outperform revenue expectations through winning new business.  
 
Adjusted EBITDA and operating profit 
Adjusted EBITDA of $24.6m was up from $19.1m, an increase of 28.8%. Operating Profit for 2017 was $9.2m (2016: $10.5m), while 
adjusted operating profit, which the Board considers a key underlying metric, was $19.1m in 2017, equating to 21.7% growth when 
compared to 2016 ($15.7m). Our adjusted operating margin was 14.3% for 2017 (2016: 15.3%) but as previously identified, the Board 
maintains its view that there is potential for future improvement in this metric as the Group benefits from the step-down in investment 
across the business to support the global rollout. 
 
The tables below set out a reconciliation between Operating profit and adjusted EBITDA:

Operating profit  9,241  10,512 
Add: Acquisition expenses  1,249  - 
Add: Deferred and contingent payments  2,131  - 
Add: Amortisation related to acquired intangibles  8,591  4,227

Add: Amortisation and depreciation (excluding acquired intangibles)  5,531  3,387 
Adjusted EBITDA  24,604  19,113 
 
Administrative expenses were up 43.3% to $64.2m (2016: $44.8m). Adjusted administrative expenses reflect the adjusting items shown 
in the table above were $48.9m, representing an increase of 35.1% on 2016 ($36.2m) and driven primarily by a continued increase in 
headcount and operational infrastructure to support our short and medium term growth, and by the acquisition of Ingresso and TE2 
in March and July respectively.   
 
The table below sets out a reconciliation between the statutory and adjusted measure: 
 
  2017  2016 
  $000  $000 
Administrative expenses  64,204  44,813 
Net adjustments detailed above  (15,363)  (8,601) 
Adjusted administrative expenses  48,841  36,212 
 
Profit before tax of $7.2m was down from $10.1m in 2016 as the income statement absorbed the increase in non-cash charges related 
to the acquisition strategy that the Group has followed over recent years, together with the acquisition expenses incurred in the period. 
 
Profit after tax of $9.9m (2016: $7.5m) is after a tax credit for the year ended 31 December 2017 of $2.7m. Tax is covered in more 
detail below and within note 10. 
 
As a result, earnings per share (basic) were 40.83 cents for 2017, an increase of 20.3% on 2016 (33.95 cents). Adjusted earnings per 
share, were 56.73 cents for 2017, an increase of 10.2% on 2016 (51.48 cents). 
 
These results reflect a well-optimised and efficient group capable of delivering sustainable profit expansion while continuing to execute 
on its shorter-term commitments and heavily investing in its future. As time goes on, accesso expects earnings expansion ahead of top 
line growth as the business benefits from improving operating leverage as a result of investments made in products, including accesso 
Prism.  
 
Total R&D expenditure during 2017 of $20.0m, (2016: $17.9m) represents 15.0% of revenues (2016: 17.5%). The slight step down in 
this percentage from 2016, reflects the heavy initial investment in accesso Prism in 2016 and leads us on a track towards what we 
expect will be a normalised rate on an ongoing basis. Capitalised development expenditure was $12.4m (2016: $11.7m) representing 
62.0% (2016: 65.4%) of total R&D expenditure. The net benefit of development capitalisation less related amortisation, fell to $8.2m 
from $9.8m in 2016.  
 
Net debt and cash flow 
Our closing net cash balance of $12.5m (2016 net debt: $3.4m), includes balances of approximately $5.5m in respect of cash paid back 
to the Group by the sellers of TE2 to make payments to employees in lieu of a pre-acquisition option scheme over a three year period. 
In addition, cash balances totaling approximately $11.0m are held by the Group to make near term settlements to venue operators in 
respect of the Ingresso platform. 
 
These balances are beneficially owned by the Group but, while there are no restrictions on their use, they have been excluded from 
our current definition of net debt. Adjusting for these items offers an adjusted net debt position of $4.0m at 31 December 2017. 
 
Cash generated from operations of $33.1m (2016: $18.6) includes the benefit of these TE2 and Ingresso balances, and is after 
acquisition related expenses. Adjusted cash generated from operations was $21.2m for the year ended 31 December 2017, per the 
table below, and was 14.0% better than in 2016 ($18.6m). This represents an underlying cash conversion from adjusted EBITDA of 
86.2% (2016: 97.4%). This cash conversion percentage remains an indication of a business with a sustainable and strong cash 
conversion cycle.

Financing costs included interest of $0.7m (2016: $0.2m) and an arrangement fee of $0.4m relating to the extension of the Group’s 
borrowing facility. 
 
Financing and investing activities 
During the year, the Group extended its borrowing facilities, and undertook a share placing in order to fund the acquisitions of Ingresso 
and TE2. 
 
The acquisition of Ingresso Group Limited in March 2017 was funded via an initial cash investment (net of cash acquired) of $18.7m.   
 
To allow for sufficient headroom, the Group extended its borrowing facility with Lloyds Bank plc. The extended Facility provides the 
Group with the ability to draw down a total of $60m, denominated in either US dollars, GB Pound Sterling or Euros, and has a term of 
four years, with an option to extend by a further twelve months at the end of the first year. The facility is at an agreed rate of 140 basis 
points above LIBOR at a borrowing to EBITDA ratio of less than 1.5 times, rising to a maximum 190 basis points if the borrowing to 
EBITDA ratio is greater than 2.25 times. It provides an additional accordion mechanism allowing for a further $10m relating to future 
acquisitions, and includes a commitment interest on undrawn funds of 35% of the relevant interest rates above. The total available for 
drawdown is subject to a reduction of US$10m on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Extended Facility. The Facility 
had an arrangement fee of $0.4m. 
 
In July 2017, the Group announced the acquisition of Blazer and Flip Flops Inc (TE2). The cash element of the acquisition costs (net of 
cash acquired) was $69.2m and was funded via an underwritten vendor and cash placing, raising gross proceeds of $75.6m. 
 
Cash balances at 31 December 2017 totaled $28.7m (including the $16.5m of ‘excluded cash’ referenced above), while borrowings at 
31 December 2017 totaled $16.1m, versus the facility of $60m.  
 
The Board believes that the Group remains in a strong financial position at the period end, with good access to debt finance on 
attractive terms. 
 
Taxation 
On a statutory basis, the Group had a tax credit of $2.7m (2016: tax expense $2.6m). This includes an initial beneficial impact to the 
Group of changes to the US tax code that were introduced via The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulting in a revaluation of US 
deferred tax assets and liabilities to incorporate the reduction in the headline federal tax rates. This resulted in a one-off credit to 
2017 earnings of $5.1m. 
 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the US tax code benefit, the Group’s effective tax rate on its underlying earnings, was 24%.  
 
The Group has for a number of years focused on tax planning that lowers its effective rate. Taking into account the relative taxable 
territories in which the Group operates, and its growth in the relative territories, together with the benefit of the reduced US income 
tax rates introduced by The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Group expects the tax rate on its adjusted earnings to be between 
21% and 23% in the short term. 
 
Dividend 
The Board maintains its consistent view that the payment of a dividend is unlikely in the short to medium term with cash more 
efficiently invested in product development and complementary M&A. 
 
Summary and Outlook 
This year has been one of significant progress at accesso, and these results reflect a business pleasing its customers, thinking about 
the future and translating its potential into financial results. While 2018 has only just begun, the Board remains confident in its 
expectations for the full year and is focused fully on delivering its growth plan.  After joining the accesso Board in 2012, I will formally 
step down in April and hand the baton to Paul Noland who I have known, trusted and worked with for more than 20 years. I can think 
of no one better suited to lead accesso through its next exciting stage of growth.

Strategic report 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 
 
Review of business 
 
The results for the period and financial position of the company and the Group are as shown in the annexed financial statements and 
explained in the Chairman’s statement and Chief Executive Officer’s statement. 
 
Principal risks and key performance indicators 
 
The Board has identified the principal risks and uncertainties which it believes may impact the Group and its operations, as well as a 
number of key performance indicators with which to measure the progress of the Group and are presented in the financial highlights 
on page 3. 
 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
 
In line with groups of a similar size, the Group is managed by a limited number of key personnel, including Executive directors and 
senior management, who have significant experience within the Group and the sectors it operates within, and who could be difficult 
to replace. Executive remuneration plans, incorporating long-term incentives, have been implemented to mitigate this risk. 
 
A key risk relates to the high concentration of revenue derived from particular customers or guests of particular theme parks groups. 
The Group continues to increase its customer base, extending its geographical presence and broadening its technologies to a wider 
range of venues. In addition, the Group continues to seek appropriate complementary acquisitions to reduce reliance on specific 
customers, sectors or geographies.   
 
The Group has a significant seasonal business with revenue and cash flows predominantly linked to leisure venue attendance which, 
with the current profile of business, peak in the summer months of the Northern Hemisphere. Attendance at leisure venues can be 
impacted by circumstances outside the control of the Group including, but not limited to, inclement weather, consumer spending 
capability within the regions we operate together with operator venue pricing, discount policies, investment capability, safety record 
and marketing. 
 
A significant proportion of revenues of the business are denominated in US dollars. Although the majority of expenditure is also 
denominated in this currency, there remains an exposure to movements between the US dollar and either sterling, euros, the 
Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso or the Canadian dollar.  
 
The Group has reviewed its operations as a result of the UK’s referendum to leave the European Union (“Brexit”). It is not expected 
that this will have a material impact on the operations or financial results of the Group given its significant operations in the US, and 
its growing global presence outside of the EU. 
 
It is of fundamental importance in maintaining a sustainable long-term business that the Group is aware and takes action to mitigate 
competitive threats, whether from technological change, or from competition. Effort is directed to ensure that the Group invests in 
appropriate and focused research and development activity and monitors technological advances and competitor activity. Linked to 
this, the Group is committed to protecting its technology by the development and/or purchase of patents and will take appropriate 
action to defend its intellectual property rights or ensure infringers enter into licensing arrangements. The Group capitalises 
appropriate levels of development expenditure but is exposed to the risk that development of a specific technology could suffer 
impairment. 
 
Key performance indicators and alternative performance measures 
 
Key performance indicators are used to measure and control both financial and operational performance. Ticket volumes, revenues, 
margins, costs, cash and sales pipeline are trended to ensure plans are on track and corrective actions taken where necessary. See the 
Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 6-10 for a discussion of the metrics. Product development performance is also monitored and 
tracked through measurement against agreed milestones. In addition, further key performance indicators include the proportion of 
business that is delivered via mobile technology and the sales mix of services offered. 
 
The Board utilizes consistent alternative performance measures (“APMs”) in evaluating and presenting the results of the business, 
including adjusted EBITDA, adjusting operating profit and repeatable revenue. A reconciliation of these measures from IFRS, along with 
their definition, is provided below. 
 
The Board views these APMs as more representative of the Group’s performance as they remove certain items which are not reflective 
of the underlying business, including acquisition expenses, amortisation related to acquired intangibles, deferred and contingent 
payments related to acquisitions, changes to earn-out considerations and share-based payments. The APMs help ensure the Group is 
focused on translating sales growth into profit. By making these adjustments, the Group is more readily comparable against a business 
that does not have the same acquisition history and share-based payment policy. Additionally, these are the measures commonly used 
by the Group’s investor base.

deferred and contingent payments, profit recognised on the reduction of the earn-out liability, and costs related to share-based 
payments 
• Adjusted EBITDA: operating profit before the deduction of amortisation, depreciation, acquisition costs, deferred and 
contingent payments, profit recognised on the reduction of the earn-out liability, and costs related to share-based payments 
• Adjusted administrative expenses: Administrative expenses adjusted for the items in adjusted operating profit 
• Repeatable revenue: transactional revenue that the Group would expect to occur every year from a current customer without a 
new customer being acquired; for example, ecommerce income (see page 8) 
• Adjusted EPS: earnings per share after adjusting operating profit for amortisation on acquired intangibles, deferred and 
contingent payments, profit recognised on the reduction of the earn-out liability, acquisition costs, finance charges relating to 
refinance for acquisition purposes and share-based payments, net of tax at the effective rate for the period (see page 48) 
 
Risk management and internal control 
 
The Board is satisfied that the Group’s risk management and internal control systems are adequate. At this stage the Board do not 
consider it to be appropriate to establish an internal audit function.

Report of the directors (continued) 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 
 
Annual general meeting 
 
The annual general meeting of the company will be held on Tuesday, 22nd May 2018. The notice convening the meeting is enclosed 
with these financial statements. 
 
Branch registration 
 
The company operates a branch in Germany. 
 
Corporate governance  
 
The Board of directors comprises three Executive directors, one of whom is the Chairman, and three independent Non-Executive 
directors. The company holds board meetings regularly throughout the year at which financial and other reports are considered. The 
Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets and major items of expenditure.  
 
The committees of the Board 
 
The following committees have been established to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities: 
 
Audit committee 
 
The members of the Audit Committee are David Gammon, who chairs the committee, John Weston and Karen Slatford. 
 
The committee met three times during the year to fulfil its duties. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
external auditor attended meetings by invitation. 
 
The committee is comprised of independent Non-Executive directors only and its terms of reference are to promote appropriate 
standards of integrity, financial reporting, risk management and internal controls. This committee is responsible for overseeing the 
involvement of the Group’s auditor in the planning and review of the Group’s financial statements, any other formal announcements 
relating to the Group’s financial performance, for recommending the appointment and fees of its auditor, and for discussing with the 
auditor the findings of the audit and issues arising from the audit. It reviews the Group’s compliance with accounting, legal and listing 
requirements. It is also responsible, along with the Board, for reviewing the effectiveness of the systems of internal control. The 
committee considers the independence and objectivity of the auditors with regard to the way in which they conduct their audit duties. 
 
The committee looks to ensure that the auditor’s independence is not compromised by their undertaking of non-audit services.  
 
Non-audit/tax advisory services are benchmarked by management to ensure value for money, auditor objectivity and independence 
of advice. 
 
The Audit Committee’s recommendation is that KPMG LLP be appointed as the company’s auditor and an appropriate resolution will 
be put before the shareholders at this year’s annual general meeting. 
 
Remuneration committee 
 
The members of the Remuneration Committee are John Weston, David Gammon, and Karen Slatford, who chairs the committee. 
 
The full committee met three times during the year to fulfil its duties. The committee considers and approves specific remuneration 
packages for each Executive director. In accordance with guidelines set by the Board, the committee determines the Group’s policy on 
remuneration of senior executives and the operation of share option schemes, the grant of options, and the implementation and 
operation of other long-term incentive arrangements. Remuneration of Non-Executive directors is set by the Executive directors. 
 
It is considered that the composition and size of the Board does not warrant the appointment of a nominations committee and 
appointments are dealt with by the Board as a whole. The need to appoint such a committee is subject to review by the Board. 
 
Going concern 
 
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future, with an underlying business that has good revenue visibility and strong cash 
generation, continues to perform well, a confident Group outlook for 2018, and a strong balance sheet and cash position and significant 
headroom to its borrowing facility. For this reason, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

Report of the directors (continued) 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 
 
Disabled employees 
 
The Group's policy is one of equal opportunity in the selection, training, career development and promotion of staff. The Group has a 
policy not to discriminate against disabled employees for those vacancies that they are able to fill and will provide facilities, equipment 
and training to assist any disabled persons employed. 
 
All necessary assistance with initial training courses will be given. Once employed, a career plan will be developed so as to ensure 
suitable opportunities for each disabled person. Arrangements will be made, wherever possible, for re-training employees who 
become disabled to enable them to perform work identified as appropriate to their aptitudes and abilities. 
 
Employees 
 
The Group's policy is to consult and engage with employees, by way of meetings, surveys and through personal contact by directors 
and other senior executives, on matters likely to affect employees' interests. Information on matters of concern to employees is given 
in meetings, handouts, letters and reports, which seek to achieve a common awareness on the part of all employees on the financial 
and economic factors affecting the Group's performance. 
 
Relations with shareholders 
 
The company and Board recognise the importance of developing and maintaining good relationships with all the various categories of 
shareholders and devotes significant effort and resource in this respect. 
 
There have been regular dialogues with shareholders during the year including holding briefings with analysts and other investors, 
including staff shareholders. The company also uses the annual general meeting as an opportunity to communicate with its 
shareholders. All directors are expected to attend the annual general meeting with the chairman of the audit and remuneration 
committees being available to answer shareholders’ questions. 
 
Notice of the date of the 2018 annual general meeting is included with this report. Separate resolutions on each substantially separate 
issue, in particular any proposal relating to the annual report and accounts, will be made at the annual general meeting. 
 
Website publication 
 
The directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available on a website.  Financial 
statements are published on the company's website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions.  The maintenance and integrity of 
the company's website is the responsibility of the directors.  The directors' responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the 
financial statements contained therein. 
 
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditor  
 
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of 
which the Group's auditor is unaware, and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to 
make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group's auditor is aware of that information.  
 
Auditor 
 
A resolution approving the re-appointment of KPMG LLP will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting.

Remuneration of the Executive Directors is designed to ensure that the Group achieves its potential and increases shareholder value. 
In respect of all aspects of the Executives remuneration package, the objective is to ensure that the Group attracts and retains high 
calibre Executives with the skills, experience and motivation necessary to direct and manage the affairs of the Group.  
 
Base remuneration consists of salary, retirement benefits and other benefits, such as the provision of medical and life insurance 
arrangements. In terms of retirement benefits, the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer are all entitled 
to receive a payment in lieu of a pension or a matching contribution to a retirement scheme operated by a Group company. 
 
In addition, annual bonuses and Long-Term Incentive Programs (LTIPs) are seen as an important element of each Director’s total 
remuneration and are designed to drive and reward exceptional performance.  
 
The Remuneration Committee 
 
The Board has appointed a remuneration committee consisting of independent non-executive directors John Weston, David Gammon 
and Karen Slatford, who chairs the committee. The committee takes regard of the return to the shareholders in its deliberations. It 
reviews the performance of the executive directors, sets their remuneration, considers the grant of options under any of the share 
option scheme and ensures that the Executive Directors are properly rewarded and motivated. In addition, they provide guidance on 
pay and conditions for other employees in the Group. The Remuneration Committee meets on an “as required” basis. 
 
The Remuneration Committee reviews remuneration of the Executives in light of market conditions, performance and developments 
in good corporate governance, whilst taking account of the Company’s status as a larger AIM company. Remuneration is benchmarked 
against similar listed companies and takes into account company performance and any increase in scale and complexity, the role, 
experience and performance of the individual Director, and average workforce salary adjustments within the Company. 
 
Executive Directors are entitled to be considered for the grant of awards under a Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The over-riding 
objective of this plan is to drive and reward exceptional performance, while aligning the interests of Executives and shareholders. 
The awards currently take the form of nominal cost options over a specified number of Ordinary Shares. Awards are released to 
participants after a performance period of three years, subject to certain performance and service conditions being met. The LTIP 
rewards the future performance of the Executive Directors and certain other employees by linking the size of the award to the 
achievement of Group performance targets. Participation is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and will typically be 
made annually based on a percentage of annual salary.  
 
The Remuneration Committee will make LTIP awards at a level they believe is consistent with its underlying objective to attract and 
retain high calibre Executives. The maximum annual award permissible under the plan is 200% of salary. The performance conditions 
for the LTIP scheme are normally related to the achievement of stringent compound share price growth rates from the date of the 
award. The specific performance conditions related to each award that has been made are set out within this report.  
 
Performance and decisions on remuneration taken in 2017  
 
Salaries are normally reviewed annually, in March, and any change applied retrospectively to the beginning of the year. In light of the 
criteria presented above, the Remuneration Committee determined, from 1 January 2017, to increase the salary of the Executive 
Chairman by 2.75% to £298,488, to increase the salary of the CEO by 2.75% to $359,624 and to increase the salary of the CFO by 5% 
to $313,250. 
 
The Company produced strong financial results for the 2017 financial year with adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) 10.2% above the 
prior year and basic EPS 20.3% higher and the Group completed two important strategic acquisitions.   
 
For 2017, the bonus awarded to the Executive Chairman and CEO was 120% (maximum: 150%) of base pay and for the CFO was 100% 
(maximum: 120%) of base pay.  
 
During 2017 the first awards of share options under the Shareholder Approved 2014 LTIP Scheme also matured.  The target CAGR for 
full vesting of LTIPs issued in 2014 was 15% per year over 3 years. This target has been substantially exceeded and, therefore, 100% of 
the options granted have vested. No additional awards were made to the Executive Directors in 2017.

Employee benefit trust share subscription and Tom Burnet equity incentive plan  
 
On 10 March 2011, the Remuneration Committee of the Board recommended, and the Board approved, an incentive arrangement 
pursuant to which the company lent its employee benefit trust (‘’EBT’’) £1,331,956, and the EBT subscribed for 853,818 new ordinary 
shares of 1 penny each in the company (‘’New Ordinary Shares’’).

Directors’ remuneration report (continued) 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 
 
The EBT plan subsequently granted Tom Burnet an interest in the growth in value above a share price of £2 per share in the New 
Ordinary Shares. Cash reserves of the Group will not be impacted when this is realised. In addition, the EBT granted Tom Burnet an 
option to acquire, in relation to half of the New Ordinary Shares (426,909), the EBT’s interest in the value between £1.30 and £2, 
provided that at the date of exercise the share price is above £1.82. 
 
On 5 April 2016, Tom Burnet terminated his interest in 426,909 of the New Ordinary Shares and the EBT subsequently disposed of 
these in order to settle its obligations relating to the value above £2. The remaining shares are registered in the name of Lo-Q (Trustees) 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. John Alder and David Gammon are the directors of Lo-Q (Trustees) Limited. 
 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Awards 
 
There have been three awards to the executive Directors since the introduction of the LTIP scheme in 2014. The performance 
conditions are identical for each executive director subject to the award. No awards were made during the year ended 31 December 
2017.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements 
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.   
 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.  Under that 
law they have elected to prepare both the group and the parent company financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and applicable law.   
 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.  In preparing each of the group 
and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:   
 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;   
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable;   
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;   
• assess the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and   
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.   
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.  They are responsible for such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Independent 
auditor’s report  
to the members of accesso Technology Group plc   
 
1. Our opinion is unmodified

Technology Group plc (“the Company”) for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, 
Company Statement of Financial Position, 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow, Company 
Statement of Cash Flow, Statement of Changes in 
Group Equity, Statement of Changes in Company 
Equity and the related notes, including the accounting 
policies in note 2.   
In our opinion:   
— the financial statements give a true and fair view 
of the state of the Group’s and of the parent 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of 
the Group’s profit for the year then ended;   
— the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);   
— the parent Company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; 
and   
— the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.   
Basis for opinion   
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) 
and applicable law.  Our responsibilities are described 
below.  We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
under, and are independent of the Group in 
accordance with, UK ethical requirements including 
the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team.  These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  In arriving at our audit 
opinion above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows: 
 
 
The risk Our response 
Valuation of acquisition 
intangibles (Ingresso and TE2) 
 
($41.9m, 2016: $nil) 
 
Refer to page 39 (accounting 
policy) and pages 52 to 57 
(financial disclosures). 
Subjective valuation 
 
The group acquired Ingresso in March 
2017 for $28.3m and TE2 in July 2017 
for $74.3m. The assets and liabilities 
acquired have been measured at their 
acquisition-date fair values and 
previously unrecognised intangible 
assets recognised on the balance sheet. 
The identification and measurement of 
these intangible assets requires 
judgment and the application of complex 
valuation techniques. Acquisition 
intangibles are also valued using cash 
flow models and therefore the 
recoverable amount is subjective due to 
the inherent uncertainty involved in 
forecasting and discounting future cash 
flows. 
Our procedures included:  
 
— Methodology choice: Involving our 
own valuation specialists to assess 
whether the valuation methodology 
applied to each asset was appropriate; 
— Benchmarking assumptions: 
Comparing the key assumptions used 
in the cash flow and replacement cost 
models to externally available industry 
data or post-acquisition results. For 
replacement cost models the key 
assumptions are those relating to cost 
inputs and the relevant mark ups 
applied and for cash flow models, 
attrition and gross margin; 
— Assessing transparency: We 
assessed whether the group’s 
disclosures of the critical judgments 
reflected the risks inherent in the 
valuation of these intangible assets.

The risk Our response 
Recoverability of group goodwill 
and of parent’s investment in 
subsidiaries 
(Group: $117.3m; 2016: $43.9m; 
Parent: $73.4m; 2016: $37.8m) 
 
Refer to page 39 (accounting 
policy) and pages 52 to 57 
(financial disclosures). 
Forecast-based valuation 
 
Goodwill in the group and the carrying 
amount of the parent company’s 
investments in subsidiaries are 
significant and recoverability is 
dependent on achieving sufficient levels 
of future cash flows. These assets relate 
to businesses located in highly 
competitive markets resulting in pricing 
pressures which may impact future cash 
flows. The estimated recoverable 
amount is therefore highly subjective 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved 
in forecasting and discounting future 
cash flows.  
Our procedures included:  
 
— Benchmarking assumptions: 
Comparing the assumptions used in 
cash flow forecasts to externally 
derived data in relation to key inputs 
such as long term growth and inputs to 
discount rates. Inputs to discount rate 
include risk free rates, size premium 
and market risk premium; 
— Historical comparisons: Comparing 
previous forecast revenue growth and 
EBITDA margins to actual performance 
to assess the historical accuracy of the 
group’s forecasting; 
— Sensitivity analysis: Performing 
breakeven analysis on the key 
assumptions noted above, including 
discount rate and projected cash flows; 
— Assessing transparency: We 
considered whether the group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the 
outcome of the impairment 
assessment to changes in key 
assumptions reflected the risks 
inherent in the valuation of goodwill. 
We also assessed the adequacy of the 
parent company’s disclosures in 
respect of the investment in 
subsidiaries.

The risk Our response 
Capitalised development costs 
 
(Costs capitalised in the year 
$12.4m, 2016: $11.6m) 
 
Refer to page 39 (accounting 
policy) and pages 52 to 57 
(financial disclosures). 
Subjective estimate 
 
Eligible employment costs in respect of 
software developers working to develop 
new software products are capitalised if 
they meet the relevant criteria, which 
materially impacts the groups’ 
profitability. 
There is judgement involved in 
determining whether costs incurred 
meet the criteria for capitalisation as the 
future financial and technical feasibility 
of new products is often uncertain. 
There is also judgment required to 
identify those costs that are directly 
attributable to development projects 
from those that relate to speculative 
R&D and bug fixes.  
Our procedures included:  
 
— Tests of detail: For a sample of 
projects we assessed the allocation of 
time to development projects with 
reference to the developers’ 
timesheets; 
— Test of detail: For a sample of 
development projects where costs 
were capitalised we corroborated the 
directors’ analysis that the projects 
met the criteria for capitalisation by 
comparing to sales forecasts and 
obtaining evidence of the project being 
technically feasible; 
— Assessing transparency: We 
assessed the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the 
judgements made in relation to 
capitalised development costs. 
 
 
 
 
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at $360,000 (2016: $465,000), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of group profit before tax normalised to exclude acquisition related costs, deferred and contingent payments and profit 
recognised on reduction of earn out liability incurred in the year, of $8,280,000 (2016: $10,102,000, of which it represents 4.3% 
(2016: 5%).  
 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at $149,000 (2016: $131,000), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of parent company revenue, of which it represents 1% (2016: 5% of profit before tax). 
   
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding $18,000 (2016: 
$23,000), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.   
 
Of the group’s 18 (2016: 12) reporting components, we subjected 6 (2016: 3) to full scope audits for group purposes and 0 (2016: 
1) to an audit of account balances. The components for which we performed an audit of account balances in 2016 were not 
individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes in the prior year, but did present specific 
individual risks that needed to be addressed. 
 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.   
For the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were 
no significant risks of material misstatement within these.   
 
The work on all 6 of the components (2016: all 4 of the components), including the audit of the parent company, was performed by 
the group team. Component materiality ranged from $100,000 to $200,000 (2016: $150,000 to $250,000), subject to the mix of 
size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The group team performed procedures on the items excluded from 
normalised group profit before tax.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 
 
1. Reporting entity 
 
accesso Technology Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom, whose shares are publicly 
traded on the AIM market. The company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Unit 5, The Pavilions, 
Ruscombe Park, Twyford, Berkshire RG10 9NN. These consolidated financial statements comprise the company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).  
 
The Group's principal activities are the development and application of ticketing, mobile and eCommerce technologies, and 
licensing and operation of virtual queuing solutions for the attractions and leisure industry. The eCommerce technologies 
are generally licensed to operators of venues, enabling the online sale of tickets, guest management, and point-of-sale 
(“POS”) transactions. The virtual queuing solutions are installed by the Group at a venue, and managed and operated by the 
Group directly or licensed to the operator for their operation. 
 
2. Significant accounting policies 
 
Basis of accounting 
 
The Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as 
adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”). 
 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. The policies have 
been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.  
 
New standards that have been adopted during the period 
 
•  Annual improvements to IFRSs 
• IAS 16 and 38: Amendments to Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation  
•  IAS 27: Amendments related to Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 
• IAS 11: Amendments relating to Acquisitions of Interest in Joint Operations 
• IAS 7: Amendments related to Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture  
 
The adoption of the above has not had a material impact on the financial statements during the period ended 31 December 
2017. 
 
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
 
A number of new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations are not effective for 2017, and therefore have 
not been applied in preparing these accounts. The effective dates shown are for periods commencing on the date quoted. 
 
•  IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for year ending 31 December 2018) 
•  IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for year ending 31 December 2018) 
•  IFRS 16 Leases (effective for year ending 31 December 2019) 
•  Annual improvements to IFRSs  
 
Management have been considering the impact IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 will have on the Group’s financial statements in the period 
of initial application, and its review is still in process. 
 
Management is currently starting its assessment of the impact of IFRS 16 on the Group’s financial statements, but has not 
yet completed its assessment of the impact on the financial statements. The assessment is ongoing. 
 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
 
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much, and when revenue is recognized. It 
replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, and IAS 11 Construction Contracts. 
 
The following areas are those management anticipate may have the greatest impact or are the most judgemental under the 
new standard: 
 
Queuing revenue 
The Group has developed virtual queuing technology which enables guests to virtually queue using proprietary software and 
hardware. The technology is installed in theme parks under agreement with the theme park operator. Revenue is earned as 
guests use the product while visiting the park and is recognised on either a gross or net basis, when the Group is acting as 
the principal or agent, respectively. 
  accesso Technology Group plc

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 
 
Significant accounting policies (continued) 
 
Currently where revenue is recognised on a gross basis, the group recognise the entire fee payable by the park guest and 
recognises costs payable to the theme park operator.  Where revenue is recognised on a net basis the group recognises only 
a portion of the fee payable by the park guest representing the services provided by the group to the theme park operator 
 
The factors in determining whether the Group is acting as principal or agent in the transaction are different under IFRS 15 
than current guidance, and reflect who has control over the good or service prior to delivery to the end customer. 
 
In some agreements, management considers that the technology, hardware, and virtual queue provided to the end customer 
are controlled by the Group prior to transfer to the end customer. Effectively, the Group has purchased the right to operate 
and control the virtual queue, and accepts responsibility for staffing the sales office and operation, maintaining the 
concession from which the product is sold, and ensuring guest satisfaction. 
 
In other agreements, management considers that the Group has passed control of the technology, hardware, and virtual 
queue to the park operator, and has minimal responsibility for the operation. The Group will be responsible for maintenance 
and support of the technology, but not take part in daily operating decisions. These agreements generally take the form of 
a licensing contract. 
 
Management is still assessing the impact on the Group. Regardless of the outcome of its review, it will not result in an impact 
to net profit, as only the classification of revenue and cost of sales are impacted. 
 
Software licenses and maintenance and technical support 
The Group sells software licenses for its guest management and POS software, which requires a large initial investment and 
yearly maintenance and technical support. Additionally, it licenses its on-site ticketing system, requiring an annual payment. 
 
In regard to the guest management and POS software, the customer is required to purchase the yearly maintenance and 
technical support to maintain an active license. The fees are typically higher in the first year, with an upfront license fee 
payable, than in subsequent years, when only the annual support fee is payable. 
 
Under IFRS 15, these types of agreements are treated as containing an option for a renewal at a discounted price – the cost 
of the yearly support – after the initial up-front purchase of the license. Accordingly, the Group will defer revenue on the 
initial license sale and recognize a portion of the up-front license payment at the time of the subsequent annual renewal. 
Where no term is agreed, the contract renews perpetually until the customer declines the yearly support, or the Group 
terminates the contract. In these circumstances, the initial fee will be spread over 5 years, which is in line with the expected 
useful life of software. 
 
For on-site ticketing licenses, the customer generally agrees to a fixed term over which it is required to pay annual 
instalments if the agreement is longer than one year. As the customer has control of the license upon delivery by the Group, 
the total amount of revenue related to the license, for the term of the agreement, will be recognized at the point of delivery. 
This will create a receivable which future annual instalment payments will be applied against. Revenue related to 
maintenance and support of the license, such as updates and technical support, will be spread over the contract term.  
 
Contract costs 
The Group pays commission on certain contracts and currently expenses the cost when incurred, unless there is a clawback 
provision. IFRS 15 requires incremental costs associated with obtaining a contract, such as commissions, be capitalised and 
amortised over the life of the contract. Accordingly, commissions will become an asset on the consolidated statement of 
financial position and tested annually for impairment. 
 
Transition 
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using the retrospective method, using the practical expedient in paragraph C5(c) of the 
standard, allowing non-disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations 
or an explanation of when the Group expects to recognize that amount as revenue for all reporting periods presented before 
the date of initial application – i.e. 1 January 2018.  
 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
 
IFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities, and some contracts to buy 
or sell non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
 
Management’s assessment of the impact on the financial statements is still ongoing.

Functional and presentation currency 
 
The presentation currency of the Group is US dollars (USD). Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured in the functional currency of each entity. The Group used the local currency as the functional currency 
including the parent company, where the functional currency is sterling. 
 
Basis of consolidation 
 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of accesso Technology Group plc and all of its subsidiary 
undertakings as at 31 December 2017 using the acquisition method. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has 
the ability to affect the returns of the entity and has the rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity. The 
results of subsidiary undertakings are included from the date of acquisition. 
 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Any costs directly attributable to the business combination are 
written off to the Group income statement in the period incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities, and 
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent 
liabilities recognised. 
 
Disclosure and details of the subsidiaries are provided in note 15. 
 
Investments, including the shares in subsidiary companies held as fixed assets, are stated at cost less any provision for 
impairment in value. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.  
 
Lo-Q (Trustees) Limited, a subsidiary company that holds an employee benefit trust on behalf of accesso Technology Group 
plc, is under control of the Board of directors and hence has been consolidated into the Group results. 
 
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
 
Foreign currency 
 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group companies at the rates 
ruling when the transactions occur. 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange 
rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are 
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that 
are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
 
Foreign operations 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill, are translated into USD at the exchange rates at the 
reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into USD at the rates ruling when the 
transactions occur, or appropriate averages. 
 
Foreign currency differences on translating the opening net assets at an opening rate and the results of operations at actual 
rates are recognised in OCI, and accumulated in the translation reserve. Retranslation differences recognised in other 
comprehensive income will be reclassified to profit or loss in the event of a disposal of the business, or the Group no longer 
has control or significant influence. 
 
Revenue recognition  
 
Revenue primarily arises from the operation and licensing of virtual queuing solutions, the development and application 
eCommerce ticketing, professional services, and license sales in relation to point of sale and guest management software 
and related hardware. 
 
  accesso Technology Group plc

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

Significant accounting policies (continued) 
 
Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the 
amount of revenue can be reliably estimated, and recovery of consideration is probable. Revenue is measured net of 
discounts and service credits. 
 
In relation to virtual queuing, the Group contracts with theme park operators to offer the technology and service to park 
guests and share the profit or revenue generated by purchases by park guests. The Group’s contracts are either a profit-
share, where the Group and the park split the profit of the operation, or a revenue-share, where the Group receives a 
percentage of revenue of sales at the park. Under both types of contracts, revenue is recognised when the guest utilises the 
technology. 
 
Where the contract is a profit-share, revenue represents the total payment by the park guest, net of sales taxes, to utilise 
the technology. The park’s share is deducted in cost of sales within the statement of comprehensive income. Typically in 
these agreements, the Group accepts responsibility for the operation within the park, including sales, operation, 
maintenance of the equipment and facility, and guest relations. 
 
In a revenue-share contract, only the Group’s share of the revenue generated by the technology, as per the customer 
agreement, is recognised as revenue. Any costs incurred by the Group are deducted within cost of sales within the statement 
of comprehensive income. The Group generally does not influence operation of the product, sales, maintenance, guest 
relations, or employees. 
 
Ticketing revenue is generated from owners or operators of venues utilising the Group’s technology, and is earned either by 
a per-ticket fee or as a percent of the total transaction of ticket purchases by guests or visitors of the venue. It is recognised 
at the time of the sale to the guest or visitor, and the fee collected for the sale of the ticket is not refundable to the customer. 
 
The Group provides implementation, support, and customisation services (collectively, “professional services”) in relation to 
its products. Professional services revenue is either earned on a time and materials basis as the services are provided to the 
customer, or on a percentage of completion method when it’s a fixed price contract. 
 
Revenue in relation to point of sale and guest management software licences is earned via installing software onto a 
customer’s owned-hardware and giving the customer the ability to use the software. While installations often occur over a 
period of time, no revenue is recognized until installation is complete and accepted by the customer. The revenue related to 
the license fee for the software purchased by the customer is recognized at the time installation is complete, as at the time 
of the installation the Group has fulfilled its obligation to provide the customer the software, and there is no recourse for 
revenue to be refunded.  Any revenue relating to an on-going support obligation is deferred and recognised over the period 
of such obligation. 
 
Customers of point-of-sale and guest management software are also charged an annual maintenance and support fee, 
calculated as a percentage of the original cost of the software, each year they remain a customer. This revenue is recognized 
rateably over the support term, which is generally 12 months. If the customer cancels during the term, the Group is entitled 
to retain the full amount of the consideration. 
 
Interest expense recognition 
 
Expense is recognised as interest accrues, using the effective interest method, to the net carrying amount of the financial 
liability. 
 
Employee benefits 
 
Share-based payment arrangements 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to full time employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at the fair value at the date of grant, with the expense recognized over the vesting period, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the Group's estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest, such that the amount recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the service and non-market 
performance conditions at the vesting date. 
 
The fair value of Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) and unapproved share options is measured by use of a Black-
Scholes model, and share options issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) are measured using the Monte Carlo 
method, due to the market-based conditions upon which vesting is dependent. The expected life used in the model has 
been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and 
behavioural considerations. 
 
The LTIP awards contain market-based vesting conditions. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the 
options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market   accesso Technology Group plc 
38 
 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

Significant accounting policies (continued) 
 
vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition or 
where a non-vesting condition is not satisfied. 
 
Pension costs 
Contributions to the Group's defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income in the period in which they become due. 
 
Property, plant and equipment 
 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or production cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses. 
 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, less residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the 
straight-line method, on the following bases: 
 
Plant, machinery, and office equipment 20 - 33.3% of the original costs each year 
Installed systems 25 - 33.3%, or life of contract, of the original costs each year 
Furniture and fixtures 20% of the original costs each year 
Leasehold Improvements Shorter of useful life of the asset or time remaining within the lease contract 
of the original costs each year 
 
Inventories 
 
The Group’s inventories consist of parts used in the manufacture and maintenance of its virtual queuing product, along with 
peripheral items that enable the product to function within a park. 
 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow-
moving items. Inventories are calculated on a first in, first out basis. 
 
Park installations are valued on the basis of the cost of inventory items and labour plus attributable overheads. Net realisable 
value is based on estimated selling price less additional costs to completion and disposal. 
 
Deferred tax  
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the Consolidated and 
Company statements of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: 
 
• the initial recognition of goodwill; 
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of 
the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and 
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal 
of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the difference can be utilised. 
 
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities / (assets) are settled / (recovered). 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: 
 
• the same taxable Group company; or 
• different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax 
assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.

Current income tax 
 
The tax expense or benefit for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the 
tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. 
 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject 
to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities. See note 10 for further discussion on provisions related to tax positions. 
 
Goodwill and intangible assets 
 
Goodwill is carried at cost less any provision for impairment. Intangible assets are valued at cost less amortisation and any 
provision for impairment. 
 
Goodwill arising on business combinations (representing the excess of fair value of the consideration given over the fair 
value of the separable net assets acquired) is capitalised, and its subsequent measurement is based on annual impairment 
reviews, with any impairment losses recognised immediately in the income statement.  Direct costs of acquisition are 
recognised immediately in the income statement as an expense. 
 
Externally acquired intangible assets 
 
Intangible assets are capitalised at cost and amortised to nil by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic life.  
 
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity.  The amounts 
ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see note 13).  The significant 
intangibles recognised by the Group and their useful economic lives are as follows: 
 
• Trademarks over 3 years 
• Patents over 20 years 
• Customer relationships and supplier contracts over 1 to 15 years 
• Intellectual property over 5 to 7 years 
 
Internally generated intangible assets and research and development 
 
Expenditure on internally developed products is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that: 
• It is technically feasible to develop the product for it to be sold; 
• Adequate resources are available to complete the development; 
• There is an intention to complete and sell the product; 
• The Group is able to sell the product; 
• Sale of the product will generate future economic benefits; and 
• Expenditure on the project can be measured reliably. 
 
In accordance with IAS 38 'Intangible Assets', expenditure incurred on research and development is distinguished as either 
to a research phase or to a development phase. Development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria and expenditure 
on the research phase of internal projects is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as incurred. 
 
Development expenditure is capitalised and amortised within administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over its useful 
economic life, which is considered to be up to a maximum of 5 years. The amortisation expense is included within 
administrative expenses in the Consolidated income statement. 
 
All advanced research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement. For development expenditure, this is 
capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset, only if it meets criteria noted above. 
 
The Group has contractual commitments for development costs of $nil (2016: $nil).

Intellectual property rights and patents 
 
Intellectual property rights comprise assets acquired, being external costs, relating to know how, patents, and licences. 
These assets have been capitalised at the fair value of the assets acquired and are amortised within administrative expenses 
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life of 5 to 9 years. 
 
Financial assets 
 
The Group classifies all its financial assets into one of the following categories, depending on the purpose for which the asset 
was acquired. The Group's accounting policy for each category is as follows: 
 
• Trade and loan receivables: Trade receivables are initially recognised by the Group and carried at original invoice 
amount less an allowance for any uncollectible or impaired amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when 
collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Debts are written off when they are identified as being 
uncollectible. Other receivables are recognised at fair value. Loan receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise principally through the provision 
of goods and services to customers (trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. 
Impairment of a financial asset is recognised if there is objective evidence that the balance will not be recovered. 
 
• Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank, cash in hand and short-term 
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flow. 
 
Financial liabilities 
 
The Group treats its financial liabilities in accordance with the following accounting policy:  
 
• Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised 
cost.  
 
• Bank borrowings and finance leases are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly 
attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment 
is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the statement of financial position. "Interest expense" in 
this context includes initial transaction costs and premiums payable on redemption, as well as any interest payable 
while the liability is outstanding. 
 
Employee benefit trust (EBT)  
 
As the company is deemed to have control of its EBT, it is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the 
consolidated financial statements. The EBT's assets (other than investments in the company's shares), liabilities, income, 
and expenses are included on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements. The EBT's investment in the 
company's shares is deducted from equity in the consolidated statement of financial position as if they were treasury shares. 
 
3. Critical judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
 
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Group makes judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning 
the future that impact the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  
 
The resulting accounting estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions are based on historical experience 
and expectations of future events, and may not equal the actual results. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis, and revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively. 
 
The judgements and key sources of assumptions and estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements are discussed below.

Judgements 
 
Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts 
recognised in these consolidated financial statements are below: 
 
Capitalised development costs 
The Group capitalises development costs in line with IAS 38, Intangible Assets. Management applies judgement in 
determining if the costs meet the criteria, and are therefore eligible for capitalisation. Significant judgements include the 
technical feasibility of the development, recoverability of the costs incurred, and economic viability of the product and 
potential market available considering its current and future customers. See Internally generated intangible assets and 
research and development within note 2 for details on the Group’s capitalisation and amortisation policies, and Intangible 
Assets, note 13, for the carrying value of capitalised development costs. 
 
Agent versus principal 
As identified in note 2, revenue in respect of the Group’s queuing contracts is recognised on either a gross or net basis. 
When analysing whether the Group is acting as a principal or agent in a given arrangement, this requires management to 
consider several judgemental factors. These factors include whether the Group has the ability to influence operating hours, 
employees, and prices, whether it bears significant credit and inventory risk, and whether it has primary responsibility for 
providing the goods or services to the ultimate customer (the park guest or venue). 
 
When revenue is recognised on a gross basis, management has determined that the Group is operating the product with 
enough autonomy and control over the outcome that is bears significant risk and responsibility such that it is acting as the 
principal. The Group is generally responsible for the operation within the attraction, including sales, operation, employee 
management (including hiring), maintenance of the equipment and facility, and guest relations.  
 
When revenue is recognised on a net basis, management does not view the Group’s participation in the operation as 
significant enough to influence the factors noted above, including operation of the product, sales, maintenance, guest 
relations, or employee management. Revenue is generally recognised on a net basis in a revenue-share contract, as the 
Group’s responsibility would not extend significantly beyond initial installation of the system and annual upkeep. 
 
Assumptions and estimation uncertainties 
 
Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in material adjustments 
in the following year are: 
 
Determination of fair values of intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are important to the revenue generating capacity of the Group. The 
recognition of intangible assets requires management to apply judgement, and may require management to contract with 
specialists to assist when it deems necessary. The recognition of goodwill in a business combination results from assets 
which do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce, and buyer-specific synergies.  
 
The fair values are based on a market participant’s ability to utilise the assets, determined using a method appropriate to 
the specific intangible asset, and reflect assumptions and estimates that have a material effect on the carrying value of the 
asset.  
 
Key assumptions and estimates made in valuing the acquired intangible assets include: 
• Cash flow forecasts prepared at the time of acquisition, which involve estimating future business volumes; 
• The discount rate applied to the forecasted future cash flows; and 
• The costs to recreate the asset. 
 
The nature and inherent uncertainty relating to these assumptions and estimates means that the actual cash flow may be 
materially different from the forecast, and would therefore have led to a different asset value. See note 2 for the useful 
lives and amortisation policies regarding intangible assets acquired in business combinations. 
 
Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding inventories and deferred tax assets) 
Impairment tests on goodwill are subject to annual review. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the 
smallest group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows; its cash generating units 
(‘CGUs’). Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group's CGUs that are expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill. As the Group’s CGUs have become more interrelated, and 
acquisitions are made with the intention of platform integration, the allocation of goodwill is monitored across the CGUs.  accesso Technology Group plc

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 
 
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued) 
 
Management must make estimates of the pre-tax discount rate, operating margin, and terminal growth rate when testing 
for impairment. These inputs are based upon historical data and estimates of future events which can be difficult to predict, 
and actual results could vary from the estimate. See note 13 for management’s assumptions used in testing for impairment. 
 
4. Financial risk management 
 
Overview: 
 
The Group’s use of financial instruments exposes it to a number of risks, including: 
 
• Liquidity risk; 
• Interest rate risk; 
• Credit risk; and, 
• Market risk. 
 
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s policies and processes 
for measuring and managing these risks. The risks are managed centrally following Board-approved policies, and by regularly  
 
monitoring the business and providing ongoing forecasts of the impact on the business. The Group operates a centralised 
treasury function in accordance with Board-approved policies and guidelines covering funding and management of foreign 
exchange exposure and interest rate risk. Transactions entered into by the treasury function are required to be in support 
of, or as a consequence of, underlying commercial transactions. 
 
Other than short-term trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from operations, as detailed in notes 17 and 
18, the Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, and finance leases. The fair values of these instruments 
are not materially different to their book values. The objective of holding financial instruments is to finance the Group’s 
operations and manage related risks.  
 
Liquidity risk 
 
The Group closely monitors its access to bank and other credit facilities in comparison to its outstanding commitments to 
ensure it has sufficient funds to meet its obligations as they fall due.  The Group finance function produces regular forecasts 
that estimate the cash inflows and outflows for the next 12 months, so that management can ensure that sufficient financing 
is in place as it is required. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility 
through the use of banking arrangements in place.

The Group would normally expect that sufficient cash is generated in the operating cycle to meet the contractual cash flows 
as disclosed above through effective cash management. 
 
Interest rate risk 
 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises mainly from interest on its bank loan facility, which is subject to a floating interest rate, 
and as such, exposes the entity to cash flow risk if prevailing interest rates were to increase. 
 
The Group regularly reviews its funding arrangements to ensure they are competitive with the marketplace. 
 
The table below shows the Group’s and company’s financial assets and liabilities that could be affected by the fluctuation in

Credit risk exposure 
 
Credit risk predominantly arises from trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks. Credit risk is 
managed on a Group basis. External credit checks are obtained for larger customers. In addition, the credit quality of each 
customer is assessed internally before accepting any terms of trade. Internal procedures take into account a customer’s 
financial position, their reputation in the industry, and past trading experience. As a result, the Group’s exposure to bad debts 
is generally not significant due to the nature of its trade and relationships with customers.  
 
Indeed, the Group, having considered the potential impact of its exposure to credit risk, and having due regard to both the 
nature of its business and customers, do not consider this to have a materially significant impact to the results. Credit risk 
also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions that have acceptable credit 
ratings.

The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in trade and other receivables. The average credit period taken 
by customers is 31 days (2016: 31 days). The allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts has been made based upon the 
knowledge of the financial circumstances of individual trade receivables at the balance sheet date. The Group holds no 
collateral against these receivables at the balance sheet date. 
 
The following table provides an analysis of trade and other receivables that were past due at 31 December 2017 and 31 
December 2016, but against which no provision has been made. The Group believes that the balances are ultimately 
recoverable based on a review of past payment history and the current financial status of the customers.

Financial risk management (continued) 
 
Capital risk management 
 
The Group considers its capital to comprise its ordinary share capital, share premium, own shares held in trust, other reserves, 
accumulated retained earnings and borrowings as disclosed in the Consolidated statement of financial position. Further 
details of the Group’s borrowing facilities are included in note 19. The Group manages its capital structure in the light of 
changes in economic conditions and financial markets generally and regularly evaluates its compliance with covenants 
applicable to their borrowing facilities.     
 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for current and future shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital 
structure to minimise the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount 
of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or increase or reduce debt. 
 
The Group does not seek to maintain any specific debt to capital ratio, but considers investment opportunities on their merits 
and funds them in what it considers to be the most effective manner. 
 
Foreign currency exposure 
 
The Group primarily has operations or customers in the UK, USA, Canada, Italy, Germany, Australia, Brazil, and Mexico, and, 
as such, is exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. The main operating currencies of its operations are in sterling, 
US dollars, and euros. The Group's currency exposure comprises the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not 
denominated in the operating or 'functional' currency of the operating unit involved.  At the period end, Group companies 
held monetary assets in currencies other than their local currency. Balances at 31 December 2017 are (in $’000s): 
 
 $714 (2016: $280) denominated in US dollars 
 AUD$9 (2016: AUD$80) denominated in Australian dollars 
 €85 (2016: €133) denominated in euros 
 Kr856 (2016: Kr419) denominated in Danish krone 
 CAD$nil (2016: CAD$16) denominated in Canadian dollars 
 
The Group manages risk by its subsidiaries matching revenue and expenditure in their local currency wherever possible. The 
Group tries to keep foreign intercompany balances as low as possible to avoid translation adjustments. Given the nature of 
the Group’s operations and their management of foreign currency exposure, they limit the potential down side risk as far as 
practicably possible.  
 
The Group considers the volatility of currency markets over the year to be representative of the potential foreign currency 
risk it is exposed to. The main currency the Group’s results were exposed to was sterling and over the year the average rate 
for 1GBP = 1.2906USD (2016: 1GBP = 1.345USD). If sterling had been an average of 5% stronger than the dollar through the 
year, then it would have increased Group profit before tax by $199,805 (1.77%). If sterling had been an average of 5% weaker 
than the dollar through the year then it would have decreased Group profit before tax by $199,805 (1.77%). 
 
Fair Value Measurement 
 
The Group does not have any level 2 or 3 financial assets or liabilities that have unobservable inputs that require disclosure. 
 
5. Business and geographical segments 
 
Segmental analysis 
 
The Group’s operating segments under IFRS have been determined with reference to the financial information presented to 
the Board of directors. The Board of the Group is considered the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) as defined within 
IFRS 8, as it sets the strategic goals for the Group as a whole and monitors its operational performance against this strategy.  
 
The Board consider the Group in its current form to consist of one Operating Segment and appraises the entity’s performance 
as a whole. The Group’s revenues, costs, assets, liabilities, currency exposure, and cash flows are therefore totally 
attributable to the single Operating Segment.  
 
The ticketing and queuing operations of the Group are evolving and continually merging, and the Group is now serviced 
through a single sales team, transferable staff, and is appraised on a Group basis in terms of incentive arrangements. 
Additionally, similar economic characteristics, including customers, markets, and operating margins, are shared by the 
revenue generating activities of the Group. As the business gains more scale, large shared customers are becoming 
increasingly common. Allocation of resources is driven by customer needs across the Group as a whole.  accesso Technology Group plc

Business and geographical segments (continued) 
 
The segments will be assessed as the Group develops and continues to make acquisitions. 
 
An analysis of the Group’s external revenues and non-current assets (excluding deferred tax) by geographical location are 
detailed below:

  133,429  102,511  201,698  85,106 
 
Revenue generated in each of the geographical locations is generally in the local currency of the venue or operator based in 
that location. 
 
 Major customers 
 
The Group has entered into agreements with theme parks, theme park groups, and attractions to operate its technology in 
single or multiple theme parks or attractions within the theme park group. 
 
The majority of the ultimate revenue of the business is derived from guest rentals of the Group’s virtual queuing technology 
or tickets purchased by guests via the Group’s ecommerce technology, but no single guest forms a significant proportion of 
the revenue of the Group. However, the ability to generate guest rentals or ticket related revenue is fully dependant on the 
Group maintaining and developing agreements with theme parks or attraction owners to operate its technology.  
 
The customers of one of the park operators with which the Group has a contractual relationship accounts for $44.8m of 
Group revenue for 2017 (2016: $51.3m). 
 
6. Revenue 
 
Management categorises revenue based upon the likelihood it will be repeatable. 
 
Transactional revenue is repeatable revenue earned as either a fixed amount per sale of an item by the customer or as a 
percent of the total sale (e.g. eCommerce income, ticket sales). Other repeatable revenue is repeatable revenue, excluding 
transactional revenue, that is expected to be earned each year of a customer’s contract (e.g. annual license fees, 
maintenance support). Non-repeatable revenue is revenue that occurs one-time (e.g. up-front license fees) or is not 
repeatable based upon the current contract (e.g. billable hours), and is unlikely to be repeatable without additional sales 
activity. Other revenue consists of hardware sales and other revenue that may be repeatable with no sales activity if 
customer behaviour is consistent.

Tax rates in the UK will reduce from 19% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.  Tax rates in the US will reduce from 35% to 
21%, before state taxes, with effect from 1 January 2018.  As both rate changes have been substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, deferred tax assets and liabilities have been measured at a rate of 17% and 21% plus state taxes in the 
UK and US, respectively (2016: 17% and 40%, respectively).  The significant reduction in the US corporate rate will also reduce 
the Group's effective tax rate in future periods. There are no material unrecognized deferred tax assets. 
 
Taxation and transfer pricing 
The Group is an international technology business and, as such, transfer pricing arrangements are in place to cover funding 
arrangements, management costs and the exploitation of IP between Group companies. Transfer prices and the policies 
applied directly affect the allocation of Group-wide taxable income across a number of tax jurisdictions. While transfer pricing 
entries between legal entities are on an arm’s length basis, there is increasing scrutiny from tax authorities on transfer pricing 
arrangements. This could result in the creation of uncertain tax positions.    
  
The Group provides for anticipated risks, based on reasonable estimates, for tax risks in the respective countries in which it 
operates. The amount of such provisions can be based on various factors, such as experience with previous tax audits and 
differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible authority. Uncertainties exist with 
respect to the evolution of the Group following international acquisitions holding significant IP assets, interpretation of 
complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income.  
  
Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual 
agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such 
assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. 
  
Uncertainties in relation to tax liabilities are provided for within income tax payable to the extent that it is considered 
probable that the Group may be required to settle a tax liability in the future. Settlement of tax provisions could potentially 
result in future cash tax payments; however, these are not expected to result in an increased tax charge as they have been 
fully provided for in accordance with management’s best estimates of the most likely outcomes.  
  
Ongoing tax assessments and related tax risks  
The Group has undertaken a review of potential tax risks and current tax assessments, and whilst it is not possible to predict 
the outcome of any current or future tax enquiries, adequate provisions are considered to have been included in the Group 
accounts to cover any expected estimated future settlements. 
  
In common with many international groups operating across multiple jurisdictions, certain tax positions taken by the Group 
are based on industry practice and external tax advice, or are based on assumptions and involve a significant degree of 
judgement. It is considered possible that tax enquiries on such tax positions could give rise to material changes in the Group’s 
tax provisions.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 
 
The Group is consequently, from time to time, subject to tax enquiries by local tax authorities and certain tax positions 
related to intercompany transactions may be subject to challenge by the relevant tax authority.   
  
The Group has recognised provisions where it is not probable that tax positions taken will be accepted, totalling $0.6 million 
in relation to transfer pricing risks and $0.4 million in relation to availability of tax losses and international R&D claims. 
 
11. Profit of parent company 
 
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented 
as part of these financial statements. The parent company's profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 was (in 
$’000) $4,442 (2016: $6,096). 
 
12. Earnings per share 
 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. 
 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, after adjustments 
for instruments that dilute basic earnings per share, by the weighted average of ordinary shares outstanding during the 
period (adjusted for the effects of dilutive instruments). 
 
Earnings for adjusted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, are defined as profit before tax before the deduction of 
amortisation related to acquisitions, acquisition costs, deferred and contingent consideration, credits to the income 
statement from the reversal of the earn-out liability, and costs related to share-based payments, less tax at the effective 
rate.

Acquisition of Ingresso Group Limited   
 
On 30 March 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity of Ingresso Group Limited (“Ingresso”), a provider of live 
access to ticketed events worldwide across multiple platforms, languages and currencies, for initial cash consideration of 
£14.8m ($18.5m), plus a potential earn out payment, capped at £10.5m ($13.1m). The total aggregate consideration was 
capped at £28.0m ($35.0m), assuming the earn out was achieved in full. A true-up of working capital brought the total cash 
investment to $18.7m. 
 
The acquisition of Ingresso is expected to further deepen the Group’s ability to help its customers drive efficiency and realise 
greater value from their ticketing operations. Additionally, it will open up a significantly larger global distribution channel 
through which existing Group customers can seek to sell their event and attraction tickets, along with providing Ingresso 
with a significant opportunity to grow its business via access to the Group’s expansive ticket inventory, eCommerce expertise, 
infrastructure and global relationships. Finally, Ingresso allows the Group to address significant inefficiencies it has identified 
within the travel and leisure industry, and help clients generate more revenue from third party distribution channels  accesso Technology Group plc

Intangible assets (continued) 
 
The earn out, payable in 2018, is based on the financial performance of Ingresso for the year ended 31 December 2017 
exceeding its financial performance in 2016. It is payable in cash and secured by a floating charge on the assets of Ingresso. 
 
The full earn out was not achieved, resulting in a credit to the Consolidated and company statement of comprehensive 
income of $3.2m. The Group's statement of financial position includes a liability in relation to the earn out of $9.1m. Under 
IFRS 3, consideration payable to employees of the acquired company is compensation expense, rather than deferred 
consideration. The Group’s income statement contains $1.0m of compensation expense due to this treatment within 
administrative expenses, and $0.2m of interest expense related to this treatment.  
 
To fund the acquisition, the Group entered into an amendment and restatement agreement in relation to its Lloyds Bank 
facility dated 14 March 2016, extending the facility to allow for the ability to draw down $60m, denominated in US dollars, 
GB Pound Sterling, or Euros. The agreement has a four-year term, with a $10m reduction in the total available for drawdown 
on the first, second and third anniversaries of the restatement. There is an option to extend the agreement for a further 12 
months at the end of the first year, and an accordion mechanism allowing for a further $10m related to future acquisitions.  
 
The drawdown rate is 140 basis points above LIBOR at a borrowing to EBITDA ratio of less than 1.5 times, rising to 190 basis 
points if the borrowing to EBITDA ratio is greater than 2.25 times. Commitment interest on the undrawn funds is 35% of 
margin.  
  
Acquisition related costs of $0.7m were incurred in relation to this acquisition, excluding capitalised finance costs ($0.4m), 
and are included within administrative expenses within the Statement of comprehensive income for the period. Finance 
costs are amortised over the life of the agreement, and presented netted against bank loans within borrowings in the 
statement of financial position. 
 
Ingresso contributed $16.7m to revenue and $0.06m to profit before tax from the date of acquisition.

Acquisition of Blazer and Flip Flops Inc DBA The Experience Engine (“TE2”) 
 
On 20 July 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity of Blazer and Flip Flops, Inc, a privately-owned developer of 
software solutions which enables leading enterprises to offer a highly-personalised guest experience to their customers, 
primarily in the leisure, hospitality, entertainment and retail sectors. The acquisition was for an enterprise value of $80 
million and was funded by the issue of $14.5 million in new Ordinary shares of the Group to the Vendors, and an underwritten 
vendor and cash placing of $75.6 million. 
 
Management believe that TE2's cloud based solution offers market-leading personalisation capabilities and data 
orchestration technologies which capture, model and anticipate guest behaviour and preferences not only pre- and post-
visit online, but in the physical in-venue environment.  The acquisition of TE2 will greatly complement and enhance the 
Group's existing offerings, which help its enterprise customers both improve and monetise their customers' experiences.  
 
Using the Group's greater scale, customer relationships, sales and delivery capability, established reputation and capital 
resources will help accelerate adoption of TE2's solution among new and existing customers. 
 
Acquisition related costs of $0.5m were incurred in relation to this acquisition, and are included within administrative 
expenses within the Statement of comprehensive income for the period.  
 
TE2 contributed $11.9m to revenue and $1.8m to profit before tax from the date of acquisition.

Goodwill on acquisition      52,403 
 
(1) In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the consideration paid in shares is based on the share price at the 
date on which the company obtained control of TE2. The price determined in the Purchase Agreement for calculating 
the number of shares to be issued to the vendors is based on an average price of $20.81. The amount is booked to the 
Merger Relief Reserve within the consolidated statement of financial position.  
 
Deferred consideration consisting of 454,547 shares will be issued to certain key employees of TE2, contingent upon their 
continued employment, over 36 months. Shares will be issued in 3 separate tranches: one-third 12 months after the 
completion date; a further one-third 24 months after the completion date; and the final one-third is released rateably over 
12 months from the 25
th
 to 36
th
 month after the completion date. A charge in relation to this of $1.3m is booked to Other 
Reserves. 
 
The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill are the presence of certain intangible assets, such as the assembled 
orkforce of the acquired entity and the expected synergies of the enlarged Group, which do not qualify for separate 
recognition. Expected synergies include the ability to drive increased sales via additional data collection on users of the 
Group’s current products, and enhanced relationships with current customers.

Impairment testing of goodwill 
The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amount 
is determined based on value-in-use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and 
the determination of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. 
 
The Group considers acquisitions based upon their ability to add accretive earnings to the Group and leverage off customer 
relationships already in place, or bring the Group’s portfolio into new markets. As such, the goodwill of cash generating units 
(CGUs) is monitored at a Group level, rather than at the individual CGU level. Accordingly, for the impairment test of goodwill, 
the CGUs are tested collectively.  
 
The recoverable amounts of all the CGUs have been determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow projections 
using budget and forecast projections and assumes a perpetuity based terminal value. 
 
The key assumptions used for value in the calculations in 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

Operating margins have been based on experience, where possible, and future expectations in the light of anticipated 
economic and market conditions.  Discount rates are based on the Group’s WACC adjusted to reflect market participant’s 
expected capital structure.  Growth rates beyond the formally budgeted period are based on economic data pertaining to 
the region concerned.  
 
In respect of the pooled goodwill, a reasonable change in the key assumptions of the terminal growth rate and operating 
margin did not significantly impact the recoverable value. If the pre-tax discount rate used for the test was 34.4%, the carrying 
amount and recoverable amount would be equal.  
 
The value-in-use of the CGUs exceeds their carrying value by $247m.

On 7 November 2014 the Group entered into an amendment and restatement agreement with Lloyds Bank plc in relation to 
a Revolving Loan Facility dated 4 December 2013. 
 
On 14 March 2016, the Group amended the facility. The amended facility extends it to allow a drawdown facility of $25m, 
with no step downs, at an improved drawdown rate of 1.35% above LIBOR, and an improved commitment rate. The renewed 
facility terminates on 14 March 2019 with the possibility for this to extend for a further 24 months in two separate 12 month 
extensions. 
 
As discussed in note 13, on 30 March 2017, in conjunction with the purchase of Ingresso Group Ltd, the Group entered into 
an amendment and restatement agreement in relation to the facility dated 14 March 2016, extending the facility to allow 
for the ability to draw down $60m, denominated in US dollars, GB Pound Sterling, or Euros. The agreement has a four-year 
term, with a $10m reduction in the total available for drawdown on the first, second and third anniversaries of the 
restatement. There is an option to extend the agreement for a further 12 months at the end of the first year, and an accordion 
mechanism allowing for a further $10m related to future acquisitions.  
 
The drawdown rate is 140 basis points above LIBOR at a borrowing to EBITDA ratio of less than 1.5 times, rising to 190 basis 
points if the borrowing to EBITDA ration is greater than 2.25 times. Commitment interest on the undrawn funds is 35% of 
margin. The Facility had an arrangement fee of $0.4m.

Share-based payment schemes and transactions (continued) 
 
The Group did not enter into any share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees during the current 
or previous period.   
 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous twelve-
month period. Expected life is based on the Group’s assessment of the average life of the option following the vesting period. 
The market vesting condition was factored into the valuation of shares issued under the LTIP as explained on page 20. 
 
Long-term incentive plan 
 
On 30 March 2017, the Group granted conditional share award (“Awards”) over a total of 18,851 ordinary shares of 1 penny 
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders on 27 May 2014. 
 
On 14 March and 14 September 2016 the Group granted Awards over a total of 306,974 ordinary shares of 1 penny under 
the LTIP, and during 2014 and 2015, the company granted Awards over 222,206 and 277,534 ordinary shares of 1 penny 
under the LTIP, respectively. 
 
All Awards vest three years from the date of grant, are required to be held for a further six months, and are subject to certain 
performance conditions. 
 
The fair values of the Awards at the dates of grant were calculated using the Monte Carlo statistical modelling approach to 
reflect the market conditions within the Award conditions. The inputs to this model were as follows:
