OVERVIEW 
Both of our prime central London estates had a very active year in 
which management made good operational progress. The Covent 
Garden estate, which now represents more than 70 per cent of the 
Group’s portfolio by value, delivered positive performance and value 
growth. The value of our investments at Earls Court has however 
been impacted by challenges in the London residential market.
PERFORMANCE 
Capco’s total shareholder return for the year, which comprises 
share price performance plus the dividends paid during the year, 
was 8.1 per cent, and total return for the year, which represents the 
change in net assets plus the dividends paid during the year, was 
-1.3 per cent. The total value of Capco’s property portfolio fell by 0.9 
per cent on a like-for-like basis to £3.5 billion, with gains at Covent 
Garden being offset by a reduction in the Earls Court valuation. 
Covent Garden is established as a renowned retail and dining 
destination and continues to attract target brands. The Covent 
Garden estate is benefiting from a period of significant investment 
made over recent years, creating an inviting environment with a 
wide variety of British heritage, independent and global brands 
offering a broad selection of retail and dining experiences across  
the estate. Net rental income has increased significantly in 2017. 
Capco’s distinct approach to creative asset management continues 
to drive leasing activity and in turn ERV progression. 
Initiatives to enhance the estate have been very successful. 
Examples include the establishment of Henrietta Street as a 
menswear and dining destination and the successful repositioning 
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 8  of the Royal Opera House Arcade. In addition, a number of 
acquisitions have extended our presence on Floral Street. The 
Floral Court development is nearing completion with the courtyard 
and restaurant openings expected over the coming months. 
Economic and political uncertainty has impacted the residential 
market in London, resulting in a further decline in the valuation  
of our investments at Earls Court. The consented Masterplan 
remains one of the largest Opportunity Areas in central London 
with the ability to evolve with the needs of the Capital. The political 
and economic environment has made discussions on enhancing the 
Masterplan more difficult, however Capco will continue to seek to 
positively engage with all stakeholders to evolve the Masterplan 
over time.
At Earls Court Partnership Limited (“ECPL”), our investment 
vehicle with Transport for London (“TfL”), the final phase of the 
complex demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres 
has been successfully completed in preparation for future 
development. Handover of the first phase of the Lillie Square 
residential development nears completion and half of Phase 2 has 
been pre-sold at a modest premium to comparable units in Phase 1. 
In April 2017, Capco completed the sale of the Venues business at a 
slight premium to net asset value, in keeping with our established 
strategy of recycling capital through the disposal of non-core assets. 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND DIVIDENDS 
Capco continues to maintain a strong balance sheet, with low 
leverage, high liquidity and modest capital commitments. During 
the year, Capco extended its debt maturities, further diversified its 
sources of funding with a Private Placement and successfully 
executed the sale of Venues. The business is well-positioned to 
support its future activities and take advantage of opportunities  
as they arise. 
The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share, 
which brings the total dividend for 2017 to 1.5 pence per share. 
PEOPLE 
The Company has evolved during the year and the Board and I 
would like to thank our employees for their work and commitment.
There were a number of changes to the Board in 2017. At the 
beginning of the year Situl Jobanputra was promoted to Chief 
Financial Officer, following Soumen Das’ departure at the end of 
2016. Charlotte Boyle was appointed as a Non-executive Director 
and member of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees in 
October 2017, following Demetra Pinsent’s decision to step down 
from the Board in July 2017.
I am pleased to report that Situl and Charlotte have both settled 
into their new roles well, and I was delighted to see the recognition 
of internal talent. Demetra’s departure unfortunately sets back our 
gender diversity aspirations at Board level. The Board will consider 
this along with wider diversity for any future appointments and is 
committed to encouraging diversity, inclusiveness and the 
development of our people across the business.
SHAREHOLDERS 
Capco is listed on the London Stock Exchange and the JSE, and  
over 50 per cent of the Company’s shares are held by South African 
investors. There are sometimes different market expectations in  
the UK and South Africa, and one example of this is the level of 
authority to issue new shares that shareholders expect to grant to 
Boards. The Board feels that, to preserve flexibility, it is appropriate 
to seek the conventional level of authorities expected by 
shareholders in UK listed companies where possible. This has 
resulted in significant votes against two of our AGM resolutions 
and Capco’s inclusion in The Investment Association’s public 
register of shareholder dissent. The Board will maintain dialogue 
with our South African shareholders on this topic. 
BOARD OVERSIGHT 
Non-executive Directors are encouraged to visit our assets in 
Covent Garden and Earls Court and meet operational management 
regularly. This is achieved through individual visits and Board 
update meetings sometimes held on site, and helps the Board keep 
abreast of the business’ challenges and opportunities and to 
contribute to strategic debate. This has been a year of considerable 
change in the macroeconomic and political context in which Capco 
operates and I am grateful for the Directors’ diligence and 
engagement throughout the year.
In reaching its conclusions regarding key business decisions, the 
Board takes account of the different stakeholders relevant to Capco 
and its activities, including local communities where we operate, 
partners, lenders, government and our own people as well as 
shareholders.
The Board also regularly reviews the changing risks affecting Capco 
and takes account of changes to risks when discussing strategy and 
reviewing operations. Health and Safety receives particular 
attention at Board meetings and across the business. 
LOOKING AHEAD 
London is an outstanding global city and remains a very attractive 
investment arena. Our strategy remains clear and focused on 
delivering long-term value for shareholders from our two prime 
central London estates. The Board remains alert to broader 
economic and political uncertainty and its potential impact on 
market conditions, however Capco’s strong financial position 
enables the Group to support its future activities and provides the 
financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Chief Executive’s review
A year of good operational progress
Capco has made good operational progress across its two prime 
central London estates. Covent Garden, which now accounts for  
72 per cent of the Group’s portfolio by value, has had another strong 
year creating value and positive rental performance. We continue  
to implement our strategy by focusing on asset management, 
investment and managing the estate creatively. Covent Garden is a 
world-class destination in the heart of central London offering a 
vibrant mix of British heritage, independent and global brands and 
continues to evolve to meet consumer demand. Investments made 
in recent years including on Henrietta Street, Floral Street, King 
Street and the Royal Opera House Arcade have positioned the estate 
well. This has resulted in strong demand from occupiers and as new 
concepts open, we are capturing the reversionary income potential 
of the portfolio. 
At Earls Court, good operational progress has been made. ECPL,  
the investment vehicle with TfL, which represents our principal 
investment in Earls Court, successfully completed the final phase  
of the complex demolition of the former Exhibition Centres, which 
prepares the land for development. At Lillie Square, Phase 1 handover 
has substantially completed. By the end of 2017 the residents of 182 
new homes had been welcomed to the scheme. A pop-up high street 
for Earls Court was successfully launched on Lillie Road. 
Whilst the West End and Covent Garden have continued to thrive, 
economic and political uncertainty has continued to impact the 
residential market in London, resulting in a further valuation 
decline in our investments at Earls Court. The growth in Covent 
Garden was offset by a decline in the value at Earls Court. As a 
result, EPRA net asset value fell by 1.7 per cent over the year to  
334 pence.
While the environment for large-scale residential development has 
become more difficult, the Earls Court Masterplan has an existing 
planning consent in place and remains one of the largest 
Opportunity Areas in central London, capable of delivering new 
homes, jobs and investment. Earls Court has the ability to evolve 
with the needs of London and its potential will be realised over 
time. As a long-term investor in London, Capco will continue to 
seek to engage positively with our partners and all stakeholders  
in order to evolve the Masterplan, which has the flexibility to be 
brought forward through the introduction of third-party capital 
and selective development.
Over the year, the Group successfully realised value from the sale  
of its Venues business, crystallising £230 million of net proceeds 
which will be recycled into Capco’s central London estates. 
Capco’s prudent approach to its balance sheet continues. We 
maintain a strong financial position with low leverage, high 
liquidity and modest capital commitments. The business is 
well-positioned to support its future activities, navigate market 
uncertainties, while taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. 
Capco remains disciplined in its investment approach, with a 
weighting towards Covent Garden as we continue to expand our 
ownership on the estate.
CLEAR AND FOCUSED 
STRATEGY TO DRIVE  
LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION
Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 10  Valuations
The total property value of the Group declined 0.9 per cent 
(like-for-like) in the year to 31 December 2017 to £3.5 billion. The 
valuation of Covent Garden has risen by 4.3 per cent (like-for-like) to 
£2.5 billion, driven by ERV growth of 4.6 per cent achieved over the 
year. The equivalent yield remains broadly unchanged, reflecting 
the valuer’s current view of the strength of demand for prime 
central London real estate. 
Capco’s investment in Earls Court Properties declined by 11.8 per 
cent (like-for-like) to £1.0 billion at 31 December 2017. A number  
of adjustments have been made to the component parts of the 
valuation of our interest in ECPL. The valuer’s more conservative 
view on gross development value and the cost of delivery, together 
with recent transactional evidence in the land market, have resulted 
in a net decline of 14.4 per cent (like-for-like) for ECPL in the second 
half of the year. Similarly the valuation of our other interests at Earls 
Court has declined reflecting changes in valuation assumptions. 
The Group has a 63 per cent controlling interest in ECPL, the 
investment vehicle with TfL, which owns the land formerly 
occupied by the Earls Court Exhibition Centres (“EC1 & EC2”). As a 
result, it is fully consolidated in the financial statements and TfL’s 
interest is represented as a non-controlling interest. See the 
Financial Review on page 38 for further information.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Covent Garden – a world-class retail and dining destination 
Covent Garden is continuing to build on its success as a world-class 
retail and dining destination. Our creative asset management 
strategy has driven positive leasing momentum with good demand 
for all uses across the estate. We continue to strengthen the core 
categories of luxury gifting and accessories, cosmetics and 
differentiated dining concepts. 
The estate is valued at £2.5 billion as at 31 December 2017, a 
like-for-like increase of 4.3 per cent. During the year, 21 new retail 
and restaurant brands were signed to the estate, the most in any 
year to date. As a result of positive demand across all uses, 90 new 
lettings and renewals were agreed, securing £14.6 million of rental 
income at 10.4 per cent above December 2016 ERV. Net rental 
income has increased significantly, by 17.8 per cent in absolute 
terms or 11.3 per cent like-for-like for the year. The ERV of the estate 
is £105 million, up 4.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis, with positive 
progress being made towards the ERV target of £125 million by 
December 2020. 
The range of dining concepts on the estate continues to expand, 
with the introduction of a number of high quality and differentiated 
concepts including The Oystermen, Avobar and The Henrietta. The 
latest additions further enhance Covent Garden’s attractiveness as 
one of London’s most desirable dining destinations. 
Covent Garden’s retail offering has gone from strength to strength. 
The Market Building has introduced Daniel Wellington, Tom Ford 
and Deciem. The repositioning of the Royal Opera House Arcade 
continues with the addition of leading travel brand Tumi which is 
set to join British heritage brands N. Peal and Tom Davies which 
opened stores during the year. Lettings to Kent & Curwen and The 
Shop at Bluebird represent an excellent start to the repositioning  
of Floral Street. 
Development of Floral Court nears completion. Anchored by 
Petersham Nurseries, the courtyard is expected to open in the coming 
months and will improve the circulation of pedestrian flows on the 
northern part of the estate. The residential component, comprising 
45 new apartments, is expected to complete by summer 2018. 
We have continued to invest in the estate through acquisitions 
which offer value creation opportunities. £99 million was invested 
in acquisitions during the year, most notably consolidating our 
presence on Floral Street. 
Earls Court Properties – large-scale strategic opportunity in 
central London 
During the year, ECPL successfully completed the final phase of the 
complex demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres 
in preparation for future development.
Handover of Phase 1 of Lillie Square nears completion with £98 
million (Capco share) of proceeds received by the end of the year. 
Cumulative proceeds of £125 million (Capco share) are expected  
to have been received on Phase 1 over the coming months. 
Negotiations are at an advanced stage for the main construction 
contract for Phase 2. 50 per cent of the 186 apartments in the phase 
have now been reserved or exchanged. 34 of these transacted during 
2017, seven of which occurred during the second half of the year. 
Sales prices achieved in Phase 2 are at a modest premium to 
comparable units in Phase 1. 
The consented Earls Court Masterplan is a strategic development 
for London and is identified as a Greater London Authority (“GLA”) 
Opportunity Area. It is referenced in the draft London Plan issued 
in December 2017 as ‘ready to grow’. The political environment has 
made discussions on enhancing the Masterplan more difficult, 
however Capco will continue to seek to engage positively with the 
GLA, our partners at Transport for London and other stakeholders 
to evolve the Masterplan over time. This includes discussions with 
London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham (“LBHF”) regarding 
the possibility of the Council taking the lead on future plans for the 
West Kensington and Gibbs Green Estates (“The Estates”). 
Chief Executive’s review continued
Site progress at Earls Court
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 12  Ian Hawksworth
Chief Executive
20 February 2018
Capco is in discussions with MOPAC (the Mayor’s Office for 
Policing and Crime) regarding its ongoing occupational 
requirements at the Empress State Building which may include  
a lease extension or sale of the building. There is no certainty  
that any transaction will be agreed. 
Innova Investment
In 2015, Capco acquired a 50 per cent interest in Innova Investment 
(formerly Solum Developments), a joint venture with Network Rail, 
which is exploring potential opportunities for future 
redevelopments at significant railway station sites across London.
Sale of Venues 
On 7 April 2017, Capco completed the sale of Venues to a 
consortium of German institutional investors for £296 million. 
Profit on disposal of Venues was £2 million. Having extracted 
significant value from the venue since acquisition, Capco took the 
decision to exit this non-core asset realising value for shareholders 
through sale. Cash proceeds were used initially to repay bank debt 
and will be deployed in Capco’s prime central London estates  
over time.
Outlook
Covent Garden is a world-class retail and dining destination in  
the heart of London, offering a differentiated mix of global, British 
heritage and independent brands addressing the needs of the 
consumer. Through creative asset management and by attracting 
excellent retail brands and dining concepts, the reversionary 
income potential of the portfolio will be captured. Capco will 
continue to invest in strategic acquisitions, interventions and in 
enhancing the customer environment. Following a year of positive 
leasing activity, 2018 will be another active year for openings across 
the estate, which are expected to further strengthen Covent 
Garden’s reputation as a leading global destination. The estate 
remains well-placed for continued success and ERV progression 
towards the target of £125 million by December 2020. 
The consented Earls Court Masterplan represents one of the most 
important mixed-use developments in London. The GLA’s draft 
London Plan issued in December 2017 references Earls Court as 
‘ready to grow’ demonstrating the site’s potential to deliver more 
housing and optimise this important London scheme. Whilst the 
economic and political environment presents challenges to the 
London residential market and large scale developments, Capco 
will continue to seek to positively engage with all of its partners 
and stakeholders to evolve the Masterplan. The consented 
Masterplan has the flexibility to be brought forward through the 
introduction of third-party capital and selective development. 
Capco has a clear strategy to deliver long-term value creation  
for our shareholders from our two prime central London estates. 
Backed by a strong balance sheet with low leverage, high liquidity 
and modest capital commitments, Capco is well-positioned to 
support its future activities, navigate market uncertainties and  
take advantage of opportunities as they arise.

ESTATE STRATEGIES
GROUP STRATEGY
To create, grow and deliver value in its assets 
and estates, through a combination of active 
asset management, strategic investments and 
maximising development opportunities.
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 14  Key performance indicators
MEASURING 
PERFORMANCE
The Group’s key performance indicators are 
selected to ensure clear alignment between  
its strategy, shareholder interests and 
remuneration of its employees.
1. Based on consensus estimates at 16 February 2018 for comparator group where results are unavailable.
The three-year total property return is calculated assuming annual reinvestment. Annualised three-year total return and total shareholder return are calculated on a basis 
consistent with the Group’s long-term incentive plans. A number of other indicators of performance are considered by the Board either at a Group level (including underlying 
earnings per share) or specifically relevant to each estate, for example ERV at Covent Garden. These are discussed further in the asset-specific operating reviews in the 
Strategic Report.
All three key performance indicators are directly linked to Executive Directors’ remuneration. These three indicators are carefully aligned with the Group’s strategy of creating 
and growing value and delivering market-leading total returns over the longer term. Total property return, underlying earnings per share and net asset value are linked to annual 
bonuses available to certain of the Group’s employees.
Total property return is calculated  
as capital growth including gains and losses 
on disposal plus rents received less 
associated costs, including ground rent.
This metric allows comparability with  
the IPD Total Return All Property Index.
 Total return is the growth in EPRA NAV  
per share plus dividends per share during 
the year.
Outperformance over a three-year period, 
versus the median of a comparator group  
of the nine largest constituents of the FTSE 
350 Real Estate Index, is identified as a key 
measure of the success of Capco’s strategy.
 Total shareholder return is the increase  
in the price of an ordinary share plus 
dividends during the year.
The Group’s total shareholder return is 
benchmarked against the median total 
shareholder return of a comparator group 
of the nine largest constituents of the  
FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.
As a key metric for the long-term equity-
based compensation for the Group’s 
employees, total shareholder return aligns 
incentives with shareholder interest.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for 
Group risk management. It determines its 
risk appetite and reviews principal risks 
and uncertainties regularly, together with 
the actions taken to mitigate them. The 
Board has delegated responsibility for the 
review of the adequacy and effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal control framework  
to the Audit Committee. 
Following a comprehensive review of  
risk management undertaken in 2015,  
risk is a standing agenda item at all 
management meetings. This gives rise to  
a more risk aware culture and consistency 
in decision making across the organisation 
in line with the corporate strategy and risk 
appetite. All corporate decision making 
takes risk into account, in a measured  
way, while continuing to drive an 
entrepreneurial culture.
The Executive Directors are responsible for 
the day-to-day operational and commercial 
activity across the Group and are therefore 
responsible for the management of business 
risk. The Executive Risk Committee, 
comprising the Executive Directors, the 
General Counsel & Director of Corporate 
Services and the Financial Controller, is the 
executive level management forum for the 
review and discussion of risks, controls and 
mitigation measures. The corporate and 
business division risks are reviewed on a 
quarterly basis by the Executive Risk 
Committee so that trends and emerging 
risks can be identified and reported to  
the Board.
Senior management from every division 
and corporate function of the business 
identify and manage the risks for their 
division or function and complete and 
maintain a risk register. The severity of  
each risk is assessed through a combination 
of each risk’s likelihood of an adverse 
outcome and its impact. In assessing 
impact, consideration is given to financial, 
reputational and regulatory factors, and 
risk mitigation plans are established. A full 
risk review is undertaken annually in which 
the risk registers are aggregated and 
reviewed by the Executive Risk Committee.

GROUP STRATEGY
All of the principal risks and uncertainties have been mapped to the most relevant strategic priority
These principal risks are not exhaustive. The Group monitors a 
number of additional risks and adjusts those considered ‘principal’ 
as the risk profile of the business changes. See also the risks 
inherent in the compilation of financial information, as disclosed 
within note 1 ‘Principal Accounting Policies’ to the consolidated 
financial statements, ‘Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation and uncertainty’.
Since the EU Referendum, there has been economic and political 
uncertainty and this is expected to continue into the foreseeable 
future. To date, there has been no adverse impact on occupier 
demand for the Covent Garden estate, which has seen strong  
rental growth, although the valuation of residential-led 
development land has been impacted by the overall economic  
and political backdrop. 
The political framework for large scale residential development  
has become more difficult. In the Autumn Statement the 
government announced it will introduce planning reform that will 
aim for more land to become available for housing. A review is being 
undertaken by the government, with an interim report targeted to 
be delivered for the Spring Statement, to evaluate the gap between 
planning permissions and housing starts which may result in 
beneficial or adverse policy change for landowners. 
London, as a highly desirable global city, continues to attract 
businesses and people and we would expect this leading position to 
be maintained over time. Uncertainty remains, however, around the 
exit mechanism and longer-term implications of Brexit, and this 
will continue to have a direct or indirect impact on a number of the 
principal risks set out below.

Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 18  VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Directors have considered the prospects of the Group over a three-year period to December 2020. The Directors have determined 
that the three-year period to December 2020 is an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement as it is the period 
covered by the latest business plan which takes into account the Group’s current position, individual asset performance forecasts 
and the potential impact of the principal risks disclosed on pages 17-19. 
In making their assessment, the Directors have taken account of the Group’s robust and flexible balance sheet position with a loan to 
value ratio well below the 40 per cent limit set, substantial cash and available facilities, the Group’s ability to raise new finance and 
the flexibility of future development expenditure. The business plan considers the Group’s cash flow, capital commitments, 
financial resources, debt covenants and other key financial risks. 
All of the Group’s risks could have an impact on viability. The Directors consider the key principal risks that could impact the 
viability of the Group to be economic conditions, funding and leasing. A sensitivity analysis was carried out which involved flexing 
a number of the main assumptions to consider alterative macro-economic conditions, both positive and negative. In particular the 
Group considered an economic downturn scenario with conditions equivalent to that of the 2007-2009 financial crisis leading to 
asset value and rental income decline, as well as rising interest rates. Additional scenarios were reviewed including stress testing the 
Group’s financing covenants and increasing the Group’s exposure to development activity. This analysis was carried out to evaluate 
the potential impact of the Group’s principal risks actually occurring and based on the results the Directors believe that the Group 
is well-placed to manage its principal risks successfully. This assessment has considered the potential impacts of these risks on the 
business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period.
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet their liabilities as they fall due over the period to December 2020. In making this statement the Directors have 
considered the resilience of the Group, taking account of its current position, the risk appetite, the principal risks facing the 
business in severe but reasonable scenarios, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions.

“Covent Garden offers a fantastic environment 
with a vibrant mix of British heritage, 
independent and global brands and continues 
to evolve to meet the demands of the consumer.”
Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 22  Royal Opera House Arcade, Covent Garden 
OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A world-class destination in London’s West End 
Covent Garden is a leading retail and dining destination and is one 
of the most vibrant estates in the heart of central London. Capco’s 
distinct approach to management of the estate with emphasis on 
enhancing customer experience continues to attract target brands. 
Following another active year of leasing and investment, a total  
of 21 new brands were contracted during 2017, the most in any  
year, taking the total number of new brands introduced since 
Capco’s ownership of the estate in 2006 to 140, with over 100 new  
retailers introduced. 
Overview 
Covent Garden, which represents 72 per cent of Capco’s portfolio  
by value, is a world-class retail and dining destination providing 
over 1.1 million square feet of lettable space across all uses in the 
heart of London’s West End. Underpinned by a vision to establish 
the estate as a leading destination for Londoners and visitors to the 
Capital, Capco drives value creation at Covent Garden through asset 
management, strategic investment and creativity. The estate is 
home to a wide variety of British, global and independent brands 
including Kent & Curwen, Petersham Nurseries and Tom Ford. 
Demand for space in this iconic setting continues to be positive, 
highlighted by the 21 new brands introduced this year. 90 leasing 
transactions including new leases and renewals were completed 
representing £14.6 million of rental income per annum transacted at 
10.4 per cent above 31 December 2016 ERV (H1 2017: 43 transactions 
representing £6.6 million of rental income, H2 2017: 47 transactions 
representing £8.0 million of rental income). A new Zone A rent of 
£750 per square foot for the Market Building was achieved this year. 
Net rental income is £48.9 million, up 11.3 per cent (like-for-like) or 
17.8 per cent in absolute terms compared to 2016. Occupancy on the 
estate remains high at 98 per cent. 
2017 was another active year for Covent Garden as the business 
continued to implement its leasing and investment strategy. The 
value of the estate increased by 4.3 per cent on a like-for-like basis to 
over £2.5 billion. ERV is £104.8 million, a like-for-like increase over 
the year of 4.6 per cent. Good progress has been made towards the 
ERV target of £125 million by December 2020, reflecting the growth 
prospects of the estate.
Capco continues to work closely with the community stakeholders 
including Westminster City Council (“WCC”) and Covent Garden 
Area Trust (“CGAT”) to maintain and celebrate the attributes which 
make the area unique.

Strong demand for space at Covent Garden from retailers 
continues with new rental tones being set. The 
repositioning of Floral Street as a fashion and lifestyle 
destination is underway. British heritage sportswear 
brand, Kent & Curwen, opened its first concept store under 
the partnership of creative director Daniel Kearns and 
business partner David Beckham at 12 Floral Street. In 
addition, multi-brand concept store, The Shop at Bluebird, 
has been signed to Carriage Hall. The store is scheduled to 
open in spring 2018, with the 15,000 square foot space 
housing two dedicated retail floors and a restaurant. 
In July, Petersham Nurseries opened its retail space, 
offering handpicked collections of homeware, furniture 
and gifts. The store is set in the Grade II listed building 
within the Floral Court development beneath three 
Victorian atria and surrounded by greenery. Petersham 
Nurseries has commenced fit-out of its restaurants in the 
courtyard of Floral Court which are scheduled to open in 
the coming months. 
The successful transformation of Henrietta Street has 
established a new menswear and dining destination in 
London. British men’s shoe brand Cheaney and 
outerwear clothing concept K-Way opened stores at the 
beginning of 2017. Australian eyewear brand, Bailey 
Nelson, opened its only UK store on Henrietta Street in 
September offering high quality opticals and sunglasses. 
The store complements the existing community of 
independent, British and global brands, representing the 
finest aspects of men’s retail, alongside high quality 
dining concepts on the street. 
NEW BRANDS ON FLORAL STREET

GIFTING AND ACCESSORIES, ROYAL OPERA HOUSE ARCADE 
N.Peal joined the selection of premium retailers that opened in 2017
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 26  Over 25 standalone beauty and fragrance boutiques form 
‘The Beauty Quarter’ at Covent Garden which continues 
to expand. Tom Ford and Deciem opened in the Market 
Building joining premium standalone beauty boutiques 
from Chanel and Dior. Floral Street Fragrance is the 
latest signing to Floral Court where customers can create 
their own four-piece fragrance in store. In addition, Bose 
has also taken space on King Street, offering innovative 
sound systems.
Capco has further strengthened the offering of gifting 
and premium accessories at the Royal Opera House 
Arcade signing leading travel accessory brand Tumi. This 
exciting addition joins the line-up of premium retailers 
which opened this year including luxury sunglasses 
brand Linda Farrow, British cashmere brand N.Peal and 
eyewear brand, Tom Davies. The British watch and 
accessories brand Olivia Burton is the latest signing to 
Covent Garden, joining watch brand Daniel Wellington 
which opened its first UK store in the Market Building 
earlier this year. 
Dining
Focusing on high quality and unique food concepts has 
been core to the dining strategy for Covent Garden. The 
restaurant leasing activity in 2017 further strengthened 
Covent Garden’s reputation as one of London’s best 
dining destinations.
The latest signing on James Street is a UK first, 
Wahlburgers, the casual dining burger restaurant and 
bar, offering a menu of high-quality homemade burgers 
and sandwiches, fresh salads and shakes at competitive 
prices. The signing sets a new rental tone for food and 
beverage on James Street and is expected to open towards 
the end of the year.
The Experimental Group have partnered with Michelin-
starred chef Ollie Dabbous to open their latest concept in 
London on Henrietta Street at The Henrietta Hotel. The 
concept includes a bar and restaurant offering a French 
seasonal menu as well as an 18-bedroom boutique hotel. 
Another successful addition to Henrietta Street is the 
highly rated seafood restaurant The Oystermen which 
provides a relaxed, affordable and fun dining experience 
offering oysters and seafood from the British Isles. 
British artisanal coffee shop Host has opened in the space 
alongside The Oystermen. 
Cora Pearl, a new 60 cover restaurant from the team 
behind renowned Mayfair establishment Kitty Fishers,  
is expected to open in spring 2018 within the ground and 
lower-ground floors of 30 Henrietta Street. 
Pancs have joined the Market Building, offering 
handcrafted pancakes, and the estate is set to  
welcome another UK first, Avobar, London’s first 
permanent avocado bar that will serve avocado based 
dishes. Egg’cellent serving a breakfast only menu using 
fresh and organic eggs will open shortly. These signings 
are in line with the strategy at Covent Garden to 
introduce high quality and interesting concepts to  
the estate. 
Petersham Nurseries deli opened 2017; restaurants La Goccia and The Petersham following soon

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Adding to the leisure offering is Z Hotels which has 
taken space on Bedford Street and will provide compact 
yet luxurious accommodation for visitors and is set to 
open in summer 2018. In addition, Capco has completed 
assembly of the Wellington block, which is a scarce 
island site in central London, through the acquisition of 
the last remaining unit, 23 Wellington Street in January 
2018. Development of the Wellington block presents a 
unique opportunity to continue Covent Garden’s 
transformation on the southern side of the estate. 
Other uses 
Covent Garden has become an attractive office location 
for professional services, creative industries and SMEs. 
Office space represents 11 per cent of the portfolio by 
value. A number of office lettings have been achieved 
successfully during the year and we continue to see 
strong interest from occupiers. 
Capco continues to restore the estate’s residential 
heritage. The most recent conversion at 26-27 
Southampton Street, a premium residential development 
with 10 apartments, completed earlier this year and units 
were successfully let in line with expectations. The final 
two units at The Beecham, a luxury development 
overlooking the Piazza, were sold in the first half of the 
year. The average sales price achieved across the scheme 
was £2,800 per square foot. Leasing demand for 
residential accommodation across the estate remains 
positive with a high rate of renewals recorded.

Acquisitions
Capco has continued to expand its presence on the estate 
through strategic acquisitions. During 2017, three new 
properties were acquired on Floral Street for a total 
consideration of £99.2 million (including purchaser’s 
costs) and represent £4.7 million of ERV. 
The acquisition of the long leasehold interest in 15-17 
Long Acre & 27b Floral Street for £85.8 million 
(including purchaser’s costs) further consolidates 
Capco’s presence on Floral Street. This prominent 
property, located at the western end of Floral Street, 
opposite the Floral Court development, benefits from 
dual frontage on both Floral Street and Long Acre and 
presents long-term asset management opportunities.
37 and 39 Floral Street were acquired for £5.9 million and 
£7.5 million respectively. Both properties are well-located 
at key access points to Floral Street and are well-placed to 
benefit from the repositioning of this strategic street. In 
addition, the acquisition of 23 Wellington Street 
exchanged and completed in January 2018. 
Developments  
Floral Court will provide over 85,000 square foot (NIA)  
of space with eight retail and two restaurant units as well 
as 45 apartments. The development of the commercial 
space nears completion. A new connecting courtyard 
between Floral Street and King Street is set to open in  
the coming months which will transform the pedestrian 
flow on the estate. 65 per cent of the commercial space 
has been let representing £2.4 million of income. 
Development of the 45 apartments is progressing well 
and is set to complete by mid-2018. 
At Carriage Hall, the refurbishment of 15,000 square  
feet (NIA) successfully completed and has been let to  
The Shop at Bluebird which is expected to open in  
spring 2018. 
The redevelopment of 11-12 Floral Street, the building 
formerly occupied by The Sanctuary, nears completion 
providing 27,000 square feet (NIA) and includes the 
creation of two new retail units with flagship potential, 
one of which has been let to British heritage sportswear 
brand Kent & Curwen. 
The development of Opera Terrace completed during  
the year. SushiSamba is currently fitting out the space 
and is scheduled to open later this year. 
Future Priorities 
Capco continues to implement its strategy for Covent 
Garden by focusing on creative asset management and 
investment, and attracting excellent retail brands and 
dining concepts to the estate. By introducing an 
interesting mix of British, global and independent 
brands to address the needs of the consumer, Capco aims 
to continue to capture the reversionary income potential 
of the portfolio and achieve ERV growth towards its 
target of £125 million by December 2020. 
Further to this, Capco is focused on making strategic 
investments to expand its ownership of the estate and 
enhancing the customer environment through creative 
asset management. As current capital initiatives 
including the Floral Court development near 
completion, the positioning of Floral Street as a fashion 
and lifestyle destination is an important priority. 
HENRIETTA STREET GOES FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH
Now established as a thriving destination for dining, 2017 has seen The Henrietta open  
its doors, the first hotel from The Experimental Group with restaurant by Ollie Dabbous
Pedestrianisation of King Street and the completion  
of Floral Court will continue to change the pedestrian 
flow on the estate, allowing for further repositioning 
opportunities. In addition, the southern side of the 
estate offers opportunities for repositioning including 
the Wellington block.
Building on the successful openings in 2017 including 
The Henrietta Hotel, The Oystermen, Tom Ford and 
Petersham Nurseries, 2018 will see even more retail 
and dining openings across the estate with brands 
such as SushiSamba, Mariage Frères, Wahlburgers and 
Cora Pearl which are expected to further strengthen 
the estate’s attractiveness as a leading retail and  
dining destination.

Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 30  OVERVIEW
Large-scale strategic opportunity in central London 
The Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area represents 
one of the most important mixed-use development sites in London 
with the potential to create a new district, delivering thousands  
of homes and jobs. The Earls Court Masterplan is a strategic 
opportunity for London with planning consent for 10.7 million 
square feet, including the Empress State Building.
The consented Masterplan provides for 7,500 new homes and  
is anticipated to create 10,000 jobs and deliver over £450 million  
of community benefits. The site is located within two London 
Boroughs, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (“RBKC”) 
and the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham (“LBHF”),  
is supported by excellent transport infrastructure and has the 
potential to deliver substantially more housing. 
Investments at Earls Court 
Earls Court Properties represents Capco’s investments within  
the Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area and 
principally comprises:
 ◦ 63 per cent interest in ECPL: the investment vehicle with TfL in 
respect of EC1 & EC2, and including certain assets on and around 
Lillie Road. Capco’s interests in ECPL were valued at £560.7 
million at 31 December 2017. ECPL land has detailed planning 
consent for 3.4 million square feet (GEA) and, following 
successful completion of the final phase of complex demolition 
works, is available for development. 
 ◦ 100 per cent of the Empress State Building (“ESB”) valued at 
£220.0 million at 31 December 2017. ESB has detailed planning 
consent to be converted from an office building into residential. 
ESB is let to MOPAC until June 2019 with a current passing rent 
of £17.0 million.
 ◦ 50 per cent interest in the Lillie Square joint venture, with  
Capco’s 50 per cent interest valued at £156.5 million at  
31 December 2017. Handover of Lillie Square Phase 1 is 
substantially complete and Phase 2 continues to progress. 
In addition, in 2013, Capco exercised its option under the 
Conditional Land Sale Agreement (“CLSA”), a binding agreement 
in relation to the West Kensington and Gibbs Green Estates  
(“the Estates”). To date, Capco has paid £75 million of the £105 
million cash consideration payable to LBHF including three of the 
five annual instalments of £15 million. 
Demolition works 
ECPL, the investment vehicle with TfL, owns 999 year leases over 
the EC1 & EC2 land together with certain adjacent properties 
primarily located on or around Lillie Road. Capco owns a 63 per 
cent share and is leading the venture in its role as business and 
development manager. 
The final phase of demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition 
Centres successfully completed on schedule in January 2018. The 
heavy lifting crane was the most visible part of the important site 
preparation. The crane successfully completed the lift of 61 concrete 
portal beams out from over the London Underground lines. 
Removal of the large portal beams, which supported the weight of 
the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres, concludes the complex 
demolition works, in preparation for future development, which 
has the flexibility to be brought forward through the introduction 
of third-party capital over time.

Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 32  Planning
In January 2017, detailed planning consent was granted by RBKC 
for Exhibition Square which is located at the entrance of the Earls 
Court estate adjacent to Earls Court Underground station. The 
consented scheme will create an important gateway to Earls Court 
and its new high street, including a public square and gardens, a 
signature hotel, offices and an entrance to Earls Court 
Underground station.
The Earls Court Masterplan remains one of the largest Opportunity 
Areas in central London, capable of delivering new homes, jobs and 
investment. Additional density could deliver much-needed homes 
for all Londoners, including additional affordable housing and a 
broad range of residential tenures. The GLA’s draft London Plan 
issued in December 2017 (“The Plan”), references the Earls Court 
Masterplan as ‘ready to grow’, demonstrating the site’s potential  
to deliver more housing and optimise this important London 
opportunity. In addition, The Plan estimates that the population  
of London will increase by 70,000 per annum, reaching 10.5 million 
in 2041. According to The Plan, London will need at least 66,000 
new homes annually. Opportunity Areas such as Earls Court are 
seen as vital in order to meet London’s demands.
Capco notes with disappointment the statement released by LBHF 
regarding the deliverability of ‘the proposed level of density and 
affordable housing’, however remains in discussions with LBHF 
including regarding the possibility of the Council taking the lead 
on future plans for the Estates, as part of the wider Masterplan. In 
the event that agreement is not reached with LBHF, the CLSA, a 
binding agreement in relation to the Estates, will remain in place. 
Capco will continue to seek to engage positively with all 
stakeholders in order to evolve the Masterplan to address the 
changing political landscape and prevailing market conditions. 
Due to the scale of the Earls Court Masterplan, there will remain  
a risk of protests and legal challenges (ranging from complaints 
about noise through to judicial reviews or applications for listing) 
against specific aspects of the development as it is progressed. It 
should be noted that all such challenges to date have been 
successfully defended however future challenges of this nature 
cannot be discounted.
West Brompton Crossing: temporary retail and leisure use
In November 2017, ECPL successfully launched a pop-up local  
high street for Earls Court, named West Brompton Crossing, with 
anchor tenant The Prince. The Prince is located on the junction  
of Lillie Road and Empress Place within a number of buildings 
brought back into temporary use, and features eateries including 
Patty & Bun, The Begging Bowl, MAM and Rabbit. The project 
marks a first for temporary retail and leisure use in the area, 
offering a parade of restaurants, bars, and shops that have proved  
a very popular addition to the area.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Lillie Square is a one million square foot (GEA) residential 
development located adjacent to the Earls Court Masterplan. The 
development can deliver over 600 private and 200 affordable homes 
across three phases. 
Handover of Phase 1 of Lillie Square nears completion with  
£98 million (Capco share) of proceeds received by the end of the year. 
Cumulative proceeds of £125 million (Capco share) are expected to 
have been received on Phase 1 over the coming months. Phase 2 
basement and frame works are underway, and the joint venture is in 
advanced negotiations with a contractor for the main construction 
contract. 50 per cent of the 186 apartments in the phase have been 
reserved or exchanged. 34 of these transacted during 2017, seven  
of which occurred during the second half of the year. Sales prices 
achieved in Phase 2 are at a modest premium to comparable units  
in Phase 1.
The Residents’ Clubhouse opened over the summer and has been 
very well-received by residents.

Future Priorities
Capco’s strategy is to drive long-term value creation 
through planning, land assembly, land enablement and 
selective development activities on its investments at 
Earls Court. 
Following a period of complex demolition works, the 
ECPL land is now available for development. Earls Court 
has the ability to evolve with the needs of London and its 
potential will be realised over time. Capco will continue 
to seek to engage positively with all stakeholders in order 
to evolve the Masterplan to address the changing 
political landscape and prevailing market conditions. 
The Masterplan has the flexibility to be brought forward 
through the introduction of third-party capital and 
selective development. 
At the Empress State Building, discussions continue with 
the tenant regarding its occupational requirements and 
at Lillie Square, the focus is on delivery of the remaining 
homes of Phase 1, ensuring a successful handover to all 
residents. On Phase 2, the focus remains on continued 
sales and completion of negotiations on the main 
construction contract, which is expected over the  
coming months.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
“Our capital structure positions the Group to withstand

 ◦ Total property value of £3.5 billion

 ◦ LTV of 21%
 ◦ Cash and undrawn facilities £691 million

1. Group share
Capco further strengthened its financial position during 2017 reducing loan to value to 21 per cent and increasing available liquidity to 
£691 million. This has been achieved by the realisation of value through the disposal of the Venues business and further enhancing the 
unsecured debt platform at Covent Garden by raising a further £225 million in the private placement market and extending the £705 
million revolving credit facility to 2022.
There was additional investment in Covent Garden of £177 million through developments, predominantly Floral Court, and £99 million  
of acquisitions which have served to increase the Group’s weighting in Covent Garden to 72 per cent. The value of the Covent Garden estate 
increased by 4.3 per cent (like-for-like) due to the rental growth achieved during the year, with ERV up by 4.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis.
Uncertainties in the broader political and economic environment continue to impact London residential property. As a result the market 
value of Earls Court Properties, which represents the Group’s interests at Earls Court, has decreased by 11.8 per cent (like-for-like). 
Overall, the Group share of the total property value has decreased by 0.9 per cent (like-for-like). EPRA net asset value per share decreased  
by 1.7 per cent during the year, from 339.6 pence at 31 December 2016 to 333.8 pence. This 5.8 pence decline together with the 1.5 pence 
dividend paid to shareholders resulted in a total return of -1.3 per cent.
Underlying earnings from continuing activities increased to £7.3 million due to higher net rental income and reduced administration 
expenses.
Basis of preparation
In line with the requirements of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, the Group is required to present its joint ventures under the equity method 
in the consolidated financial statements. Under the equity method, the Group’s interest in joint ventures is disclosed as a single line item 
in both the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement rather than proportionally consolidating the Group’s share of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis. 
Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”), being financial measures which are not specified under IFRS, are used by the Group to 
monitor the performance of the business. These include a number of the Financial Highlights shown on page 3. Many of the APMs included 
are based on the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations reporting framework which aims to improve the transparency, comparability and 
relevance of published results of public real estate companies in Europe. Further details on APMs are set out on page 141.

flows have been reported for the period 1 January 2017 to 7 April 2017 as having arisen from a discontinued operation. This extends to the 
prior period comparative which has been re-presented to reflect the disposal. Further information on the disposal of the Venues business  
is set out in note 12 ‘Discontinued Operation’.
The chart below sets out a summary of the main movements in the EPRA net asset value per share over the year.

Investment, development and trading property
The revaluation loss on the Group’s property portfolio was £37.6 million for the year, representing a 0.9 per cent decrease in value on a 
like-for-like basis compared with the IPD Capital Return for the equivalent period of 5.4 per cent. The Group revaluation loss consists of  
a £93.4 million gain at Covent Garden and a £131.0 million loss at Earls Court. 
Total property return for the year was 1.0 per cent. The IPD Total Return index recorded a 11.2 per cent return for the corresponding period. 
The total revaluation loss of £37.6 million consists of a £27.9 million loss on investment property and a £9.7 million loss on trading 
property. On an IFRS basis, which includes ECPL at 100 per cent and does not include Lillie Square on a line by line basis, loss on 
revaluation and sale of investment and development property was £90.9 million.
Trading property is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost and market value, therefore valuation surpluses on trading 
property are not recorded. Any unrecognised surplus is however reflected within the EPRA net asset value measure. During the year £6.6 
million of the unrealised trading property surplus has been realised. At 31 December 2017, the unrecognised surplus on trading property 
was £31.8 million (31 December 2016: £48.1 million) which now arises solely on the Group’s share of trading property at Lillie Square. 
Debt and gearing
During the year the Group’s share of total facilities increased by £24.5 million. During the first half of the year the Group terminated the 
£100 million Olympia Exhibitions Holdings Limited facility (of which £50 million was drawn prior to termination), the £85.5 million loan 
on the Empress State Building and £30 million (£15 million Group share) of the Lillie Square LP facility. In June, the Group signed an 
agreement with eight institutional investors for a private placement of £225 million with a range of maturities from 7 to 20 year senior 
unsecured notes, further enhancing the unsecured debt platform at Covent Garden. Closing occurred in August 2017 and proceeds were 
used to repay bank debt. In November 2017, the Group exercised the option under the £705 million Covent Garden debt facility to extend 
the full loan amount to 2022.
The Group’s cash and undrawn committed facilities at 31 December 2017 were £690.8 million (31 December 2016: £556.3 million). A 
reconciliation between IFRS and Group share is shown below:

1. Primarily Lillie Square.
2. Non-controlling interest represents TfL’s 37 per cent share of ECPL.
Net debt decreased by £114 million to £734 million, principally as a result of the disposal of the Venues business partly offset by further 
investment into our assets and the acquisitions at Covent Garden. As set out in the summary adjusted balance sheet, net debt on an IFRS 
basis was £748 million.
The gearing measure most widely used in the industry is loan to value (“LTV”). LTV is calculated on the basis of net debt divided by the 
carrying value of the Group’s property portfolio. The Group focuses most on an LTV measure that includes the notional share of joint 
venture interests but excludes the share of the non-controlling interest. The LTV of 21.3 per cent remains comfortably within the Group’s 
limit of no more than 40 per cent.

Interest cover 170% 173%
Weighted average debt maturity 6.9 years 5.9 years
Weighted average cost of debt 2.8% 2.7%
Gross debt with interest rate protection 91% 86%
The Group’s policy is to eliminate substantially the medium and long-term risk arising from interest rate volatility. The Group’s banking 
facilities are arranged on a floating rate basis but are generally swapped to fixed rate or capped using derivative contracts. At 31 December 
2017 the proportion of gross debt with interest rate protection was 91 per cent (31 December 2016: 86 per cent). 
The Group remains compliant with all of its debt covenants, details of which are set out on page 140, and has substantial levels of 
headroom against its covenants across all of its debt facilities. 
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 40  At 31 December 2017 the Group had capital commitments of £61.3 million (£156.6 million at 31 December 2016) of which Covent Garden 
represents £19.5 million and Earls Court Properties £41.8 million (including the £30.0 million of CLSA instalments and £7.0 million in 
relation to Lillie Square).

Conditional Land Sale Agreement (“CLSA”)
In November 2013 the Group exercised its option under the CLSA, which it entered into with LBHF, for the purchase of the West 
Kensington and Gibbs Green housing estates (the “Estates”). The overall consideration payable is expected to be £105 million cash plus the 
planning requirement to provide up to 760 replacement homes.
The CLSA remains unrecognised in the consolidated financial statements of the Group as its main underlying asset (the land relating to the 
Estates) does not currently meet the recognition criteria under IFRS required for investment and development property. Annual payments 
of £15 million commenced in December 2015 and will run through to December 2019. Where amounts are paid prior to the transfer of 
property, they will be carried on the Group’s balance sheet as prepayments against future land draw down. Of the £75 million paid to date, 
£15 million relates to the acquisition of two properties, held as investment and development property, and £60 million relates to options 
over the Estates which is held as a prepayment within other receivables. The remaining future payments totalling £30 million are disclosed 
as a capital commitment as referred to above. 
The prepayment balance will be transferred to investment and development property once the recognition criteria of investment and 
development property have been met. Once this occurs, in line with the Group’s accounting policy, the land will become subject to 
bi-annual valuation with any changes reflected in the Group’s reported net asset measure.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Financial review continued
Operating cash outflows of £24.0 million, of which £15.0 million relates to the CLSA annual payment, have decreased from £42.4 million 
for the year to 31 December 2016 as a result of changes in net working capital requirements. 
During the year, £170.2 million was invested at Covent Garden for the purchase of three properties and subsequent expenditure for the 
development of property predominantly at Floral Court. At Earls Court, total expenditure of £55.4 million comprises enablement works 
on ECPL land, construction of Lillie Square Phase 1, the acquisition of two properties and other subsequent expenditure.
The disposal of the Venues business resulted in a net inflow of £226 million after repayment of the £50 million drawn debt on the £100 
million Olympia Exhibitions Holdings Limited loan facility, working capital adjustments and transaction related costs. The proceeds were 
used to reduce the Group’s net debt position and will be deployed in Capco’s core central London estates.
Net sales proceeds from trading property comprise of £95.9 million, Group share, for the disposal of 177 units at Lillie Square (£92.0 
million) and for the sale of the final two residential units at The Beecham, Covent Garden (£3.9 million). Disposal of investment property 
net of payments in relation to investments resulted in proceeds of £8.7 million being received during the year.
Net borrowings repaid during the period were £75.7 million. 
Dividends paid of £6.7 million reflect the final dividend payment made in respect of the 2016 financial year and the interim dividend paid 
in September 2017. This was lower than the previous year due to a higher take up of the scrip dividend alternative, 47 per cent versus 41 per 
cent in 2016.

2. Lillie Square and Innova Investments.
3. Non-controlling interest represents TfL’s 37 per cent share of ECPL.
Income
Net rental income has increased by £8.3 million (14.4 per cent) during the year mainly as a result of the positive performance at Covent 
Garden (up 11.3 per cent like-for-like). Of the increase, £5.4 million has been achieved on the like-for-like portfolio as the Group continues 
to convert the reversionary potential into contracted rents. A further £2.9 million has been added through prior and current year 
acquisitions with the remaining increase resulting from the net effect of disposals and properties classified as development. At Covent 
Garden gross income has increased by 15.4 per cent from £52.1 million in 2016 to £60.1 million whilst ERV has increased by 9.2 per cent 
from £96.0 million in 2016 to £104.8 million.
Loss on revaluation and sale of investment and development property
The loss on revaluation and sale of the Group’s investment and development property was £28.0 million. Covent Garden recorded a gain 
on revaluation of £93.4 million as a result of rental growth. The loss on revaluation at Earls Court of £121.4 million was driven by changes 
in valuers’ assumptions and is reflective of recent evidence. 
Administration expenses
Administration expenses have decreased by £3.2 million on a headline basis. The prior year included a £2.0 million credit for performance 
related employment costs and an assumed allocation of £4.0 million of head office costs to the Venues business. Allowing for these items, 
like-for-like administration expenses of £38.7 million compared with £47.9 million in 2016, a decrease of 19.2 per cent. 
Net finance costs
Net finance costs have increased marginally to £19.8 million due to the higher level of average borrowings during the year. 
www.capitalandcounties.com 43 
Governance Financial statements Strategic report Financial review continued
Taxation
The total tax charge for the year, made up of both underlying tax and non-underlying tax, is £6.7 million. 
Tax on underlying profits of the Group was £2.7 million, which reflects a rate in line with the current rate of UK corporation tax. The main 
rate of corporation tax reduced from 20 per cent to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017. The corporation tax rate will further reduce to 17 per cent 
from 1 April 2020.
Contingent tax, the amount of tax that would become payable on a theoretical disposal of all investment property held by the Group, was 
nil (31 December 2016: nil). A disposal of the Group’s trading properties at their market value net of available losses would result in a 
corporation tax charge to the Group of £1.6 million (19.25 per cent of £8.3 million).
The provisions of IAS 12 provide for the recognition of a deferred tax asset where it is probable there will be future taxable profit against 
which a deductible temporary difference can be utilised. As a result of the application of this provision, the Group has not recognised the 
deferred tax asset on decreases to the carrying value of investment property and certain losses carried forward.
The Group’s tax policy, which has been approved by the Board and is available on the Group website, is aligned with the business strategy. 
The Group seeks to protect shareholder value by structuring operations in a tax efficient manner, with external advice as appropriate,  
which complies with all relevant tax law and regulations and does not adversely impact our reputation as a responsible taxpayer. As a 
Group, we are committed to acting in an open and transparent manner.
Consistent with the Group’s policy of complying with relevant tax legislation and its goal in respect of its stakeholders, the Group 
maintains a constructive and open working relationship with HM Revenue & Customs which regularly includes obtaining advance 
clearance on key transactions where the tax treatment may be uncertain.
Dividends
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share to be paid on 23 May 2018 to shareholders on the register at 20 April 2018. 
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to offer a scrip dividend alternative. 
Going concern
At 31 December 2017 the Group’s cash and undrawn committed facilities were £690.8 million and its capital commitments were £61.3 million. 
With a weighted average debt maturity of 6.9 years, loan to value of 21.3 per cent and sufficient headroom against all financial covenants,  
there continues to be a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group will have adequate resources to meet both ongoing and future 
commitments for at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. Accordingly, the Directors consider it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 2017 Annual Report & Accounts.

Corporate responsibility
CORPORATE 
RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
It is important to us that we conduct our business in a responsible way. Our programme of 
Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) initiatives sits at the core of Capco’s business, with a focus on 
three core themes: people, community and environment, underpinned by a commitment to the 
highest standards of business practices.
Although Capco owns assets totalling £3.5 billion, the Company is managed by a relatively small team of people. Our employees 
are therefore key to the success of our business and we provide a range of support and training opportunities that enable us to 
develop the right talent to implement our strategy and help individuals to maximise their potential. 
As long-term stewards of two major London estates we support initiatives that aim to address social problems faced by the 
communities in which our estates are located. Our work with these communities focuses on initiatives that maximise 
opportunities for young people, address homelessness and support ex-military and emergency services personnel. 
We are committed to minimising the impact of our operations on the environment, employing a forward-looking approach to air 
quality, environmental and sustainability issues, and implementing initiatives which improve the quality of the environment for 
all, such as pedestrianisation and increasing greenery at Covent Garden. 
We target the highest standards of health and safety and ethical practices in areas such as modern slavery, tax evasion and bribery 
and corruption, and expect the same standards from our suppliers. 
Community and environmental initiatives across the business are managed by our asset teams and overseen by the CR Executive 
Committee. This report provides updates on the progress made against our 2017 CR targets, and explains more about our activities 
in each of our areas of focus.

TALENT
Our aim is to manage talent effectively and ensure that we have 
sufficient capability to realise our ambitious strategy. We regularly 
undertake succession planning exercises to review the talent 
pipeline and progress individuals according to capability.
We have a graduate recruitment programme for top graduates  
who pursue an internal programme of training and mentoring, 
which will ensure they are well prepared for the Royal Institution 
of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Assessment of Professional 
Competence (“APC”). Each graduate is assigned an experienced 
Capco counsellor and supervisor who guide them through the  
APC process.
New opportunities that arise in the business are advertised 
internally and we aim to promote internal candidates in order  
to enhance career development and encourage mobility across  
the Company.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
Capco training and development programmes are designed  
to augment the bench strength of our teams and challenge  
aspiring leaders.
Individual training and development needs are identified and 
discussed at performance review meetings with line managers. 
During 2017, our employees recorded 493 hours of training activity.
Through our sponsorship of individuals undertaking further 
professional qualifications, we encourage continuous learning, 
reflecting our intention to create a knowledgeable environment.
We recognise that coaching and mentoring can have significant 
impact on behaviours and key employees continue to benefit  
from bespoke coaching programmes.
PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
Annual performance objectives for individuals are agreed at 
performance review meetings, which take place at the beginning  
of the calendar year. Performance is measured against objectives  
set for the previous year and individual performance ratings 
underpin discretionary bonus awards, which are paid in April  
of each year.
We regard the giving of regular and direct feedback as a core 
competency of effective leadership and encourage line managers  
to appraise performance regularly during the year.
CULTURE
The high-performance culture at Capco is reflective of our 
ambitious and innovative business strategy. Typically, Capco 
people are results-driven and brave in their approach to new ideas. 
Many of our people are in new roles and have assumed increased 
levels of responsibility since joining Capco.
We have a good track record of supporting employee development 
and promoting from within the business. We aim to fill vacancies 
from our existing people where possible.
We support new parents returning to the workplace and encourage 
our people to adopt a healthy attitude to work-life balance.
PEOPLE
People are the key to our success and we are

insurance and dental cover. The Company contributes up to  
10 per cent of salary into the MyCapco pension scheme.
Our policy is to enable employees to take their full annual leave 
entitlement of 28 days per annum, rising to 30 days after four  
years’ service.

REWARD
The aim of our reward strategy is to compensate people for  
high performance and to incentivise them to strive to improve.
Core compensation packages at Capco comprise three elements  
of base salary, discretionary performance bonus and discretionary 
share awards.
We regularly benchmark our approach to reward to ensure that  
we are competitive in the market and we aim to remain within the 
upper quartile range of our sector.
Awards are made in April of each year and take account of 
performance ratings discussed at performance review meetings  
in January.
All Capco employees are eligible to receive share awards  
so that everyone can participate in the success of the Company. 
These awards have a three-year performance period and are  
subject to corporate performance conditions.
DIVERSITY
We believe that every person in the Company has a part to play in 
generating value and we understand fully the benefits of a diverse 
workforce. Diversity is considered when making appointments  
at all levels. As a sign of our commitment to diversity in the work 
place our Chief Executive, Ian Hawksworth, is supporting the  
“CEO Commitments for Diversity”, an initiative spearheaded by 
Real Estate Balance. 
We are keen to develop female talent across the business and 
provide executive coaching to our senior leadership team. There is 
strong female representation across the business. A summary of 
gender diversity across the Company is set out to the right.
We support a number of initiatives which aim to increase diversity 
within the property industry, including being a signatory to the 
RICS Inclusive Employer Quality Mark, a member of the Employers 
Network for Equality and Inclusion (“ENEI”), a member of Real 
Estate Balance, a sponsor of the Reading Real Estate Foundation 
and supporting the Pathways to Property work experience 
programme.
HUMAN RIGHTS
This report does not contain specific information on human rights 
issues as this is not considered necessary for an understanding of 
the development, performance or position of the Company’s 
business. However, Capco has adopted a CR policy and a supply 
chain policy which reflect a responsible approach to human rights.
MODERN SLAVERY
In accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Board has 
approved a Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, 
which has been published on our website. The statement details  
the steps we take to avoid slavery and human trafficking in our  
own operations and in our supply chain. We believe that our own 
operations present minimal risk, but recognise that a higher level 
of risk is posed by the suppliers we engage with to provide goods 
and services. 
During 2017 we undertook an extensive assessment of a major 
development site within the Capco portfolio in conjunction with 
the contractor with the objective of better understanding whether 
the policies and procedures in place are sufficient to mitigate the 
risks of modern slavery in the supply chain. The assessment 
included interviews with management personnel from the 
contractor and also sub-contractor site workers. A follow-up 
meeting was held with the contractor to discuss findings and 
recommendations from the assessment. We also delivered bespoke 
training on modern slavery and human trafficking to relevant 
employees and incorporated further information on Capco’s 
expectations in relation to modern slavery into our procurement 
processes and policies. In the year ahead we plan to provide further 
guidance to our employees and continue our ongoing engagement 
with our suppliers.

London Community Foundation
In collaboration with the London Community Foundation, we have 
donated £45,000 to provide grants to support the community 
activity in the Earls Court area.
Through this programme, we support groups which deliver 
activities and services that benefit residents and the community. 
The projects fall under one of the three criteria of Get fit, Get 
support and Get involved. This year we have supported a number of 
youth projects, computer coding classes, homework clubs, creative 
writing classes, boxing classes, nutrition and well-being projects 
and trips for older people.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMES
Apple Market Challenge
The hugely successful Apple Market Challenge entered its 11th year 
and has involved over 6,500 children since its inception in 2006. 
This is run in conjunction with the sixth form students at a 
Business Enterprise School, Ursuline High School Wimbledon. 
Teenagers from ten schools, including both the Covent Garden 
primary schools, presented products that could be sold from the 
Apple Market in the Covent Garden Market Building. 
Newsround project
Employees from the Covent Garden office actively engaged in a 
“Newsround” project with children from both Covent Garden 
primary schools. Teams from both schools prepared news-based 
videos relating to topics relevant to schoolchildren in Covent 
Garden, such as antisocial behaviour and safety. 
Earls Court
During the year Capco worked with children from four primary 
schools in the Earls Court area on a range of educational projects 
focused on Earls Court. The projects included researching the 
history of the Earls Court area, exploring the changing nature of 
urban landscapes and what makes a great place, learning about the 
demolition and construction processes being followed at Earls 
Court, visits to the Earls Court Project Room and Lillie Square 
construction site, and viewing the heavy lifting crane. 
Urban Plan Project
We collaborated with the Urban Land Institute on their Urban  
Plan Project. This programme helps young people understand the 
role the real estate industry plays in reviving and regenerating 
urban areas and brings to life the urban environment through a 
series of interactive workshops and team challenges. Two projects 
for Year 12 students were run at Chelsea Academy during 2017.

ENVIRONMENT
Capco aims to minimise the impact of our 
operations on the environment. We apply  
a responsible and forward-looking approach  
to environmental issues and the principles  
of sustainability.
ENERGY & CARBON MANAGEMENT
In 2017, we reduced our energy use and carbon emissions by six per 
cent and seven per cent respectively on a like-for-like basis 
compared with 2016, exceeding our reduction target of three per 
cent. Steps to improve the energy efficiency of our assets remained  
a key focus and, as part of major refurbishment works, we have 
installed more efficient boilers, lighting and improved heating  
and cooling controls. 
At Covent Garden the roll-out of LED lighting continues across the 
estate, solar panels were installed at Carriage Hall and we continue 
to purchase electricity via green energy tariffs to further reduce our 
carbon footprint. 
Throughout the year we have closely monitored the Energy 
Performance Certificate (“EPC”) ratings of our assets and have 
taken action to increase the number of assets with an EPC rating  
of at least an “E”. For Phase 1 of Lillie Square we achieved our target 
of all apartments achieving at least an EPC “C” rating. In 2018, with 
the introduction of the government’s Minimum Energy Efficiency 
Standards (“MEES”), our activities to upgrade assets with an EPC 
rating lower than an “E” will continue. 
AIR QUALITY
In 2017, we sought to gain an improved understanding of air quality 
within Covent Garden and funded the repair of an air quality 
monitor located in Covent Garden. The air quality is monitored  
via an application called “London Air” which is run in conjunction 
with King’s College London. Covent Garden regularly records the 
lowest level of air pollution measured by the application. 
In 2017 the GLA designated Covent Garden and our neighbours  
the Northbank Business Improvement District as one of only two 
“Business Low Emission Neighbourhoods” in Westminster. We 
continue to work collaboratively to further enhance air quality in 
the district.
WASTE & WATER MANAGEMENT
Minimising the amount of waste sent to landfill and improving 
recycling rates are ongoing priorities across our estates. Within  
our offices we have continued to promote recycling by sharing 
recycling statistics via the intranet, and continue to divert all  
waste from landfill. 
As part of the waste consolidation strategy at Covent Garden, we 
have engaged with tenants to raise awareness of the importance  
of recycling and the waste collections services available. Over a third 
of estate waste was recycled, with the remaining waste being sent to 
an energy from waste plant that helped to generate 185 megawatts 
of energy.
We are actively monitoring water consumption and identifying 
opportunities to reduce usage. Rainwater harvesting has been 
installed to help supply the irrigation to the Covent Garden living 
wall and water efficient fittings are being installed as part of 
refurbishment works.
Reduced energy use by six per cent compared with 2016 on a 
like-for-like basis, exceeding our three per cent reduction target.
Awarded BREEAM Very Good certification for the 
refurbishment of Carriage Hall and Level 4 Code for 
Sustainable Homes certification for Phase 1 of Lillie Square. 
Installed a vibrant living wall in Covent Garden covering  
1,500 square feet and containing 8,000 plants.
Diverted 99 per cent of non-hazardous demolition waste  
from landfill at Earls Court with nearly two thirds of 
demolition material being re-used either on-site or on other 
construction projects.
Achieved a “Silver” and “Most Improved” award in the EPRA 
Sustainability Best Practice Recommendations for reporting 
awards and upgraded our performance in the CDP and  
GRESB benchmarks.
2017 ACHIEVEMENTS
Energy & carbon management
Continue our efforts to lower energy use and carbon emissions 
and maintain a target of three per cent energy reduction for 
managed assets on a like-for-like basis compared with 2017.
Waste & water management
Continue to pursue the goal of waste consolidation and 
improve recycling rates across our estates, working in 
partnership with our tenants and contractors. 
Identify opportunities to reduce water consumption for 
managed assets. 
Responsible development
Continue to embed sustainability into the delivery of our 
projects and work towards a minimum rating of BREEAM 
Very Good on major construction projects and, where existing 
planning conditions apply, Code for Sustainable Homes Level 
4 certification.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, Capco continues to monitor and 
report on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its operations. We have used DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidelines and  
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate emissions. We have adopted the operational 
control consolidation method, as this reflects where we have the ability to influence energy use, and we have set a materiality threshold  
of five per cent for greenhouse gas reporting purposes.
Capco has engaged with Carbon Credentials Energy Services Limited to provide independent verification of the 2017 greenhouse gas 
emissions assertion in accordance with industry recognised standard ISO 14064-3.

1. The market-based method reports emissions as tonnes of carbon dioxide (tCO2). Factors such as the addition of new electricity supplies for Lillie Square Phase 1, higher supplier 
emission factors and changes of supplier have led to an increase in market-based emissions.
2. The location-based method reports emissions as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). The sale of Olympia London in April 2017 caused a notable reduction in  
location-based emissions.
RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT
Capco is committed to integrating responsible and sustainable 
practices into the delivery of our projects and development. Efforts 
to certify our major construction projects to industry sustainability 
standards continue with the refurbishment of Regal House 
receiving our first Ska rating of Silver, Carriage Hall achieving 
BREEAM Very Good status and Phase 1 of Lillie Square attaining 
Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4 certification. 
At Earls Court the responsible management of demolition waste 
has been a key priority. By identifying opportunities to re-use 
material on site and carefully segregating waste streams for 
recycling, we have diverted 99 per cent of non-hazardous waste 
from landfill. 
In 2017, we also focused on introducing more planting and 
greenery across our portfolio. At Covent Garden we installed a 
living wall covering over 1,500 square feet and containing over 
8,000 plants to refine the quality of the air, increase the area’s 
biodiversity and capture pollution particles. We also introduced 
further flower crates and barrows across the estate. At Lillie Square, 
we introduced a series of new gardens, created by award-winning 
landscape designer Andy Sturgeon. The contemporary gardens 
introduced 95 new trees, over 100 different species of plants and 
bird, bat and hedgehog boxes to the area. 
Capco remains an active member of the UK Green Building Council. 
SUSTAINABILITY INDICES
We monitor and report our performance in line with industry 
sustainability benchmarks. In 2017 we remained a participant  
in the FTSE4Good Index, responded to the CDP climate change 
programme, achieving an “A” rating, and achieved four green stars  
in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark. Following  
our incorporation of the EPRA Sustainability Best Practice 
Recommendations for reporting, we achieved our first Silver award 
and a Most Improved award. For more information on our reporting

HEALTH AND SAFETY
We are committed to providing the highest 
standards of health and safety at our assets to 
minimise the risk to our employees, contractors, 
consultants and visitors. We expect our supply

OUR COMMITMENTS IN 2018
MILESTONES
During 2017 a number of key projects were safely completed in 
partnership with our contractors. These included the complex 
removal of the 61 concrete portal beams that sat above the London 
Underground lines at Earls Court and supported the weight of the 
former Exhibition Centre, the practical completion of the first phase 
of residential development at Lillie Square and commencement of 
sub-structure and frame works for the second phase of the scheme, 
and the completion of the 11 Floral Street development project.
In addition, Capco became a Client Partner of the Considerate 
Constructors Scheme (the “Scheme”), reflecting the Company’s 
commitment to ensuring that our contractors provide the highest 
standards of health and safety on Group construction projects. As a 
Client Partner, Capco encourages the contractors we engage to be 
registered with the Scheme. We expect compliance with all aspects 
of the Scheme’s Code on our registered sites.
GOVERNANCE
At a Group level the governance and reporting framework 
implemented during 2016 is now fully embedded across the 
business. The Sector Safety Leadership Teams (“SSLTs”) met 
regularly during the year to consider health and safety matters for 
each asset and to implement the Group’s Occupational Health and 
Safety Management System (“OH&SMS”) at operational level. 
The SSLTs are overseen by the Group Safety Leadership Team 
(“GSLT”), which is chaired by our General Counsel & Director of 
Corporate Services and championed by the Managing Director and 
Chief Investment Officer, who is responsible for health and safety at 
Board level. The GSLT reviews health and safety performance across 
the Group regularly throughout the year, and facilitates the sharing 
of lessons learnt and best practice across the management team.
Health and safety is a standing item on the Board’s agenda and the 
Board receives regular formal reports on health and safety, 
summarising health and safety performance, risks and 
achievements across the Group.
In line with our OHSAS 18001 compliant OH&SMS a detailed health 
and safety management review was undertaken during the year to 
ensure that the system remained appropriate and continued to 
operate effectively. A detailed review of fire safety issues, including 
fire protection measures across the Group’s assets, was also 
undertaken and no areas of concern were identified. 
Capco’s Group-wide business continuity and major incident 
response plans were tested and refreshed during 2017, using 
scenario-based desktop exercises focused on each asset.
REPORTING
No work-related employee fatalities were recorded in 2017 or since 
Capco’s inception. There was a total of six RIDDOR incidents 
reported across the Group during 2017, comprising one RIDDOR on 
the Covent Garden estate and five RIDDOR incidents recorded 
involving employees of our contractors working on our development 
projects. The Accident Frequency Rate (“AFR”) for Capco 
development projects at the end of 2017 stood at 0.34. We benchmark 
our development projects’ AFR against the Health and Safety 
Executive (“HSE”) Construction Industry Standard of 0.77. Capco’s 
Lost Time Incident Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) for 2017 was 0.48.
TRAINING
Bespoke health and safety training was delivered to senior employees 
during the year. In addition, members of operational management 
attended an IOSH Directing Safely course, and an IOSH Managing 
Safely course was delivered to the property and project management 
teams. Further training was attended by our first-aiders.

Corporate governance report
OUR GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
Ian Durant, Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2017 Corporate Governance 
Report.
A key focus of the Board during 2017 was consideration of 
corporate strategy in light of the ongoing uncertain market 
conditions and political outlook. Management is implementing 
the strategy within a robust governance framework, which 
includes a commitment to the highest standards of business 
practice and ethics. 
The Corporate Governance Statement, together with the 
Committee reports that follow, explain how Capco’s governance 
framework works and how the Company applied the principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code during the year. We also 
provide information on some of the management committees 
that support the controls and reporting framework across the 
Group and constitute an environment of integrity, transparency 
and openness. I am pleased to confirm that this governance 
framework continues to ensure that the Company operates 
effectively. Capco’s governance regime reflects the nature of the 
Company, including our large property holdings in well known 
London locations, Covent Garden and Earls Court, and the 
relatively small executive team in a business which now 
employs about 100 people directly. 
During the year, there were a number of changes to the Board. 
In January, Situl Jobanputra took up his new position as Chief 
Financial Officer, and we welcomed Charlotte Boyle to the 
Board in October. We were sorry to lose Demetra Pinsent from 
the Board during the year as a result of the increasing time 
requirements of her other roles. 
Promoted from within the business, Situl’s appointment reflects 
Capco’s commitment to developing the talent of our employees. 
Charlotte is an experienced board adviser and brings expertise in 
people matters including remuneration, talent development and 
succession planning as well as a close knowledge of UK Real 
Estate leadership. I am delighted to report that both Situl and 
Charlotte have settled in well and are accordingly effective in 
their new roles. You can read more about Capco’s recruitment 
process and the tailored inductions that we provide to new 
Directors in the Nomination Committee Report from page 65. 
Board composition and succession planning remains an area of 
focus for the Board and regular reviews are undertaken to ensure 
that the Board has, and will continue to have, the appropriate 
mix of skills and experience to deliver Capco’s strategic goals. As 
part of this process an updated Board diversity policy has been 
adopted, which is described in greater detail within the 
Nomination Committee Report. During 2018, the Board will 
carefully consider the implications of any updates to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code arising from the Financial 
Reporting Council’s ongoing consultation.
All of the Directors will be seeking election or re-election at our 
AGM. Andrew Strang, Henry Staunton and Graeme Gordon have 
each served on the Board for more than six years. Accordingly, 
before recommending that they be reappointed, the Nomination 
Committee gave particular consideration to the contribution of 
each Director and the balance of independence of the Board.
Capco has its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and 
is also listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and over 50 
per cent of the Company’s shares are now held by South African 
investors. There are sometimes different market expectations in 
the UK and South Africa, and one example of this is the level of 
authority to issue new shares that shareholders expect to grant to 
boards. The Board feels that, to preserve flexibility, it is 
appropriate to seek the higher levels of authority expected by UK 
shareholders where possible. This has resulted in significant 
votes against two of our AGM resolutions and Capco’s inclusion 
in The Investment Association’s public register of shareholder 
dissent. The Board will maintain dialogue with our South 
African shareholders on this topic as we move into 2018.

 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE  
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Company has applied the principles and complied with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
during 2017.
“A governance framework that 
supports the achievement of 
Capco’s strategic objectives.” www.capitalandcounties.com 57 
Financial statements Strategic report Governance
 THE BOARD
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success  
of the Company, and for its leadership, strategy, values, standards, 
control and management. Day-to-day management of the Group  
is delegated to the Executive Directors, subject to formal delegated 
authority limits; however, certain matters have been reserved for 
Board approval. These matters are reviewed annually and include 
Board and Committee composition, strategy, significant funding 
decisions and corporate transactions, delegated authority limits 
and dividend policy.
Board composition
As at 31 December 2017, the Board comprised the Chairman, three 
Executive Directors and six Non-executive Directors. The table on 
page 58 summarises the membership of the Board and Committees.
Biographies of each of the Directors can be found on pages 54 and 
55 and additional information on Directors’ skills and experience is 
included on page 67.
Board independence
The Code requires that, excluding the Chairman, at least half of  
the Board should comprise Non-executive Directors determined  
to be independent.
The Board has considered the independence of the Non-executive 
Directors, including potential conflicts of interest, and the table  
on page 58 sets out those Directors considered to be independent  
in character and judgement. Each of these Directors has also 
confirmed that there is no reason why they should not continue  
to be considered independent.
In considering Director independence, the Board concluded that 
Directors’ tenure should be counted from the date of their first 
election by shareholders to the Capco Board.
The key responsibilities of Board members are set out in the table on page 59.
THE BOARD IN 2017
The Board met formally throughout the year with main meetings 
timed around the financial calendar, and additional meetings 
convened to consider specific matters as required. Attendance  
at Board and Committee meetings held during 2017 is shown  
on page 61.
The annual Board calendar includes a two-day strategy meeting.  
At this meeting the Board receives detailed updates from external 
advisers and business divisions, and is able to consider strategic 
issues in depth, and spend time with members of senior 
management in a less formal environment.
Board papers are circulated a week in advance of meetings to ensure 
that Directors have sufficient time to consider their content prior  
to the meeting. If matters require approval at short notice, written 
approval is sought from the Directors.
The Chairman meets regularly with the Non-executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors being present and maintains 
regular contact with both the Chief Executive and members  
of senior management.
As matters that require the Board’s decision are often large, 
complex and evolve over a period of time, informal update 
meetings are held between Board meetings to allow Board 
members adequate time to explore, understand and challenge 
matters under consideration. These are often combined with site 
visits and provide an opportunity for the Non-executive Directors 
to meet senior management. Four such updates were held during 
2017, including a visit to the Earls Court Project Room.
During 2017, the Board received regular asset, financial and 
performance updates from the Executive Directors and senior 
management from each asset and reports from the General Counsel 
& Director of Corporate Services (“General Counsel”), the Company 
Secretary and Committee Chairmen. The table below shows the key 
areas considered by the Board during the year.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees to enable the Board to operate effectively and ensure  
a strong governance framework for decision making.
Each Committee has written terms of reference which are reviewed 
annually. The terms of reference can be viewed on the Company’s 
website www.capitalandcounties.com. Minutes of all Committee 
meetings are made available to all Directors. The Committee 
Chairmen attend the AGM to answer any questions on the 
Committees’ activities. 
A number of management committees support the business  
in delivering its strategy.
A summary of the role of each Committee is shown on page 58, and the activity  
of each Committee during 2017 is described on pages 62 to 86.

 ENSURING AN EFFECTIVE BOARD
To ensure that Capco’s Board continues to be effective, the Board 
conducts an annual evaluation of its own performance and that of 
its Committees and Directors. Following an external evaluation in 
2016, in 2017 an internal evaluation was managed by the Chairman 
and Company Secretary. Using an online questionnaire, Directors 
and the General Counsel were each asked to rate and provide 
anonymous feedback on a wide range of matters relating to the 
performance of the Board, its Committees and its Directors. A 
report which summarised the responses to the evaluation was 
considered by the Board and it was concluded that the Board 
continues to operate well. A number of minor proposals arising 
from the evaluation will be implemented. 
In addition, the Senior Independent Director conducted an 
appraisal of the Chairman’s performance which confirmed the 
Board’s continued confidence in the Chairman and that the 
Directors are satisfied that the Chairman continues to commit 
sufficient time to the Company. The Chairman also undertook 
appraisals of the other Directors’ performance.
COMMUNICATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Our policy
The Board is keen to ensure that our shareholders and potential 
investors have a good understanding of Capco’s business  
and performance, and that Directors are aware of any issues  
and concerns that shareholders may have. The Company 
communicates with stakeholders in a number of ways:
Corporate website
Our corporate website www.capitalandcounties.com allows  
visitors to access Company information, annual reports, results 
presentations and webcasts. The site also includes links to our 
division websites and contact details for shareholder queries.
Annual General Meeting
Our AGM allows the Board to update our shareholders on Capco’s 
progress, and provides an opportunity for shareholders to put 
questions to the Directors, and meet senior executives.
Shareholders are encouraged to vote on the resolutions put to  
the meeting, either in person, online or by submitting a proxy card.  
We publish the results of the votes on all resolutions on our website 
following the meeting.
Our 2018 AGM will be held on Friday 4 May 2018. The notice of 
Annual General Meeting will be issued to shareholders at least  
20 working days before the meeting. Separate resolutions will  
be proposed on each issue and, in accordance with the Code,  
each Director will offer themselves for election or re-election.
The Chairman, Chairmen of the Board Committees and other 
Directors will be available at the AGM to meet shareholders  
and answer any questions.
Should shareholders have any concerns that they are unable to 
successfully resolve following communication with the Chairman, 
Chief Executive or Chief Financial Officer, they may raise them 
through the Senior Independent Director.
 ACTIONS FOR 2018
 ◦ Create additional time for debate by 
considering certain matters on a by 
exception basis

 Communications with shareholders and other stakeholders
Communication with the Company’s investors is a priority for  
the Board. The Company runs an extensive investor relations 
programme, and the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and 
Head of Investor Relations hold meetings with institutional 
investors throughout the year, including results presentations, 
webcasts, roadshows, one-to-one meetings and investor tours.
The Company’s major shareholders are encouraged to meet with 
the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director to discuss  
any matters they may wish to raise. During 2017, Directors engaged 
with shareholders on matters including the remuneration policy 
and authorities to allot shares (subsequently approved at the 2017 
AGM) and Capco’s approach to Board diversity. 
The Directors receive regular updates on the Company’s major 
shareholders, and receive reports on shareholder feedback at  
each Board meeting. The Non-executive Directors are invited  
to attend the Company’s results presentations.
Private shareholders may raise questions through the  
Company Secretary’s office either by telephone or by email 
(feedback@capitalandcounties.com).
The Company maintains active relations with community 
stakeholders.
Please see pages 49 and 50 in the CR Report for more details of Capco’s  
stakeholder engagement.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND  
TIME COMMITMENTS
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to 
authorise potential conflicts of interest that may arise. The Board 
has adopted a procedure under which Directors must notify the 
Chairman of any potential conflicts. The Chairman then decides 
whether a conflict exists and recommends its authorisation by  
the Board where appropriate. In cases where there is a potential 
conflict of interest, an appropriate protocol to be followed where  
a conflict of interest may arise is agreed. In addition, a Director who 
had a conflict of interest would not be counted in the quorum or 
entitled to vote when the Board considered the matter in which  
the Director had an interest. The interests of new Directors are 
reviewed during the recruitment process and, if appropriate, 
authorised by the Board on appointment.
On appointment, and each subsequent year, Non-executive 
Directors are required to confirm in writing that they have 
sufficient time to devote to the Company’s affairs. In addition,  
they are required to seek prior approval from the Chairman before 
taking on any additional external commitments that may affect 
their time available to devote to the Company, and the Board is 
advised of any changes.
The Chairman is also Chairman of Greggs plc and DFS Furniture 
plc. As part of the Senior Independent Director’s annual evaluation 
of the Chairman’s performance, Directors were specifically asked to 
consider whether the Chairman’s external commitments prevent 
him from devoting sufficient time to perform his duties as 
Chairman of Capco, and it was concluded that the Company 
continues to receive the appropriate time required.
The Board is satisfied that all Non-executive Directors are 
contributing effectively to the operation of the Board. 
DTR DISCLOSURE
The disclosures required under DTR 7.2 of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules are contained in this report, and the Audit 
Committee and Nomination Committee Reports, except for 
information required under DTR 7.2.6 which is contained in  
the Directors’ Report on pages 87 and 88. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 62 
Audit Committee report
The Audit Committee, reporting to the Board, oversees the 
financial reporting process, monitors the effectiveness of internal 
control, internal audit, risk management and the statutory audit 
and monitors the independence of the statutory auditors and the 
provision of non-audit services. As at 31 December 2017 and the  
date of this report, the Committee comprises three independent 
Non-executive Directors and is chaired by Henry Staunton who  
is considered to have significant, recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Board believes that the Committee as a whole  
has competence in real estate matters.
The Committee’s meetings were also attended by the Company’s 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, General 
Counsel, Company Secretary and Financial Controller, together 
with senior representatives of the external and internal auditors.
The valuers and members of senior management, including the 
Director of Finance, attended by invitation to present reports 
required for the Committee to discharge its responsibilities.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Finally, following consideration of the matters reviewed during 
the year and the Group’s principal risks, the Committee 
concluded, and made a recommendation to the Board that, 
taken as a whole, these Annual Report and Accounts are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.
 
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2017 Audit Committee 
Report. The Committee plays a key oversight role for the  
Board, monitoring and reviewing all aspects of the  
Group’s financial reporting, internal controls and risk 
management procedures.
This report provides an overview of the work undertaken  
by the Committee during 2017. The most significant topics 
considered by the Committee during the year included the 
Group’s property valuations, taxation and the accounting 
treatment of various significant or complex corporate 
transactions. The Committee also reviewed the Company’s 
risk and viability statement disclosures before they were 
recommended to the Board, and updated the Company’s 
non-audit services policy to ensure that the objectivity  
and independence of the auditors is not compromised by  
any other work undertaken for the Company.

The Audit Committee met three times during 2017. Attendance  
at these meetings is shown in the table on page 61. The Committee 
also met privately during the year with both the external and 
internal auditors.
The Committee follows an annual programme, which is agreed with 
the Committee Chair, management and external auditors prior to each 
financial year, and ensures it gives thorough consideration to matters 
of particular importance to the Company, and additional matters are 
considered when appropriate. The Committee’s 2017 agenda is shown 
in the table on the next page, and the significant matters considered by 
the Committee during the year are also explained on the next page.
EXTERNAL AUDITORS
Committee responsibilities
The Committee oversees the relationship with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), the external auditors,  
and is responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring  
the Company’s policy on external audit, and for monitoring the

The external auditors are not permitted to perform any work that

a conflict of interest or affect the auditors’ objectivity and 
independence.
Access to Committee
The external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee 
Chairman should they wish to raise any concerns outside formal 
Committee meetings.
Effectiveness of auditors
The Committee monitored PwC’s effectiveness and performance 
during 2017, and considered a paper prepared by the Financial 
Controller which confirmed that in management’s view PwC  
was providing an independent and good-quality audit service  
and continued to deliver against all facilities considered at their 
appointment. Matters considered in reaching this conclusion 
included audit partner rotation, continuity of audit team, 
commitment to understanding the Group’s business and 
transactions and the level of technical challenge on the Group’s 
accounts and accounting policies.
The Committee is satisfied that the external auditors remain 
independent and objective, are able to challenge management 
where appropriate, and that the Group’s audit is robust and 
objective. The Committee has therefore recommended to the  
Board that PwC be reappointed in 2018.
Tendering of external audit contract
Capco tendered its external audit contract in 2010, and PwC was 
appointed as Group auditors on an annual rolling contract. This  
is the second year in which Jeremy Jensen has been the audit 
engagement partner. The Directors plan to complete an audit 
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE IN 2017
Matter considered What the Committee did
Valuations As in previous years, the independent external valuers presented the year end and half year valuations to the Committee  
at the February and July meetings respectively. The Committee reviewed the valuation process and component parts of the 
valuations, discussed the valuations with the external auditors and challenged the valuers on the assumptions used. The 
Committee also advised the Board on the independence of the valuers and obtained confirmation that management had 
provided all requested information. The Committee was satisfied that the approach taken by the valuers was appropriate. 
Further information can be found in note 15 on pages 116 to 119 of the notes to the accounts.
Tax The Director of Finance presented a report to the Committee at the February and July meetings, explained the basis of the 
Group’s tax position, identified key taxation risks to the Group and updated the Committee on the ongoing relationship with 
HMRC. The Committee challenged the assumptions made in arriving at the tax position and discussed with the external auditors 
the assumptions and judgements made in arriving at the deferred tax position. The Committee was satisfied that the policy was 
appropriate for the Group. Further information can be found in note 27 on page 130 of the notes to the accounts.
Significant  
and complex 
transactions
As in previous years, the Committee received updates from the Financial Controller on significant and complex transactions 
at each meeting. With regard to each transaction, such as the CLSA, the Innova Investment joint venture, impairments of 
other receivables and the sale of Olympia, the Committee discussed the accounting treatments with management and the 
external auditors and is satisfied that the appropriate approach has been taken.
tender by 2020, the date by which the external audit contract must 
be tendered to comply with regulatory requirements. This is in the 
best interest of the Company’s members because it will ensure 
continuity of service from the external auditors.
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 –  
statement of compliance
The Company confirms that it complied with the provisions of the 
Competition and Markets Authority’s Order for the financial year 
under review.
Non-audit services
Non-audit services are normally limited to assignments that are 
closely related to the annual audit or where the work is of such  
a nature that a detailed understanding of the Group is necessary.
During the year, the Committee reviewed its non-audit services 
policy, and adopted an updated policy consistent with the Financial 
Reporting Council (“FRC’s”) current Ethical Standard. The purpose 
of the policy is to ensure that the provision of non-audit services  
by the external auditors does not compromise their independence 
or objectivity. A number of non-audit services, which reflect the 
FRC’s list of prohibited non-audit services, are prohibited under 
the policy. The policy requires the Audit Committee Chairman  
to approve in advance any non-audit work with a cost exceeding 
£75,000 for work related to the interim review or, for other 
projects, the lower of £50,000 or 15 per cent of the estimated annual 
level of the auditors’ fees at that time. The total value of non-audit 
services in a financial year must not exceed 70 per cent of the 
average of the fees paid to the external auditors in the last three  Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 64 
consecutive years for the audit of Capco, its Group undertakings 
and joint ventures. Services below this limit are pre-approved by 
the Audit Committee under the policy, subject to consideration and 
approval by an Executive Director. Approval is only given following 
a full and thorough assessment of the value case for using the 
auditors, the skills and experience the auditors would bring and 
determination that the auditors are the most suitable provider of 
the service. Additionally, consideration must be given to the 
preservation of auditor independence; and in advance of providing 
non-audit services the external auditors are required to report that 
they are acting independently, that provision of the non-audit 
services does not impair their objectivity and that they are not:
 ◦ auditing their own work;
 ◦ making management decisions for the Company;
 ◦ creating a mutuality of interest;
 ◦ being remunerated via a contingent success fee;
 ◦ developing close personal relationships with the Company’s 
personnel; or
 ◦ acting in the role of advocate for the Company.
The Committee is satisfied that the policy is operating effectively. 
The total fees paid and payable to PwC in 2017 were £435,000  
of which £66,000 related to non-audit work. The non-audit work 
relates to the interim review and agreed upon procedures on the 
verification of balances for contractual arrangements, the 
verification of share scheme performance outcomes and other 
regulatory requirements. The total fees paid and payable to PwC  
in 2017 and 2016 are set out in the table below.

INTERNAL AUDITOR
Internal Audit Plan
BDO LLP (“BDO”) has been appointed to act as Capco’s internal 
auditor. During 2017, BDO’s audit plan included reviews of 
procurement, IT security, risk and policies, Bribery Act 2010 
policies and procedures, health and safety at Covent Garden, 
financial management and budgetary control, payroll and 
employee benefits. No significant issues were raised during  
the reviews.
During 2018, it is expected that the audit plan will include reviews  
of tax, Covent Garden project management, Covent Garden 
commercial leasing, Capco’s disaster recovery and business 
continuity arrangements, Lillie Square facilities management, 
accounts payable, the corporate governance framework and 
compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016.
Committee responsibilities
The Committee reviews the work of the internal auditor, the  
audit plan, any matters identified as a result of internal audits  
and whether recommendations are addressed by management  
in a timely and appropriate way. The Committee is satisfied that  
the internal auditor continues to be independent and its  
services effective.
Access to the Committee
The internal audit partner has direct access to the Audit Committee

auditor at least once per year without management being present.

INTERNAL CONTROL & RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management framework and system of internal control and the 
ongoing review of their effectiveness; it also determines the risk 
appetite of the Group and regularly reviews principal risks and 
uncertainties. The framework is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk, and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has 
delegated responsibility for the review of the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls relating to risk  
to the Committee and the Committee reviews the controls  
relating to risks and the proposed principal risk disclosures.
A description of the Group risk management framework and the review undertaken 
during the year is set out on page 16.
Viability statement
As part of its work in reviewing the Group’s financial statements, 
the Committee reviewed the methodology for the preparation of 
the viability statement including the principal risks, supporting 
analysis, qualifications and assumptions to be disclosed.
The viability statement can be found on page 19. 
Internal controls
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of  
the Group’s internal controls and reports regularly to the Board  
on its work and conclusions. In reviewing the effectiveness of  
the Group’s internal controls, the Committee considers reports 
provided by the Financial Controller, external auditors and internal 
auditor. No significant failings or weaknesses were identified  
in the review process.
Details of the Group’s internal controls are set out below:
Day-to-day procedures and internal control framework
 ◦ Schedule of matters reserved for the Board
 ◦ Remit and terms of reference of Board Committees
 ◦ Delegated authority limits
 ◦ Documentation of significant transactions
 ◦ The Executive Directors are closely involved in the day-to-day 
operations of the business and hold regular meetings with senior 
management to review aspects of the business, including risks 
and controls
 ◦ Regular Board updates on strategy and project developments
 ◦ A whistleblowing procedure under which staff may raise matters 
of concern confidentially. No calls were received during the year.
Specific controls relating to financial reporting  
and consolidation process
 ◦ Appropriately staffed management structure, with clear lines  
of responsibility and accountability
 ◦ A comprehensive budgeting and review system. Board and Audit 
Committee updates from the Chief Financial Officer which include 
forecasts, performance against budget and financial covenants
 ◦ Led by the Chief Executive, the Group Finance team participates 
in the control self-assessment and policy compliance elements  
of the risk management framework and sets formal requirements 
with business division finance functions which specify the 
reports and approvals required
 ◦ BDO conducts regular audits of the Group’s financial control 
procedures and reports its findings to the Audit Committee
The Committee is satisfied that the Group’s internal controls  
are operating effectively and that systems are in accordance with 
FRC guidance. www.capitalandcounties.com 65

Nomination Committee report
NOMINATION 
COMMITTEE REPORT
in 2010. It is our intention that over the next two to three years, 
in the normal course of succession management, our Board 
composition will better reflect the diversity within the Company, 
particularly as regards gender. 
In 2018, the Committee will continue to monitor Board 
composition, including Directors’ tenure, skills, experience and 
diversity, to ensure that the Board is best placed to deliver Capco’s 
strategy, and will consider succession planning for all Directors, 
particularly in the context of new governance regulations.
Finally, all the Directors will be seeking election or re-election  
at the forthcoming AGM. In accordance with best practice, the 
Nomination Committee gave particular consideration before 
recommending that Andrew Strang, Henry Staunton and Graeme 
Gordon, who have each served on the Board for more than six years, 
be reappointed. I am pleased to report that the Committee 
concluded that each of these Directors continues to make a valuable 
contribution to the work of the Board and its Committees.
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2017 Nomination  
Committee Report.
During 2017, the Committee continued to focus on Board 
composition, undertaking a rigorous recruitment process, 
following which we were pleased to welcome Charlotte Boyle  
to the Board. At this time the Board did give consideration  
to appointing two new Directors, however, in light of the 
Company’s current focus on cost control, it was not felt to  
be appropriate to make a second appointment at this time.
The Committee monitored Situl Jobanputra’s performance 
following his promotion to the Board, and I am delighted to 
report that Situl has settled excellently into his new role.
The Committee also spent time considering diversity, both at 
Board level and within the wider business context. During the 
year I was pleased to engage with the 30% Club and a number  
of our shareholders on this topic. This was a good opportunity 
to explain Capco’s approach to recruitment of Directors, 
diversity across Capco’s business and the diversity initiatives  
in which Capco participates. 
Following this engagement, the Committee encouraged the 
Board to review and update its Board Diversity Policy to ensure 
that it properly reflects the Board’s view of the benefits of 
diversity. We report on the revised Policy within this report. 
Whilst the Board does not currently meet the Hampton-
Alexander Review’s target for women’s representation on 
Boards, it is notable that half of our Non-executive Director 
appointments since 2010 have been women, and that female 
representation within Capco’s senior management has been 
consistently strong. We have also been in line with the Parker 
Report’s recommendation on ethnic diversity since our inception

Nomination Committee report continued
appointment of Charlotte, who was previously a partner of The 
Zygos Partnership which has assisted the Board with previous 
recruitment, the Board concluded that there were no material 
business relationships that would compromise her independence. 
Director induction
An induction programme is provided for each new Director, which 
is tailored depending on the individual’s experience and expected 
role on the Board. A typical induction programme for a Capco 
Non-executive Director will include individual meetings with the 
Chairman, Executive Directors, General Counsel, Company 
Secretary and members of senior management, site tours of Capco’s 
estates with management, and meetings with the Company’s 
brokers, advisers and lawyers. The Director is also provided with 
copies of past Board and Committee papers and minutes, and 
individual briefings are arranged on topics such as Directors’ duties 
and responsibilities, remuneration structure and regulations and 
the property market. 
The Company provided Charlotte Boyle with a full induction 
programme on her appointment. Charlotte commented that the 
programme was comprehensive and enjoyable, and helped her 
quickly gain an understanding of the Company’s operations. A 
tailored induction was also provided to Situl Jobanputra on his 
promotion to the Board.
Director development
The Chairman and the Committee together ensure that Directors 
keep their skills and knowledge up to date to allow them to fulfil 
their roles on the Board and Board Committees. The General 
Counsel and Company Secretary regularly update the Board on 
legal and corporate governance matters, and information on 
training opportunities and seminars is circulated to Directors. The 
Company also arranges periodic briefings from external advisers, 
and Directors receive regular business updates from the Executive 
Directors. Directors may also take independent advice at the 
Company’s expense where they feel this is appropriate.
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for making 
recommendations on Board appointments and succession to  
the Board.
The members of the Committee as at 31 December 2017 and the  
date of this report are listed in the box on the previous page. The 
Nomination Committee met four times during the year, and 
attendance at these meetings is shown in the table on page 61.
Board composition and succession
The Committee regularly considers Board composition and 
succession planning for both Executive and Non-executive 
Directors. In considering Executive Director succession, the Board’s 
strategy is to consider both internal and external candidates, whilst 
aiming to develop a choice of internal potential successors. The 
focus of Non-executive Director succession planning is to ensure 
that the Board and its Committees continue to have the right mix  
of skills and experience to deliver Capco’s strategy. A summary of 
Directors’ core skills and experience is shown in the table to the 
right. Board succession and composition will continue to be 
considered at Committee meetings during 2018, and the Committee 
will make recommendations to the Board where appropriate. This 
is likely to include the appointment of an additional Non-executive 
Director with property expertise, at such time as a suitable 
candidate is identified. However, the Committee is satisfied that 
there is no immediate urgency in making this appointment.
Director recruitment
Capco operates a rigorous and transparent recruitment process for 
new Directors, which is summarised above. 
Following Demetra Pinsent’s decision to leave the Board due to  
the increasing time requirements of her other roles, the Committee 
initiated a search for one or more new Non-executive Directors. 
Lygon Group, which provides no other services to the Company, 
was engaged to assist with the process and a broad brief setting out 
desired skills, aptitudes and experience was prepared to ensure that 
the long-list of candidates was appropriately diverse and matched 
to the strategic needs of the Company. 
The Committee considered a shortlist of two female candidates 
with different experience and, having concluded that it would  
be inappropriate to make two appointments at a time when the 
Company was focusing on cost savings, recommended that 
Charlotte Boyle be appointed to the Board. In approving the 
Nomination Committee considers Board composition and determines desired skills and experience
A shortlist of executive search firms is prepared and a selection process followed
A person specification is prepared

Diversity
Diversity is important to Capco and the Board recognises that 
diversity of experience and perspective can bring benefits across  
the business. During 2017, the Board reviewed its Diversity Policy 
to ensure that it aligns with the Committee’s aim of ensuring that 
the Board has the right mix of skills and experience to deliver 
Capco’s strategy, and properly reflects the Board’s view of the 
benefits of diversity. 
Capco’s refreshed Board Diversity Policy states that, when 
considering the nomination of new Directors, the Nomination 
Committee will evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board, to establish the particular skills, 
experience and aptitudes desirable for that appointment. Such 
evaluations will pay particular attention to the merits of diversity, 
including diversity of gender, race, age and background. 
The Board remains committed to encouraging diversity, and 
intends that over the next two to three years, in the normal course 
of succession management, its composition will become more 
reflective of the diversity across Capco’s business, particularly in 
respect of gender. The Board Diversity Policy does not include 
targets for gender or other characteristics, however in conducting 
searches, Capco will only use executive search firms that are 
signatories to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search 
Firms, and will require diverse candidate shortlists, from which 
appointments will be made on merit. The Board believes that 
diverse shortlists increase the likelihood of identifying the best 
candidates for each appointment.
The refreshed Diversity Policy reflects Capco’s past approach to 
recruitment of Non-executive Directors, under which half of new 
Non-executive Director appointments since 2010 have been women, 
and which has supported a number of candidates in obtaining their 
first listed company Board appointments.
During the period, Demetra Pinsent left the Board and Charlotte 
Boyle was appointed. Although there was not an opportunity to 
increase female representation on the Board without increasing 
Director numbers, Charlotte’s appointment meant that the  
gender balance of Capco’s Board did not reduce following 
Demetra’s departure. 
The composition of the Board will be kept under review to ensure 
that the best balance of skills and experience is maintained, and  
the effectiveness of the Board Diversity Policy will be monitored  
by the Nomination Committee.
Below Board level there is strong female representation within 
Capco’s senior management team and their direct reports, which  
is summarised in the table to the right. However, as a company 
with a relatively small headcount, a small number of changes can 
have a significant impact on the percentages. 
Capco is supportive of employee development, including those  
who wish to seek non-executive roles elsewhere, and provides 
development opportunities, including mentoring from our 
Non-executive Directors. It is hoped that such initiatives will help 
develop the next generation of Board members either within Capco 
or in the wider business world.
The Company also supports a number of initiatives which promote 
diversity within the property industry, such as the Real Estate 
Balance initiative and the RICS Inclusive Employer Quality Mark, 
as well as working with peer companies to promote diversity and 
equal opportunities.
More information on Capco’s people practices and diversity initiatives can be found on 
pages 47 and 48 of the Corporate Responsibility Report.

Directors’ remuneration report
DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION REPORT
In line with the framework set for the annual bonus at the 
beginning of the year, the Committee adjusted the NAV and 
EPS targets following the disposal of the Venues business on  
7 April 2017. The adjustment was made to ensure that the 
targets remained as stretching as intended when originally set 
at the start of 2017, and the targets did not become more or less 
challenging to achieve as a result of the adjustment.
This year the Remuneration Committee has improved the 
disclosure of annual bonus targets. The Committee has 
previously committed to publish the financial performance 
targets once they cease to be commercially sensitive, which was 
two years retrospectively. However, the Committee 
understands that an increasing number of shareholders and 
governance bodies are in favour of earlier disclosure. As a result, 
from this year forward, annual bonus targets will be disclosed 
one year retrospectively. 
Implementation of the remuneration policy in 2018
In 2018, the operation of the remuneration policy will be in line 
with its operation in 2017. The policy comprises base salary, 
benefits and pension, annual bonus, and PSP awards. The 
Remuneration Committee has taken the following decisions 
with regard to the implementation of these elements in 2018:
 ◦ Base salary increases for the Chief Executive and Managing 
Director & Chief Investment Officer will be approximately 
two per cent, in line with the lower end of the range of 
inflation-based increases for the general workforce. The 
Committee is satisfied that these increases are merited by the 
performance of each Director. 
 ◦ Upon his appointment in January 2017, it was agreed to 
bring the Chief Financial Officer’s base salary to market 
levels over time subject to his performance and development 
in the role, with a review by up to 15 per cent in 2019, to 
recognise his experience gained. Following an assessment of 
the performance of the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Committee noted that he had performed very strongly 
during 2017 and his development in the role had significantly 
exceeded the Committee’s expectations. 
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
for 2017. This year was the first in which we implemented our 
new remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders 
at the 2017 AGM, with 97.6 per cent of shareholders voting  
in favour.
The Committee’s key objectives, as in previous years, are  
to ensure that Capco’s executive team is appropriately 
incentivised by remuneration arrangements that are fully 
aligned with the Company’s strategy of providing long-term 
market-leading returns to shareholders. Management 
incentives are linked to the KPIs which the Company uses to 
measure the creation and growth of value for shareholders. 
These KPIs are described in full on page 15.
Performance in 2017 and variable remuneration outcomes
Since its establishment in 2010, Capco has delivered TSR 
performance which ranks in the top quartile when compared 
with its listed peers. However, external market circumstances 
have again impacted Capco’s financial performance and the 
variable remuneration outcomes reflect the impact of these 
market conditions. 
The long-term incentive awards which would have vested in 
2018 based on TSR and TR performance up to the end of 2017 
are expected to lapse as neither the TSR or TR targets are 
expected to be met.
The financial elements of the 2017 bonus paid out at 55.5 per 
cent of maximum, reflecting achievement of the EPS target and 
NAV performance which was between threshold and target, but 
TPR results which were below threshold. The individual 
performance measures were rated between 76 and 91 per cent of 
maximum, and overall bonuses of between 90 and 96 per cent 
of salary were awarded to the Executive Directors, of which half 
will be deferred as nil cost options under the Performance Share 
Plan (“PSP”) for three years.

As a result, the Committee decided to bring forward the potential 
15 per cent increase to base salary so that it would be effective 
from April 2018. This increase is considered appropriate as it 
reflects his strong performance in the role demonstrated by his 
overall contribution, funding initiatives undertaken during the 
year and the identification and implementation of cost saving 
measures. In awarding the increase, the Committee was mindful 
of the impact that the increase would have on the Chief Financial 
Officer’s long-term incentive awards, and concluded that the 
resulting incentive was appropriate.
 ◦ The annual bonus will continue to be based 75 per cent on 
financial measures and 25 per cent on personal performance.
 ◦ The weighting of the EPS annual bonus measure will be 
increased to 20 per cent of the financial performance measures, 
to reflect the continued focus on cost management and income 
growth at Covent Garden. The rebalanced NAV and TPR 
performance measures will be 50 per cent and 30 per cent of the 
financial performance measures respectively.
 ◦ PSP awards of 350 per cent of salary will be granted in 2018. 
Half of this award will be subject to a relative TSR performance 
condition, whilst the remainder will be subject to a relative 
TR performance measure.
The Committee aims to set PSP performance targets that equate to 
an upper quartile level of performance, and has noted that 
narrowing levels of outperformance within Capco’s comparator 
group have made it more difficult for the maximum PSP TSR target 
to be achieved. The Committee therefore sought shareholder views 
on whether it would be appropriate for the maximum PSP TSR 
target to be reduced. However, having considered feedback from 
shareholders, the Committee concluded that no change to the TSR 
target would be made. The PSP outperformance targets will 
continue to be kept under annual review.
Conclusion
We are proposing no changes to our policy, having received 
shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM held on 5 May 2017. This 
year, we will only ask shareholders to approve the Annual Report 
on Remuneration and this Annual Statement. We have included the 
remuneration policy in the Annual Report in order to provide 
clarity for our shareholders. The Committee looks forward to 
receiving your support for this advisory vote at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
 1. POLICY REPORT
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out 
Capco’s remuneration policy which took effect following 
shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM. In the interests of clarity, 
the report includes some minor annotations to show, where 
appropriate, how the policy will be implemented in 2018. A full 
version of the policy approved by shareholders can be found in the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended  
31 December 2016. Details of actual remuneration paid, share 
awards made, and the approach to remuneration for 2018 are  
set out within the Annual Report on Remuneration which starts  
on page 76.
1.1 Remuneration policy
The key objectives of the Company’s remuneration  
policy are to:
 ◦ strongly align executive and shareholder interests;
 ◦ underpin an effective pay-for-performance culture;
 ◦ support the retention, motivation and recruitment  
of talented people who are commercially astute; and
 ◦ encourage executives to acquire and retain significant  
holdings of Capco shares.
The Committee aims to achieve an appropriate balance between 
fixed and variable remuneration, and between variable 
remuneration based on short-term and longer-term performance. 
Fixed remuneration includes base salary, benefits and pension. 
Variable remuneration includes an annual bonus, half of which 
is deferred in shares, and awards under the Performance Share 
Plan (“PSP”).
The remuneration policy is aligned to the strategy and nature of  
the Company, and reflects the importance of total return and the 
long-term nature of Capco’s business, rewarding the Executive 
Directors for delivering strong performance against the Company’s 
Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).
Details of each element of remuneration, their operation, purpose, 
link to strategy and performance metrics are set out in this section.

1.2 Executive Director Policy Table
The table below summarises each of the components of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors:
Operation Purpose and link to strategy
To provide an appropriately competitive base salary, whilst placing 
emphasis on the performance related elements of remuneration.
The Committee believes base salary for high-performing 
experienced Executive Directors should be at least median.
To be appropriately competitive with those offered at 
comparator companies.
To be appropriately competitive with that offered by comparator 
companies.
To incentivise and reward performance.
The Committee selects performance measures and targets each year 
to reinforce the strategic business priorities for the year.
The deferral of half of the bonus into shares is designed to further 
align executives with shareholders’ interests.
To incentivise and reward long-term outperformance, and help 
retain Executive Directors over the longer term.
Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis, with any increase normally 
taking effect from 1 April.
The Committee reviews base salaries with reference to:
• other property companies (including the constituents of the long-term incentive 
plan’s comparator group)
• UK companies of a similar size
• each Executive Director’s performance and contribution during the year
• scope of each Executive Director’s responsibilities
• changes to the remuneration and overall conditions of other employees
When reviewing base salaries, the Committee is mindful of the gearing effect that 
increases in base salary will have on the potential total remuneration of the 
Executive Directors.
Benefits will be in line with those offered to some or all employees and may include 
private dental and healthcare, life insurance, personal accident cover, travel 
insurance, income protection and a car allowance, currently paid in cash.
Other benefits may be introduced from time to time to ensure the benefits package 
is appropriately competitive and reflects individual circumstances. For example, 
Directors may be offered relocation and/or expatriate benefits should a Director  
be required to relocate as a result of emerging business requirements.
Capco offers a defined contribution pension scheme.
Executive Directors may elect to be paid some or all of their entitlement  
in cash.
The Company does not currently operate any All Employee Share Schemes, 
however if such a scheme were introduced the Executive Directors would be able to 
participate on the same terms as other employees.
The annual bonus arrangements are reviewed at the start of each  
financial year to ensure performance measures and weightings are  
appropriate and support the business strategy.
The Committee reviews performance against the annual bonus targets but has  
the ability to take into account broader factors and, subject to the 150 per cent of 
salary maximum, may exercise two-way discretion to ensure that the annual bonus 
awarded properly reflects the performance of the Company and each Director.
Adjudication of bonuses will be explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
50 per cent of any bonus earned is deferred in Capco shares or nil cost  
options for three years under the Performance Share Plan without  
further performance conditions but subject to risk of forfeiture should  
an Executive Director leave the Company in certain circumstances. Directors  
may be entitled to be paid dividend equivalents on deferred bonus.
Deferred bonus is subject to malus as described in the notes to this table.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive awards of shares under the  
PSP, which may be made as awards of shares or nil cost options, at the discretion  
of the Committee. In assessing the outcome of the performance conditions, the 
Committee must satisfy itself that the figures are a genuine reflection of underlying 
financial performance, and may exercise downwards discretion when determining 
the proportion of an award that will vest.
Dividend equivalents may be paid.
The Committee has the discretion in certain circumstances to grant and/or settle 
an award in cash. In practice this will only be used in exceptional circumstances for 
Executive Directors.
PSP awards are subject to malus and clawback as described in the notes to this table.

In line with HMRC approved limits.
Base salary increases will be applied in line with the outcome of the 
annual review and will normally be in line with increases awarded 
to other employees. However, the Committee may make additional 
adjustments in certain circumstances to reflect, for example, an 
increase in scope or responsibility, development in role, to address 
an increase in size or complexity of the business, to address a gap in 
market positioning and/or to reward the long-term performance of 
an individual. For the purposes of stating a maximum as required 
by the remuneration regulations, no increase will be applied to an 
Executive Director’s base salary if the resulting base salary would be 
above the upper quartile base salary for CEOs at companies in the 
FTSE 350.
Set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate in light of 
relevant market practice for the role and individual circumstances. 
The cost of all benefits will not normally exceed 10 per cent of base 
salary, with the exception of any future expatriate and/or relocation 
benefits, which would be disclosed in the annual report on 
remuneration. Any reasonable business related expenses (including 
tax thereon) can be reimbursed if determined to be a taxable benefit.
The maximum contribution is 10 per cent of base salary for any 
Executive Director appointed on or after the 2017 AGM, in line with 
the level available for other head office and Covent Garden 
employees. Executive Directors appointed before the 2017 AGM 
receive 24 per cent of base salary as a defined contribution.
The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is  
150 per cent of annual salary with a bonus of 75 per cent of salary 
payable for achieving target levels of performance. No bonus  
is payable for below threshold performance. The payment for 
threshold performance will not exceed 10 per cent of maximum. 
Awards are made on a straight-line basis for performance between 
threshold and target, and on a separate straight-line basis for 
performance between target and maximum.
Each year participants may be granted up to 350 per cent of salary in 
awards or nil cost options.
33 per cent of an award vests for threshold performance, with  
full vesting taking place for equalling or exceeding maximum 
performance conditions and straight-line vesting between 
threshold and maximum.
The Committee considers individual and Company performance when setting 
base salary, as well as the general increase awarded to other employees.

Executives’ performance is measured relative to challenging one-year targets in  
key financial, operational and strategic measures. The measures selected and their 
weightings vary each year according to the strategic priorities.
At least 75 per cent of the bonus will be measured against financial performance.
Measures and respective weightings used for the annual bonus for 2017 and 
proposed for next year’s annual bonus are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on pages 78 to 81.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 72.
PSP awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, and are subject to  
a two-year post-vesting holding period.
The vesting of awards is subject to continued employment and the Company’s 
performance over a three-year performance period based:
• 50 per cent on relative Total Return (Net Asset Value growth plus dividends); and
• 50 per cent on relative Total Shareholder Return
For both measures, performance is measured relative to a comparator group 
comprising the largest FTSE350 property companies.
The performance measures and weightings which apply to the PSP are reviewed  
by the Committee annually, and, subject to consultation with shareholders, the 
Committee has discretion to make changes to the measures, the weightings  
and/or comparator group for future awards to ensure that they remain relevant  
to the Company strategy and are suitably stretching.
Details of the performance conditions for previous years’ awards, and those 
proposed for 2018 awards, are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration  
on pages 80 to 82.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 72. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 72

Performance measurement selection
Annual Bonus Scheme
Executive Directors may earn bonuses 
depending on the Company’s financial 
performance and performance against 
individual performance targets designed  
to deliver strategic goals. The current 
structure of the annual bonus performance 
conditions is illustrated within the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on page 81. The 
financial performance measures and the 
importance of each are set out in the table 
below. The Remuneration Committee  
has discretion to change the performance 
conditions in the annual bonus, but within 
the bounds set out in the Remuneration 
Policy Table.
The annual financial performance targets 
are set by the Committee in the first quarter 
of each year following an analysis of external 
and internal expectations compiled by the 
Committee’s independent adviser. The 
Committee sets targets it believes to be 
appropriately stretching, but achievable.
Long-term incentives
As mentioned above, the performance 
conditions for the PSP currently comprise 
two measures:
 ◦ Three-year relative Total Return  
(TR, growth in NAV per share plus 
dividends); and
 ◦ Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends).
The Committee believes that these two 
measures are currently the most appropriate 
measures of long-term success for Capco as 
long-term relative performance provides  
an appropriately objective and relevant 
measure of Capco’s success which is strongly 
aligned with shareholders’ interests.
The Committee believes that NAV growth  
is the most important internal measure of 
success for Capco at this time. Accordingly, 
the Committee considered it appropriate to 
reward NAV performance in both the short 
and long-term incentive arrangements, 
with one-year absolute NAV growth being 
used in respect of the annual bonus 
arrangements and three-year relative  
NAV (as the main component of three-year 
Total Return) being used in respect of the 
long-term incentives. NAV is used as a 
performance measure by over half of 
FTSE350 property companies in their 
long-term incentive arrangements. The 
Company’s NAV is based on independent 
external valuations carried out in 
accordance with RICS Valuation 
Professional Standards.
Relative TSR helps align the interests of 
Executive Directors with shareholders by 
incentivising share price growth and, in  
the Committee’s view, provides an objective 
measure of the Company’s long-term success.
The current long-term incentive 
performance conditions are summarised 
within the Annual Report on Remuneration 
on page 82. Performance is measured 
relative to a comparator group comprising 
the largest FTSE350 property companies 
and Capco. The members of the comparator 
group are shown in Figure 4 on page 80.
In order for any awards to vest, the 
Committee must also satisfy itself that  
the TR and TSR figures are a genuine 
reflection of underlying financial 
performance. In assessing the extent to 
which the performance conditions have 
been met, the Committee consults with its 
independent remuneration adviser. The 
calculation of the returns is also reviewed 
by the Company’s auditors as appropriate. 
The performance targets are set by the 
Committee following an analysis of internal 
and external expectations, and are believed 
to be appropriately stretching.
For future awards, the Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to change the 
performance measures and weightings. 
However, any such changes would only be 
made after consulting with shareholders.
Discretions
Under the Annual Bonus Scheme and  
the PSP the Company has the standard 
discretions to take appropriate action in  
the event of unforeseen events which affect 
the schemes such as a variation in share 
capital as well as terminations and on a 
change in control as described in the policy. 
The Committee does not intend to make 
adjustments to the methods by which it 
measures the performance conditions, 
however, it reserves the discretion to  
make adjustments in very exceptional 
circumstances. Shareholders would be 
given details of any exercise of discretion.
Payments resulting from existing 
arrangements
The Committee may make any 
remuneration payments and payments  
for loss of office (including exercising any 
discretions it has relating to such payments) 
even though they are not in line with the 
policy set out in this report. This will apply 
where the entitlement to the payment 
arose: (i) before the 2014 AGM; (ii) at a  
time when the relevant individual was  
not a Director of the Company and, in the 
opinion of the Committee, the payment  
was not in consideration for the individual 
becoming a Director of the Company; or  
(iii) under a remuneration policy previously 
approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
For these purposes entitlements arising 
under the Company’s previous 
remuneration policy (as approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM) will be 
incorporated into this policy, “payments” 
includes the Committee satisfying awards 
of variable remuneration, and an 
entitlement under an award over shares 
arises at the time the award is granted.
Why are the current annual bonus performance measures appropriate for Capco?
Measure Reason
Growth in Net Asset Value  
per share
Considered by the Committee to be the most important driver of value creation for Capco at the present time.
Relative Total Property Return 
 
Rewards the additional portfolio value created by management over and above any changes in value from 
tracking the property market as a whole, as measured by the IPD Total Return All Property Index, an external 
benchmark widely used in the property industry.
Underlying Earnings Per Share Rewards value growth in net rental income as well as the management of financing and other costs. Given the 
current stage of the Company’s development, the Committee considers EPS to be relatively less relevant as an 
indicator of value creation than growth in Net Asset Value per share. However, the focus on this metric has been 
increased for 2018.

Financial statements Strategic report Governance
Malus and clawback
Awards granted under the long-term 
incentive arrangements are subject to malus 
and clawback until the end of the respective 
holding periods. Deferred bonus awards are 
subject to malus prior to vesting. Reasons 
for malus and clawback include: in the 
event of gross misconduct of a Director,  
in the event of a material misstatement in 
the audited accounts of the Company for  
a period that was wholly or partly before  
the end of the financial year by reference  
to which any performance condition was 
assessed, or in the event that the assessment 
of the satisfaction of any performance 
condition was based on error or inaccurate 
or misleading information. In the latter two 
scenarios, to the extent an overpayment 
resulted. The application of any malus  
or clawback is at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration of employees below  
the Board
No element of remuneration is operated 
solely for Executive Directors. Capco head 
office (including Earls Court Properties) and 
Covent Garden employees below the Board 
receive base salary, benefits, annual bonus, 
and participate in the PSP. The pension 
contribution for new Executive Directors 
has been set at the same level as available to 
employees at Capco head office (including 
Earls Court Properties) and Covent Garden. 
However, there are some differences in 
operation as set out below:
 ◦ In exceptional circumstances, such as 
recruitment, long-term incentive awards 
may be granted without performance 
conditions to participants below  
the Board;
 ◦ Employees below the Board are not 
subject to any minimum shareholding 
requirement; and
 ◦ Incentive awards granted to employees 
below the Board may not be subject to 
holding periods, clawback or malus.
Shareholding guidelines
The Chief Executive is required to achieve  
a shareholding in the Company equivalent 
to 300 per cent of salary and the other 
Executive Directors are required to achieve 
a shareholding in the Company equivalent 
to 200 per cent of base salary, to be achieved 
by retaining at least 50 per cent of any 
vested share awards (net of tax) or within 
three years. The current shareholdings  
of the Executive Directors are set out  
on page 84. The current Chairman is 
required to maintain a shareholding in  
the Company equivalent to 100 per cent  
of his base fee, but this would be reviewed 
on any new appointment.
1.4 Performance scenario charts
The potential reward opportunities 
illustrated in Figure 1 are based on the 
policy which will apply in 2018, applied  
to the base salary at the salary review date,  
1 April 2018, and provide estimates of the 
potential future reward opportunity for 
each Executive Director, and the potential 
split between the different elements  
of remuneration under three different 
performance scenarios: ‘Below Threshold’, 
‘Target’ and ‘Maximum’.
The Below Threshold scenario includes base 
salary, pension and benefits (fixed pay). No 
annual bonus or PSP elements are included 
(variable pay). The Target scenario includes 
fixed pay, on target bonus and threshold 
vesting of PSP awards. The Maximum 
scenario includes fixed pay, maximum 
bonus and full vesting of PSP awards. For 
variable pay, the amounts illustrated are  
the normal maximum opportunities.
It should be noted that the PSP awards 
granted in a year do not normally vest until 
the third anniversary of the date of grant 
and are subject to a two-year post-vesting 
holding period. The projected values of 
long-term incentives shown here exclude 
the impact of share price movement  
and dividends.

1.5 Approach to recruitment remuneration
When hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration,  
as follows:
Element of remuneration Policy on recruitment Maximum opportunity
Salary Based on scope and nature of responsibilities of the proposed role; the candidate’s 
experience; implications for total remuneration positioning vs. market pay levels for 
comparable roles; internal relativities; and the candidate’s current salary.
A new Director may be appointed at a salary which is less than the prevailing market rate 
but increased over a period to the desired positioning subject to satisfactory performance.
N/A
Pension A contribution of up to 10 per cent of salary may be offered, consistent with policy.
Benefits Appropriate benefits will be provided, which may include the continuation  
of benefits received in a previous role.
Annual Bonus Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme  
on the same basis as existing Executive Directors, pro-rated for proportion of year served.
Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate 
to set different annual bonus performance conditions to the current Executive Directors 
in the first performance year of appointment.
The maximum opportunity  
will be 150 per cent of salary, 
consistent with policy.
In exceptional circumstances, 
normal policy table limits may 
be exceeded on recruitment.  
The maximum additional bonus 
opportunity will be limited to  
50 per cent of salary.
Performance Share Plan New Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the long-term incentive 
scheme set out in the remuneration policy table.
A PSP award can be made shortly following an appointment (assuming the Company is 
not in a prohibited period).
The opportunity levels will be 
consistent with those disclosed 
in the table.
Other In determining appropriate remuneration for new Executive Directors, the Committee 
will take into consideration all relevant factors (including quantum, the nature of 
remuneration and where the candidate was recruited from) to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of Capco and its shareholders.
Remuneration may include:
• An award made in respect of a new appointment to “buy out” existing incentive awards 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In such cases the compensatory award would 
typically be a like-for-like award with similar time-to-vesting, performance conditions 
and likelihood of those conditions being met. The fair value of the compensatory award 
would not be greater than the awards being replaced. To facilitate such a buyout, the 
Committee may use an award under a different structure or an additional award under 
the PSP;
• A relocation package, should this be required;
• For an overseas appointment, the Committee will have discretion to offer cost-effective 
benefits and pension provisions which reflect local market practice and relevant 
legislation; and
• In the event that an employee is promoted to the Board, the Company would honour 
any existing contractual arrangements.
 
1.6 Service contracts and exit payment policy
The service contracts of Executive Directors are approved by the Remuneration Committee and are one-year rolling contracts. The 
commencement dates of the current contracts are shown below. The service contracts may be terminated by either party giving one year’s 
notice to the other. It is the Company’s policy that termination payments should not exceed the Director’s current salary and benefits for 
the notice period. The service contracts may be viewed at the Company’s registered office.
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the Company in respect of his/her statutory employment rights or any other 
claim arising from the employment or its termination, the Committee will be entitled to enter into a settlement agreement with the 
Director. The Company may pay a Director’s legal fees in relation to any settlement agreement.
The Committee may pay reasonable outplacement fees where considered appropriate.
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders  
and participants. The payment of any annual bonus is subject to the discretion of the Committee, and both the cash and deferred share 
elements of an annual bonus would normally be payable at the normal payment date. Any deferred share element could be paid in cash. 
Any outstanding deferred bonus may be released or paid in cash, subject to clawback for a period of three years from the date of grant.

Financial statements Strategic report Governance
An individual would generally be considered a ‘good leaver’ if they left the Group’s employment for reasons including injury, ill-health, 
disability approved by the Committee, redundancy or retirement with the agreement of the employing company. The table below 
summarises how PSP awards are typically treated in specific leaver circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the 
Committee’s discretion, for example an individual may be considered a ‘good leaver’ for any other reason at the absolute discretion  
of the Committee, and the vesting of awards may be reduced for ‘good leavers’.
Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Treatment of awards
Good leaver Normal vesting date, although 
the Committee has discretion to 
accelerate. 
Payments are normally pro-rated for time and remain subject to outstanding performance 
conditions. Where vesting is accelerated, payments are further pro-rated to reflect the 
extent to which the performance conditions had been satisfied at the date of leaving.  
The holding period would continue to apply.
Change of control Immediately Vesting will be pro-rated for time and remain subject to performance conditions. 
However, the Committee has discretion to allow awards to vest in full in such 
circumstances if it deems this to be fair and reasonable. The holding period would  
cease to apply.
Any other reason Awards lapse
There are no obligations on the Company contained within the existing Directors’ service contracts which would give rise to payments not 
disclosed in this report.
The service contracts of any future-appointed Directors will provide for mitigation in the event of termination.
1.7 Non-executive Director Policy Table
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment. The letters of appointment of the 
Non-executive Directors are reviewed by the Board annually and contain a one-month notice period. The Chairman’s letter of appointment 
contains a 12-month notice period. The letters of appointment may be viewed at the Company’s registered office.

Directors do not receive any pension, bonus or long-term incentive benefits from the Company.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Performance 
metrics
Fee
To recruit and retain 
appropriately qualified 
Non-executive Directors.
The Chairman and Non-executive Director fees are reviewed  
on an annual basis, with any increase taking effect from 1 May.
The Board and Committee review fees with reference to:
• other property companies;
• UK companies of a similar size; and
• the time that Non-executive Directors are required to devote  
to the role.
In exceptional circumstances, if there is a temporary yet material 
increase in the time commitments for Non-Executive Directors, 
the Board may pay extra fees on a pro-rata basis to recognise the 
additional workload.
Non-executive Director fees may 
include a basic fee and Committee/
SID fees as disclosed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration. These  
are set at a level that is considered 
appropriately competitive in light 
of market practice, and will not 
exceed the aggregate fees permitted 
by the Company’s Articles  
of Association.
N/A
Benefits
To be appropriately  
competitive with those offered  
at comparator companies.
The Chairman’s benefits include private healthcare and personal 
accident and travel insurance.
Other Non-executive Directors will be covered by the Company’s 
travel insurance policy should they be required to travel on 
Company business.
Any reasonable business related expenses can be reimbursed 
(including tax thereon if determined to be a taxable benefit).
The maximum value of the  
benefits provided to Non-executive 
Directors will be the cost of 
purchasing them in the market.
N/A Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 76 
Directors’ remuneration report continued
1.8 External Directorships
The Company’s policy is to encourage each 
Executive Director to take up one or more 
Non-executive Directorships, subject to 
Board approval. Fees received for serving  
as a Non-executive Director of a company 
outside the Capco Group are retained by  
the Executive Director.
1.9 Consideration of conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
When setting Executive Director pay the 
Committee considers the remuneration  
and overall conditions of all employees. As 
Capco has a relatively small workforce, the 
Committee does not consult with employees 
when deciding remuneration policy, but  
it receives regular updates from the Head of 
HR on salary increases, bonus and share 
awards made to Group employees and is 
aware of how the remuneration of Directors 
compares to that of other employees; for 
example, salary increases are generally in 
line with increases awarded to other 
employees, which are set with reference  
to market data.
1.10 Consideration of shareholder views
It is the Committee’s policy to consult with 
major shareholders as appropriate, for 
example, prior to finalising any major 
changes to its executive remuneration policy.
2. ANNUAL REPORT ON 
REMUNERATION
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report explains how Capco’s current 
remuneration policy has been implemented 
during the year.
2.1 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for determining and 
recommending to the Board the policy  
for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, setting targets for the Company’s 
incentive schemes and determining the 
total individual remuneration package for 
each Executive Director. Membership of the 
Committee as at 31 December 2017 and the 
date of this report is set out on page 69. In 
addition, the Company Chairman, Chief 
Executive and the Company Secretary are 
invited to attend Committee meetings and 
contribute, except on matters relating to 
their own remuneration. Attendance at the 
five meetings held during the year is shown 
in the table on page 61 and a summary of 
the matters considered by the Committee 
during the year is set out in the adjacent 
shaded box in column 3.
2.2 Remuneration Committee and  
its advisers
The Committee appointed Aon Hewitt 
(formerly New Bridge Street) as its 
independent remuneration adviser in 2014 
following a competitive process. During  
the year, the Committee received advice on 
matters including remuneration structure, 
incentive design and target setting from 
Aon Hewitt. Aon Hewitt is a member of  
the Remuneration Consultants Group  
and adheres to its code of conduct. The 
Committee has received confirmation  
of independence from Aon Hewitt, and  
is satisfied that the advice received was 
objective and independent. In addition  
to advice provided to the Committee, Aon 
Hewitt also provided share award valuation 
services to the Company. During 2017, the 
Company was charged a total of £87,487  
by Aon Hewitt in respect of advice to the 
Committee. Fees were charged on a  
time basis.
2.3 Statement of shareholder voting
The table below shows the results of  
the advisory vote on the 2016 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the binding vote 
on remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM.

1. Comprises Executive Director car allowance of £18,000, medical insurance and Non-executive Directors’ travel expenses relating to Board meeting attendance where these are 
taxable or would be if the Director were resident in the UK for tax purposes. Where applicable, the Company pays the tax payable on Non-executive Director travel expenses as they 
are incurred in the fulfilment of Directors’ duties.
2. The 2017 disclosure comprises the expected value on maturity of the 2015 Former PSP and MSP awards which have a performance period that ran from 2015 to 2017, and were 
expected to vest in early 2018. These awards have been included in the 2017 single figure as the performance conditions relating to these awards had been substantially (but not 
fully) completed during 2017. The disclosure has been calculated assuming that zero per cent of the Former PSP awards and MSP awards will vest. The 2016 multi-year variable 
comparators were previously disclosed on the basis described above assuming vesting of zero per cent, and it is confirmed that the awards lapsed as the performance conditions were 
not satisfied.

2.5 Annual bonus outcomes for 2017
Opportunity
Executive Directors can earn bonuses of up to 150 per cent of salary. 
Half of the bonus earned is deferred in Capco shares or nil cost 
options for three years, subject to forfeiture should the Executive 
Director leave the Company.
Performance measures and targets
Awards made in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 were 
based 75 per cent on financial performance, and 25 per cent on 
individual performance.
Financial measures: The financial performance element for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 was based on growth in absolute NAV  
per share (“NAV”), Total Property Return relative to the IPD Total 
Return All Property Index (“TPR”), and underlying Earnings Per 
Share (“EPS”). When setting the annual targets for these measures 
in 2017, the Committee recognised the long-term nature of some 
aspects of the Company’s strategy, and the extent to which this 
would be reflected in these measures on a 12-month horizon. In line 
with the framework set for the annual bonus at the beginning of 
the year, the NAV and EPS targets were adjusted following the 
disposal of the Venues business on 7 April 2017. The adjustment 
was made to ensure that the targets remained as stretching as 
intended when originally set at the start of 2017 and did not become 
more or less challenging to achieve as a result of the adjustment. 
The performance measures, weightings and targets that applied in 
respect of the 2017 annual bonus are summarised in the table on the 
following page.
The Committee has previously committed to publishing the 
financial performance targets once they cease to be commercially 
sensitive. The Committee has determined that the financial 
performance targets that applied in respect of the years ended 31 
December 2015 and 2016 are no longer commercially sensitive; 
accordingly, the targets and the Company’s performance against 
these targets are set out on the following page. Bonus awards made 
in 2015 and 2016 were based 75 per cent on financial performance. 
In future the Committee expects to disclose annual bonus targets 
one year retrospectively.
Personal measures: The Committee assessed individual performance 
against a set of KPIs which align with the Company’s objectives 
outlined on page 15 of the Annual Report. These KPIs include:
 ◦ Corporate objectives: enhancing Capco’s position and reputation 
in the market; identifying, monitoring and controlling risk 
including health and safety, progress towards meeting  
medium-term corporate objectives;
 ◦ Financial objectives: optimising liquidity and financing; effective 
cost and capital expenditure management; other budgeted KPIs;
 ◦ Investment objectives: strategic investment initiatives; operation 
of joint ventures; implementation of business plans; 
achievement of planning targets; and
 ◦ CR/HR objectives: personal development; optimisation of 
organisational structure; nurturing of future leaders; promotion 
and support of CR initiatives.
Outcome of 2017 annual bonus performance measures (Audited)
Outcome of financial objectives: In respect of the year ended  
31 December 2017, the Company’s performance did not meet  
the threshold performance targets for TPR, however the EPS target 
was exceeded and NAV performance was between threshold and 
maximum. Accordingly, awards of 62.4 per cent of salary were 
made to Ian Hawksworth, Situl Jobanputra and Gary Yardley in 
respect of the financial performance measures.
Outcome of personal objectives: The Executive Directors were 
considered to have delivered good performance in 2017, including 
delivery of cost efficiencies and streamlined organisational 
structure, sale of the Venues business, operation of joint ventures 
with TfL and Network Rail, management of capital and corporate 
liquidity, consideration of new business opportunities and personal 
development. Accordingly, awards of between 28.5 and 34.1 per 
cent of salary were made to the Executive Directors in respect of the 
individual performance measures.
A summary of the overall outcomes of 2017 annual bonus 
performance measures is shown in Figure 3 on page 79.

2.6 Long-term incentive outcomes  
for 2017 (Audited)
In 2015 the following awards with a 
performance period of 2015-2017 were made 
under the Company’s former Performance 
Share Plan (“Former PSP”) and former 
Matching Share Plan (“Former MSP”):
Former PSP: Awards of 150 per cent of salary 
were made to Executive Directors.
Former MSP: Shares awarded in respect of 
Executive Directors’ deferred 2014 bonus 
were matched under the MSP on a 1:1 basis. 
Additionally, awards were made pursuant 
to the Committee’s 2013 invitation to 
Executive Directors to invest up to 150 per 
cent of 2013 salary between 2013 and 2015 
(subsequently extended to early 2016) when 
permitted by scheme headroom with an 
exceptional matching opportunity of 2:1.
Performance measures and outcomes for 
2015 awards under the Former PSP  
and Former MSP
Performance measures and targets: The 
performance conditions for the Former PSP 
and Former MSP comprised two equally 
weighted measures:
 ◦ Three-year relative Total Return (TR, 
growth in NAV per share plus dividends)
 ◦ Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends)
Where an exceptional award was made, the 
additional matching opportunity could 
only be earned for performance above the 
normal stretch targets. The performance 
targets are set out in Figure 4 below.
Performance outcome: In early 2018, the 
Committee determined that Capco’s TR  
was not expected to equal the median of the 
comparator group (vs an outperformance 
target of 2.5 per cent per annum or 3 per 
cent for exceptional awards), and that 
Capco’s TSR was not expected to equal  
the median of the comparator group  
(vs an outperformance target of 4 per cent 
per annum or 5 per cent for exceptional 
awards), and as such the performance 
conditions relating to the 2015 Former 
PSP and Former MSP awards had not been 
met. Accordingly, the 2015 Former PSP and 
Former MSP awards are expected to lapse 
and no value has been included in the  
single figure disclosures in respect of  
these awards.

2.10 Statement of implementation of policy for 2018 Salary
The Executive Directors’ salaries are reviewed annually. In April 
2018, the salary of the Chief Executive and Managing Director  
and Chief Investment Officer will be increased by approximately 
two per cent to £607,000 and £544,000 respectively, which is in 
line with the lower end of the range of increases expected to be 
applied to Group employees. As explained in the Committee 
Chairman’s letter on page 68, the review of the Chief Financial 
Officer’s salary previously intended for 2019 has been brought 
forward to 2018 and his salary will be increased in April 2018 by  
15 per cent to £373,750.
The proposed revised salaries for the Executive Directors are set  
out in the table below:
Executive Director salaries – 2017 and 2018
 2018 2017 % Increase
Ian Hawksworth £607,000 £595,000 2.02%
Situl Jobanputra £373,750 £325,000 15.00%
Gary Yardley £544,000 £533,000 2.06%
Pension and benefits
As described in the policy table on pages 70 and 71.
Annual bonus
Opportunity
The annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged for 2018.
Performance conditions
The financial performance targets for the year ended 31 December 
2017 were based on growth in absolute NAV per share, Total Property 
Return relative to the IPD Total Return All Property Index, and 
underlying EPS. The Committee has decided that, whilst NAV and 
TPR continue to be of greatest importance to Capco’s strategy, in 
2018 the weighting of EPS as a performance measure will be increased 
to 20 per cent of the financial performance measures in order to reflect 
the continued focus on the Group’s cost structure and income 
growth at Covent Garden. The rebalancing of weightings of the 
financial performance measures for 2018 is shown in the table below. 
The relative weighting of financial and individual performance 
measures will remain unchanged. The Committee will consider the 
appropriate weighting of the EPS measure on an annual basis.
Performance targets
The TPR target is included in the Company’s KPIs on page 15.  
The KPIs are in part dependent upon the occurrence of certain 
discrete events. Therefore, whilst the outperformance targets  
that apply to the long-term incentives are disclosed, the Board  
has decided that as the Group operates in two specific locations 
within the competitive central London property market, 
prospective disclosure of specific short-term NAV and EPS targets 
would provide a level of information to counterparties that could 
prejudice the Company’s commercial interests. The Committee will 
publish the performance targets retrospectively once they have 
ceased to be commercially sensitive, which is expected to be one 
year in retrospect. Further information on the Company’s KPIs can 
be found on page 15.

2.14 Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (Audited)
(a) Directors’ shareholdings 
The beneficial interests in the shares of the Company for each Director who served during the year are set out in the table below. The Chief 
Executive is required to achieve a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 300 per cent of salary and the other Executive Directors are 
required to achieve a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200 per cent of base salary, to be achieved by retaining at least 50 per cent 
of any vested share awards (net of tax) and/or within three years. The Chairman is required to maintain a shareholding equivalent to  
100 per cent of his base fee. The current shareholdings of the Chairman and Executive Directors are illustrated in Figure 7. The shares 
which are included in these holdings are those held beneficially by the Director, their spouse or dependant family members, shares held 
within ISAs, PEPs or pensions, shares that are subject to a holding period, such as deferred bonus, and vested but unexercised awards. The 
latter two categories are included on a net of tax basis.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
& Accounts, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
(a)  select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
(b)  make judgements and accounting estimates that are  
reasonable and prudent; 
(c)  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union (EU) have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial  
statements; and  
(d)  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time,  
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Governance section, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
– the Group financial statements, which have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true  
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position  
and loss of the Group; 
– the Directors’ report contained includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces; and 
– having taken all matters considered by the Board and brought  
to the attention of the Board during the year into account, the 
Directors consider that the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable. The Directors 
believe that the disclosures set out in the Annual Report & 
Accounts provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position, performance, business model  
and strategy. 
The financial statements on pages 96 to 137 were approved by the 
Board of Directors on 20 February 2018 and signed on its behalf by

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Opinion 
In our opinion, Capital & Counties Properties PLC’s Group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements (the “financial 
statements”): 
– give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss 
and the Group’s and the Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended; 
– have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company’s 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
– have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements,  
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report & Accounts (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the 
Group and Company balance sheets as at 31 December 2017; the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the Group and Company statements of cash flows, and the Consolidated and Company statement of changes in 
equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies. 
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of 
our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Independence 
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to 
the Group or the Parent Company. 
Other than those disclosed in the Audit Committee Report on pages 63 and 64, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the 
Parent Company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. 
Our audit approach 
Overview 
Materiality – Overall Group materiality: £39 million (2016: £41 million) which represents 1 per cent of total assets. 
– Overall Parent Company materiality: £20 million (2016: £20 million) which represents 1 per cent of total assets. 
– For income statement line items that are deemed to be of particular relevance, we applied a lower materiality. 
Audit scope – We audited the complete financial information of the Group, which comprises three business lines, Covent Garden,  
Earls Court and Other.  
– We audited the financial information relating to the sale of Venues including the Venues results attributable to the Group  
for the approximately three month period until the disposal. 
Key audit matters – Valuation of investment and development property 
– Taxation 
– Disposal of the Venues business 
– We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the Parent company to communicate in our report. 
 
The scope of our audit 
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. We gained an understanding of the legal and 
regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the Group which 
were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit procedures to respond to the risk, recognising that 
the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws 
and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and Parent Company financial statements, including but not 
limited to, the Companies Act 2006 and UK tax legislation. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement 
disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, enquiries of management and review of minutes of meetings of those charged with 
governance for the Group. 
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and 
regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. 
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors 
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  www.capitalandcounties.com 91 
 
  www.capitalandcounties.com 91 
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter 
Valuation of investment and development property 
Refer to pages 62 to 64 (Audit Committee Report), pages 102 to 106 
(Principal Accounting Policies) and pages 102 to 137 (notes to the 
financial statements). 
The valuation of the Group’s investment and development property is 
the key component of the net asset value and underpins the Group’s 
result for the year. The result of the revaluation this year was a loss of 
£90.9m (2016: loss of £231.2m), which is accounted for within ‘Loss 
on revaluation and sale of investment and development property’ and is 
a significant component of the result for the year. The Group’s property 
portfolios, which comprise investment property (including retail, food 
and beverage, commercial and residential) as well as development 
property located in central London, are not uniform in nature. Therefore, 
there are a number of different assumptions made by the Group’s third 
party valuers, JLL and CBRE Ltd (the “Valuers”), in determining fair value:
– Investment property – The valuation of investment properties 
(predominantly Covent Garden) is inherently subjective, due 
principally to the individual nature of each property, which greatly 
influences the future rental it is expected to generate. The assumptions 
on which the property values are based are influenced by tenure and 
tenancy details for each property, prevailing market yields and the 
estimated rental value of each property. 
– Development property – The valuation of development property 
(predominantly Earls Court) is also inherently subjective. Development 
properties are valued using the residual appraisal method (i.e. by 
estimating the fair value of the completed project using either a sales 
comparison or income capitalisation method less estimated costs to 
completion, finance cost and market based profit margin providing a 
return on development risk).  
Macro-economic factors and uncertain market conditions impact the 
valuation of investment and development property. 
The fact that only a small percentage difference in individual property 
valuations, when aggregated, could result in a material misstatement, 
warrants specific audit focus on this area. 
The Valuers were engaged by the Directors, in accordance with the 
RICS Valuation – Professional Standards (“RICS”). 
Experience of Valuers and relevance of their work 
We read the Valuers’ reports from CBRE Ltd and JLL. We confirmed that 
the approaches used were consistent with the RICS guidelines and the 
requirements of IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. We assessed 
the Valuers’ competence and capabilities and read their terms of 
engagement with the Group, determining that there were no matters that 
affected their independence and objectivity or imposed scope limitations 
upon them. 
Data provided to the Valuers 
For investment and development properties, we validated a sample of 
the data provided to the Valuers by management and found that it was 
consistent with the information we audited. This data included tenancy 
schedules, capital expenditure details, cost schedules and square 
footage details which we agreed back to appropriate supporting 
documentation. 
For development properties, we agreed that the planned schemes being 
valued were consistent with the actual planned developments and, 
where appropriate, had achieved planning consents. 
Assumptions and estimates used by the Valuers 
We met with the Valuers independently of management and gained an 
understanding of the valuation methods and assumptions used. We 
compared the movement in capital values over the period with market 
sector benchmarks to help identify significant changes in assumptions. 
The nature of assumptions used varied across the portfolio, depending 
on the nature of each property but they included estimated capital 
values, investment yields, estimated rental values, construction costs, 
finance cost and developers’ margins. In each of these areas, and on a 
sample basis, we compared the estimates and assumptions used by the 
Valuers against our own expectations, using evidence of comparable 
market transactions. Where we identified estimates and assumptions that 
were outside the typical ranges used, we discussed these with the 
Valuers to understand the rationale and then assessed, based on all the 
available evidence and our experience in this sector, whether the use of 
the estimate or assumption was justified. 
Our testing, which involved the use of our internal real estate valuation 
experts, qualified chartered surveyors with deep market knowledge, 
indicated that the estimates and assumptions used were appropriate in 
the context of the Group’s property portfolio and reflected the 
circumstances of the market in the year.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter 
Taxation 
Refer to page 62 to 64 (Audit Committee Report), page 102 to 106 
(Principal Accounting Polices) and pages 102 to 137 (notes to the 
financial statements). 
Tax is a specific risk for the Group due to the degree of judgement 
involved in some of the ongoing activities of the Group. This gives rise 
to material tax considerations on the calculation, recognition, and 
classification of current and deferred tax balances from both a tax 
compliance and accounting perspective.  
Judgements are made by management to arrive at the current and  
deferred tax position. These judgements include the impact of the 
Group holding structure. 
We assessed the principal assumptions and judgements made in 
arriving at the current and deferred tax position by using our experience 
of similar matters in the industry. 
We evaluate the tax provisions and potential exposures as at 31 
December 2017, challenging the Group’s assumptions and judgements 
through our knowledge of the tax circumstances. 
Our testing, which involved the use of our internal tax specialists, did 
not identify any matters that the Directors have not adequately reflected 
in their calculation of the necessary current and deferred tax provisions. 
Disposal of the Venues business 
The disposal of a significant business component, the Venues business, 
during the year is considered higher risk as it is a significant non-routine 
transaction. We therefore placed specific audit focus on this area. 
We performed substantive procedures over the sale agreement, 
completion accounts, and gain on disposal workings relating to the 
transaction. We reviewed the related disclosures in the financial 
statements including the prior period re-presentation.  
We did not identify any material misstatements relating to the 
transaction. 
 
We determined that there were no Key audit matters applicable to the Parent company to communicate in our report.  
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Parent Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in 
which they operate. 
The Group is structured along three business lines, Covent Garden, Earls Court Properties (including the Lillie Square joint venture and 
the Empress State Building) and Other. The Venues business was disposed of during the year. The Group engagement team audited all 
business lines, including the Venues business results reflected in the Group results for the period. 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
   
Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements 
Overall materiality 
£39 million (2016: £41 million). £20 million (2016: £20 million).  
How we determined it 
1 per cent of total assets. 1 per cent of total assets. 
Rationale for benchmark 
applied 
The key measure of the Group’s performance is the 
valuation of investment and development properties 
and the balance sheet as a whole. On this basis, 
and consistent with the prior year, we set an overall 
Group materiality level based on total assets. 
The Parent Company’s main activity is the holding  
of investments in subsidiaries. On this basis, and 
consistent with the prior year, we set an overall 
Parent Company materiality level based on  
total assets.  
In addition to overall Group materiality, a specific materiality was also applied to certain areas of the income statement. Our specific 
materiality is aligned with the metrics in the consolidated income statement that we believe are of particular interest to the members and 
we determined those metrics to be Net rental income and Net finance costs. In order to reflect their specific characteristics, we applied 
materiality levels of 10 per cent of Net rental income and 10 per cent of Finance costs to each constituent line item within Net rental income 
and Net finance costs. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £1.9 million (2016: 
£2.0 million) on balance sheet items as well as misstatements below that amount based on a proportionate value of the relevant materiality 
figures for income statement line items and other matters that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Going concern 
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows: 
Reporting obligation 
 
Outcome 
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect of the 
Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the 
Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements. 
 
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. However, because not 
all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a 
guarantee as to the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. 
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in accordance with 
Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit. 
 
We have nothing to report. 
 
Reporting on other information  
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon.  
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required 
to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the 
other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. 
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered whether the disclosures 
required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.  
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs 
(UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described 
below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated). 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06) 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did 
not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06) 
Corporate Governance Statement 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement (on pages 
56 to 61) about internal controls and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures in 
compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the FCA (“DTR”) is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06) 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did 
not identify any material misstatements in this information. (CA06) 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement (on pages 
56 to 61) with respect to the Parent Company’s corporate governance code and practices and about its administrative, management and 
supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the DTR. (CA06) 
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the Parent 
Company. (CA06)

The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity  
of the Group 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding: 
– The Directors’ confirmation on page 89 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
– The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated. 
– The Directors’ explanation on page 19 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit 
and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in 
alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the statements are consistent 
with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions 
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:  
– The statement given by the Directors, on page 89, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Parent Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Parent Company obtained in the 
course of performing our audit. 
– The section of the Annual Report on pages 62 to 64 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
– The Directors’ statement relating to the Parent Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors. 
Directors’ Remuneration 
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006. (CA06) 
 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 89, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report. 
Use of this report 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING 
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

– the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.  
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
General information 
Capital & Counties Properties PLC (the “Company”) was 
incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 3 February 
2010 under the Companies Act as a public company limited by 
shares, registration number 7145051. The registered office of the 
Company is 15 Grosvenor Street, London, W1K 4QZ, United 
Kingdom. The principal activity of the Company is to act as the 
ultimate parent company of Capital & Counties Properties PLC 
Group (the “Group”), whose principal activity is the investment, 
development and management of property.  
The Group’s assets principally comprise investment and 
development property at Covent Garden and Earls Court. 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations 
Committee (“IFRS IC”) interpretations and with those parts of  
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting  
under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention as modified for the revaluation  
of property and derivative financial instruments.  
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by 
section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate 
income statement or statement of comprehensive income for  
the Company. 
During 2017, the following accounting standards and 
interpretations have been adopted by the Group:  
IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ (amendment)  
IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ (amendment) 
These pronouncements had no significant impact on the 
consolidated financial statements and resulted in changes to 
disclosures only. 
At the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements  
the following standards and interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not effective, 
and in some cases have not been adopted for use in the European 
Union: 
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ (amendment)  
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates’ (amendment) 
IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ (amendment) 
Amendments to IFRS (Annual improvements cycle 2014-2016) 
Amendments to IFRS (Annual improvements cycle 2015-2017) 
The Group has assessed the impact of these new standards and 
interpretations and does not anticipate any material impact on the 
financial statements.  
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ modifies the classification and 
measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, 
impairment provisioning and hedge accounting. There is no 
change to the Group in respect of classification of financial assets 
and liabilities and hedge accounting. All Group financial assets 
have been assessed for impairments under the 12 month and 
lifetime expected credit loss models considered by IFRS 9. The 
adoption of the new standard does not have a material impact  
on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
 
 
 
In relation to IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, 
the Group’s material revenue stream relates to property rental 
income. On the adoption of the standard this revenue stream  
will not be materially impacted due to property rental income not 
being within the scope of IFRS 15. The assessment of this standard 
also indicated that the impact on all other revenue streams is  
not material. 
As the Group is predominantly a lessor, IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ will not 
have a material impact on adoption. Where the Group is currently  
a lessee, this relates only to immaterial contracts. 
A summary of the Group’s principal accounting policies, which 
have been applied consistently across the Group is set out below. 
Going concern 
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements 
and for this reason the consolidated financial statements have  
been prepared on a going concern basis. 
Basis of consolidation  
These consolidated financial statements include the consolidation 
of the following limited partnerships: Capital & Counties CGP, 
Capco CGP 2012 LP, CG Investments 2016 LP, EC Properties LP, 
Innova Investment Group Holdings LP and The Empress State LP. 
The members of these qualifying partnerships have taken 
advantage of exemptions available in Statutory Instrument 
2008/569 and therefore will not produce consolidated accounts  
at the partnership level. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in British 
pounds sterling, which is also determined to be the functional 
currency of the Parent. 
Subsidiaries  
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the 
Group has control, it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over an entity. Subsidiaries cease  
to be consolidated from the date this control is lost. 
Non-controlling interests are recognised on the basis of their 
proportionate share in the recognised amounts of a subsidiary’s 
identifiable net assets. On the balance sheet non-controlling 
interests are presented separately from the equity of the owners  
of the Parent. Profit or loss and total comprehensive income for  
the period attributable to non-controlling interests are presented 
separately in the income statement and the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
and uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in  
accordance with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses from sources not 
readily apparent. Although these estimates and assumptions are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, historical 
experiences and other factors, actual results ultimately may differ 
from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate  
is revised if the revision affects only that period.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
and uncertainty continued 
The significant areas of estimation and uncertainty are: 
Property valuation: The most significant area of estimation and 
uncertainty in the consolidated financial statements is in respect  
of the valuation of the property portfolio, where external 
valuations are obtained. The valuation of the Group’s property 
portfolio is inherently subjective due to the assumptions as 
outlined within note 15 ‘Property Portfolio’ and this subjectivity 
may result in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the 
assets and liabilities year on year. As a result, the valuations the 
Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of 
uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may 
not prove to be accurate and could therefore have a material effect 
on the Group’s financial performance and position. 
The key areas of accounting judgement are: 
Property classification: Judgement is required in the classification 
of property between investment and development, trading and  
owner occupied. Management considers each property separately 
and reviews factors including the long-term intention for the 
property, in determining if trading, and the level of ancillary 
income, in determining if owner occupied, to ensure the 
appropriate classification. 
Other less significant judgements and sources of estimation and 
uncertainty relate to revenue recognition, significant disposals, 
provisions, share-based payment and contingent liabilities. 
Operating segments 
Management has determined the operating segments with 
reference to reports on divisional financial performance and 
position that are regularly reviewed by the Executive Directors,  
who are deemed to be the chief operating decision makers. 
Revenue recognition 
Rent receivable consists of gross income calculated on an accruals 
basis, together with services where the Group acts as principal in 
the ordinary course of business, excluding sales of property. Rental 
income is spread evenly over the period from lease commencement 
to lease expiry.  
Tenant lease incentive payments, including surrender premiums 
paid which can be directly linked to enhanced rental income, are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Upon receipt 
of a surrender premium for the early termination of a lease, the 
profit and non-recoverable outgoings relating to the lease 
concerned are immediately reflected in net rental income. 
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are not fixed  
at the inception of a lease, for example increases arising on rent 
reviews, are recorded as income in the periods in which they  
are earned.  
Where the outcome of an outstanding rent review is reasonably 
certain, rent is accrued from the review date based upon an 
estimated annual rent. Estimates are derived from knowledge  
of market rents for comparable properties determined on an 
individual property basis and updated for progress of negotiations. 
Where revenue is obtained by the sale of property, it is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to  
the buyer. This will normally take place on exchange of contracts 
unless there are conditions that suggest insufficient probability  
of future economic benefits flowing to the Group. For conditional 
exchanges, sales are recognised when these conditions are satisfied. 
Revenue arising from the sale of property under construction is 
recognised when contracts have been exchanged, the building work 
is physically complete and significant conditions with the buyer 
have been satisfied. 
Other income 
Other income includes management fees charged to joint ventures 
for services associated with the management of properties and 
other general expenses as defined by management agreements. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and the effective interest rate. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting  
from settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the income statement except for differences 
arising on the retranslation of available-for-sale investments  
which are recognised in other comprehensive income.  
Income taxes 
Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income for the 
year and any adjustment in respect of prior years. It is calculated 
using rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by  
the balance sheet date.  
In accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’, deferred tax is  
provided for using the balance sheet liability method on temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of those assets 
and liabilities. However, temporary differences are not recognised 
to the extent that they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; or are associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where  
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be 
controlled by the parent, venture or investor, respectively, and  
it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in  
the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
management believes it is probable that future taxable profit will 
be available against which the deferred tax assets can be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities 
and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income 
taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the same taxable 
group or different taxable entities where there is an intention to 
settle balances on a net basis.  
Tax is included in the income statement except when it relates  
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  
in equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.  
Discontinued operation 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business 
that represents a separate major line of the business that has been 
disposed of or meets the criteria for classification as held for sale. 
Discontinued operations are presented separately from continuing 
operations in both the income statement and statement of  
cash flows. The comparatives have been re-presented as a result  
of the discontinued operation. 
Share-based payment 
The cost of granting share options and other share-based 
remuneration to employees and Directors is recognised through 
the income statement with reference to the fair value of the 
instrument at the date of grant.  
Financial statements Strategic report Governance Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 104 
Notes to the accounts continued 
104 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Share-based payment continued 
The income statement is charged over the vesting period of the 
options with a corresponding increase in equity. An option pricing 
model is used applying assumptions around expected yields, 
forfeiture rates, exercise price and volatility.  
Upon eventual exercise, a reserves transfer occurs with no further 
charge reflected in the income statement. 
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans and 
other share-based payment arrangements are treated as treasury 
shares and deducted from equity.  
Investment and development property 
Investment and development property is owned or leased  
by the Group and held for long-term rental income and  
capital appreciation. 
The Group has chosen to use the fair value model. Property and  
any related obligations are initially recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards attached to the property have transferred to the 
Group. Payments made in respect of the future acquisition of 
investment and development property, as is the case for the CLSA, 
are initially recognised as prepayments until the recognition 
criteria outlined above have been met. Investment and 
development property is recorded at cost and subsequently 
revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined  
by professionally qualified external valuers on the basis of  
market value. 
The fair value of property is arrived at by adjusting the market 
value as above for directly attributable tenant lease incentives  
and fixed head leases. 
Property held under leases is stated gross of the recognised finance 
lease liability. 
The valuation is based upon assumptions as outlined within the 
property portfolio note. These assumptions conform with the  
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation 
Professional Standards. The cost of development properties 
includes capitalised interest and other directly attributable 
outgoings, with the exception of properties and land where  
no development is imminent in which case no interest is  
included. Interest is capitalised (before tax relief) on the basis  
of the weighted average cost of debt outstanding until the  
date of practical completion. 
When the Group redevelops a property for continued future use, 
that property is classified as investment and development property 
during the redevelopment period and continues to be measured  
at fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
and development property are recognised in the income statement 
in the period in which they arise. Depreciation is not provided in 
respect of investment property including plant and equipment 
integral to such investment property. Investment and development 
properties cease to be recognised as investment and development 
property when they have been disposed of or when they cease  
to be held for the purpose of generating rental income or for  
capital appreciation. 
Disposals are recognised on completion. Gains or losses arising  
are recognised in the income statement. The gain on disposal is 
determined as the difference between the net sales proceeds and  
the carrying amount of the asset at the commencement of the 
accounting period plus capital expenditure in the period.  
A property ceases to be recognised as investment and development 
property and is transferred at its fair value to trading property 
when in the Directors’ judgement, development commences with 
the intention of sale. Criteria considered in this assessment include 
the Board’s stated intention, contractual commitments and 
physical, legal and financial viability. 
When the use of a property changes from trading property to 
investment and development property, the property is transferred at 
fair value with any resulting gain recognised in the income statement. 
Trading property 
Trading property comprises those properties that in the  
Directors’ view are not held for long-term rental income or capital 
appreciation and are expected to be disposed of within one year of 
the balance sheet date or to be developed with the intention to sell.  
Such property is constructed, acquired, or if transferred from 
investment and development property, transferred at fair value 
which is deemed to represent cost. Subsequently trading property 
is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling costs. 
Net realisable value approximates market value as determined by 
professionally qualified external valuers at the balance sheet date.  
The amount of any write down of trading property to market  
value is recognised as an expense in the period the write down 
occurs. Should a valuation uplift occur in a subsequent period,  
the amount of any reversal shall be recognised as a reduction in  
the previous write down in the period in which the uplift occurs. 
This may not exceed the property’s cost.  
The sale of trading property is recognised as revenue when the 
significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer. 
Total costs incurred in respect of trading property are recognised 
simultaneously as an expense.  
Leases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. 
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases.  
Group as a lessee: 
In accordance with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’, property  
held under finance and operating leases may be accounted for  
as investment property. Finance leases are recognised as both an 
asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments. 
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet at 
the lower of fair value and the present value of minimum lease 
payments, gross of the recognised finance lease liability. Lease 
payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges  
so as to achieve a constant financing rate. 
Other finance leased assets are capitalised at the lower of the fair 
value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
and the useful life of the asset.  
Rental expenses under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment consist of fixtures, fittings and other  
office equipment. Plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment  
losses. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset  
plus any attributable cost in bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use. Depreciation is charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over an asset’s  
estimated useful life. Currently, the maximum life of the  
Group’s plant and equipment is five years.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Investment in Group companies  
Investment in Group companies, which eliminates on 
consolidation, is stated in the Company’s separate financial 
statements at cost less impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses 
are determined with reference to the investment’s fair value less 
estimated selling costs. Fair value is derived from the subsidiary’s, 
and their subsidiaries’, net assets at the balance sheet date. On 
disposal, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and its 
carrying amount is included in the income statement. 
Investment in joint ventures 
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has 
joint control, established by contractual agreement. Investments in 
joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. On initial 
recognition the investment is recognised at cost, and the carrying 
amount is subsequently increased or decreased to recognise the 
Group’s share of the profit or loss of the joint venture after the date 
of acquisition. Goodwill, if any, on acquisition is included in the 
carrying amount of the investment.  
The Group’s investment in joint ventures is presented separately  
on the balance sheet and the Group’s share of the joint venture’s 
post-tax profit or loss for the period is also presented separately  
in the income statement.   
Where there is an indication that the Group’s investment in joint 
ventures may be impaired the Group evaluates the recoverable 
amount of its investment, being the higher of the joint venture’s 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable 
amount is lower than the carrying value an impairment loss  
is recognised in the income statement.  
If the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds  
its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to 
make payments on behalf of the joint venture. 
Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses non-trading derivative financial instruments  
to manage exposure to interest rate risk. They are initially 
recognised on the trade date at fair value and subsequently 
remeasured at fair value based on market price. The method of 
recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the 
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the 
nature of the item being hedged. Instruments that have not been 
designated as qualifying for hedge accounting are classified as  
held for trading. Changes in fair value of these instruments are 
recognised directly in the income statement.  
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a highly 
probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). For hedging 
instruments, the Group documents at the inception of the 
transaction the relationship between hedging instruments  
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives  
and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions. The Group  
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on  
an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes  
in cash flows of hedged items. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives  
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised  
in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit 
or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.  
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge  
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised 
in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in 
equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value  
and subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Directors 
exercise judgement as to the collectability of the Group’s trade  
and other receivables and determine when it is appropriate to 
impair these assets. 
Impairment of financial assets 
An annual review is conducted for financial assets to determine 
whether there is any evidence of a loss event as described by IAS 39 
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. Factors 
such as days past due, credit status of the counterparty, historical 
evidence of collection and probability of deriving future economic 
benefit are considered to assess whether there is objective evidence 
of impairment. The amount of any potential loss is calculated by 
estimating future cash flows or by using fair value where this is 
available through observable market prices. If, in a subsequent 
period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the 
decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the 
original impairment was recognised, the impairment reversal is 
recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent with  
the original charge. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value. Cash and 
cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits with banks and 
other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade payables are obligations for goods or services acquired  
in the ordinary course of business. Trade and other payables are 
recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost until settled. 
Deposits 
Property deposits and on account receipts are held within trade and 
other payables. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current obligation 
arising from a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are ordinarily recognised initially at their net proceeds 
as an approximation of fair value. 
If the transaction price is not an approximation of fair value  
at initial recognition, the Group determines the fair value as 
evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical 
instrument or based on a valuation technique that uses data from 
observable markets. Where equity holders of the Group are party  
to the transaction the difference between the net proceeds and  
fair value is recognised within equity. Borrowings are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost. Any transaction costs, premiums or 
discounts are capitalised and recognised over the contractual life of 
the loan using the effective interest rate method; or on a straight 
line basis where it is impractical to do so. 
In the event of early repayment, transaction costs, premiums or 
discounts paid or unamortised costs are recognised immediately  
in the income statement.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Pensions 
The costs of the defined contribution scheme and the Group’s 
personal pension plans are charged against profits in the year in 
which they fall due.  
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed where there are present or 
possible obligations arising from past events, but the economic 
impact is uncertain in timing, occurrence or amount. A description 
of the nature and, where possible, an estimate of the financial effect 
of contingent liabilities are disclosed. 
Capital commitments are disclosed when the Group has a 
contractual future obligation which has not been provided for  
at the balance sheet date. Amounts are only provided for where 
such obligations are onerous. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a 
deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.  
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
Management has determined the operating segments based  
on reports reviewed by the Executive Directors, who are deemed to  
be the chief operating decision makers. The principal performance 
measures have been identified as net rental income and net  
asset value.  
For management and reporting purposes the Group  
is organised into three divisions: 
– Covent Garden; 
– Earls Court Properties represents the Group’s interests in the 
Earls Court area, comprising properties held in ECPL, Lillie 
Square, the Empress State Building and a number of smaller 
properties in the Earls Court area; and 
– Other comprises Innova, the discontinued activity of Venues and 
The Great Capital Partnership, other head office companies and 
investments, including the payment of internal rent. 
Management information is reported to the chief operating 
decision makers on a Group share basis. Outlined below is the 
Group share by segment: 
Segment Group share
Covent Garden 100%
 
Earls Court Properties 
ECPL  63%
Lillie Square 50%
Empress State 100%
Other 100%
 
Other 
Innova 50%
GCP 50%
Venues
1
 0%
Other 100%
1 Venues was 100 per cent owned until 7 April 2017. Subsequent to this the Group 
share ownership is nil. 
Segmental reporting has been presented in line with management 
information and therefore consolidation adjustments are presented 
to reconcile segmental performance and position to the IFRS total.  
The Group’s operating segments derive their revenue primarily 
from rental income from lessees.  
Unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally 
which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to 
individual segments.

Impairment of other receivables 1.3 14.8
Following an impairment review of amounts receivable from joint ventures by the Group, a net impairment of £1.3 million has been 
recognised (2016: £14.8 million). The Lillie square joint venture incurs amortisation charges on deep discount bonds that were issued to the 
Group and Kwok Family Interests (“KFI”) which has contributed to the cumulative losses. The Group has recognised £11.7 million (2016: 
£10.5 million) finance income on these deep discount bonds. 
During the year the amounts receivable from joint ventures were part repaid resulting in a write back of £8.2 million against amounts 
previously impaired. The impairment of amounts receivable from joint venture is calculated with reference to the Group’s share of the 
cumulative losses in the Lillie Square joint venture. The carrying value of the investment is £nil (2016: £nil) in accordance with IAS 28 
‘Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures’ (“IAS 28”). Refer to note 17 ‘Investment in Joint Ventures’. 
Due to objective evidence existing an impairment assessment was performed in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments’ comparing 
the carrying amount of the deep discount bonds to the present value of the estimated future cash flows. This has resulted in a write down  
of £9.5 million which has been recorded against the deep discount bonds.  
6 OTHER COSTS 
On 30 August 2012, the Group completed a joint venture arrangement with KFI. The venture, to develop land interests at Lillie Square, 
resulted in the loss of control of the former subsidiary Lillie Square GP Limited and the disposal of a 50 per cent limited partnership 
interest in Lillie Square LP. As at 31 December 2016 additional costs associated with the transaction were incurred resulting in a loss of £5.0 
million. No additional costs were incurred in 2017.

12 DISCONTINUED OPERATION  
On 7 April 2017, the Group completed the sale of Venues, its exhibition business, comprising Olympia London together with certain 
related property assets for a total gross cash consideration of £296.0 million. The disposal was in line with the Group strategy following 
the successful transition of shows from the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres to Olympia. After the repayment of debt, working 
capital adjustments and transaction related costs, net proceeds received were £230.2 million. Based on the net assets at the date of disposal 
a profit has been recognised on the sale of £2.1 million. As part of the sale, the defined benefit scheme the Group previous held was sold to 
the purchaser and therefore the Group has no outstanding liability in relation to the scheme.  
The net assets at the date of disposal were as follows:

15 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED 
At 31 December 2017, the Group was contractually committed to £57.3 million (2016: £149.2 million) of future expenditure for the 
purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property. Refer to note 29 ‘Capital 
Commitments’ for further information on capital commitments.  
The fair value of the Group’s investment, development and trading property at 31 December 2017 was determined by independent, 
appropriately qualified external valuers, JLL for Earls Court Properties (excluding the Empress State Building) and 15-17 Long Acre and 
CBRE Ltd for the remainder of the Group’s property portfolio. The valuations conform to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors 
(“RICS”) Valuation Professional Standards. Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts.  
Each year the Executive Directors, on behalf of the Board, appoint the external valuers. The valuers are selected based upon their 
knowledge, independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group. 
Valuations are performed bi-annually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Group’s portfolio. At each reporting  
date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs. Valuers submit  
and present summary reports to the Group’s Audit Committee, with the Executive Directors reporting to the Board on the outcome  
of each valuation round. 
Valuations take into account tenure, lease terms and structural condition. The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent or 
business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs 
including any site specific costs (for example Section 106), professional fees, planning fees, developer’s profit including contingencies, 
planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar 
properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development. As at 31 December 2017 all Covent Garden properties are valued 
under the income capitalisation technique. The majority of Earls Court properties are valued under the residual development approach.  
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use. When considering the highest and best use a valuer will 
consider, on a property by property basis, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable. Where the 
highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing  
this change in arriving at its valuation.  
A number of the Group’s properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing use.  
In respect of development valuations, the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based upon 
assumptions of capital values, rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the 
development. Deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developer’s profit, before arriving at a valuation.  
Most notably, within Earls Court Properties, the Empress State Building has been valued on the basis of its development potential as a 
residential-led scheme. The property is currently used as an office space, generating an income stream for the Group, while the process to 
achieve the change in use is being implemented.  
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets.  
The most significant of these occur when planning permission is required or when a credit facility is in place. These restrictions are 
factored into the property’s valuation by the external valuer. Refer to disclosures surrounding property risks on page 19.  
Non-financial assets carried at fair value, as is the case for investment and development property held by the Group, are required to be 
analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ (“IFRS 13”). Trading property is 
exempt from IFRS 13 disclosure requirements. The different valuation levels are defined as: 
Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets; 
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either  
directly or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices; and 
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data. Valuations at this level are more subjective and 
therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.  
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between  
fair value levels is deemed to have occurred. Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer from  
Level 3 to Level 2. All investment and development properties held by the Group are classified as Level 3. 
As at 31 December 2016, £178.5 million of Covent Garden investment and development properties were valued using the residual 
development method valuation technique. As at 31 December 2017, these properties have been valued using the income capitalisation 
valuation technique as the developments have completed or are substantially complete.   www.capitalandcounties.com 119

1 Estimated rental value and capital value are expressed per square foot on an net internal area basis. Construction costs incl uding site specific costs expressed per square foot on a 
gross external area basis.  
For properties valued under the income capitalisation method, if all other factors remained equal, an increase in estimated rental value  
of five per cent would result in an increased asset valuation of £119.5 million (2016: £111.8 million). A decrease in the estimated rental value 
of five per cent would result in a decreased asset value of £115.8 million (2016: £108.7 million). Conversely, an increased equivalent yield of  
25 basis points would result in a decreased asset valuation of £174.3 million (2016: £159.8 million). A decreased equivalent yield of 25 basis 
points would result in an increased asset valuation of £199.4 million (2016: £182.9 million). These inputs are interdependent, partially 
determined by market conditions. The impact on the valuation could be mitigated by the interrelationship between the two inputs. An 
increase in estimated rental value occurring in conjunction with an increase in equivalent yield could result in no net impact to  
the valuation. 
For properties valued under the residual development method, an increase in the estimated construction costs of 10 per cent wou ld result in  
a decrease in the asset valuation of £224.5 million (2016: £238.1 million) and a decrease of 10 per cent would result in an inc rease in the asset 
valuation of £225.1 million (2016: £239.4 million). An increase in the developer’s profit of one percentage point would result in a decrease in the 
asset valuation of £24.8 million (2016: £27.8 million) and a decrease of one percentage point would result in an increase in the asset valuation  
of £24.8 million (2016: £28.6 million). An increased finance rate of 25 basis points would result in a decreased asset valuation of £25.2 million 
(2016: £26.3 million) and a decrease of 25 basis points would result in an incr eased asset valuation of £25.0 million (2016: £26.6 million). 
Conversely, an increase in the capital value per square foot of five per cent would result in an increase in the asset valuatio n of £144.8 million 
(2016: £158.1 million) and a decrease of fi ve per cent would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of £145.8 million (201 6: £156.4 million).  
The above inputs are interdependent, partially determined by market conditions. The impact on the valuation could be mitigated by the 
interrelationship between these inputs. 
An increase in the discount rate included in a discount cash flow valuation of 10 per cent would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 
£0.2 million (2016: £22.4 million). A decrease in the discount rate included in a discount cash flow valuation of 10 per cent would result in 
an increase in the asset valuation of £0.2 million (2016: £38.4 million).

Unsecured, non-interest bearing loan notes have been issued by ECPL to TTL Earls Court Properties Limited. As the transaction price of the 
loan notes was not an approximation of their fair value, the Group determined the fair value by using data from observable inputs. As a 
result, the initial fair value of the loan notes was valued at less than £0.1 million (2016: less than £0.1 million) and therefore £402.9 million 
(2016: £402.6 million) has been classified as equity.

Finance lease liabilities are in respect of leasehold interests in investment and development property. Certain leases provide for payment  
of contingent rent, usually a proportion of net rental income, in addition to the minimum lease payments above. £1.3 million contingent 
rent has been paid during the year (2016: £1.1 million).  
A 999 year leasehold interest is held for the air rights above the West London Line as detailed in note 30 ‘Contingent Liabilities’. Any 
further payments payable at the time of development or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan will be accounted for as 
contingent rent when incurred. 
Finance lease liabilities are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.

26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group’s financial risk management strategy seeks to set financial limits for treasury activity to ensure they are in line with the risk 
appetite of the Group. The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Group’s operations: market risk (principally interest rate 
risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. 
The following tables set out each class of financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.

The majority of the Group’s financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summa rised below. 
Market risk 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a 
financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial 
instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas 
borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.

26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives. Interest rate swaps have 
the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates. Interest rate caps protect the Group by capping the maximum 
interest rate payable at the caps ceiling. Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate payable at the collar’s 
ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor. 
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn external borrowings profile of the Group and joint 
ventures. The table is calculated on a Group share basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.

1 Excludes current loan notes of £nil (2016: £6.0 million) to which the Group has no interest rate exposure under the terms of the borrowing. 
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is greater than 25 per cent. 
In 2016, the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap to hedge the variability in specified hedged interest cash flows arising 
on £60.0 million of outstanding debt from 2016 to 2026. The loss recognised in other comprehensive income in the year was £nil (2016: 
£1.2 million). This loss will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement over the term of the 
designated debt. The fair value of the designated hedging instrument at 31 December 2017 is £nil (2016: £nil). The hedge was 100 per cent 
effective; therefore no charge for an ineffective portion has been taken to the consolidated income statement. 
The sensitivity analysis below illustrates the impact of a 50 basis point (“bps”) shift, upwards and downwards, in the level of interest rates 
on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments.

Effect on profit before tax (change in fair value of derivative financial instruments):  
Increase/(decrease) 6.6 (6.6) 10.4 (10.4)
The sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve  
that may actually occur and represents management’s assessment of possible changes in interest rates. The fixed rate derivative financial 
instruments are matched by floating rate debt, therefore such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.  
The Group’s policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing 
risk. The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost. 
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Group’s operational requirements and investment commi tments.  
The Group’s policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed and undrawn facilities. 
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entity’s ability to meet the relevant facility’s 
financial covenants. The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.  
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the 
regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted 
maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk. This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the  
desired refinancing.  
The tables overleaf set out the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to 
make payments of interest and to repay principal. Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates used are  
those implied by the par yield curve.

Contractual maturities reflect the expected maturities of financial instruments. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, amounts receivable from joint ventures, loan notes and cash and  
cash equivalents. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk 
arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Group’s undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such  
as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties. The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account the value of any deposits or guarantees obtained. 
Trade and other receivables:  
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who cont inuously  
monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default. Trade receivables are less 
than one per cent of total assets at 31 December 2017 (2016: less than one per cent). 
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial 
information. As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2017 was  
£13.6 million (2016: £7.8 million). 
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment specifically  
on each contract. 
Specific provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns. The 
amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.  
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: 
Group  
2017  
£m 
Group 
2016 
£m
Up to 90 days 3.2 7.3
Over 90 days 0.1 0.6
Trade receivables 3.3 7.9
In 2017 there was an impairment write back on trade receivables of £0.5 million (2016: write down of £0.6 million).  
As the Group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk. However, this is mitigated by the 
extensive range of tenants from varying business sectors and the credit review process as noted above.

26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
Amounts receivable from joint ventures: 
Included within receivables is £nil (2016: £7.0 million) of amou nts advanced to LSJV. The carrying value of the investment in LSJV is £nil  
(2016: £nil) as the Group’s share of losses exceeds the cost of its investment. Total funding advanced to LSJV, including the deep discount 
bonds, of £147.5 million (2016: £150.9 million) has been impaired by the cumulative losses attributable to the joint venture by £47.6 million 
(2016: £46.3 million).  
LSJV is in a net liability position due to carrying trading property at the lower of cost and net realisable value. However, based on a market 
valuation undertaken by the Group’s valuers JLL, there is an unrecognised surplus of £31.8 million (Group share) as at 31 December 2017. 
This surplus will only be evidenced on sale of trading property when significant risks and rewards have transferred to the buyer. Therefore, 
while Lillie Square demonstrates positive pricing evidence commercially and funding provided is not deemed to be at risk of default, for 
reporting purposes the Group is required to allocate losses against amounts advanced to LSJV, to the extent that losses do not exceed the 
investment, until the unrecognised surplus on trading property is realised through sale. 
Cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments:  
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury. Relationships  
are maintained with a number of institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group cash investment policy relating  
to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties. The maximum exposure to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments as at  
31 December 2017 amounted to £28.6 million (2016: £31.1 million). 
Capital structure 
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and  
by managing the capital structure. The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and other financial instruments and aims to access both debt  
and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.  
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the loan to value ratio (“LTV”) and the interest cover ratio. The Group 
aims not to exceed an underlying LTV ratio of more than 40 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent. These ratios are 
disclosed on a Group share basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management. These metrics are discussed in 
the Financial Review on page 40.

Fair value estimation  
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13. 
The different valuation levels are defined in note 15 ‘Property Portfolio’. 
The tables below present the Group’s financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. 
There were no transfers between levels during the year.

The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined from observable market prices or estimated using appropriate yield 
curves at 31 December each year by discounting the future contractual cash flows to the net present values. 
The fair values of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets and other financial liabilities are not materially different 
from those at which they are carried in the financial statements.

27 DEFERRED TAX  
The decrease in corporation tax rate referred to in note 11 ‘Taxation’ has been enacted for the purposes of IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ (“IAS 12”) 
and therefore has been reflected in these consolidated financial statements based on the expected timing of the realisation of deferred tax.  
Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the 
properties’ original tax base cost. Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief and the Group’s holding structure.  
The Group’s recognised deferred tax position on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is £nil at 31 December 
2017 (2016: £nil). The Group’s contingent tax liability on investment properties, calculated on the same tax base cost as above but based on 
a deemed market value disposal at year end, is £nil (2016: £nil).  
A disposal of the Group’s trading properties at their market value as per note 15 ‘Property Portfolio’, net of available losses, would result in 
a corporation tax charge to the Group of £1.6 million (19.25 per cent of £8.3 million).

29 CAPITAL COMMITMENTS 
At 31 December 2017, the Group was contractually committed to £57.3 million (2016: £149.2 million) of future expenditure for the 
purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property. Of the £57.3 million 
committed, £42.2 million is committed 2018 expenditure.  
In November 2013, the Group exercised its option under the CLSA which it entered into with LBHF in January 2013 in relation to LBHF’s 
land interest within the Earls Court Masterplan. Under the terms of the CLSA, the Group can draw down land in phases but no land can be 
transferred unless replacement homes for the residents of the relevant phase have been provided and vacant possession is given. The Group 
has already paid £75.0 million of the £105.0 million cash consideration payable under the CLSA. The residual £30.0 million will be settled 
in two annual instalments of £15.0 million with the next payment due on 31 December 2018. 
The Group’s share of joint venture capital commitments arising on LSJV amounts to £7.0 million (2016: £18.2 million).  
30 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims, guarantees and warranties arising from the ordinary course of business. 
Contingent liabilities that may result in material liabilities are described below.  
Under the terms of the CLSA the Group has certain compensation obligations relating to achieving vacant possession, which are subject  
to an overall cap of £55.0 million. Should any payments be made in respect of these obligations, they will be deducted from the total 
consideration payable to LBHF (refer to note 29 ‘Capital Commitments’). 
In March 2013, an agreement with Network Rail was signed to acquire a 999 year leasehold interest in the air rights above the West London 
Line where it runs within the Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area. Within the terms of the agreement, the Group can 
exercise options during the next 50 years for further 999 year leases over the remainder of the West London Line to allow for development 
within the Earls Court Masterplan. Network Rail is entitled to further payments of 5.55 per cent of the residual land value which will be 
payable at the time of development or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan. Any further payments to Network Rail will be 
treated as contingent rent as per note 24 ‘Finance Lease Obligations’.  
Within the terms of the agreement of the acquisition of the Northern Access Road land, the vendor’s successor in title is entitled to further 
payments until 2027 if certain conditions are met. Further payments become due following the grant of a planning permission for change 
of use or on disposal. In the event such planning permission is implemented, the payment is calculated at 50 per cent of the uplift in land 
value following the grant of the permission. In the event of a disposal, the payment is calculated as 50 per cent of the difference between 
the sale value against the land value without the relevant permission.

33 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives. All schemes are equity settled 
with the increase in equity measured by reference to the fair value of the Group’s equity instruments at the grant date of the share awards. 
The corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares 
that are expected to vest. The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of share-based payments for 2017 
was £2.0 million (2016: £1.1 million). All options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. The fair 
value of share awards is determined by the market price of the shares at the grant date. 
Full details of the performance criteria, vesting outcomes and any additional holding periods for the performance share plan, and the 
former performance and matching share plans, are set out within the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 86. 
1. Performance share plan 
Market value and nil cost options to subscribe for ordinary shares and conditional awards of free shares may be awarded under the  
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”), and could previously be awarded under the former Performance Share Plan (“Former PSP”). The 
Company may make a proportion of awards as HMRC approved market value options. 
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2017 were exercisable between nil pence and 364 pence and have a weighted average  
remaining contractual life of eight years and are exercisable between 2018 and 2027.

no further awards will be made.

3. Fair value of share-based payment 
The fair value of share awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the half that is subject to the total return 
performance condition and using the stochastic pricing model for the half that is subject to the total shareholder return performance 
condition. Inputs to the models for share awards during the year are as follows:

Alternative performance measures 
For the year ended 31 December 2017 
The Group has applied the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) guidelines on alternative performance measures 
(“APMs”) in these annual results. An APM is a financial measure of historical or future finance performance, position or cash flow of the 
Group which is not a measure defined or specified in IFRS. 
Set out below is a summary of the APMs used in this Annual Report. 
Many of the APMs included are based on the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations reporting framework, a set of standard disclosures for 
the property industry, which aims to improve the transparency, comparability and relevance of published results of public real estate 
companies in Europe.  
The Group also uses underlying earnings, property portfolio and financial debt ratios APMs. The Group considers the presentation of 
underlying earnings to be useful supplementary information as it removes unrealised and certain other items and therefore represents the 
recurring, underlying performance of the business. The property portfolio presents the Group share of property market value which is the 
economic value attributable to the owners of the Parent. Financial debt ratios are supplementary ratios which we believe are useful in 
monitoring the capital structure of the Group. Additionally loan to value and interest cover are covenants within many of the Group’s 
borrowing facilities. 
Internally, the Board focuses on and reviews information and reports prepared on a Group share basis, which includes the Group’s share of 
joint ventures but excludes the non-controlling interest share of our subsidiaries.

The following are the salient dates for payment of the proposed 
final dividend:

Election date for scrip dividend alternative (UK) by

Annual General Meeting 4 May 2018
Dividend payment date for shareholders 23 May 2018
South African shareholders should note that, in accordance with 
the requirements of Strate, the last day to trade cum-dividend will 
be 17 April 2018 and that no dematerialisation of shares will be 
possible from 18 April 2018 to 20 April 2018 inclusive. No transfers 
between the UK and South Africa registers may take place from  
9 April 2018 to 20 April 2018 inclusive. 
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to offer an optional 
scrip dividend alternative in respect of the 2017 final dividend.  
The above dates are proposed and subject to change. 
Important information for South African shareholders: 
The final cash dividend declared by the Company will constitute a 
dividend for Dividends Tax purposes. Dividends Tax will therefore 
be withheld from the amount of the final cash dividend which is 
paid at a rate of 20 per cent, unless a shareholder qualifies for an 
exemption and the prescribed requirements for effecting the 
exemption, as set out in the rules of the Scrip Dividend Scheme,  
are in place. 
It is the Company’s understanding that the issue and receipt of 
shares pursuant to the scrip dividend alternative will not have any 
Dividends Tax nor income tax implications. The new shares which 
are acquired under the scrip dividend alternative will be treated  
as having been acquired for nil consideration. 
This information is included only as a general guide to taxation  
for shareholders resident in South Africa based on Capco’s 
understanding of the law and the practice currently in force.  
Any shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position  
should seek independent professional advice.
