OF FINISHED MEDICAL DEVICES
The Company is developing several proprietary products it intends 
to commercialise through out-licensing to distribution partners.
STRATEGIC REPORT
5 Annual report and accounts 2017 Collagen Solutions plc STRATEGIC REPORT
Our business model
Our core products include medical-grade collagen, the 
primary protein in those tissues that provides a supportive 
environment for the cells, and processed native tissues such as 
pericardium, a uniquely strong tissue that surrounds the heart, 
and medical-grade collagen formulations. We supply these as 
standard raw materials as well as in custom formulations that 
are used for the spectrum of basic research to regenerative 
medicine therapies and medical devices. 
In addition, we have several proprietary products in 
development based on our IP and know-how for cartilage 
regeneration, wound healing and bone grafting that we 
plan to out-license to distribution partners. 
Example collagen-based medical devices
We enable creation of regenerative medicine technologies 
through our extensive experience in biomaterials. 
Collaborative approach 
Our team works in partnership with our customers to engineer 
the best solution, resulting in faster time to market, improved 
production and superior products for our customers. 
Comprehensive offering of products and services 
We have a broad range of soluble and freeze-dried monomeric 
and polymeric medical-grade collagen, plus access to a wide 
range of xenograft tissues, providing customers with a single 
source with a flexible range of options for their biomaterials 
needs. More importantly, we are one of a few companies 
with the know-how in collagen and tissue processing related 
to tissue scaffold and medical device development. 
World-class quality standards 
Given the highly regulated nature of our business and barriers 
to entry, the quality of our products, along with our regulatory 
dossiers and animal sourcing from Australia and New Zealand 
(the lowest BSE risk), provides our customers with confidence 
and reduces risk in their supply chains. 
Products D iff er en t i a t o r s
Collagen Solutions’ vision is to be the industry’s first choice 
for regenerative biomaterials.
Growth model
We have multiple initiatives to drive long-term accelerating revenue growth as we: (i) significantly expand our core business of 
biomaterials development, supply and manufacturing that has ‘sticky’ recurring revenue; and (ii) introduce multiple proprietary products 
for licensing and distribution.

Haemostats
6 Collagen Solutions plc Annual report and accounts 2017 With reference to our value differentiators, innovation 
begins by leveraging our extensive scientific expertise and 
our collaborative approach with customers. Innovation 
comes from our extensive experience in collagen and tissue 
processing at both the research and clinical levels.
Development
Through our three R&D centres of excellence in the US, UK, 
and New Zealand, we are able to offer a wide variety of 
development services depending on the customer’s needs. 
Early in a project, we contract with a customer to iterate a 
formulation and/or device that meets the specific technical 
and commercial product needs before entering the final 
stages of development.
Supply
When customers choose to manufacture their own product, 
we supply the critical biomaterials needed for their application. 
We manufacture those materials in our New Zealand and UK 
facilities and maintain an ongoing supply. This supply chain 
is ‘sticky’ in that once materials are embedded in a customer’s 
product, the demand typically follows the growth in volume 
once the product is launched.
Manufacturing
We manufacture semi-finished or finished devices to spec 
for our customers under their private label. Additionally, 
as we develop our own proprietary products, they will be 
manufactured in our UK and New Zealand plants and then 
private labelled for our licensing/distribution partners.
Growth strategy
Collagen Solutions’ growth strategy entails multiple 
initiatives within two areas of the business:
• 
core development, supply and manufacture; and
• 
proprietary products.
Our core business includes a wide range of biomaterial 
supply and product development services, and contract 
manufacturing for medical devices, regenerative medicine, 
and research. Our initiatives to grow this core business include:
• 
expansion and investment in our direct and distribution 
partner sales channels;
• 
geographic expansion (especially in Asian markets); and
• 
increasing the OEM mix of our business.
Because our products are embedded in our customers’ final 
products early in the design and regulatory process, our 
sales growth is expected to follow the growth of our 
customers’ products.
Commercial management
To reach the most accessible customers in medical device 
and regenerative medicine markets, we have invested in a 
direct sales team in the US, UK and South Korea. This team 
is primarily responsible for sourcing new prospects and 
advancing the pipeline of opportunities to secure 
agreements with the support of:
• 
marketing to increase brand awareness through a number 
of channels such as live events, web-based marketing 
campaigns and direct customer engagement; and
• 
sales operations to co-ordinate contracting and customer 
responsiveness across our three centres of excellence, 
ensuring seamless global support.
Value creation process Strategies
Summary value proposition
Collagen Solutions has established multiple opportunities for accelerated growth over the next several years in both our core 
development, supply and manufacturing business as well as our new proprietary products to take advantage of the high-growth 
regenerative medicine opportunity with few competitors that can match the quality, expertise and experience we bring along 
with our extensive offering of products and services.

Chairman’s statement
WE HAVE SET OURSELVES 
A GOAL TO ACCRETE VALUE 
BY CREATING A LEADING 
BIOMA TERIALS BUSINESS AND 
WE BELIEVE THE MOMENTUM FOR 
ACHIEVING THIS IS INCREASING.”
I am pleased to present Collagen Solutions’ annual report and 
accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
Strategy
Earlier in the year we committed to a strategic plan to accelerate 
our business growth and enhance shareholder value by both 
developing our core business and commercialising the investment 
in our proprietary device programmes. In March, we secured up 
to £10.8 million in funding by way of a placing and open offer of 
£6.8 million and a venture debt facility of up to £4.0 million, which 
will provide the resources to deliver a targeted increase in revenue 
of five times in the five years to 2021. Our commercial and R&D 
teams have been strengthened in the past year to execute on 
these plans over the coming years.
Innovation and IP
We have continued to invest in the proprietary product 
pipeline, in particular in ChondroMimetic
®
, an exciting cartilage 
repair technology based around a bilayered collagen sponge. 
Manufacturing validations have commenced in Glasgow, and 
significant work has been undertaken in preparation for the 
CE mark submission, which will be delayed slightly as a result of 
a Board decision to secure as many patients as possible from the 
original clinical trial conducted in Budapest in 2009. To that end 
we have secured patient consent from 15 out of the original 17 
with the other two having moved out of Hungary making it 
logistically difficult for them to participate. This new trial, which is 
technically known as an open-label extension trial, will provide 
us with seven to eight years of longitudinal data which, if positive, 
will help enormously with our partnering activities. 
Our other key projects are in wound healing and in bone graft 
substitutes, where we have filed for a provisional patent. We remain 
confident about our ability to partner these products, although the 
increasing burden of regulation has resulted in extended timelines.
Our collaborations with various academic and industry partners 
include our participation in two prestigious European Horizon 
2020 consortiums to develop: (i) a disease-modifying therapy for 
Parkinson’s which could slow down the progression of the disease 
rather than offering symptomatic benefits; and (ii) cell-based 
tissue regeneration techniques.
Board and management
During the year we have made a number of key appointments 
to strengthen the executive team. Kevin Darling joined us in 
October as General Manager, New Zealand, taking over the reins 
from Geoff Bennett, who, in January, moved from his previous 
executive director position to become a non-executive director. 
In February, we appointed Brad Selman to the role of VP Global 
Sales and Marketing to lead our commercial team and in March, 
Chris Wattengel joined the team as VP Global R&D to lead our 
product development programmes. 
Co-founder Dr Stewart White stepped down from the Board on 
30 June 2017, but will remain in a consultancy role and continue 
to participate as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board.

8 hard work and what we have achieved together in the growth of 
the business to date, and I look forward to continued interaction 
via his continued membership of the Scientific Advisory Board.
The Board is confident that we now have a team in place to 
deliver the short to medium-term strategic goals and have also 
strengthened our functional teams to drive product innovation 
and take the business to the next level of growth.
Our people
As part of our vital initiatives for the coming year we are committed to 
providing development opportunities for our employees and have 
been working with them on individual employee development plans 
to deliver the required targeted training to allow them to deliver 
enhanced performance to the business in its growth phase. We value 
feedback from our employees and carry out an annual survey to 
measure our performance in this area.
Overview
Our Board and management team have continued to make positive 
progress, delivering nine new commercial agreements, with strong 
sales growth in Asia, where we established a regional sales office 
in Seoul, and in Europe. We have also seen an increase in demand 
for tissue biomaterials from our Australian and New Zealand 
sources. The investment in the multi-purpose processing facility 
in New Zealand last year has allowed product development and 
prototyping to be carried out, which will generate further revenues 
in the coming year. The quality of the customer pipeline is building 
up with some interesting projects to be executed.
We continue to put in place the clear organisation and detailed 
initiatives to drive our focused strategy in the current financial year 
and beyond, which is to build a leading global regenerative biomaterials 
business based upon a core supply, development and manufacturing 
platform, enhanced by developing our own novel products, such as 
ChondroMimetic
®
, across a range of clinical indications. The funding 
secured in March allows us to implement these initiatives and we 
will continue to strengthen our core business through operational 
improvements and investing in innovation to create significant value. 
Our activities in entering the Chinese market continue with Cre8ive, 
where we have been successful in achieving initial shipments 
of product via our import agents and are in discussion with 
potential customers.
We have set ourselves a goal to accrete value by creating a leading 
biomaterials business through a combination of organic growth 
and exploitation of our own and licensed IP, as well as through 
appropriate acquisitions, and we believe the momentum for 
achieving this is increasing.
Results
The Group’s results for the year ended 31 March 2017 are set out in 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and discussed 
further in the Financial Review.
Outlook
The past year has seen significant change in the business 
and we expect the current year will be no different in terms of the 
speed and magnitude of progress. We are an ambitious company with 
ambitious targets and the agenda for the coming year reflects both the 
opportunities that we have identified and the associated challenges.
Our key targets for the current year are as follows:
• 
We have a multitude of development milestones amongst the high 
value product portfolio and we will seek to progress further projects 
into development. ChondroMimetic
®
 is the most advanced such 
project and we expect to complete the open-label extension study 
in Hungary for the 15 identified patients. We expect an ever-greater 
contribution to the value of the business from these projects as 
they approach commercialisation.
• 
Based on a successful outcome to the aforementioned 
ChondroMimetic
®
 study we aim to secure the most appropriate 
partner who, in an ideal world, would give us global commercial 
access for the ChondroMimetic
®
 product. More likely is a partnering 
arrangement that will be for Europe and the rest of the world, 
excluding the US, but with an option to commercialise the 
product in the US where the regulatory authorities will demand 
that the product goes down the pre-market approval route. 
Given the significant cost of this regulatory pathway, we would 
expect these costs to be met by the partner.
• 
Achieving continued revenue growth across all our key territories 
and to seek to address a specific risk with a Korean customer 
on potential reduced quantities at contract renewal, which could 
possibly impact 18/19 revenues if not addressed this year. As 
you would expect and hope for, we are at an advanced stage 
of mitigating this risk by discussing new product categories 
and services with the customer as well as leveraging our 
market reach to help accelerate their sales.
• 
Forging the most mutually beneficial arrangement with Cre8ive, 
our partner in China. We continue to examine a number of potential 
options for a route forward and hopefully we will be able to arrive 
at the best option soon. The work we have done in the past year 
has underlined the potential for our medical-grade collagen sourced 
from Australia and New Zealand. This differentiator gives us a clear 
advantage over local Chinese producers where environmental 
factors such as heavy metal contamination alone can impact 
the quality of the product.
• 
To successfully execute the relocation of our San Jose R&D 
facility and ensure the transfer to a new facility in Minneapolis.
• 
The Company is keen to reflect its ambition by contemplating 
potential transactions which could help deliver critical mass in its 
core business and access additional products and technology which 
will be accretive to future commercial plans for high-value products. 
We will continue to review such opportunities as they arise.
I continue to be very committed to ensuring Collagen Solutions 
is a success and continue to be assured by:
• 
the quality of the people we have at Collagen Solutions and the 
fact that we have been able to attract into the Company people 
of a very high calibre;
• 
the quality of our current product offering and our development;
• 
the continued support of the Board to our strategic plan; and
• 
the continued support of yourselves as shareholders.
Finally, last year I referred to us being on a journey. In the past year, 
I feel that we have travelled a long way and I believe that in the next 
year we will travel even further. Hopefully as a shareholder you 
will see this better reflected in our share price.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Chief Executive’s statement
I am pleased to report the results for the year ended 31 March 
2017 for Collagen Solutions and the considerable progress we 
have made towards realising value from multiple growth initiatives.
Building on momentum and strengthened financials
Firstly, and perhaps most significantly, we strengthened our 
financial position substantially at the end of the financial year by 
securing £10.8 million financing inclusive of £6.8 million in equity 
and a venture debt facility of up to £4.0 million via Norgine 
Ventures. This positions us to continue to grow our core business, 
invest in our proprietary devices, and satisfy our contingent 
payment obligations related to the successful acquisition of 
Southern Lights Biomaterials.
Investments in our commercial organisation last year have begun 
to deliver results. While the sales cycles in our core business can 
be from 12–18 months, we have seen the early benefits with nine 
new agreements during the year under review, mostly towards the 
end of the period. Critically, we hired our new VP Global Sales and 
Marketing, Brad Selman, to continue this momentum and develop 
and lead the commercial team to deliver accelerated growth over 
the next few years.
Another key executive team position filled was the new General 
Manager of Collagen Solutions New Zealand (formerly Southern 
Lights Biomaterials), Kevin Darling. Kevin’s strong commercial and 
operational background has been key to continuing the momentum 
of the New Zealand business, especially as we see greater growth 
opportunities in our tissue business.
Finally, we prioritised and initiated three projects related to our 
proprietary products platform, as well as strengthening our R&D 
leadership by appointing Chris Wattengel, VP Global Research and 
Development. Chris’ experience in medical device development, 
regulatory approvals, intellectual property and biomaterials will 
be vital to ensuring the success of these programmes. 
Revenue growth
Revenue and other income during the year ended 31 March 2017 
was £4.09 million, including £3.95 million in sales and £0.14 million 
in other income, and represented 26% growth on the prior year. 
This growth was organic and driven largely by gains in Europe and 
Asia, where the first investments in commercial activities were made.
Revenue from North America grew by £0.12 million to £1.92 million, 
an increase of 6%. This region was the last to benefit from new 
sales team hires and new business was offset partially by some 
sales volume reductions amongst a few customers. Revenue from 
Asia grew by £0.42 million to £1.60 million, an increase of 36%, our 
fastest-growing region, driven by new business wins and a 
dedicated commercial manager in place in Seoul. Revenue from 
EMEA grew by £0.28 million to £0.42 million, an increase of 190%, 
driven by new customers and as a result of commercial activities 
by the team in the UK. 
OUR COMMERCIAL INVESTMENTS 
OF LAST YEAR DELIVERED NINE 
NEW AGREEMENTS AND POSITIVE 
MOMENTUM, AND OUR RECENT 
FUNDRAISING STRENGTHENED 
OUR BALANCE SHEET TO FUEL 
OUR GROWTH INITIATIVES.”

Funding
+£10.8m During the year the team delivered nine new supply, development 
and distribution agreements, including distribution partnerships 
in Korea and Japan. Most of these agreements closed in the 
second half of the year. In addition, the Company has seen its 
pericardium tissue business grow by 30% resulting in a specific 
initiative to diversify and increase its tissue supply base in 
Australia and New Zealand to meet the additional demand. 
Innovation and product development
The Company has historically been committed to extensive 
research and development investments and has made continued 
progress in biomaterials innovation, both for our core supply, 
development, and manufacturing business and also our 
proprietary products programmes. 
With Australia-New Zealand tissue sourcing becoming a more 
significant part of our core business, we were pleased to have 
been granted a patent from the Australian Patent Office for the 
use of our novel ultra-thin processed pericardium material, which 
can be used for heart valve replacement medical devices and 
other applications. Patent coverage has already been established 
in New Zealand and the US. 
Related to our bone graft substitute programme, we have added 
substantial expertise in this field with our new Scientific Advisory 
Board as well as Chris Wattengel’s background. With this group’s 
guidance, we’ve completed surgeon and industry voice of 
customer feedback, identified the regulatory and pre-clinical 
pathways and established a revised plan to meet these needs, 
resulting in a mid-2019 estimate for regulatory clearance. We also 
filed a provisional US patent application covering novel properties 
of a bone graft substitute formulation. The provisional patent 
covers several novel, proprietary characteristics related to the 
product’s superior handling properties and inorganic particle 
retention, which will enhance ease of use for the surgeon 
and ensure that the substitute remains at the operative site. 
Our wound healing project is based upon core technology we 
developed over several years, with promising results presented at 
multiple conferences, including the recent Society for Biomaterials 
Annual Meeting in Minneapolis. The Company’s scientists presented 
new data related to the potential for a fibrillar collagen-based 
matrix that protects autologous cells during delivery and promotes 
cellular adhesion to a wound site. The potential of the research 
may address the limitations of current split or full-thickness 
autologous skin grafts, particularly in large wound sites. We have 
completed surgeon and industry voice of customer feedback, 
identified the regulatory and pre-clinical pathways and targeted 
our pre-clinical trials to begin in early 2018 with wound market 
clearance expected to follow in late 2018.
Additionally, the Company’s cartilage ChondroMimetic
®
 programme 
has advanced significantly since the acquisition of the assets of 
Orthomimetics at the end of 2015. With first human use in 2009 and 
original launch in 2010, ChondroMimetic
®
 offers a rare opportunity to 
come to market with over seven years of in-patient results. We recently 
initiated the extension of the original clinical study to review the results 
of the first patients from a safety study conducted in 2009, and have 
begun manufacturing validations of the product at our Glasgow UK 
facility. The long-term extension study will collect seven to eight years 
of data from up to 15 of the original 17 patients. Our CE mark submission 
is pending this study conclusion and completing internal validations, 
with a target commercialisation outside the US in mid-2018.
Finally, we recognise the need for close co-ordination between 
our global commercial and R&D teams as well as the expertise 
needed for successful development and regulatory approvals of 
our proprietary medical devices. We recently announced our plans 
to relocate our US R&D from San Jose to Minneapolis, where we 
will realise some operational cost savings by merging the two sites, 
and also enhance our global R&D and commercial co-ordination 
with leadership and both teams at the same Minneapolis site.
Strategic initiatives
Last year was the first implementation of our global strategic 
planning process resulting in several initiatives we felt critical 
to our future growth. I am pleased with the results the team 
delivered on these initiatives and look forward to accomplishing 
similar success on our initiatives for FY 2018.
Our 2017 initiatives generally focused on three areas: sales 
channel development, marketing brand launch and operational 
excellence. Our sales channel development initiative resulted in 
the recruitment, hiring and training of a full specialised direct sales 
team and support including our new VP of Global Sales and 
Marketing as well as sales process improvements that led to nine 
new customer agreements in the fiscal year. 
Our marketing brand launch initiative resulted in the execution 
of a full integrated marketing communications programme leading 
to an increase in several customer touch-point metrics in terms 
of commercial leads, web traffic and social media engagement. 
Finally, we successfully completed several initiatives to improve 
operational excellence including a new OEM programme that 
improved time-to-close deal flow and throughput, contributing 
to nine new agreements during the year.
Looking forward to FY 2018 we are continuing our strategic initiative 
programme and selected four ‘Vital Few’ initiatives aligned with our 
strategic pillars of Customers, Our People, Products and Capabilities, 
and Growth which are summarised as follows:
• 
Customers: identify and attain more high-value customers.
• 
Our People: implement an employee-driven individual 
development plan programme.
• 
Products and Capabilities: secure and create a stronger 
pericardium business.
• 
Growth: successfully develop and partner our three key 
proprietary products.
Conclusion
The critically important financing of the Company that closed at 
the end of the last financial year has put us in a strong position to 
execute on our growth initiatives, including fueling our proprietary 
products development, and was a significant focus of the Company. 
We delivered growth based on commercial investments made 
in the prior year and also recruited necessary talent in R&D, 
commercial and general management to execute on these growth 
initiatives, and continue towards our shared vision to be the 
industry’s first choice for regenerative biomaterials.

STRATEGIC REPORT

Chief Executive’s statement continued
What are the top achievements from last year?
While the team was very busy and accomplished several important 
goals last year, two stand out as critical achievements. First, our 
successful fundraising at the very end of the fiscal years was necessary 
in order to meet our operating and other obligations, as well as 
to ensure the multiple growth initiatives we’re excited about can 
come to fruition. Second, we are pleased to see the commercial 
investments made last year beginning to demonstrate results 
including delivering nine new agreements mostly in the back half 
of the year.
How is your strategy developing?
We remain enthusiastic about the strategy we set forth last year, 
strengthening our supply, development and manufacturing ‘core’ 
business with commercial investments and leveraging that platform 
to create a portfolio of proprietary products. As we continue to 
receive feedback from the marketplace we believe this strategy 
is sound and our focus on orthopaedics and wounds in particular 
for our proprietary products is the right direction.
How are you strengthening your team?
I am pleased with the talent we’ve added to the executive team this 
year. First, Kevin Darling became our General Manager of New Zealand 
in October, succeeding Geoff Bennett who remains on our Board and 
continues to actively support our business as a Board member and 
leader of our China initiative. Kevin’s combination of commercial 
and operational experience has made a tremendous contribution 
to ensure the continued momentum of the New Zealand business. 
Brad Selman joined us as VP Global Sales and Marketing in 
February and has already worked to enhance our sales team and 
processes substantially. Finally, Chris Wattengel brings a critical 
skill set in finished devices with his 16+ years of directly relevant 
biomaterials and OEM experience. 
These new members are great additions to the executive team, which 
also includes our COO, Tom Hyland, with over 30 years of collagen and 
medical technologies experience and our CFO, Gill Black, who has 
been instrumental in strengthening our financial position as well as 
deeply involved in operationally supporting the growth of our business. 
In addition, each of these leaders has also enhanced their own teams 
with new talent. So, overall, I can say we’ve substantially strengthened 
the team over the past several months. 
We have assembled a highly experienced and dynamic Scientific 
Advisory Board (SAB) with a combination of significant industry 
backgrounds and complementary technical and scientific 
knowledge within the field of regenerative medicine. In addition 
to providing advice on and direction to our current development 
projects and core business, the SAB will help us to assess future 
market directions and to guide our activities towards the 
development of both commercially and clinically relevant next 
generation products. The SAB consists of Andrew Lynn, PhD, who 
is a successful entrepreneur and founder of Orthomimetics Ltd., 
which developed ChondroMimetic
®
; Professor William (Bill) Walsh, 
PhD, who has over 27 years of academic and industry-related 
research experience in orthopaedics and other surgical fields; 
Tom Buckland, PhD, who was a co-founder of ApaTech Ltd., research 
and development director with Baxter Inc., and managing director 
of NuVasive (UK) Ltd; and Stewart White, PhD, the founding CEO 
of Collagen Solutions and Collbio with international operations, 
business and product development experience.
What does the R&D pipeline look like?
The R&D side of our strategy has evolved the most in selecting our 
key three projects (cartilage, wound healing and bone grafts) and 
doing the in-depth work to refine the customer requirements and 
novel product attributes. While we have several new product concepts 
that were taken to various stages of development in multiple areas of 
tissue engineering, we are going to focus on these three projects to 
ensure they are developed to deliver a compelling value proposition 
to our customers supported by the appropriate data.
What is critical for the Company this year?
We have multiple growth initiatives, each with significant upside 
potential, so it’s critical we focus on realising value from these. Our 
‘Vital Few’ initiatives are so-named because we think these are the 
critical initiatives for the Company for success and this is where we will 
focus. On the commercial side, it’s about continuous improvement 
of our sales pipeline and processes to identify and attain more 
high-value customers. Our people development is critical to 
everything we do, and we believe the employee development plans 
will improve our employee engagement and effectiveness. We see 
upside potential in our tissue business, which led to our initiative 
with respect to tissue supply and growth. Finally, we are focused 
on advancing our proprietary products and securing 
partners for successful commercialisation.
 Q A
with the CEO
12 Collagen Solutions plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Strategic report
Collagen Solutions strives to be the industry’s first choice for 
regenerative biomaterials and will advance and enhance customers’ 
collagen-based products for the timely benefit of patients.
Our strategy
Our mission is to increase the profitability of our business by growing 
revenue through continual improvement and development of our 
product offering, innovation and harnessing IP, and by superior 
engagement and understanding of our customers and their market 
segments. Our aim is to develop sales channels around the world, 
while investing in our manufacturing facilities to enable the Group 
to meet that sales growth. Our progress to date is noted in both 
the Chairman’s and the Chief Executive’s Statements.
Our markets
Our extensive technical expertise in the area of collagen formulations 
and our GMP capacity and capabilities make us very well placed to 
meet the needs of customers in the research and diagnostics, medical 
device and regenerative medicine markets in all geographical areas. 
We offer foundational products in the large regenerative biomaterials 
sector which can be used in the repair, replacement or regeneration 
of damaged organs or tissue in tissue engineering and are used in 
many major markets including cardiovascular, orthopaedics, dental 
and wound care. We will continue to invest in our sales and marketing 
operations and channel development, including penetration of the 
Chinese market through our 60% holding in Cre8ive Collagen Limited.
Our products
Our standard product range includes raw tissue supply, including 
pericardium which is used in heart valves and dural patches, various 
strengths of soluble and acid soluble collagen, acid swollen gels, 
freeze-dried powders, collagen sheets and fibrous collagen. The Group 
manufactures a fibrillar collagen gel which can be used in wound care 
and cell therapy fields, in addition to other collagen components for 
approved medical devices for use in bone void fillers and in sponges 
for cell therapy skin substitute applications. Future plans include 
commercialising additional products by harnessing licensed IP for 
wider patient benefits and development of formulations from novel 
sources of raw materials. In addition to developing market access 
products we also will develop the platform technology within the 
ChondroMimetic
®
 portfolio to address unmet need in segments 
of the regenerative medicine market.
Competitive advantage
The Group’s competitive advantages are based on both the ability to 
source quality raw materials from accredited sources and to develop 
novel and relevant formulations from different types of materials to 
meet customer needs. We can also assist customers through the 
regulatory approval process for their medical devices, and then offer 
the GMP facilities for large scale production, thereby taking their 
products to market. We are uniquely placed to add value throughout 
the entire supply chain, having surety of supply through high grade 
collagen sourcing from negligible BSE-risk sources.
Review of the business
The Group’s results are set out in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income on page 29 and are explained within 
the Financial Review on pages 18 and 19. In March 2017, the Group 
raised funding of up to £10.8 million through a placing and open 
offer together with a venture debt facility from Norgine Ventures. 
A full review of the Group’s activities and future developments is 
incorporated into the Chairman’s and the Chief Executive’s Statements.
Corporate social responsibility
The Group embraces working in a way that delivers financial, 
socially responsible and environmentally sustainable business 
performance and ensures adherence to the law and conducts its 
affairs to the highest ethical standards. We expect our customers 
and suppliers to embrace these same principles. The Group values 
teamwork, taking personal responsibility, positive attitudes and 
working hard to deliver positive outcomes for all our stakeholders, 
customers, staff and shareholders alike. We encourage the 
personal learning, growth and development of our team and 
voluntarily try to eliminate practices that harm the environment. 
We are particularly proud of our team in New Zealand, which 
is positively impacting the communities where we work and live. 
Over the last year we sponsored the NZ National Art Exhibition, 
which directs all proceeds to charitable endeavours in Napier. 
In Glasgow our employees have raised money for charitable 
causes and organised donations to the local food banks.
Employee involvement
Collagen Solutions fosters a culture of responsiveness and 
customer engagement, reflecting our global team’s talents in 
biomaterials science and production, and market knowledge.
The Group recognises and seeks to encourage the involvement 
of its employees, with the aim being the recruitment, motivation and 
retention of quality employees throughout the Group. An option 
scheme is operated within the Enterprise Management Incentive 
Scheme. We have recently conducted an Employee Satisfaction 
Survey and will monitor the improvements in the scores arising 
from increased employee engagement. One of the key strategic 
initiatives for 2018 is to implement individual development 
plans for employees.
The Group’s employment policies, including the commitment to 
equal opportunity, are designed to attract, retain and motivate 
employees regardless of sex, race, religion or disability. Equality 
of treatment includes full and fair assessment of applications and 
extends to training and continuing career development.
The Group is committed to ensuring and communicating the 
requirements for a safe and healthy working environment for 
all employees, consistent with health and safety legislation and, 
wherever practicable, gives full consideration to applications 
for employment from disabled persons.
STRATEGIC REPORT

Principal risks and uncertainties
The long-term success of the Group depends on the continual review, assessment and control of the key business risks it faces.
The principal risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse impact on the performance of the Group are detailed below:
Risk and impact Mitigating controls Change
Sales and R&D pipeline
The impact of our customers’ stage of regulatory approval of 
their medical device or product is critical to Collagen Solutions’ 
revenue streams. Our collagen component or formulation 
may have been developed, embedded and listed as part of a 
customer’s regulatory admission, but contract manufacturing 
revenues may be delayed until such approval is obtained in 
the relevant geographical market from the relevant agencies.
Customers in early stage development may be required 
to secure external funding before committing to volume 
manufacturing and this can delay revenues for the Group.
Timing of launch of own proprietary products presents risks.
The Group continues to focus on building and diversifying  
the customer pipeline and has strategies in place to:
• 
increase production scheduling flexibility;
• 
accelerate revenues by use of minimum order quantities 
and non-refundable fees for engineering and set-up 
costs for a specific GMP process;
• 
invest in sales and marketing to increase sales 
pipeline funnel; 
• 
develop long-term collaborative and development 
partnerships with our customers, resulting in our 
products becoming embedded in their end devices 
and therapies; and
• 
closely monitor resources and project management.
Growth
The ability of the Group to manage growth effectively, 
and implement its strategy, requires careful planning and 
management control systems. The pace of change required 
could place a significant strain on the Group’s management, 
operational, financial and personnel resources and could have 
a detrimental impact on the trading performance of the Group.
The Group has an experienced management team and a 
clear strategy for any required integration and management 
of business growth.

Competition
Many of the Group’s competitors have access to greater 
funds; however, the directors believe that the Group can 
compete strongly and that there are sufficient barriers to 
entry to other competitors entering the same markets.
The Group’s investment in marketing and business 
development will support sales in territories across 
the world.
–
Technology
Technologies in the medical device market continue to 
evolve and there is a risk that the Group’s offering may 
become outdated as improvements in technology are made.
The Board has confidence in the Group’s research and 
development capabilities to respond to such eventualities.  
The Group relies on information technology systems to run 
the business, and its continued commitment to investment 
in this area will ensure robust effective management 
information systems allow management to make key 
financial decisions affecting the business.
–
Suppliers
The Group has a limited number of suppliers for some of our 
raw materials which we may not be able to find replacements 
for or immediately transition to alternative suppliers. These 
materials are used in validated processes, and substitution 
of replacement raw materials may have a revenue impact 
as a result of potential delays in validation and approval.
The Group’s materials are sourced from BSE-free territories, 
with suppliers who have the necessary quality systems, 
certifications and export health attestations in place to 
ensure reduced risk. Any change to the BSE-free status 
of our suppliers could impact our supply chain and 
ultimately revenues.
Treasury policy and financial risk
The Group maintains a centralised treasury function, which 
operates under policies and guidelines approved by the Board. 
These cover funding, management of foreign exchange 
exposure and interest rate risk. The purpose is to manage 
the financial risks of the business and to secure the most 
cost-effective funding.
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and bank 
balances, which are exposed to varying degrees to the 
following risks: liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency 
risk. The policy for managing these risks is outlined below:
• 
Liquidity risk – the Group maintains proactive 
relationships with its banks and investors and its working 
capital requirements are anticipated via the forecasting 
and budgetary process.
• 
Credit risk – the Group is mainly exposed to credit risk 
from its trade and other receivables, short-term deposits 
and bank balances. An allowance for impairment is made 
when there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the 
recoverability of the cash flows. Cash is held on deposit 
with a highly reputable financial institution. Management 
considers the above measures to control the credit 
risk exposure.
• 
Foreign currency risk – in addition to GBP revenues the 
Group has overseas revenue in US dollars, with minimal 
income in NZ dollars and euros, and is exposed to trading 
foreign currency risk. The functional currency of the Company 
is sterling. Revenues in US dollars are utilised in funding US 
operations and forward exchange rate contracts may be used 
to hedge exposure. The Group seeks to negotiate contracts 
in the functional currency where possible.

DURING THE YEAR TURNOVER 
CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN 
ALL GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORIES, 
WITH PARTICULARLY STRONG 
GROWTH IN ASIA.”
Group results
Group revenue and other income increased to £4,090,549 
(2016: £3,244,257) for the year ended 31 March 2017. During the 
year turnover continued to increase in all geographic territories, 
with particularly strong growth in Asia. We were pleased to report 
an increase in gross margin to 75.1% (2016: 74.1%).
LBITDA before credit for separately identifiable items of £227,155 
(2016: £152,365) for the year was £1,259,361 (2016: £410,016) 
and the loss before tax (before separately identifiable items) 
was £1,840,905 (2016: £1,018,655). Separately identifiable items 
comprise a release, net of foreign exchange translation loss, of 
contingent consideration provision, and legal costs in relation to 
the Norgine Bond facility (2016: release of contingent consideration 
provision in relation to the Collagen Solutions LLC asset acquisition). 
The loss per share, as calculated per note 7, increased to (0.95)p 
(2016: (0.57)p).
Cash and borrowings
As at 31 March 2017, the Group had cash balances of £8.98 million 
(2016: £2.49 million) and financial liabilities in relation to the 
contingent consideration and other borrowings of £4.26 million 
(2016: £2.55 million). The Statement of Cash Flows shows the 
movements in funds during the year.
Overheads
The Group has continued to invest in both its sales and marketing 
and R&D resources during the year in order to support the growth 
in global demand for its products and services. R&D expenditure 
increased to £593,986 (2016: £367,496) and selling and marketing 
costs increased to £718,986 (2016: £333,426). 
Fundraising
In March 2017, the Group was successful in raising funds by way of 
a placing and open offer resulting in net proceeds of £6.46 million 
and, in addition, received net proceeds of £1.94 million from the 
first tranche of a Bond issue to Norgine Ventures, a strategic debt 
provider. A further £2 million of Bond facility is available for draw 
down during the coming financial year providing certain revenue 
targets are met. The funding allows acceleration of core business 
growth and further investment in key R&D programmes, as well 
as providing additional working capital.
Capital expenditure
During the year the Group invested in capital expenditure 
additions of £137,324 (2016: £565,740) to its manufacturing and 
research facilities in both New Zealand and the UK to increase 
capabilities for expected future demand.
Business risks
Risk management is an important element of the management 
process throughout the Group, and internal controls have been 
developed to address the main business risks, which are 
considered to be:
Growth of pericardium tissue business
+30%
EMEA revenue
+190%
Asia revenue
+36%
18 Strategic
The Group operates in a global market and is dependent on 
enhancing revenues by leveraging existing customers, products 
and facilities in order to provide a broad range of collagen 
biomaterials, development services, contract manufacturing for 
collagen-based medical devices and commercialisation of our 
own proprietary medical devices. One of the risks to the business 
is that of timing of customer projects, where, as a component 
supplier, we rely on customer demand, which is not within our 
control. So, in order to mitigate this risk we constantly strive 
to have a diversified customer base and pipeline with multiple 
products. The timelines for launching proprietary products also 
present risks which are addressed through close monitoring and 
project management. 
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
The Group monitors the following KPIs to ensure the business 
performs in line with expectations and that issues are identified 
promptly and efficiency measures can be quantified:
• 
revenue and revenue growth;
• 
gross profit;
• 
gross profit margin %;
• 
operating costs;
• 
LBITDA;
• 
EPS; and
• 
cash and cash equivalents.
Operational
The Group’s most important assets are its employees, its 
customers and the development of know-how and intellectual 
property rights (IPR):
• 
Employees are recruited carefully to address the needs of 
the business. 
• 
Appropriate training is provided to support the development 
of employees. 
• 
The needs of the Group’s customers are addressed to ensure 
that they are appropriately met.
• 
The Group has controls in place to safeguard the IPR that 
it develops.

The Group also has established procedures to maintain its 
appropriate accreditations.
• 
The Group recognises the importance of its IT infrastructure 
and back office systems to deliver its services. 
• 
The Group has the appropriate controls in place to secure its 
data and maximise the operational efficiency of its systems. 
Controls exist to ensure information is made available to 
enable management to monitor the performance of the Group. 
The controls address the performance of the Group based on 
monthly management accounts, which include details of sales, 
gross margin and costs. 
Treasury policies and financial risk
The Group maintains a treasury function, which operates under 
policies and guidelines approved by the Board. These cover 
funding, management of foreign exchange exposure and interest 
rate risk. The purpose is to manage the financial risks of the 
business effectively and to secure the most cost-effective funding. 
Contingent consideration
The Group made a provision of £1.7 million in December 2014 
for the contingent consideration payable resulting from the 
acquisition of Southern Lights Biomaterials. This provision was 
made from an estimate of the maximum to be paid under the 
‘earn-out conditions’. The directors believed that the provision 
represented the best estimate of the eventual outcome of the 
‘earn-out’. Any future revision to the consideration will be charged/
credited to the income statement in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised) 
in future periods. This is in addition to the provision made in the 
year ended 31 March 2014 of £2.4 million in relation to the 
contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of the Collbio 
Group. During the year there was a revision to the estimate of the 
cash earn-out payable under the Collbio Group provisions resulting 
in a release in the provision of £0.291 million (2016: £0.152 million). 
There was also a revision to the cash earn-out payable under the 
Southern Lights Biomaterials agreement resulting in a release 
of £0.262 million (2016: £nil) both of which are shown in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as separately 
identifiable items. The amount of the contingent consideration due 
to be settled by issue of shares in relation to the Collbio Group 
as at 31 March 2016 has now been satisfied by issuing shares 
of £2 million during the year pursuant to our obligations under 
the sale and purchase agreement dated January 2014. The total 
contingent consideration now provided in the accounts at 
31 March 2017 is £2.32 million (2016: £2.41 million) with the 
unwinding of discount being charged within finance costs and 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance
Principles of corporate governance
The Board appreciates the value of good corporate governance 
not only in the areas of accountability and risk management but 
also as a positive contribution to business prosperity. It believes 
that corporate governance involves more than a simple ‘box ticking’ 
approach to establish whether a company has met the requirements 
of a number of specific rules and regulations. Rather, the issue is one 
of applying corporate governance principles (including those set out 
in the Corporate Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted 
Companies published by the Quoted Companies Alliance) in a sensible 
and pragmatic fashion having regard to the individual circumstances 
of a particular company’s business. The key objective is to enhance 
and protect shareholder value.
Board structure
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management 
of the Group. A Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect 
of the financial statements is set out on page 26. 
The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to 
ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are 
fully considered. All non-executive directors receive a fixed fee for 
their services.
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all directors have full 
and timely access to all relevant information and there is a procedure 
for all directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the expense of the Group. The 
Board is responsible for overall Group strategy, approval of major 
capital expenditure projects and consideration of significant 
financing matters.
The following Committees, which have written terms of reference, 
deal with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board on the Group and the Company’s 
framework of executive remuneration and its cost. The Committee 
determines the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits 
for each of the executive directors, including performance-related 
bonus schemes, pension rights and compensation payments. The 
Board itself determines the remuneration of the non-executive 
directors. The Committee comprises three non-executive directors 
(David Evans, Malcolm Gillies and Geoff Bennett). It is chaired by 
Malcolm Gillies.
Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee comprises three non-executive 
directors (David Evans, Geoff Bennett and Malcolm Gillies) and 
is chaired by David Evans. In light of the passing of non-executive 
director Kevin Wilson, who previously held the Chair of the Audit 
and Risk Committee, it was considered an appropriate interim measure 
by the Board to appoint David Evans (non-executive Chairman) 
as the Chair of this Committee. Geoff Bennett has taken over from 
David Evans as the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee since 
the year end.
Its prime tasks are to review the scope of the external audit, to 
receive regular reports from RSM UK Audit LLP, and to review the 
half yearly and annual accounts before they are presented to the 
Board, focusing in particular on accounting policies and areas of 
management judgement and estimation.
The Committee is responsible for monitoring the controls which 
are in force to ensure the integrity of the information reported 
to shareholders.
The Committee acts as a forum for discussion of internal control 
issues and contributes to the Board’s review of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems and 
processes. It advises the Board on the appointment of external 
auditors and on their remuneration for both audit and non-audit 
work, and discusses the nature and scope of the audit with the 
external auditors. It reviews and monitors the independence 
of the auditors, especially with regard to non-audit work. 
The Audit and Risk Committee met to consider the reports of the 
auditors prior to the submission of the annual financial statements 
to the Board.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises three non-executive 
directors (David Evans, Malcolm Gillies and Geoff Bennett) 
and is chaired by Malcolm Gillies. 
Its duties include the review of the structure, size and composition 
of the Board, including skills, knowledge, experience and diversity, 
succession planning, review of leadership needs and identification, 
evaluation and nomination of candidates to fill Board vacancies, 
as necessary.
Internal control
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and reviewing its effectiveness. The Board has designed 
the Group’s system of internal control in order to provide the 
directors with reasonable assurance that its assets are safeguarded, 
that transactions are authorised and properly recorded and that 
material errors and irregularities are either prevented or would 
be detected within a timely period.
However, no system of internal control can eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives or provide absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the control system in operation are:
• 
the Board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters 
for decision and has put in place an organisational structure 
with clear lines of responsibility defined and with appropriate 
delegation of authority; 
• 
the subsidiaries’ boards also meet regularly with a formal 
schedule of matters for decision; and
• 
there are procedures for the planning, approval and monitoring 
of capital expenditure and information systems for monitoring 
the Group’s financial performance against approved budgets 
and forecasts. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
23 Annual report and accounts 2017 Collagen Solutions plc
The Audit and Risk Committee receives reports from the external 
auditors on a regular basis and from executive directors of the Group. 
The Board receives periodic reports from all Committees.
There are no significant issues disclosed in the report and 
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 and up 
to the date of approval of the report and financial statements 
that have required the Board to deal with any related material 
internal control issues.
The Board has considered whether the Group’s internal control 
processes would be significantly enhanced by an internal audit 
function and has taken the view that, at the Group’s current stage 
of development, this is not a necessity. The Board will continue 
to review this matter.
The Group is compliant with industry standard quality assurance 
measures and undergoes regular external audits to ensure that 
accreditation is maintained.
Relations with shareholders
The Group values its dialogue with both institutional and private 
investors. Effective two-way communication with the investment 
community is actively pursued and this encompasses issues such as 
performance, policy and strategy. The directors have had meetings 
with actual and potential investors and they will continue to do so 
on a regular basis. The Group maintains an informative website 
containing information likely to be of interest to existing and new 
investors. In addition, the Group retains the services of financial 
PR consultants, providing an additional contact point for investors.
There is also an opportunity, at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting, for individual shareholders to raise general business matters 
with the full Board, and notice of the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting is circulated to all shareholders before such meeting.
Going concern
The directors believe that the use of the going concern basis 
of accounting is appropriate because they consider that the Group 
has considerable financial resources, together with a robust sales 
pipeline and commitments from a number of customers. As such the 
directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully. The directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Research and development
The Group invests in research and development in the UK, the US 
and New Zealand and collaborates with partners and academia. 
In the opinion of the directors, continuity of investment in this 
area is essential for the maintenance of the Group’s market 
position and for future growth.
Supplier payment policy
It is Group policy to agree and clearly communicate the terms 
of payment as part of the commercial arrangements negotiated with 
suppliers and then to pay according to those terms based upon the 
timely receipt of an accurate invoice. At 31 March 2017, average 
creditor days were 39 days (2016: 50 days).
Charitable and political contributions
£1,393 of charitable donations were made by the Group in the 
year ended 31 March 2017. No political donations were made 
during the period. 
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The directors who were in office on the date of approval of 
these financial statements have confirmed that, as far as they are 
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors 
are unaware. Each of the directors have confirmed that they have 
taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order 
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that it has been communicated to the auditors. Details 
of financial risk management objectives and policies, including 
exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow 
risk, are shown in the Strategic Report on page 17.
Directors’ responsibilities in the preparation of the 
financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, 
the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company 
financial statements for each financial year. The directors are required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare Group 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) 
and have elected under company law to prepare the Company 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements are required by law and IFRSs adopted 
by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the Group and 
the Company and the financial performance of the Group. The 
Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements 
that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements 
giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a 
fair presentation.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
• 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• 
state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs adopted by the EU; and
• 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
and the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Collagen Solutions plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.

Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Collagen Solutions plc
Opinion on financial statements
We have audited the group and parent company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”) on pages 29 to 60. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion:
• 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the group’s and the parent’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 
and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
• 
the group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• 
the parent financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements 
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
http://www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements 
and, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit, the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company 
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have 
not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report 
or the Directors’ Report. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• 
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As more fully explained in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
on page 26, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
General information
Collagen Solutions plc is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The locations and principal activities of the subsidiaries are 
set out in note 10. The registered office is c/o Shepherd and Wedderburn LLP, Condor House, 10 St. Paul’s Churchyard, London EC4M 8AL.
The financial statements of Collagen Solutions plc and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year ended 31 March 2017 were authorised 
for issue by the Board of directors on 10 July 2017.
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs), including IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRICs) interpretations as endorsed by the European Union (EU), 
and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial liabilities incorporated at fair value. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is also the functional currency of the Company. The principal 
accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. The results of 
subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income from 
the date of their acquisition until their date of disposal.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition 
of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration 
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs 
are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets acquired are recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary 
acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Intra-group balance transactions and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The Company Statement of Comprehensive Income has not been disclosed in accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The loss of the parent company for the year amounted to £712,203 (2016: £606,248).
Going concern
As part of its going concern review the Board has followed the guidelines published by the Financial Reporting Council entitled 
‘Guidance on the Going Concern Basis of Accounting and Reporting on Solvency and Liquidity Risks (2016)’. In determining the appropriate 
basis of preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to consider whether the Company can continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, being a period of not less than 12 months from the date of the approval of the financial statements. 
As at 31 March 2017 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £8.98 million and net current assets of £7.95 million.
Management prepares detailed working capital forecasts which are reviewed by the Board on a regular basis. Cash flow forecasts and 
projections have been prepared through to 30 September 2018 and take into account sensitivities on revenues and costs. Having made 
relevant and appropriate enquiries, including consideration of the Company’s and the Group’s current cash resources and the working 
capital forecasts, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will have adequate cash resources to 
continue to meet the requirements of the business for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and other sales-related taxes. Depending on the contractual terms, 
revenue is recognised based on the level of work completed to date in respect of each individual element of the contract. Laboratory 
services are recognised on a fee-for-service basis. The difference between the amount of revenue recognised and the amount invoiced 
on a particular contract is included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as deferred income.
Normally amounts become billable in advance on the achievement of certain milestones, in accordance with agreed payment schedules 
included in the contract or on submission of appropriate detail. Any cash payments received as a result of this advance billing are not 
representative of revenue earned on the contract, as revenues are recognised over the period in which the specified contractual obligations 
are fulfilled. Amounts included in deferred income are expected to be recognised within one year and are included within current liabilities.
In the event of contract termination, if the value of the work performed and recognised as revenue is greater than aggregate milestone 
billings at the date of termination, cancellation clauses provide that the Group will be paid for all work performed to the termination date.

Accounting policies continued
Government grants
The Group receives government grants in relation to research and development, business development and employment costs. 
Government grants receivable for the reimbursement of costs charged to the income statement are credited to the income statement 
within other income in the year in which the costs are incurred.
Segmental reporting
The Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for resource allocation and the assessment 
of performance. In the performance of this role, the Chief Executive Officer reviews the Group’s activities, in aggregate. The Group 
has therefore determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8 Operating Segments, which is biomaterials.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities of the acquiree at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in ‘intangible assets’. Goodwill 
is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. See note 8 for detailed 
assumptions and methodology. Impairment losses are not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating 
units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, identified 
according to operating segment, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit 
or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for 
internal management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment.
Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and is included as part of the consideration transferred. Changes 
in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding 
adjustments against goodwill. The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify 
as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified 
as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or 
loss for the relevant financial period.
Purchased goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business and its net assets represents the excess of the consideration and the fair 
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of that business at the date of acquisition. It is included within intangible assets and subject 
to annual impairment reviews noted above.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from 
contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are stated at cost, net of any amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is calculated so as to write 
off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Customer contracts and relationships – over two to ten years, depending on terms of contract, on a straight-line basis
Licensed IP and patents – over estimated useful lives of ten to 25 years
Expenditure on research (or on the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. Expenditure 
arising from the Group’s development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
• 
an asset is created that can be identified (such as new processes or products);
• 
it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;
• 
 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably;
• 
 the Group has the intention to complete the asset and the ability and intention to use or sell it;
• 
 the product or process is technically and commercially feasible; and 
• 
sufficient resources are available to complete the development and to either sell or use the asset.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred. 38 Collagen Solutions plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Cost comprises 
purchase price and other directly attributable costs. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets to their residual 
values over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, or diminishing value over the following estimated useful lives:
Leasehold property improvements – over life of lease
Plant, equipment and machinery – 8%–60%
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An asset’s carrying amount 
is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangibles, including goodwill, 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which 
the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) 
is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate 
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
as income immediately.
Detailed assumptions with regard to discount, growth and inflation rates are set out in note 8 to the accounts.
Investments
Investments are initially recorded at cost. The subsequent measurement of contingent consideration is recognised through the income 
statement. The fair value of the contingent consideration is recognised by discounting the estimated sums payable by the discount rate 
of equity financing. Unwinding of the discount is charged to finance costs over the relevant period. The fair value of the share price at 
date of acquisition for shares issued as part of the consideration is reflected in the cost of the investment. Investments are reviewed for 
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow-moving items. 
Inventories comprise completed products, raw materials and work in process. The cost of inventories is calculated on a weighted average 
cost method. The cost included within inventories comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and an attributable 
portion of production overheads in bringing them to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group has become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables, classified as loans and receivables, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. 
The amount of provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, 
discounted at the effective interest rate.
Trade payables
Trade payables, classified as other liabilities, are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.

Accounting policies continued
Financial instruments continued
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An instrument will be 
classified as a financial liability when there is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another enterprise. 
Instruments that are settled through the delivery of a variable number of equity shares are classified as financial liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
For the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents 
as defined above, net of any outstanding bank overdraft when it forms an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement 
of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the consolidated Group income statement under the heading ‘finance costs’. Arrangement and facility 
fees together with bank charges are charged to the income statement under the heading ‘administrative expenses’.
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration amounts arising from acquisitions are recorded at fair value having regard to the relevant discount rate 
of equity capital. The finance costs arising from unwinding the instrument over the period are charged through the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Amounts are reviewed annually against criteria for payment set out within the relevant sale 
and purchase agreements.
Derecognition of financial instruments
The derecognition of financial assets takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial 
instrument, which is normally the case when the instrument is sold, or all of the cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed 
through to an independent third party.
Leasing commitments
Rentals payable under operating leases, where substantially all the benefits and risks remain with the lessor, are charged to income on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease, except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time 
pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, 
which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency. Amounts included within non-current assets in respect 
of amounts loaned to foreign subsidiaries have no fixed terms of repayment and there is no intention or expectation that repayment 
of such amounts will be demanded.
Transactions in overseas currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The results and financial position of subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated 
into the presentation currency as follows:
(a)  assets and liabilities for each reporting date are translated at the closing rate at that date; and
(b)  income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate 
on the dates of the transactions).
All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate.  40 Collagen Solutions plc Annual report and accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounting policies continued
Taxation
Current tax is the expected corporation tax payable or receivable in respect of the taxable profit/loss for the financial period using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, less any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities included in 
the financial statements and the amounts used for tax purposes that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or 
to receive more tax, with the following exceptions:
No provision is made relating to the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than 
those acquired as part of a business combination.
Provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on all taxable temporary differences associated with investments except where the 
Group can control the reversal of the temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable 
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences and unused tax losses and credits can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset 
is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that it will result 
in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reliably estimated.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payment transactions to certain employees, directors and suppliers. Equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions takes into account any non-vesting conditions and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group’s estimate of share options that will eventually vest, and a corresponding amount is credited to the share-based payment reserve.
Non-vesting conditions which are not satisfied during the vesting period are treated as cancellations and any remaining expense 
is accelerated in the period of failure.
Share-based payments associated with share options granted to employees of subsidiaries of the parent company are treated as an 
expense of the subsidiary company to be settled by equity of the parent company. The share-based payment expense increases the 
value of the parent company’s investment in the subsidiaries and is credited to the share-based payment reserve.
The proceeds received on exercise of share options are credited to share capital (for the nominal value) and the share premium account 
(for the excess over nominal value).
Fair value is measured by use of the Trinomial Barrier Option and Black-Scholes models. The expected life used in the model has been 
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial information in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are both readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods. These assumptions include but are not limited to the following areas: 
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and is included as part of the consideration transferred. Changes 
in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding 
adjustments against goodwill. The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify 
as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified 
as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or 
loss for the relevant financial period.
Amounts provided represent management’s best estimate of the likely outcome to be paid out under the individual earn-out provisions. 
Unwinding discount costs applied to the contingent considerations in relation to acquisitions made are charged through the income 
statement and included within finance costs. 42 Collagen Solutions plc Annual report and accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounting policies continued
Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Impairment of goodwill
The amount of goodwill initially recognised is dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based, to a considerable 
extent, on management’s judgement. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The test considers future cash flow projections 
of cash-generating units that give rise to the goodwill. Where the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of goodwill, 
an impairment charge is recognised for the difference. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the 
discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period. These are detailed in note 8.
Fair values of acquired intangibles
In respect of business combinations, the purchase price is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired entity. 
The Group makes judgements and estimates in relation to the fair value allocation of the purchase price and whether any value should 
be attributable to assets and liabilities not recognised in the acquiree’s individual financial statements such as customer contracts and 
relationships. If any unallocated portion is positive, it is recognised as goodwill. The recognition criteria in IAS 38 are applied to 
intangibles before allocating to goodwill in relation to development expenditure.
Management’s significant judgements in relation to customer contracts and relationships and patents as intangible assets are set out 
in note 8.
Management’s judgement is also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets, having reference to future economic benefits 
expected to be derived from the use of the asset. Economic benefits are based on the fair values of estimated future cash flows.
Deferred tax
Taxation management judgement is required to determine the amount of tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing 
and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of future tax planning strategies.
Research and development
Careful judgement by the directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been 
met. This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain until such time as technical viability has been 
proven and commercialisation is likely to be achieved. Judgements are based on the information available at each reporting date, which 
includes progress with testing and data and commercial feasibility. Activities in relation to research and development are continuously 
monitored by the directors.

The unrecognised deferred tax asset relates to losses. Whilst the directors consider that there is a significant stream of income in the 
pipeline that may come to fruition, they consider that there is sufficient uncertainty surrounding the timing of those cash flows to warrant 
not recognising a deferred tax asset.
During the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, Collagen Solutions (UK) Limited created and surrendered tax losses under 
research and development expenditure claims. A payment of £60,534 in relation to the year ended 31 March 2016 was received during 
the year ended 31 March 2017 and has been included in ‘other revenues’ in accordance with IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants. 
Payments of £43,168 for the year ended 31 March 2015 and £28,699 for the period ended 31 March 2014 were receivable at 31 March 2016.
7 Loss per share
The calculation of basic loss attributable to the equity holders of the parent is based on losses of £1,755,678 (2016: £980,464) 
and 185,776,383 (2016: 171,210,108) ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. 
The loss for the year and the weighted average number of ordinary shares for calculating the diluted loss per share for the year ended 
31 March 2017 are identical to those for the basic loss per share. This is because the outstanding share options would have the effect 
of reducing the loss per ordinary share and would therefore not be dilutive under the terms of IAS 33. 46 Collagen Solutions plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Impairment review
Total goodwill of £12,543,426 comprises goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings of £8,673,382 and goodwill arising 
on the purchase of a business of £3,870,044. Goodwill relates to the acquisition of Collagen Solutions (UK) Limited, the purchase of the 
assets of Collagen Solutions LLC in January 2014, the acquisition of Southern Lights Ventures 2002 Limited in December 2014 and the 
investment in Cre8ive Collagen Limited in July 2016. This goodwill has been allocated to the combined Group as a single CGU for the 
purposes of the impairment review, since this is the lowest level within the entity at which management monitors goodwill for internal 
purposes. The whole Group is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combinations through cross-selling opportunities, 
market reputation, cost savings and surety of supply. Synergies are represented by those unrecognised assets of the acquired entities 
that are effectively transferred to the CGU, rather than by the recognised assets.

47 Annual report and accounts 2017 Collagen Solutions plc
8 Intangible assets continued
Impairment review continued
The impairment review involves a value in use calculation which is based on the present value of expected future cash flows of the CGU 
to be generated. The key assumptions underlying the cash flow projections within the impairment review are revenue growth, margins 
and the level of operating expenditure. The cash flow projections are based on formally approved management cash flow projections for 
a four-year period. A terminal value is calculated based on estimated real growth rate in perpetuity of 3.6% (2016: 3.5%) and rate of 
inflation in perpetuity of 2.2% (2016: 2.5%), together with a pre-tax discount rate of 11.0% (2016: 11.0%).
Key assumptions used in the growth calculations for years ended 2017 to 2019 are:
• 
Gross margins  – between 70% and 73%
• 
Annual revenue growth – between 37% and 53%
• 
Increase in operating costs – between 2% and 11%
The recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds the carrying amount of the CGU by 422.9%. The directors consider the revenues to be 
the most sensitive assumption used in the impairment reviews. A reduction in revenues in excess of 26.4% would result in the 
recoverable amount of the CGU being equal to its carrying amount.

Impairment review
The recoverable amount of investments is determined from value in use calculations when there is an indication of impairment. The key 
assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and future expected changes to revenue 
and direct costs in relation to the particular investment and are set out in note 8.
Management estimates that there has been no impairment. 
The Group prepares forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets. Changes in revenue and direct costs are based on 
management’s plans to cross-sell the Group’s expanded range of current and pipeline products into existing customers and markets, 
and also to exploit opportunities with new customers, including extending into new market territories. These are approved by 
management and cash flows are extrapolated thereafter in perpetuity.
Based on the assumptions and estimates discussed above, and in note 8, management believes that no impairment provision is required.

Elements of the contingent consideration become payable if certain sales targets are reached over the course of the period to 
31 March 2018. There are three separate sets of earn-out conditions relating to the acquisitions of Collagen Solutions (UK) Limited, 
Collagen Solutions LLC and Collagen Solutions NZ Limited (formerly Southern Lights Ventures 2002 Limited). During the year ended 
31 March 2017 management reviewed the probability that relevant targets will be achieved. Based on current information it was 
considered that the full Collagen Solutions LLC and Southern Lights Ventures 2002 Limited contingent consideration payments in 2017 
and 2018 would not be likely and a reversal of £553,062 in relation to this provision has been included in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. 
The amounts recognised as of the date of relevant acquisitions are as follows: Collagen Solutions (UK) Limited – £1,782,122; 
Collagen Solutions LLC – £627,113; and Collagen Solutions NZ Limited (formerly Southern Lights Ventures 2002 Limited) – £1,704,693.
The terms for Collagen Solutions (UK) Limited required the Group to pay the vendors two tranches of up to £1 million in ordinary 
shares based on a 12.5p strike price, i.e. 8 million ordinary shares dependent on Group turnover reaching £2.25 million and securing 
three manufacturing contracts respectively. The expected shares to be issued under this arrangement were included in the shares 
to be issued reserve at 31 March 2016. During the year ended 31 March 2017, both tranches of 8 million ordinary shares were issued 
under this arrangement.
The terms for Collagen Solutions LLC require the Group to pay the vendors two tranches of up to $0.625 million in cash dependent 
on sales of certain deferred consideration products and sales to certain deferred consideration customers reaching $3.5 million 
in any two consecutive years ending before 31 December 2017.

if turnover of NZ$6.5 million is achieved.
In the case of both Collagen Solutions LLC and Collagen Solutions NZ Limited (formerly Southern Lights Ventures 2002 Limited), pro-rata 
amounts will be payable if the maximum turnover levels are not achieved.

On 14 February 2017, the Company entered into a Bond Subscription Agreement with Norgine Ventures Fund I SCA SICAR for up to 
£4,000,000 in private senior secured bonds. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions these can be drawn down in three tranches.
Tranche A of £2,000,000 of the Bond Subscription Agreement was drawn down on 31 March 2017 and is carried net of issue costs. 
The term of this tranche of the Bond is 42 months with principal payments commencing in April 2018 in monthly instalments. The interest 
rate is 10% and the Group is not exposed to interest rate changes or contractual repricing dates at the end of the reporting period as 
the borrowings are fixed in nature. 
The fair value of these borrowings equals their carrying amount as the impact of discounting is not significant. 
The Bonds are secured against certain assets of the Group. Collagen Solutions plc, Collagen Solutions (UK) Limited and ChondroMimetics Limited 
have granted first fixed and floating charges over all property and assets to Norgine Ventures Fund I SCA SICAR. Collagen Solutions NZ Limited 
(formerly Southern Lights Ventures 2002 Limited) has granted security to Norgine Ventures Fund I SCA SICAR over all its assets apart from 
those covered by the Alberta security (refer to note 19) and security granted to the vendors for the additional consideration owing.

Currency derivatives
The Group and the Company have not utilised forward contracts to hedge future purchase transactions and cash flows in the financial year.
Credit risk
The Group and the Company’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents, although all cash 
is held on deposit with highly reputable financial institutions.
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is due to the Group and Company trading with a limited number of companies which are 
generally large listed or blue-chip medical device companies. Therefore, the Group and the Company do not expect in the normal course 
of events that these debts are at significant risk. Where there is perceived to be a greater risk, a standby letter of credit or similar is sought. 
The Group’s and the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is reflected in the carrying amounts of their financial assets as set out 
in the table above.
The Group and the Company have no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of their trade receivables as the exposure 
is spread over a number of customers.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s and the Company’s interest rate exposure is limited to their cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are held 
on short-term deposit-attracting variable rates of interest.
Liquidity risk
The Group and Company manage liquidity risk to ensure that they will have sufficient liquidity to meet their liabilities as they fall due. 
All trade and other payables contracted at the reporting date have a settlement date of less than 12 months.

Contingent consideration
The contingent consideration relating to the purchase consideration on the acquisitions made has been discounted to reflect the 
fair value of the future cash outflows based on the directors’ best estimate of when such sums will become payable under the terms 
of the agreement.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets
The Group’s and the Company’s financial assets at 31 March 2017 comprised cash and trade receivables. The cash balances of 
£8,978,150 (2016: £2,493,146) (Group) and £7,776,079 (2016: £1,321,938) (Company) are floating rate financial assets. Trade receivables 
are non-interest bearing.

The fair values based upon the market value or discounted cash flows of financial liabilities and financial assets held in the Group 
and the Company were not materially different from their book values.
Finance and interest rate risk
Where appropriate, the Group and the Company manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations on their borrowings to reduce 
the impact of adverse variations in the market rates on the Group’s profit and cash flow. 
Currency risk
The Group and the Company’s activities expose it primarily to currency risk as overseas revenues are primarily in US dollars. This risk is 
mitigated by the requirement to settle the costs, including salary and fixed overheads of operations in the US in US dollars. The Group is 
required to settle salary costs and cover overheads of the NZ facility in NZ dollars, which presents a currency risk as revenues are primarily 
denominated in US dollars. Management monitors these risks on an ongoing basis and would use foreign exchange forward contracts if 
required to hedge this exposure. There were no forward exchange rate contracts at the balance sheet date. The Group does not use 
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies, approved 
by the Board of directors, which provide written principles for the use of financial derivatives.

Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Both share capital and the share premium account arise on the issue of shares. The retained deficit reflects losses incurred to date.
Share-based payment reserve
This reserve is the result of the Company’s grant of equity-settled share options to selected employees and is measured in accordance 
with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. 
Shares to be issued reserve
This reserve arises from ordinary shares that are due to be issued under deferred and contingent consideration arrangements. 
The fair value of the warrants granted to Norgine Ventures to be issued in connection with the Bond facility has also been accounted 
for in this reserve.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve arises from the retranslation of the foreign subsidiaries to the presentational currency of the Group on consolidation.
Merger reserve
This reserve arises from the premium on the difference between the fair value share price of Collagen Solutions plc shares issued as 
consideration shares on 2 January 2014 and 10 December 2014 and the nominal value of those shares. Consideration shares were issued 
to satisfy part of the consideration in the acquisition of Collagen Solutions (UK) Limited, the acquisition of the business and assets 
of Collagen Solutions LLC, and the acquisition of Collagen Solutions NZ Limited (formerly Southern Lights Ventures 2002 Limited).
Non-controlling interest reserve
This reserve represents 40% of the net assets of Cre8ive Collagen Limited and Cre8ive Collagen Bio-Tech (Beijing) Co Limited not held 
by the Group.

Explanatory notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting
These notes give an explanation of the proposed resolutions. Resolutions 1 to 7 are proposed as ordinary resolutions. This means that 
for each of those resolutions to be passed, more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution. Resolution 8 is proposed 
as a special resolution. This means that for resolution 8 to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of 
the resolution.
Resolution 1 – Annual report and accounts
The directors must lay the Company’s accounts, the Directors’ Report and the Auditors’ Report before the shareholders in a general 
meeting. This is a legal requirement after the directors have approved the accounts and the Directors’ Report, and the auditors have 
prepared their report.
Resolutions 2 to 4 – Re-election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that at the Annual General Meeting of the Company any directors who have been 
appointed since the last Annual General Meeting, or any who were not appointed or re-appointed at one of the preceding two Annual 
General Meetings, must retire from office. Accordingly, David Evans, Malcolm Gillies and Gill Black will offer themselves for re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting.
Biographical details of the directors are set out on pages 20 and 21 of the annual report and accounts.
Resolutions 5 and 6 – Re-appointment and remuneration of auditors
The Company is required to appoint auditors for each financial year of the Company. Resolution 5 proposes the re-appointment 
of RSM UK Audit LLP as the Company’s auditors for the current financial year of the Company ending on 31 March 2018. Resolution 6 
seeks authority for the directors to decide the auditors’ remuneration.
Resolution 7 – Renewal of authority to allot shares 
The purpose of this resolution is to renew the directors’ power to allot shares. Section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) 
provides that the directors may not allot new shares (other than for employee share schemes) without shareholder approval. This 
resolution proposes that authority be granted in substitution of the existing authority to allot securities up to a maximum amount of 
£1,080,997. This amount represents approximately one-third of the Company’s total issued ordinary share capital as at 3 August 2017, 
being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document.
In addition, following guidance issued by the ABI in December 2008 and updated in November 2009, the Company is seeking additional 
authority to allot securities in connection with a fully pre-emptive rights issue up to a maximum amount of £1,080,997 representing 
approximately one-third of the Company’s total issued ordinary share capital as at 3 August 2017, being the latest practicable date prior 
to publication of this document. The benefit to the Company of obtaining such authority on an annual basis is that it would allow the 
Company to implement a rights issue of an amount equal to two-thirds of the issued ordinary share capital without the need to call 
an additional general meeting. This would shorten the implementation timetable of such a rights issue. 
The directors consider that the authorities sought pursuant to resolution 7 are desirable to allow the Company to retain flexibility 
although they have no present intention of exercising these authorities. The authorities will expire at the end of the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting or, if earlier, on 30 September 2018, unless previously cancelled or varied by the Company in general meeting. 
Resolution 8 – Disapplication of pre-emption rights
Section 561(1) of the Act provides that if the directors wish to allot any equity securities, or sell any treasury shares (if it holds any), for 
cash, it must first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. Section 561 does not apply in connection 
with an employee share scheme. The purpose of this resolution is to allow the directors to allot equity securities for cash as if section 561(1) 
of the Act did not apply, in connection with rights issues, open offers and other pre-emption offers pursuant to the authority granted by 
resolution 7, and otherwise up to a total amount of £324,299, representing approximately 10% of the Company’s total issued ordinary 
share capital as at 3 August 2017, being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document. This power is being sought in 
order to give the Company the flexibility to raise funds in the future should it choose to do so.
The authority will expire at the end of the 2018 Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, on 30 September 2018, unless previously cancelled 
or varied by the Company in general meeting.  64 Collagen Solutions plc Annual report and accounts 2017
