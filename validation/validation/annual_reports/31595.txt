STRATEGIC REPORT
IN-DESTINATION MANAGEMENT 
AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS
Our customer teams are integral to our business and the 
holiday experience that we give our customers. We believe that 
the strength of the relationship we build with the customer is 
what sets us apart in a crowded market. Customer Relations 
and In-Destination Services – our teams on the ground in resort 
– build and maintain relationships so that our customers enjoy 
the best of Thomas Cook.
OUR CUSTOMER CHANNELS 
Putting the customer at the heart of our business also means 
building direct contact with customers, whenever and wherever 
they want to interact with us. This includes developing our 
websites to offer a better online experience, as well as maintaining 
a network of profitable stores to attract, inspire and engage our 
customers. The customer insight we have built up over the years, 
along with the trust there is in the best brand in travel, shapes 
the approach we take to every customer contact.
STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS
We will enter into strategic partnerships 
where we have the opportunity to 
streamline our business while also tapping 
into new markets or widening our offer 
to customers. Our strategic partnerships 
also enable us to leverage the trust and 
heritage of the Thomas Cook brand.
OUR PARTNER AIRLINES 
We partner with other airlines to maximise 
the choice for our customers, increase 
flexibility in our operations, and manage 
our fleet more effectively.
OUR COMPLEMENTARY 
HOTEL PARTNERSHIPS
Partnerships with Expedia and Webjet 
to outsource the production of our 
complementary hotel offering allow us 
to provide our customers with a broad 
choice of hotels at the lowest possible 
cost. This approach means we can focus 
on creating maximum value in the holidays 
to our directly-contracted own-brand 
and selected partner hotels.
THE CUSTOMER JOURNEY
Our customers’ journey doesn’t start in the airport. It begins with the first 
holiday inspiration online or in a store, through to planning and booking their 
time away, to the experience on holiday with us and then the memories 
they carry with them afterwards. We are building closer relationships with 
our customers throughout this cycle to increase loyalty and inspire more 
customers to holiday with Thomas Cook.
OUR OWN-BRAND AND 
SELECTED PARTNER HOTELS
It is through our holiday offering that we 
generate, preserve and capture value. 
We focus our holiday offering on our own-
brand hotels and resorts, supplemented by 
a defined portfolio of selected partner hotels. 
By concentrating on a streamlined portfolio 
of hotels, we are able to have a greater 
influence on the customer experience, driving 
better customer loyalty and recommendations 
while delivering higher margins.
OUR AIRLINE
We recognise that the flight to and from the 
destination is an integral part of the holiday 
experience. Control of our own Airline gives 
us influence over the on-board experience 
and enables us to create value through sale 
of additional in-flight services. The sale of 
seat-only airline tickets maximises revenue 
from the assets that we control.
ADDED-VALUE SERVICES 
To supplement the value that we create 
through our holidays, we offer a choice of 
additional travel-related services to our 
customers, including airline seat sales, 
meals on board, transfers and excursions, 
as well as holiday-related financial services. 
Sales of these services give customers 
the opportunity to personalise the holiday 
experience and create additional returns 
for the business.

STRATEGIC REPORT
 CHAIRMAN’S
 ST A TEMENT 
2017 has been a year of considerable strategic progress 
at Thomas Cook. In what remains a highly competitive 
environment – one that has contributed to the collapse 
of a number of competitors in the last 12 months – 
Management’s focus on executing its strategy for 
profitable growth has delivered good results for the year, 
and set the business on a clear path for sustainable 
growth in the years to come. 
After five years of hard work to reposition Thomas Cook, 
there is a real sense of energy and momentum in the 
business – and tangible evidence of execution. 
Despite the competitive backdrop, the Group delivered 
an £28 million increase in underlying operating profit 
to £330 million, an eight per cent increase year-on-year, 
and net profit of £12 million, the third consecutive year 
of positive net profit after tax. We also took further steps 
to strengthen the balance sheet. Debt was reduced 
by another £89 million in the year, and the business 
has signed new financing arrangements amounting 
to £975 million. This builds on the work the Group has 
done over the last five years to progressively improve 
the terms and maturity of its debt to provide it with 
greater flexibility and a more robust capital structure 
over the medium term.
The progress the business made operationally should 
be seen alongside a number of very significant steps 
the Group took in 2017 to better position the business 
for the future.
In September, the business secured what promises to 
be a ground-breaking alliance with Expedia. Meanwhile, 
a new strategic partnership with Swiss hotel property 
development company, LMEY Investments, establishes the 
launch pad to develop and grow Thomas Cook’s portfolio 
of own-brand hotels, key to the successful delivery of the 
Group’s profitable growth strategy.
Reflecting the Board’s support for the progress that 
has been made in the last year and its confidence in 
the strategy, the Board has recommended that we pay 
a dividend to Shareholders of 0.6 pence per share.
Moving onto the business of the Board, we were 
pleased to welcome two new Non-Executive Directors 
in July, Jürgen Schreiber and Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson. 
Jürgen brings a breadth of international experience 
across retail and consumer goods including Chief 
Executive roles in both a publicly-listed company and 
large private companies. Paul, meanwhile, as CFO 
of InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), brings deep 
experience of the global hotel industry to the Board.
In January 2018, we will also welcome a new Executive 
Director to the Board when Bill Scott takes over from 
Michael Healy as CFO following Michael’s decision to 
retire. I look forward to Bill supporting us through the 
next phase of the Group’s development and would like 
to thank Michael for the very significant contribution he 
has made to the financial health of the Group in his six 
years with the business. I am pleased that he has agreed 
to continue his involvement in the business through 
non-executive leadership roles in Thomas Cook China and 
Thomas Cook Money, two important areas of potential 
growth for the Group.
We are at an exciting point in the development of this 
company as we pursue our unique strategy to focus on 
our core holidays and streamline the business, while at 
the same time partnering with the best in the industry to 
offer customers a greater choice. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank Peter Fankhauser, CEO, and every 
one of the 22,000 colleagues across the business for their 
commitment and hard work in the past year. I would also 
like to thank all of our Shareholders for their continued 
support as we transform Thomas Cook for the future. 
FRANK MEYSMAN 
CHAIRMAN
21 November 2017
“ We are at an exciting point in the 
development of this company as we 
pursue our unique strategy to focus 
on our core holidays and streamline 
the business, while at the same time 
partnering with the best in the industry 
to offer customers a greater choice.” THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10
STRATEGIC REPORT
 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
 REVIEW 
 “Our focus on the customer drives 
every decision that we take in the 
business, from the hotels that we 
sell every season and the service 
promises that we make, through to 
the destinations we fly to. But it 
also determines the big decisions 
that we take about the business 
we want to be in the future.”
PETER FANKHAUSER
CEO
2017 has been a good year for Thomas 
Cook. The actions we took on strategy 
in the last 12 months have transformed 
the scale of the opportunity ahead 
for the Group while at the same time 
delivering strong growth in demand, 
as more customers from across our 
markets chose our modern package 
and flight offer for their hard-earned 
weeks in the sun.
The very deliberate decision that we 
made two years ago to put the customer 
back at the heart of our business is now 
bearing fruit. Strong customer demand 
for our improved holiday offering helped 
increase revenues by 9 per cent in the year. 
This combined with an improved performance 
in our German Airline, Condor, to deliver an 
underlying operating profit of £330 million, 
an 8 per cent increase year-on-year. That we 
achieved this growth in a highly competitive 
environment shows how much more resilient 
we are as a business than even a few 
years ago.
Most importantly, we know that customers’ 
experience of their holidays with Thomas 
Cook is getting better all the time. Our Net 
Promoter Score – or NPS – which is the 
primary indicator of customer satisfaction 
and the metric we look at before anything 
else, has increased by nine points over 
the last two years. This reflects continued 
growth in every one of our significant 
markets in 2017.
Our focus on the customer drives every 
decision that we take in the business, from 
the hotels that we sell every season and 
the service promises that we make, through 
to the destinations we fly to. But it also 
determines the big decisions that we take 
about the business we want to be in the 
future. It is perhaps there that we have made 
the most progress in the past 12 months. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11
STRATEGIC REPORT
TRANSFORMING OUR 
OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH
The strategic alliance that we signed in 
September with Expedia, outsourcing 
our city and domestic hotels business 
and using Expedia technology, will 
transform the way in which we work. 
By attracting one of the best operators 
in the travel industry, we will be able to 
offer a much greater choice to customers, 
at lower cost and complexity to us. This, 
in turn, will allow us to focus on holidays 
to our own-brand and selected partner 
hotels in sun & beach destinations where 
we know we can really set ourselves 
apart from the competition. 
Our partnership with LMEY reinforces 
that strategy, paving the way for the 
creation of a joint hotel investment 
platform which will enable us to super-
charge our portfolio of own-brand 
hotels and resorts. 
This will give customers an even greater 
choice of high-quality hotels to suit 
their needs, hotels that are unique to 
Thomas Cook, and achieve higher levels 
of customer satisfaction and earn better 
margins than the portfolio average. 
Another example of a successful 
partnership is Thomas Cook China, our 
joint venture with Fosun, which is growing 
fast in a rapidly expanding market, 
taking 20,000 bookings in its first year 
of operations. Our focus on developing 
strong partnerships with big technology-
led players in the Chinese market, like 
Alibaba, gives us access to a big customer 
base, while our tailored holiday offering 
means we can differentiate ourselves in 
a competitive environment.
Meanwhile, the launch of Thomas Cook 
Money builds on our long heritage in 
financial services to offer customers across 
our source markets new and simpler ways 
to plan, save, borrow and spend their 
holiday money, all supported by innovative, 
easy-to-use technology.
Each of these developments represent 
an important step forward in delivering 
our strategy for profitable growth. 
Taken together, they transform the 
opportunity ahead for the Group. 
CARE
Of course, the big strategic moves are only 
relevant if we continue to do all we can to 
ensure that every customer has the best 
experience on holiday with Thomas Cook. 
It is here where I believe that we have the 
biggest opportunity to differentiate our 
holidays from the competition – in the care 
and the reassurance that we provide. 
In the last year, we have extended our 
24-Hour Hotel Satisfaction Promise to more 
than 2,000 hotels, giving 80% of customers 
who book a sun & beach holiday with 
Thomas Cook the reassurance that if a hotel 
is not as we described it, we will sort out 
the issue or offer to move the customer 
to another hotel of the same standard 
within 24 hours. This represented a bold 
move when we introduced it for summer 
2016, one which is now paying off with 
customer satisfaction on average 12 points 
higher in those hotels with the 24-Hour 
Hotel Satisfaction Promise than the rest 
of the portfolio.
We continue to innovate to broaden our 
appeal – and increase customers’ ability 
to personalise their holiday – with the 
launch of a ‘Choose Your Room’ option. 
Available in 300 of our core hotels for 
summer 2018, this is another industry first 
for a ‘traditional’ tour operating business 
and shows how we are evolving to capture 
greater opportunities.
Another area where we have made big 
changes is in the way in which we talk 
about risk to customers. We operate in a 
market where disruption, whether from 
natural disaster, political changes or terror 
attacks, can affect many of our customers 
and our operations. We are not a security 
company but we know that what we can 
do is to be as transparent as possible about 
potential risks – whether that’s through 
customer-friendly blogs or clear links to 
the latest government advice – so that 
the customer can make up their own mind 
about whether to travel. I am proud of how 
far we have come. STRATEGIC REPORT
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 12
We have also taken a leading role in 
bringing the industry together on the issue 
of health and safety. In September, the Safer 
Tourism Foundation, the independent charity we 
set up with Sharon Wood, the mother of Christi 
and Bobby Shepherd, launched a pledge which 
articulates a new approach to customer health 
and safety within the industry. This has already 
been signed by seven major travel companies 
in a move that we believe will promote greater 
collaboration to achieve practical change for 
the benefit of all customers.
In our UK business, we have faced a specific 
issue this year related to a dramatic surge in 
illness compensation claims, many of which 
we believe to be fraudulent. Our presence in 
destination through our resort teams and our 
rigorous focus on hotel quality means we are 
continually improving standards and can take 
care of those who fall ill, but we must also 
protect our customers from dishonest illness 
claims which threaten the price and availability 
of all-inclusive holidays. We have made good 
progress highlighting these false claims in 
the courts, in the media and to government, 
which we hope will lead to substantive 
changes in legislation, including the way 
the claims industry is regulated, in time for 
summer next year.
We know that our approach to care needs also 
to encompass the wider environment in which 
we operate, at home and abroad. To this end, 
this year we introduced a new animal welfare 
policy, becoming the first major travel company 
to commit to remove from sale any animal 
attraction that is found not to be fully compliant 
with the ABTA Global Welfare Guidance for 
Animals in Tourism. This is a bold step which 
demonstrates our commitment to change.
CONTACT
Our customer focus also extends to 
developing direct contact with customers 
in order to strengthen our relationships 
and provide more personalised services. 
This starts with providing rich, inspirational 
content on our websites and this year we’ve 
added over 110,000 images and 1,200 room 
plans to better engage our customers. 
The investment we’ve made in our websites 
has helped grow our online bookings with 
the strongest growth in the UK, up 27 per 
cent in 2017. Across the Group, we now 
achieve 46 per cent of all sales via the web, 
up three percentage points on last year. 
In this context, we continue to reshape our 
retail store network to ensure we are well-
positioned to meet the changing customer 
needs. In the UK, the Co-operative’s exit from 
our retail joint venture has enabled us to 
take full control of our store portfolio, and 
in Germany, we’ve signed 92 new agency 
agreements to increase the proportion of 
direct sales.
OWN-BRAND HOTELS AND 
RESORTS AND SELECTED 
PARTNER HOTELS
Of course, the other area where we can 
genuinely differentiate ourselves is in the 
holidays we offer and, most importantly, our 
ability to provide customers with holidays 
that are unique to Thomas Cook. To this end, 
we have gradually been streamlining our 
portfolio of hotels to focus the majority of our 
business on 3,000 properties where we know 
we can have a higher degree of influence 
over the quality and service standards.
Our own-brand hotels and resorts are central 
to the success of this strategy. These enable 
us to provide customers with a consistent 
and high-quality holiday, whatever their needs, 
delivering higher satisfaction scores and 
higher margins than the portfolio average. 
With the arrival this year of Ingo Burmester, 
who ran the successful Robinson brand for 
TUI, we are now building a hotel management 
company inside Thomas Cook under his 
leadership, with the aim of growing the size 
of the portfolio and strengthening our brands. 
We made further progress in the year with 
11 new openings in summer 2017, including 
our second Casa Cook in Kos and a new 
Sunwing Ocean Beach Club in Cyprus. 
We also added a seventh brand to the 
portfolio in the form of Aldiana, the premium 
club-based activity format, through an 
acquisition of a 42 per cent stake in the 
business as part of a wider partnership 
agreement with LMEY. At the same time, 
we have continued to rigorously manage 
the portfolio for quality, removing hotels 
where they don’t meet our standards. I feel 
very optimistic about the future growth 
prospects for this part of our business in 
the coming year as we work to identify 
new properties and build up our pipeline.
AIRLINE
Another element of our holiday offering where 
I feel optimistic is our airline. Over the last four 
years, and in a very competitive market, we’ve 
transformed it from four essentially separate 
airlines whose primary task was to transport 
our tour operator customers, to one airline 
group with an increasingly successful seat-
only business, particularly on long-haul routes, 
and its own distribution channels. In doing so, 
we have created Europe’s third-largest airline 
to sun & beach destinations which competes 
wing-to-wing with the low-cost carriers, 
and Europe’s sixth-largest long-haul carrier 
with an expanding range of destinations 
and a compelling customer offer.
We have now formalised the work Management 
has undertaken to create one Group airline, 
by separating its reporting and legal structure. 
This is the logical next step which reflects the 
way we think about the airline business within 
the Group; from our airline being the primary 
transport for the tour operator to becoming 
a leisure airline in its own right, with its own 
commercial relationships, distribution channels 
and growth targets – while sharing the Group’s 
absolute focus on giving our customers the 
best possible experience of Thomas Cook. 
PARTNERSHIPS
We are very clear in our strategy for profitable 
growth that we will focus our attention and 
resources on a number of key areas where 
we can genuinely be different from the 
competition. This approach is complemented 
by a series of partnerships which enable us to 
streamline our operations, while also tapping 
into opportunities for growth. 
The strategic alliance with Expedia agreed at 
the end of this year to outsource our city and 
domestic hotel business, while harnessing their 
technology for our hotel-only offering, is the 
most significant of those partnerships agreed 
during the year. This, combined with the deal 
we agreed in 2016 to outsource the sun & beach 
hotels which sit outside of our core portfolio 
to Webjet, completes our complementary hotel 
strategy and positions us for growth in this area 
of the business at the lowest possible cost.
However, we also made good progress in Thomas 
Cook China, a joint venture with Fosun launched 
September 2016. A full-service travel company, in a 
fast-expanding market, our China business booked 
20,000 customers in its first year. Our ambition 
in 2018 is to grow that number tenfold.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES
The strategy we are executing sets out a 
clear path to profitable growth. But it also 
results in a business which is much simpler 
with a leaner organisational structure. We’re 
working to remove duplication from across 
the business and to align processes to fit 
the new shape of Thomas Cook. 
In this respect, the new strategic alliance 
with Expedia, and the execution of the 
Webjet agreement, effectively outsourcing 
our complementary business, is a catalyst 
for the next stage in the transformation of 
the business. I believe it will enable us to 
realise significant cost savings and remove 
further layers of complexity in our systems 
and processes. 
CONCLUSION
In summary, Thomas Cook has made 
significant progress in 2017. We operate in an 
industry that is constantly changing, impacted 
by events that are often unpredictable and 
regularly beyond our control. The companies 
that succeed are those that are operationally 
flexible and which can anticipate shifts in 
customer demand.
The fact that we have successfully managed 
through a competitive environment while 
at the same time taking big decisions that 
will strengthen our position for the future is 
testament to the hard work and engagement 
of our 22,000 people around the globe. They are 
the ones that make this company different, 
focusing on every detail to make our customers’ 
experience of our holidays even better. 
Looking across the Group, I see real 
momentum behind our strategy for 
profitable growth. The actions we have 
taken in the last 12 months accelerate the 
transformation of Thomas Cook into a truly 
modern, streamlined travel company with 
the customer at the heart of everything that 
we do – for the benefit of our customers, 
our people and our Shareholders.

THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14
 OUR MARKETS TODAY 
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
For six consecutive years, the Travel & 
Tourism sector has outperformed the global 
economy. The 10-year forecast from the 
World Travel and Tourism Council anticipates 
this trend to continue, with average growth 
of 3.9 per cent per year, versus a forecast 
of GDP growth of 3.8 per cent. 
In addition, package holiday bookings are 
forecast to outgrow independent travel 
over the next four years as consumers 
look for ways to make their leisure spend 
go further. Mintel estimates that package 
travel in the UK will grow by 28.5 per cent 
by 2021, compared with independent travel 
which is forecast to grow by 17 per cent. 
International tourist arrivals increased 
by six per cent in the first half of 2017 
compared with the same period in 2016 
and significantly above the four per cent 
annual growth since 2010. According to 
the UNWTO, Mediterranean destinations 
reported particularly strong growth in 
international tourist arrivals in the first half 
of 2017. This trend is driven by the continued 
strength of many destinations in the area, 
combined with a significant rebound in 
destinations that suffered decreases in 
previous years, such as Turkey, Egypt and 
Tunisia. The rebound is thanks in part to 
a more stable geopolitical environment 
in these countries in 2017 versus the 
disruption of 2016.
Overseas visitors to Turkey and Egypt 
increased by 25 per cent and 51 per 
cent respectively compared with 2016. 
The UK Government’s decision to lift its 
recommendation against travel to Tunisia 
in July 2017 is a further sign of positive 
development in the region. Overall, countries 
within Europe saw an eight per cent rise 
in international tourism arrivals in the first 
six months of the year. 
Within our source markets, the OECD 
estimates that the Eurozone will grow by 
1.9 per cent over 2018, with Germany, our 
largest Eurozone source market, just ahead 
at 2.1 per cent. UK GDP is expected to rise 
by one per cent, while Sweden, Denmark 
and Norway are forecast at 2.3, 2.1 and 
1.5 per cent respectively.
POLITICAL AND REGULATORY 
ENVIRONMENT
We expect Brexit to impact the regulatory 
framework in which we operate for both 
our UK business and our wider Group 
operations, and we are actively planning 
and preparing for this. Most importantly, the 
UK’s current membership of Europe’s Single 
Aviation Market will change upon the UK’s 
withdrawal from the EU, as will the UK’s 
access to EU employment markets, including 
the country’s ability to place temporary 
workers in EU Member States without 
additional barriers.
With regards to maintaining access to 
the Single Aviation Market, we continue 
to make the case for the extension of 
existing aviation arrangements through 
a transitional agreement that retains the 
current framework. This would provide 
welcome certainty for customers and 
businesses alike. Having already begun the 
sale of flights and holidays in the post-Brexit 
era, we now require urgent clarity from 
the UK Government and EU institutions on 
a transitionary agreement. We continue to 
make the case for a comprehensive EUUK 
air transport agreement in the longer-term. 
We are working with UK and EU 
governments to highlight the benefits of the 
Posted Workers Directive and to advocate 
that these benefits are replicated in a future 
trade agreement, or bilateral arrangements 
between the UK and EU Member States. 
Within the UK, the issue of fraudulent 
holiday sickness compensation claims 
threatens both the cost and availability of 
all inclusive holidays for our UK customers. 
We have worked with the government to 
highlight the prevalence of fraud within the 
sickness claims industry, both directly and 
through the media, as well as pressing the 
case for effective regulation of the claims 
management companies which encourage 
customers to make claims – and in many 
cases encourage fraudulent activity.

STRATEGIC REPORT
We welcome the UK government’s call 
for evidence on the topic in October 2017 
and the passage of the Financial Guidance 
and Claims Bill, both of which we are 
monitoring closely and contributing to 
where appropriate.
The European Package Travel Directive 
will be implemented across the EU 
from 1 January 2018, with full compliance 
by 1 July 2018. We welcome that the 
implementation of the Directive will 
help to bring a level playing field for 
travel businesses selling ‘linked trips’ 
incorporating a flight and a hotel booking. 
We are working with the EU to make 
sure that the measures are implemented 
consistently across our markets and that 
customers have clarity on the protections 
that the Directive brings.
In February 2017, the European Union 
Competition Commission launched an 
investigation into the travel industry 
regarding hotel accommodation agreements 
with a focus on the availability of hotel 
bookings and pricing between member 
states. Thomas Cook is committed to fair 
and open competition and will cooperate 
fully with the Commission through 
the process.
Since current data protection legislation 
was introduced, our use of technology 
has changed the way we use and process 
personal data. In May 2018, the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) will come into 
effect. This will bring legislation up to date 
with the new, previously unforeseen ways 
that data is now used and will harmonise 
data protection rules and requirements 
across the EU. We are implementing 
changes to ensure that the personal data of 
our customers and employees is protected 
effectively and consistently across the 
business and that both our customers 
and employees have transparency on how 
their data may be used by Thomas Cook 
and the protections that the GDPR brings. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16
STRATEGIC REPORT
  CUSTOMER A T  
 OUR HEART 
‘Customer at our Heart’ is the cornerstone of our 
strategy for profitable growth. Our desire to create 
a genuinely customer-centric organisation shapes the 
way in which we think about the culture of the business 
and the values by which we work. It continues to act 
as a powerful catalyst for change and we believe it is 
where we have the biggest opportunity to differentiate 
ourselves from the competition.
We know that happy customers are more likely to 
come back to Thomas Cook and to recommend us to 
their friends. As customer loyalty increases, our cost 
of sale goes down as customers choose Thomas Cook 
because of our reputation rather than our marketing. 
We also know that on average customers that return to 
Thomas Cook spend more with us than new customers, 
reflecting their increased trust in our holiday offering.
Operationally, we focus our Customer at our Heart 
strategy in two areas: the care and reassurance 
we provide to our customers, set out in our three 
Customer Promises of Quality, Service and Reliability; 
and the contact we maintain with customers, 
ensuring that we are accessible however they 
choose to interact with us and forming long-lasting 
relationships throughout the year.  THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 17

 PROGRESS AGAINST STRATEGY
 CARE 
We believe that the biggest opportunity we have 
to differentiate a Thomas Cook holiday from the 
competition is in the level of care and reassurance 
that we provide to our customers.
That principle of customer care informs the approach 
that we take across the business; our colleagues who 
offer advice and customer service before, during and 
after their holidays; the quality assurance that our teams 
in resort provide through the formation of deep, long-
lasting relationships with our hotel partners; and the 
assistance we offer if something goes wrong – from 
individual incidents of hotel snags right through to 
emergency evacuations in crisis situations.
In a sign of our commitment to drive meaningful 
change in customer satisfaction across the business, 
we created a Group Customer Experience Team in 2015. 
Bringing expertise from across our source markets and 
in-resort teams, the team drew up a structured four-
year plan with the objective of delivering outstanding 
customer experience and differentiating Thomas Cook 
as the most loved holiday company.
In year one, their focus was on fixing the basics by 
identifying the key drivers of customer satisfaction 
and implementing NPS as the single KPI for customer 
satisfaction and one of the key metrics of business 
performance across the Group.
Year two involved delivering the priority improvements 
identified, and introducing the voice of the customer 
via customer feedback into our plans for the future.
We are now in year three of our plan, which is all about 
leveraging customer care as a genuine differentiator for 
our business. We have introduced new organisational 
values across the Group which properly reflect our 
priorities as a holiday company: ‘We put our heart into 
it’, ‘Wear their flip flops’ and ‘We’re one Thomas Cook’. 
These are directly linked to our Customer Promises of 
Quality, Service and Reliability respectively. See overleaf 
for more details. 
OUR PROGRESS IN 2017
We are now seeing evidence of the direct link between 
NPS uplift and rebooking rate. Our data demonstrates 
that the hotels which score highest in NPS achieve 
not only a higher rebooking rate, but also attract 
more new customers to Thomas Cook, showing that 
customer advocacy is playing an increasingly important 
role in the growth of our business.
Our Academy of Excellence, established to work with our 
hotel partners to help them maintain the highest standards 
of customer service and quality at our hotels, is now in 
its third year. In 2017, it helped implement over 650 quality 
improvement plans with hoteliers, contributing to a rise in 
NPS across our core hotel portfolio this year. 
For summer 2017 we extended our 24-Hotel Satisfaction Promise 
to cover 2,000 hotels in our core portfolio of own-brand and 
selected partner hotels, giving 80 per cent of our core sun & 
beach holiday customers additional reassurance of quality and 
service. We plan to increase the roll out to cover 100 per cent of 
customers on holiday in our core portfolio of 3,170 hotels in 2018.
We have also succeeded in increasing the proportion of 
complaints that we have been able to resolve in resort 
before customers come home. The result is that customers 
come home happier, while we spend less on customer 
relations in our source markets.
There is more to come as we introduce new ways to 
increase loyalty and attract new customers to Thomas Cook. 
New innovations for summer 2018 include the ability to 
pre-book a specific hotel room based on detailed floor plans 
and imagery.

CASE STUDY
GAMBIA  
EVACUATION 
January is a popular time for holidays 
to the Gambia, which offers reliable 
winter sun in a beautiful African setting. 
Unfortunately, political instability following 
a disputed election caused the UK Foreign 
Office in January 2017 to change its 
travel advice for this small West-African 
nation, recommending against all but 
essential travel.
We had been monitoring the situation for 
some weeks and maintaining close contact 
with the Foreign Office to understand what 
impact the escalating tension could have on 
civil stability. With just one airport and an 
unfavourable mountainous geography, we 
knew that we had to act early to position 
aircraft and crew in the region so we had 
the operational flexibility to evacuate our 
customers at short notice should the 
situation deteriorate.
Before the UK Government changed the 
travel advice, we had already drawn up 
a logistics plan in anticipation of the 
situation escalating. Aircraft capacity and 
crew availability were earmarked for a 
potential full evacuation, as were Special 
Assistance Team members willing to travel 
to the Gambia in support of a potential 
ground operation. That meant that when 
the change in advice came, we were ready, 
sending extra flights directly from the UK, 
on top of the existing scheduled flights 
which we sent in empty. We also operated 
reserve aircraft based in the Canary Islands 
and used Las Palmas in Gran Canaria as a 
bridgehead, switching crew and refueling 
as necessary. This shorter flight time from 
Banjul to the Canary Islands allowed for 
an increased number of rotations and an 
accelerated evacuation process.
We provided all of our package 
holidaymakers and our seat-only airline 
customers with a seat on a rescue flight 
home, in total repatriating 3,500 customers 
in three days with 16 rescue flights. 
Our Airline gives us the responsiveness 
to evacuate our customers when they 
most need us, while our world-class In-
Destination Management teams, supported 
by our trained Special Assistance Team, 
offer support to our customers on the 
ground. We believe that it is this ability 
to offer our customers the reassurance 
that we will be there when things go 
wrong which differentiates us from 
the competition.

 CONT ACT 
Putting our customers at the heart of the 
business means building a closer relationship 
throughout the year, wherever and whenever 
our customers want to engage with us. 
From the way we persuade our customers to come to us 
first, how we sell them our flights and holidays, through 
to how we retain and strengthen that relationship, 
we are building seamless contact with our customers 
throughout their holiday journey.
This includes developing rich, inspirational content that 
stands out in a crowded online marketplace and will 
grab customers’ attention to drive higher conversion. 
By investing in our websites, we can grow our online 
presence and reshape our retail estate to create a  
true omni-channel approach to how we sell our holidays. 
To stay close to our customers, we are building world-
class customer relationship management, including 
improving our personalised interaction with customers in 
the period running up to their holiday through a holiday 
companion app. 
This direct contact with customers through the channel 
of their choice, be that in-store, through our customer 
contact centres or online, means we can drive loyalty and 
increase sales of tailor-made services which add value 
to our customers’ holidays and increase satisfaction 
scores, while at the same time lowering cost of sale 
and achieving higher margins. 
OUR PROGRESS IN 2017
Over the course of the year, we added more than 112,000 
images to our website, 1,200 room plans and 520 hotel 
and destination videos to further enrich our websites 
and inspire our customers.
We also created a single content hub to better distribute 
our content across all of our online channels and leverage 
the Group’s marketing assets on a larger scale.
These investments in our websites have led to strong 
growth in online bookings for our major markets. Overall, 
the share of sales generated through the web increased 
by another 3 per cent across the Group, meaning we now 
take 46 per cent of bookings online.
In Germany we grew web bookings by 21 per cent, in the UK 
by 27 per cent and in Scandinavia, by a further 7 per cent 
so that 81 per cent of sales are now made online. We have 
also made progress in mobile with 45 per cent of online 
bookings in the UK accounted for by mobile devices, split 
equally between mobile and tablet. 
As online grows we have further reshaped our retail 
network in the UK, introducing nine ‘Discovery stores’, 
larger stores in higher footfall areas, to broaden our reach 
as we continue to reduce the number of stores, which 
this year fell from 790 to 692 outlets. 
Our mobile companion app, now live in Germany, Northern 
Europe and the UK, has been downloaded 1.7 million 
times, strengthening the direct relationships with our 
customers, improving their holiday experience and 
generating increased sales of added services.
This focus on improved customer contact has increased 
direct distribution across the Group by one percentage 
point to 68 per cent.

RESHAPING OUR CONTACT 
WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE UK 
This year we’ve seen a big increase in 
mobile bookings from our UK customers, 
which now account for 45 per cent of 
online bookings, up from 40 per cent last 
year. It’s part of a clear shift in the way our 
customers research and book their holidays 
which has helped increase online bookings 
from 43 per cent of our Group sales to 
46 per cent this year.
We are adapting to this changing behaviour 
by investing in our websites and the way 
we attract customers online, and this 
year UK digital sales overall increased by a 
further 27 per cent on top of the 9 per cent 
growth we achieved in 2016. While we’re 
pleased with the progress we’re making, 
we also need to make sure we’re giving 
customers a seamless experience of 
Thomas Cook wherever they choose 
to interact with us – be that in person 
or online. 
It’s clear that our shops remain an 
important channel through which we can 
showcase the best of our holiday offering, 
as well as provide the expertise and 
reassurance that many customers value 
as part of their largest annual purchase. 
Our 2017 UK Holiday Report showed that 
two-thirds of customers still come into 
stores to speak to our experts before 
booking their holiday, while 47 per cent of 
our holidays are still booked in our shops.
At the start of this financial year we 
took two important steps to meet those 
changing customer needs. First, we took 
full control of our all our UK stores after 
announcing that we would buy the Co-op 
out of our retail joint venture, allowing us 
to move to one single Thomas Cook brand. 
Second, we took the decision to refocus 
our store network into two key formats 
to make sure we’re offering our customers 
the best of a 21st Century travel company; 
larger stores in higher footfall areas like 
shopping centres and retail parks, and 
smaller stores in traditional high street 
locations. Over the past 12 months, we’ve 
refurbished or rebranded 51 stores and 
closed 101 stores meaning we’ve now cut 
the size of our network by 45 per cent in 
the past five years to 692 stores, with 
many of the closures in areas where there 
was a geographic overlap between the 
Thomas Cook-branded shops and  
Co-operative Travel branded shops.
In this financial year we’ve increased 
revenue in the UK by three per cent, thanks 
in large part to the work we’ve done online. 
Despite closing 101 stores at a cost saving 
of £12 million, our retail sales have remained 
broadly flat. Crucially, we’ve increased the 
proportion of the holidays we sold through 
our own channels by a further 1.5 per cent 
to 83.5 per cent – evidence that we’ve 
improved contact with our customers 
whenever and wherever they need us.

 OUR HOLIDA YS
Of course, it is the quality and range of our holidays that 
determine the success of our business. We want Thomas Cook 
customers to trust us to provide a range of consistently  
high-quality hotels which provide excellent value for money. 
Our strategy is increasingly to focus our attention on a 
more streamlined portfolio of around 3,000 hotels by 2019. 
By focusing on a smaller number of properties, we can 
have a greater influence over the customer experience, 
enabling us to offer holidays that are unique to Thomas 
Cook with a level of care and quality that stands out from 
the competition. 
By focusing the majority of our business on a more 
streamlined portfolio, we are also selling more of the 
rooms in those hotels across more of our source markets. 
This means we are able to better leverage our scale and 
develop deeper relationships with the hoteliers, with 
holidays to these select partner hotels delivering higher 
than average selling prices and margin.
At the heart of this portfolio of hotels sit our own-brand 
hotels and resorts, which are franchised, managed or 
directly owned by Thomas Cook. These are complemented 
by our selected partner hotels, contracted directly and 
developed in partnership with hoteliers. 
In these hotels we seek to give customers elements 
of their holiday that are unique to Thomas Cook. 
These include our 24-hour hotel satisfaction promise; 
our on-the-ground resort teams and our connected 
services helplines; as well as a raft of measures that 
customers don’t see – from more frequent auditing for 
health and safety, to the work done by our team of quality 
managers to ensure that we are providing a standard of 
accommodation and service of which we can be proud.
We rigorously track the performance of every one of 
these hotels using customer feedback. If they fall short, 
we take them out of the portfolio.
OUR PROGRESS IN 2017 
We continued to innovate to improve the customer 
experience in our core portfolio of hotels in the past 
12 months. We expanded our 24-hour hotel satisfaction 
promise to cover 2,000 hotels, accounting for more than 
80 per cent of our sun & beach customers.
We further reduced the portfolio of directly-contracted 
hotels by 310 to 3,170 for summer 2018, marking good 
progress towards our target of 2,900 by FY19. At the 
same time, we increased sales to our own brand and 
selected partner hotels by eight per cent in the summer 
compared with 2016, reflecting the strong demand for 
our differentiated holiday offer.
We now share 42 per cent of our hotels across more 
than one of our source markets, compared with just 
seven per cent three years ago, improving the scale 
benefits we get in these hotels.

IN-DESTINATION SERVICES – 
HOTEL QUALITY TRACKING 
As part of our strategy to rigorously 
manage the quality of our select partner 
hotels, we track NPS scores at all stages 
of the holiday. This year we stepped up the 
resources and tools available to our hotel 
quality managers in destinations to help 
improve this process.
We want our quality managers to operate 
at the heart of the feedback loop between 
customers, our source markets and 
our hotels, to make sure we’re doing all 
that we can to continually improve our 
holiday offering.
The remit of our team of 49 quality 
managers is simple: to ensure all of the 
hotels in our core portfolio offer the 
best possible quality to our customers. 
This means working closely with our hotel 
partners to identify areas of improvement, 
based on customer feedback and our 
quality managers’ rich experience in the 
holiday industry. 
Our portfolio of services, which includes 
hotel training and consulting services, 
the Sunny Heart Academy of Excellence 
and online reputation management 
advice, means that the team is able to 
offer valuable support for hoteliers to 
improve overall standards for the benefit 
of all customers.
In 2017, the team undertook close to 
10,000 hotel visits, implemented more 
than 650 quality improvement plans and 
monitored over 800 hotel construction and 
refurbishment projects. 
We also saw the benefits of a new system 
introduced last summer to bring a more 
data-driven approach to the quality 
managers’ work. The Quality Tracking Tool is 
a web-based programme that compiles into 
one place all relevant hotel KPIs, including 
NPS, customer service questionnaires and 
online performance, as well as construction 
reports, quality manager visits and quality 
improvement plans. 
This gives us a comprehensive set of 
qualitative and quantitative measurements 
that help us to put the right plans in place 
to support underperforming hotels that 
want to improve, or make the difficult 
but necessary decision to terminate the 
contracts of those hotels that do not. 
The results have been clear – NPS has risen 
across the hotel portfolio and was a full five 
points above target in summer 2017 with a 
particular improvement in underperforming 
hotels. It has also made more clear where 
we need to terminate hotel contracts – 
as we did with 100 hotels from our UK 
portfolio at the start of the year – in order 
to maintain the quality and service that 
our customers expect from a Thomas 
Cook holiday.

 OWN-BRAND HOTELS & RESORTS
The development of a strong portfolio of own-brand hotels 
and resorts is critical to the success of our strategy for 
profitable growth. They enable us to provide customers with 
a consistent, high-quality and unique holiday, whatever their 
needs, and earn us higher returns than the portfolio average. 
Our aim is to build a hotel company within Thomas Cook 
with a community of hoteliers who want to work with 
our brands and loyal customers who follow the brands 
round the world. By building deeper and longer-lasting 
relationships with our own-brand hoteliers and taking 
more capacity at the hotels, we have greater influence 
over the service levels and quality standards. As a result, 
these hotels achieve higher customer satisfaction scores 
and higher loyalty than the portfolio average. We also 
earn additional revenues through management, incentive 
and franchise fees. Together with the brand value which 
these hotels command, we earn a higher margin for these 
hotels than others in our holiday offering.
OUR PROGRESS IN 2017
We made further progress in 2017 in strengthening our 
existing portfolio of own-brand hotels and developing 
a pipeline of new hotels. We continued to rigorously 
manage the quality in our hotels, taking a total of 19 
properties from the portfolio which did not meet the 
quality expectations we set. We opened 11 new hotels 
for summer 2017, including a new Sunprime hotel in 
Tenerife, our first Italian own-brand property, in Sicily, 
and the successful launch of our second Casa Cook in 
Kos. We have a further 20 hotels in the pipeline to open 
between winter 2017 and summer 2019. This includes at 
least another two Casa Cooks.
As the quality of our own-brand hotels improved, so we 
continued to drive a higher number of bookings to the 
portfolio. Sales to our own-brand hotels increased eight 
per cent in 2017. 
The arrival in the spring of our new Chief Hotels Officer, 
Ingo Burmester, formerly head of TUI’s Robinson hotel 
brand, brought welcome experience at the head of the 
team and provided an opportunity to reboot our approach 
in this part of the business. 
In September we took a significant step forward by 
agreeing a new strategic partnership with Swiss-based 
hotel property development company LMEY Investments. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Thomas Cook has 
acquired a seventh brand in the popular club-based 
sector with a 42 per cent stake in Aldiana, a premium club 
and activity-focused tour operator and hotel management 
company based in Germany.
In addition, the two companies have agreed to work 
together to create a joint hotel investment platform, 
in order to accelerate the growth of Thomas Cook’s 
own-brand hotels portfolio. The partners will contribute 
a minimum of five owned and directly-managed hotel 
properties between them, which will be used to develop 
the platform into a fund focused on acquiring a pipeline 
of further hotel and resort assets across Thomas Cook’s 
destination markets. 
In total, we closed the year with 190 own-brand hotels 
in the portfolio, including the eight Aldiana resorts 
which will come as part of the agreement we signed 
in September.

CASE STUDY
CASA COOK
KOS 
We introduced Casa Cook as a hotel brand 
in 2016 to fill a niche in the travel industry: 
boutique resorts that tick all the boxes 
for a growing generation of independent 
travellers, many of whom would not think 
to book a package holiday.
We wanted Casa Cook to be an eclectic 
collection of stylish modern resorts with a 
low-key vibe, each with its own personality 
inspired as much by the local surroundings 
as our interpretations of global travel trends 
and tastes. The pool, bar and restaurant form 
the social hub at each hotel, informed by the 
Greek concept of ‘Parea’ – roughly translated 
as a get-together with friends to nourish 
the body and mind. The staff are attentive 
yet discreet, guided by a service culture that 
encourages guests to determine their own 
holiday rhythm. This extends to the dining 
experience: healthy and made with regional 
products, food is served any time of day and 
well into the evening.
We opened our first Casa Cook in May 2016 in 
Rhodes, Greece. In just one season we knew 
we were spot-on with our concept. 
The feedback has been overwhelmingly 
positive and 90 per cent of our guests were 
new to Thomas Cook, proving that we have 
achieved our aim of attracting travellers who 
thought a holiday package wasn’t for them.
Our second Casa Cook in Kos posed a 
challenge – how to replicate the success of 
Rhodes and maintain consistency of brand 
while at the same time forging a unique 
identity at the new hotel. With a beautiful 
location on the north coast of Kos, nestled 
between the countryside and the soft, 
dune-backed beach, we knew we had the 
backdrop for a stunning addition to the Casa 
Cook hotel, and the greenfield site allowed 
us to be even bolder in our design to embed 
the Casa Cook ethos from the ground up.
Like Rhodes, the hotel’s pool, beach bar and 
restaurant are designed to bring guests 
together. The rooms themselves were all 
created as private sanctuaries, focusing on 
stylish simplicity, many with their own or 
shared pools. The result is a perfect balance 
of private and shared areas, akin to historic 
Greek villages and their labyrinth of cubist 
houses, designed to harmonise with the 
surrounding landscapes.
At the close of our first summer, we’re 
very happy with what we’ve achieved in 
Kos. The hotel ran at 95 per cent occupancy, 
showing how well our new brand has landed 
since we opened in Rhodes in May 2016, 
again with almost 75 per cent of customers 
new to Thomas Cook. Guests from across 
all of our source markets were attracted 
to our new Casa Cook, and we achieved 
a customer satisfaction score of 87 – a 
fantastic result for any hotel, let alone one in 
its first months of operation.
Next year we open our third Casa Cook 
in Chania, Crete – a pure family concept 
that is very different to what people 
might expect. In 2019 we go to Croatia where 
we’re putting the Casa Cook vision into 
a sixties-era hotel – our most exciting 
challenge yet. There’s no doubt we’ve got 
a big task to balance local individualism 
with our house style when we grow to four 
hotels, but if Casa Cook Kos is anything to 
go by, we’re on the right track.

 PROGRESS AGAINST STRATEGY
 OUR AIRLINE
The other key element of our holiday offering which is 
increasingly important to our strategy for profitable growth 
is our airline. Over the last four years, we have transformed 
our airline from four separate national airlines into one 
Group Airline under one management team, with shared 
maintenance, IT systems and infrastructure.
In parallel, we have expanded the proportion of business that 
the Airline does independent of the tour operator, building a 
world-class leisure airline which benefits from a dependable, 
and sizeable, base of Tour Operator customers, while also 
increasingly competitive with airlines across Europe on a 
seat-only basis. Thomas Cook Group Airline is now Europe’s 
third largest airline to sun & beach destinations, and its sixth 
largest long-haul carrier following strong profitable growth 
in our long-haul and seat-only programme.
Our strategy for the Airline is clear: to profitably build on our 
position in the European leisure airlines market, focused on 
four areas. 
First: we will invest in the customer experience to build on 
the progress we’ve made in the last few years, targeting 
the areas which we know matter most to our customers. 
Second; we will continue to open new routes, particularly 
in long haul. Third: we are leveraging the support that our 
tour operating business provides the Airline, whilst actively 
developing new distribution channels. This model helps us 
to flex capacity between the Tour Operator and Airline in 
order to optimise performance. And finally, we will continue 
to review our cost structure to ensure that we are operating 
as competitively as we can in a tough market environment, 
without compromising on safety. We have measures in place 
to further improve reliability and operational performance, 
as well as ensuring we have the right cost structure in the 
right locations. 
OUR PROGRESS IN 2017 
Overall, 2017 been a positive year for our Group Airline in 
what has been a very competitive market, and we have 
made good progress against all four of our strategic aims. 
We have added 15 new destinations across our three 
markets, including San Francisco, New Orleans and, closer 
to home, Malaga and Mykonos. Next year, we will begin flying 
from a new base in the UK – Leeds Bradford – expanding 
our reach in the North of England for our tour operator 
customers where previously we used third-party airlines.  
In total, we have grown the number of long haul 
routes we offer by 30 per cent in the last three years, 
supported by a good long-haul cost base and our strong 
distribution channels.
We have improved our distribution channels by working 
more closely with third-party tour operators, and online and 
traditional travel agents. We’ve also increased seat-only 
sales by improving our website and increasing the number 
of interline agreements we hold with other long-haul airlines. 
This, together with our expanded route capacity, has meant 
we have grown seat-only sales by 16 per cent versus 2016.
We are now benefiting from our new, Group-wide commercial 
IT system, which for the first time enables us to sell all 
ancillaries through industry global distribution systems and 
to take code-share bookings from third-party airline partners 
with the aim of driving significant revenue growth.
As part of our drive for greater efficiencies while opening up 
new opportunities for growth, in May we agreed to extend 
an existing partnership with Brussels Airlines to make them 
the leading carrier for Thomas Cook in Belgium. Under the 
terms of the agreement, we transferred all 160 pilots and 
cabin crew, all flight slots and two aircraft from Thomas Cook 
Airlines Belgium to Brussels Airlines. We also sold our ground 
operations and Airline Operating Certificate to SHS Aviation. 
The agreement gives Thomas Cook’s customers a wider 
choice of destinations, flights and departure days while at the 
same time enabling us to manage our aircraft and personnel 
more efficiently and effectively.
We followed the partnership in Belgium by agreeing a 
partnership in September with Canadian airline Air Transat, 
under which the two companies will exchange aircraft on 
a seasonal basis. This takes advantage of the different 
seasonality of the leisure market in each country, and is a 
further step in our strategy to work with partners in order to 
manage our fleet more efficiently.
Finally, in October 2017 we launched a new airline based in 
Majorca which will give us a greater degree of operational 
flexibility in how we share aircraft across our Group Airline. 
Our plan is to focus any future growth in our fleet through 
this operating unit, allowing us to deploy aircraft to our three 
airlines in the UK, Germany and Scandinavia at a competitive 
cost, based upon seasonal and operational requirements. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 27
STRATEGIC REPORT

US
LONG-HAUL GROWTH 
We’ve transformed the choice we offer 
customers over long haul in recent 
years, expanding the fleet and opening 
up new routes. In Germany for example 
we expanded our long-haul fleet from 
eight to 18 aircraft in the last three 
years and more than doubled the fleet 
in the UK to eight long-haul aircraft plus 
incremental peak capacity transferred 
from Scandinavia. We’ve had a particular 
focus on transatlantic routes, reflected 
in the fact that more than one million 
passengers flew across the North Atlantic 
with Thomas Cook during last year’s winter 
and summer season. 
In the same period, we introduced 11 new 
US destinations and we have more routes 
planned, including flights to Phoenix from 
Germany and Seattle from the UK which 
start in early 2018. 
With a total of 18 US destinations on offer 
across the Group – three of which we 
now fly year-round – and five in Canada, 
we’re making excellent progress with our 
strategy to grow our long-haul network. 
As a carrier that generally focuses on 
leisure destinations, we, of course, look for 
cities that might have interest from within 
the German, UK and greater European 
outbound tourist market. However, we also 
are winning business in corporate markets. 
That is particularly evident to us on our 
successful nonstop route from Frankfurt 
to Seattle, where the frequency of our 
flights provide the flexibility that business 
travellers need. 
These customers consistently tell us 
how great the quality and value is on our 
business class offer which is reaching load 
factors clearly above 80 per cent across our 
entire long-haul network. 
Offering a wide range of quality options 
to our customers allows them to make 
the smart choices whenever they fly, and 
allows us to further develop and grow our 
long-haul business.

 SERVICES
The additional services we offer our customers as part of 
their holiday, through our direct sales channels, our Airline 
and our in-destination teams, are a big part of what makes 
us different from travel agents and other tour operators. 
By offering more choice to our customers in all aspects 
of their holiday, we can provide a unique holiday 
experience that is tailored specifically to our customers’ 
individual needs. 
This more personalised experience increases customer 
satisfaction and loyalty at the same time as delivering 
additional revenue and margin from the services 
that are purchased. The more personalised approach 
also enables us to combine some of the flexibility of 
independent travel with the hassle-free reassurance 
of a package holiday, thus modernising our offer and 
broadening our appeal to those who may not previously 
have considered a Thomas Cook holiday. 
OUR PROGRESS IN 2017
This year we have further increased revenues from our 
core ancillary services, as well as broadening the range 
of value-add holiday extras that we offer customers. 
Overall, we grew sales of ancillary services, such as 
seat reservations, extra luggage, meals on board, travel 
insurance and in-resort transfers and excursions, by 10 
per cent, a total increase of 20 per cent in the two years 
since we created the Group Ancillaries Team in 2015. 
The improvements we made to our websites this year in 
providing richer content have helped improve conversion 
of sales. As we optimise how and when we offer these 
services to customers, from the point of booking to 
in-resort, we help to build customers’ excitement as they 
plan their perfect holiday, while increasing penetration 
of our services and gaining a greater share of wallet.
This year also saw the launch of a new division which 
builds on our heritage in financial services to offer 
customers across our source markets new ways to plan, 
save, borrow, spend and protect their holiday money. 
Led by Anth Mooney, the former head of financial services 
at Virgin Money, Thomas Cook Money will combine the 
trust that consumers have in the Thomas Cook brands 
with the best of new technology in order to offer a 
genuinely innovative set of new products and services.

 PARTNERSHIPS
This strategy is complemented by a series of partnerships 
which enable us to expand our offer to customers 
while at the same time streamlining our operations. 
Our partnerships also enable us to leverage our brand 
as a way to tap into new opportunities for growth. 
PROGRESS IN 2017
In September, we agreed a ground-breaking strategic 
alliance with Expedia which will transform the way in 
which we produce and sell our ‘complementary’ hotels 
which sit outside of our core portfolio. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Expedia will 
become the preferred provider of hotels for our city 
and domestic business, offering customers more than 
60,000 additional hotels in city and domestic locations 
than currently on sale.
We will also integrate Expedia’s market-leading booking 
platform into Thomas Cook sales channels for all hotel-
only and city-break sales. This agreement completes 
the outsourcing of the production of our non-core 
hotel offer to customers, following the signing of our 
strategic partnership with Webjet in 2016 to outsource 
our non-core sun and beach hotels.
Another partnership where we have made good progress 
in 2017 is Thomas Cook China, our joint venture with 
Fosun. This has got off to a great start, tapping into 
the growing demand from Chinese consumers for 
personalised holiday packages to destinations around the 
world. It’s early days, but we took 20,000 customers on 
holiday in our first year of operations. Our aim is to grow 
this more than 10 times in 2017/18. 
CASE STUDY
THOMAS COOK  
CHINA
We officially launched Thomas Cook China 
in September 2016, less than a year after 
we announced our joint venture with 
Fosun. Since then, the business has 
developed into a one-stop, full service travel 
company operating inbound, domestic and 
outbound tourism from offices in Shanghai 
and Beijing. 
Our plan has always been simple – combine 
our brand heritage and travel expertise 
with Fosun’s local market access and 
knowledge to tap in to the huge growth 
opportunity offered by the world’s largest 
source market for leisure travel.
While large and fast growing, the China 
travel market is also very competitive 
and fragmented. The biggest opportunity 
lies in the rapidly evolving behaviours of 
Chinese travellers. The traditional group 
tour travel is gradually giving way to a 
more independent and higher quality type 
of travel, and the industry is not keeping 
up with the pace of this change. At Thomas 
Cook China, we have focused on developing 
products that are truly unique and 
differentiated, leveraging Thomas Cook and 
Fosun’s resources across destinations. 
In our first year of operations we served over 
20,000 customers. Recent improvements 
in technology and newly established local 
distribution partnerships have made the 
business more scalable. Over the next 
financial year, we aim to grow by more 
than 10 times. 
Both Thomas Cook and Fosun remain 
fully committed to supporting the future 
growth of our joint venture business in 
China. The ambition is to make China a 
sizeable source market for Thomas Cook 
Group, comparable, over time, with our 
more mature markets in Europe. As China’s 
tourism sector continues to grow strongly, 
our expertise in travel and our unique, 
personalised offer means we are well-
positioned to take full advantage of 
the opportunity.
As we focus on our holiday offer, we are 
putting our energy and attention into a 
number of key areas where we can create 
the most value for our customers.

 EFFICIENCIES
Underpinning every element of our strategy for profitable 
growth is a continual drive for greater operational 
efficiency, removing duplication and aligning processes 
so that they fit the new shape of Thomas Cook. 
By reducing the number of hotels in our core holiday 
offering, and outsourcing the production of our non-core 
hotels and the technology platform to sell them, we 
will be able to take considerable cost and complexity 
out of our business – first, in terms of the contracting, 
pricing and other support that we need, and then 
through our IT systems which will support the sale 
of a smaller number of hotels. 
These efficiencies also flow through into our marketing 
and digital activities where we are able to focus 
investment building content to support one streamlined 
portfolio of hotels across the Group. And this is key – 
reducing duplication and complexity in our systems 
Group-wide will enable us to increase investment in those 
areas where we know we can make greatest impact on 
customers and how they buy from us. 
The result is a business which is much simpler, with a 
leaner organisational structure that is more focused on 
the activities which matter to our customers.
OUR PROGRESS IN 2017
Continuing our efficiencies drive in Continental Europe, 
we consolidated our tour operator activities into three 
hubs for the segment: in Oberursel, Ghent and Hamburg.
We accelerated our UK store closure programme following 
our announcement at the start of the financial year that 
our retail joint venture with the Cooperative Group would 
end. In all we closed 101 stores this financial year, taking 
our retail network to 692, down from more than 1,200 
in 2012. 
 See case study in Contact on page 21
We have made good progress through procurement 
activities to reduce our spend by rationalising the number 
of suppliers we use across the Group to better leverage 
our scale. 
Our financial shared service centre has made good 
progress this year and now houses financial functions 
from across the Group. 
 See case study on page 31
In our airline, we have now saved £35 million against 
a 2015 baseline through rationalisation of our ground 
handling and maintenance set-ups across our destination 
and source markets airports. 
In March we announced that we would be extending 
our partnership with Brussel Airlines to make them 
the leading carrier for our Belgian tour operator, with 
Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium (TCAB) no longer operating. 
The agreement reduces our operating costs in our Belgian 
market while increasing choice for customers. In addition, 
three of our TCAB aircraft will operate under our new 
airline in Palma from summer 2018.

FINANCIAL SHARED  
SERVICE CENTRE 
IN PALMA
We knew there was an opportunity to 
bring our finance shared service centres 
together from across the Group in a way 
which would not only significantly reduce 
cost but would also mean we can provide 
a greater consistency of quality to all 
parts of the business. 
More importantly, one central financial 
shared service centre would also allow 
us to create a working environment 
that encourages the simplification and 
standardisation of processes so critical 
to our vision of ‘One Thomas Cook’.
We chose Palma as a target location when 
we first set up the finance transformation 
project because of its central location 
within Europe and an abundance of skilled 
professionals from universities in Palma 
and mainland Spain. It is also the Group’s 
most popular holiday destination, meaning 
we had a sizeable existing presence 
and infrastructure on which to build. 
In 2014 we started to move finance 
functions from across our Continental 
business source markets into Palma. 
By September this year the Palma 
centre was providing finance services to 
Germany, France, Belgium, The Netherlands 
and Austria.
Phase two of the shared service centre 
is now well underway. We are in-sourcing 
those of the UK’s finance functions which 
are currently run from Mumbai and Pune, 
India, to give us greater control over the 
quality of the output. We also have further 
plans to expand the existing services by 
moving further functions from within 
Continental Europe, the UK, our Northern 
Europe business and Group Airline into 
Palma. Our aim is that these measures will 
foster a culture of greater collaboration and 
best practice across the Group, meaning it 
will become more efficient as it grows. 
To accommodate this growth we’re 
moving into a new building and by 
September 2018 we expect to have one 
Finance Shared Service Centre in Palma 
providing services to all segments in 
the Group, staffed by Thomas Cook 
colleagues, with our shared vision and 
values, working to put the customer 
at the heart of everything we do.

the underlying EBIT generated as a proportion of 
sales. We target improving these metrics across all 
our businesses. 
2017 performance
Group underlying EBIT of £330m and underlying 
EBIT margin of 3.7% represents growth of £24m due

overall loyalty and satisfaction in relation to our 
flights, our hotels and the holiday experience overall. 
We are targeting NPS increases in all of our source

main indexes, being our ‘Core-index’ and ‘commitment-index. 
Our target is to at least maintain our high core-index score 
and increase our commitment index score.
2017 performance
Our core index and commitment index was 74% and 68% 
respectively, level with 2016. The strongest progress this 
year was seen in customer orientation, driven by the launch 
of the Customer promises and values which has driven 
more customer centricity. The results also told us that the 
strategy and direction of the Company is more clear among 
all managers – a foundation for driving the new strategy. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 33

SUSTAINABILITY
 OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY
Over the last year, we conducted an internal review of our 
sustainability programmes and have developed a renewed 
vision and strategy for sustainability which is integral to 
our business strategy. Through this renewed vision and 
strategy, we can enhance the Company’s resilience to 
the external environmental and social challenges while 
improving the experience of our customers.
OUR ‘MAKING A DIFFERENCE WITH 
EVERY HOLIDAY’ STRATEGY
Our goal is to ‘make a difference with every holiday’, 
working at every step to change the way we operate to 
limit environmental impacts whilst maximising the social 
and economic benefits travel can bring.
Our new strategy is simplified and stronger than 
previous iterations. It reflects three key stages of the 
customer journey;
 >At Home
 > On the Journey
 > On Holiday
Each of these areas aligns to the three core concepts of 
sustainability: people, environment and business. For each 
one of the three areas of the customer journey, our new 
strategy articulates our objective as well as a simple but 
bold target to be achieved by 2020.
AT HOME
We understand Thomas Cook’s operations affect individuals 
and communities around the world. Through working with 
our partners, NGOs and other industry tourism groups we 
can better understand and mitigate the negative impact of 
the business, whilst maximising the economic and social 
benefits tourism can bring. 
The key strand of our work ‘at home’ focuses on our impact 
as a business through our charitable and community 
initiatives, while ensuring we have the right policies 
and procedures in place to make sure we contribute 
meaningfully to the communities in which we live and work. 
In order to materially impact the lives of 100,000 people by 
2020, we have taken strong steps to strengthen our impact 
through greater alignment on charitable activity across 
Thomas Cook Group. 
The Group’s Health, Safety & Environmental Committee 
this year endorsed an over-arching charitable strategy for 
the Group. This strategy, a first for Thomas Cook, aligns our 
charitable activity across our source markets and focuses 
our impact in key areas, including improving health and 
well-being, supporting vulnerable children, providing natural 
disaster relief and enhancing community spaces. We aim to 
make transformational impact through our charitable work. 
Greater alignment means we can focus on fewer, more 
relevant issues, whilst leveraging the scale of the business 
to create lasting change for thousands of people at home 
and in our destinations.
The millions of customers that choose Thomas Cook for 
their holiday have high expectations of us and the services 
that we provide them. We understand that sustainability 
is extremely important for our customers and critical to 
the long-term success of our business.

SAFEGUARDING  
ANIMAL WELFARE
Experiencing the local environment and 
wildlife-viewing opportunities can be a 
key part of many of our customers’ holiday 
experiences. We recognise that these 
activities have a socio-economic benefit 
and can help to promote biodiversity and 
education initiatives. However, we also are 
acutely aware of the welfare of animals 
impacted by tourism. 
Last year we took the decision to 
commission animal welfare experts Global 
Spirit to conduct an independent audit of 
a selection of animal attractions we offer. 
Following that initial review we set out 
our new animal welfare policy in December  
2016. At its heart is a simple premise – our 
customers trust us to make sure anything 
we recommend to them is consistent  
with our Customer Promises of Quality, 
Service and Reliability. 
From that premise came a simple rule 
– if an animal attraction is found not to 
be fully compliant with the ABTA Global 
Welfare Guidance for Animals in Tourism, 
Thomas Cook won’t sell it.
We are determined to improve standards 
for all animals in our supply chain, while 
allowing our customers to enjoy and learn 
about animals in their natural environments. 
We remain committed to working 
responsibly and ethically in all areas of our 
business, and we expect the same from 
our suppliers.
To that end, we have already stopped the 
sale of 16 of 25 audited excursions following 
the 2016 audit programme. We have 
expanded our 2017 audit programme, 
with a further 50 audits underway.

STRATEGIC REPORT
ON THE JOURNEY
The environmental impact of the travel industry is 
considerable, with around five per cent of all global 
carbon emissions coming from the travel and tourism 
sector. We recognised the risks presented by climate 
change and our duty to reduce our impact. 
We have for a number of years worked to reduce our 
environmental impact across our business and supply 
chain. This includes reducing the use of water in our 
hotels, using sustainable products and materials wherever 
possible; reducing our production of waste; and sourcing 
or producing renewable energy.
Our new strategy has environmental efficiency at its heart. 
We are committed to making  progress across our business 
to decrease our impact. This is demonstrated through 
our annual response to CDP who assess our response to 
carbon management. In 2016 we scored ‘B’, which means 
we are taking coordinated action on climate change issues. 
Fuel efficiency in our airline is central to this effort and 
is a key part of our approach to running efficient and 
profitable airlines, as demonstrated through our target 
of a 12 per cent increase in fuel efficiency per passenger 
km by 2020 (based on a 2011 baseline). We recognise the 
challenge presented by the Paris Climate Agreement to the 
airline industry and we are determined to drive incremental 
improvements in our current fleet, while working with 
the industry to develop more efficient aircraft and more 
sustainable fuels.
Thomas Cook Group Airline is among the most efficient 
in Europe, with only 72.4g CO 2 per passenger kilometre, 
compared with an average of 88.6g CO 2 for the five largest 
European airlines last year. Our German airline was ranked 
ninth in the Charter Carrier sector by the 2016 Atmosfair 
Airline Index, which ranks the carbon efficiency of the 
200 largest airlines in the world. 
In 2017 we brought together a group across the Airline 
to focus on fuel efficiency. Seven key projects were 
selected, including a continued drive to reduce weight 
on board, improve flight planning processes and optimise 
routing. Our upgraded aircraft continue to deliver greater 
comfort and a superior experience for passengers, whilst 
contributing toward improved efficiency.

emission factors from the UK Government GHG Conversion

ON HOLIDAY
Tourism is one of the biggest industries in the world and 
one that contributes to the economic and social fabric of 
destination communities. We work extensively with our 
hotel brands to enable our customers to experience local 
products and services, giving them an authentic taste 
of the local culture. 
By 2020, we aim to have all of our own-brand hotels 
accredited by Travelife, the internationally-recognised 
scheme which helps hotels and accommodations to manage 
and improve their social and environmental performance. 
The scheme also ensures that staff in resort are employed 
fairly and local sourcing of products is promoted. We know 
that Travelife hotels are not only better for us, but they are 
better for our customers too, with greater results recorded 
in customer satisfaction surveys than our other hotels. 
Over the last year we have taken strong steps to embed 
Travelife within our Hotels and Resorts business. This has 
included integrating Travelife as a brand standard in our 
Casa Cook, Sunwing, Sunprime and SENTIDO brands, with 
Smartline and Sunconnect brands to follow in 2018 and 2019.
Four years ago we launched range of excursions to allow 
customers to immerse themselves in the culture of a 
destination and create lasting memories. These ‘Local Label’ 
excursions are designed to bring a place, its people and 
their traditions to life; celebrating authentic food and drink, 
sharing personal stories with local people, and contributing 
to the protection of ancient sites or natural habitats.  STRATEGIC REPORT

TUNISIA 
EDUCATION PROGRAMME 
Tourism is a hugely important industry in 
Tunisia, but one which suffered in recent 
years. It is essential that following this 
tough period for the tourism industry, 
skills are retained and quality is improved 
for customers. A key challenge is finding 
good-quality staff who are able to deliver 
high-quality service while promoting 
sustainability within our hotels.
This innovative programme consists of 
two strands, focusing on further education 
and training.
The ‘Continuing Education’ project, which 
runs from September 2017 to the end of 
2018, will focus on the re-qualification and 
training of hotel staff in order to increase 
service quality and sustainability.
At the same time, Thomas Cook and 
Futouris e.V, together with the Gesellschaft 
für Internationale Zusammenarbeit Gmbh, 
the German Association for International 
Cooperation (GIZ) , have launched a new 
partnership. The aim is to improve the 
training for the hotel staff in Tunisian 
hotel schools and hotels through greater 
experiential learning. 
The pilot project will run for three years 
and is part of the develoPPP.de programme 
that GIZ implements on behalf of the 
German Federal Ministry for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (BMZ).
The two strands of the programme will 
enable the training and mentoring of 
employees in the Tunisian hotels, enabling 
them to access better quality employment 
and delivering a more sustainable, higher-
quality experience for our customers.

 OUR PEOPLE
We recognise that strong leadership and the development 
of a highly engaged and committed workforce is critical to 
achieve our profitable growth strategy and continue the 
transformation of our organisation. We are particularly 
pleased therefore that our employee engagement score 
increased by 1 per cent to 77 per cent in our annual 
engagement survey this year. We believe this reflects the 
efforts we have made to bring our strategy to life for our 
people and inspire strong belief in our new organisational 
values, which form the basis of our drive to put the 
customer at the heart of all that we do.
COMMUNICATION
We know that great internal communications is key to 
breaking down silos and building awareness and belief in 
our strategy. This year has seen a re-energised approach 
to communication with the introduction of new global 
townhalls giving Peter Fankhauser the opportunity to 
speak to thousands of our people, increasing his visibility 
and reach to record numbers.
In May, we held our annual briefing for the top 170 leaders 
in the Thomas Cook Leadership Council (‘TCLC’) in Tenerife. 
With many of our leaders now working in a horizontal 
or matrix structure, we can see stronger connections 
across the TCLC, with several subjects at the Tenerife 
event ‘co-presented’ by teams from across the Group.
CULTURE AND WAYS OF WORKING
With a continued focus on our ‘Customer at our Heart’ 
mantra, we felt the time was right in 2017 to make a bold 
next step in redefining our culture and place the customer 
even more firmly at the centre of our organisation. 
Our strategy towards recruiting, training, 
developing, retaining and inspiring our 
workforce is critical to our success.
We decided to move away from traditional corporate 
values, and instead, to develop and launch a new set of 
values and behaviours that truly reflect a holiday company. 
To this end, we took the unconventional approach of 
developing a set of values and customer promises from 
research into what our customers told us they want from 
a holiday company. Our new values help our people to 
understand what we expect from them in their behaviour, 
both towards each other and our customers. 
Since launch in January, 21,255 colleagues across the Group 
have attended training workshops on the new Customer 
Promises and Values. Our annual survey showed that 80 per 
cent of our people understand the new values, 2 per cent 
more than last year, and 73 per cent of our people believe 
they are the right values for us to succeed. We continue 
to embed our new behaviours by using them to recruit, 
develop, measure performance and reward our people.
The new values and behaviours were introduced as criteria 
for our Customer Heroes recognition programme, which we 
continued this year. Nominated by colleagues or managers, 
we identify customer heroes in each market and hold local 
recognition events to celebrate the finalists. The winners 
are then recognised at the TCLC.
Our annual survey has shown that work to develop a more 
customer-focused culture is having an impact. There was 
a significant increase in customer orientation with 83 
per cent of our people indicating that an awareness of 
customer feedback drives their improvements.
We also launched a new version of our Code of Conduct in 
May to reflect changes to our values and ways of working. 
The revised Code of Conduct is provided to all new joiners 
and we held briefings for existing colleagues in 2017, 
emphasising the importance of individual responsibility 
to adhere to the values at all times.

ALIGNMENT OF OUR PEOPLE BEHIND  
THE STRATEGY
Reflecting the need to align our people behind 
the Group strategy, our Group-wide performance 
management system is organised into key themes 
from the strategy so that all colleagues can select 
from a range of measures designed to achieve our 
organisational goals.
Our annual Every Voice engagement survey showed 
that awareness of strategy rose 2 per cent this year 
to 68 per cent. 
Building an efficient organisational structure is a 
key strategic objective and we are working across 
the Group to better align structures. Our organisational 
design review includes a focus on reducing layers 
between the CEO and our front line colleagues, and 
increasing spans of control – creating larger teams 
with fewer managers. The aim is to increase speed 
of decision making and empower teams to take action 
for the benefit of our customers. 
We have also further developed our matrix structure 
to bring the operations closer to the horizontal 
functions. This has seen us split our two key horizontals 
(Commercial and Digital & Marketing) across the UK, 
Northern Europe and Continental Europe. This ensures 
that our leaders think ‘Group’ at the same time as 
their local markets, streamlining the organisation 
and accelerating the next phase of our strategy for 
profitable growth.

PEOPLE/TALENT DEVELOPMENT
We strengthened our Group-wide talent management 
processes this year, culminating in our annual talent 
review with the PLC Board in July.
Introducing a newly updated definition of ‘potential’, 
we have reviewed all our leaders’ performance to 
identify those we regard as ‘high potential’ and reviewed 
succession for all roles across the TCLC. 70 per cent of 
our leaders were rated as ‘key talent’, up from 61 per cent 
the previous year, while 69 per cent of our TCLC have 
an identified successor.
We welcomed two new members to the Executive 
Committee (previously General Management Council) 
in the year: Ingo Burmester as Chief Hotels Officer, 
and Anth Mooney as our new Chief Financial Services 
Officer, leading Thomas Cook Money. Tenure across 
the TCLC, those reporting to the Executive Committee, 
increased, with the number of leaders with less than one 
year’s tenure reducing from 45 per cent to 31 per cent. 
Attrition across the TCLC was 14 per cent.
There were 30 new appointments into the TCLC, of which 
20 were internal promotions, demonstrating that our 
talent processes are working. We have also moved key 
high potential leaders into our two new businesses in 
China and Thomas Cook Money, aligning talent with our 
strategic priorities. 
In June, we launched our first global career site, aimed 
at encouraging international movement and retaining our 
talent. Within the first three months, the site had received 
over 120,000 visits and 16,000 registrations. 
We launched a new Group-wide Leadership Development 
programme, Leadership Plus, for our middle managers, 
department heads and local Directors, recognising the 
influence this group has on overall engagement.
Leadership Plus addresses three main areas:
 > Influencing without authority (reflecting the growth 
of matrix structures)
 > Authentic leadership 
 > Building highly effective teams
40 leaders attended the pilot programme with excellent 
feedback. A further 45 leaders started the programme in 
October, with further programmes planned for 2018. 
In addition, leaders from across our In-Destination 
teams attended a new Leadership programme aimed at 
addressing the challenges of leading virtual teams and 
building high performance.
Our Navigator programme, our Group-wide emerging 
talent programme, successfully concluded in February, 
with presentations to the Executive Committee from 
18 leaders.  THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 39
STRATEGIC REPORT
DIVERSITY 
Our vision to be the world’s most loved holiday company 
is supported by an internationally diverse workforce. 
We believe that improving our diversity will open up new 
ways of thinking, get us closer to our customers and drive 
profitable growth. We are committed to creating an inclusive 
working environment in which every employee is able to 
fulfil their potential through training, career development 
and fair promotion, regardless of personal characteristics. 
Gender diversity has been a particular focus area for us 
in 2017. We introduced ‘balanced’ gender shortlists for 
the first time, for leadership roles, ensuring a fair and 
consistent selection of males and females. In the UK, 
we ran our second Women’s sponsorship programme for 
high potential females, while in Germany, we introduced 
a family centre in our Head Office in Oberusel, to support 
working parents in their child care.
Our international diversity across our Leadership Team is 
strong, with 18 nationalities represented, the largest of which 
are British at 37 per cent, German at 28 per cent and Swedish 
at 9 per cent. We are working to create a new international 
mobility framework, designed to encourage the movement 
of colleagues across different countries and markets.
Ethnicity is also an increasing subject of focus. We aim to 
establish an organisational benchmark in 2018 and establish 
a framework of activity based on the results. We remain 
committed to a fully diverse workforce which represents 
the wide range of ethnicities from both our customer base 
and the countries and destinations in which we operate.
EVERY VOICE – ENGAGEMENT
Our annual ‘Every Voice’ colleague survey is at the 
heart of our people strategy. The 5th annual Group-wide 
survey was completed by just over 19,013 colleagues, 
representing a response rate of 78 per cent, something 
we attribute to the fact that 75 per cent of our people 
said that they had seen positive actions taken based 
on results of our last survey. 
Our ‘Core Index’ – an indication of a highly performing 
organisation – was 74 per cent, level with 2016, and 
our engagement index rose by 1 per cent to 77 per cent.
Customer orientation was at 83 per cent, seeing 
the highest increase of all areas of our survey. 
This is particularly pleasing, given our ‘Customer 
at our heart’ focus.
Our employee commitment remains high at 70 per 
cent, and we saw a 2 per cent increase in colleagues 
recommending Thomas Cook as an employer.
Each team builds an action plan off the back of their 
results, culminating in one overall plan for the Group. 
Action plans are reviewed closely by the Executive 
Committee to understand progress and ensure 
momentum is maintained.

OVERVIEW
The comments below are based on underlying like-for-like 
comparisons unless otherwise stated, as Management believes 
this provides a clearer view of Group’s year-on-year progression.
The Group made good financial progress in FY17, reporting higher 
revenues, higher underlying EBIT and lower net debt, compared 
to last year. Group revenue increased by 15% (£1,197 million) on a 
headline basis (before adjusting for the positive benefits of foreign 
exchange translation differences), and by 9% (£722 million) on a 
like-for-like basis, as demand grew for our holidays, particularly to 
Greece and Long-Haul destinations, as well as Turkey and Egypt. 
Supported by our strong revenue growth, gross profit increased 
by £56 million, although gross margin decreased by 130 basis 
points to 22.1%, mainly reflecting a more competitive market in 
holidays to Spain, and a mix effect from higher sales in our Russian 
business which has a structurally lower gross margin than our 
other businesses. 
The Group’s underlying EBIT improved by £24 million to £330 million, 
while the Group’s profit from operations improved by £30 million to 
£231 million, due to lower EBIT Separately Disclosed Items.
Separately disclosed finance charges increased by £18 million to 
£41 million due to costs associated with our bond refinancing in 
December 2016. As a result, Group profit before tax increased by 
£8 million to £46 million. The tax charge for the year was £34 million, 
£1 million higher than last year, resulting in Group profit after tax 
of £12 million. 
Free cash flow for the year was £153 million, £93 million higher 
than last year, underpinned by growth in EBITDA of £46 million to 
£552 million, and improvements in working capital as a result of 
stronger trading. The Group’s improved cash flow position, together 
with non-cash changes such as foreign currency translation, 
resulted in net debt of £40 million, £122 million lower on a like-for-like 
basis than the position as at 30 September 2016. STRATEGIC REPORT

PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHICAL MARKET
As the Group’s Tour Operator and Airline activities are integrated

REVENUE 
Group revenue increased by £722 million (9%) to £9,007 million, as 
we expanded our Winter and Summer programmes to meet growing 
customer demand. This resulted in higher revenue from holidays and 
flights to Greece, Spain, and Long Haul destinations, as well other 
Short and Medium haul destinations including Turkey and Egypt.

GROSS PROFIT AND MARGIN 
Gross profit increased by £56 million to £1,995 million, supported by 
strong revenue growth. Gross margin of 22.1% is 130 basis points 
lower than last year, mainly reflecting the impact of bed cost 
inflation on holidays to Spain, particularly in our UK business, and 
the mix effect in Continental Europe of strong growth in our Russian 
business, which has a lower relative gross margin. Our Airline gross 
margin was broadly in line with last year, with short-haul yield 
pressure during Winter offset by the Condor turnaround during 
Summer. The impact on the Group’s gross margin performance by 
segment is set out below.

OPERATING EXPENSES/OVERHEADS 
Operating expenses before depreciation increased by 2% (£28 million) 
to £1,443 million as the benefits of efficiency initiatives were offset 
by inflation and volume-related increases to the operating cost 
base. Depreciation increased by £4 million to £222 million reflecting 
investment in our aircraft fleet and IT enhancements.

The market for overseas holidays experienced a resurgence in 
demand in FY17, following a more muted demand environment 
in FY16 due to geopolitical disruption. Against this backdrop, our 
Group Tour Operator business increased revenues by £476 million 
(7%) to £7,122 million, reflecting growth in both customer numbers 
and average selling prices across most of our source markets, 
particularly in Continental Europe. Supported by both strong 
demand and a continued focus on efficiencies, Continental Europe 
grew underlying EBIT significantly, while Northern Europe further 
increased profits on top of a strong performance last year. This was 
offset by lower margins in our UK business, and as a result Group 
Tour Operator underlying EBIT declined by £5 million to £250 million.
The underlying EBIT for our Group Tour Operator, split by source 
market, is set out below.

UK
Having traded strongly in the first half, our UK Tour Operator 
experienced challenging conditions in the second half of the 
year, as highlighted in previous announcements. A combination of 
hotel price inflation, weaker Sterling and increased air capacity 
made the market for holidays to Spain more competitive than 
in previous years, putting pressure on input costs and selling 
prices. The business also absorbed the costs of rising fraudulent 
illness claims during the year, and of supporting 10,000 customers 
caught up in Hurricane Irma. As a result, while revenue grew by 
3%, underlying EBIT declined by £34 million compared to the strong 
result reported last year.
In response, our UK Tour Operator has implemented a set of actions 
to improve profitability. We have taken a robust approach towards 
illness claims including improving our handling and assessment 
processes, and taking legal action against fraudsters – as a result, 
the claim rate has declined dramatically. We are also rebalancing our 
destination mix towards more profitable, fast-growing destinations 
such as Turkey and Egypt, and we are continuing to drive 
operating efficiencies.
In addition, we are continuing to reposition the business. In FY17 web 
bookings grew by more than 25% and we closed over 100 stores, in 
order to accelerate the shift towards online distribution. We also 
grew sales of differentiated holidays, by 16% for holidays to own-
brand hotels, and by 8% for sales to selected partner hotels, in order 
to improve our competitive positioning. Together, we expect that 
these actions will help to return the business to its former profitable 
growth trajectory.  STRATEGIC REPORT
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 46
Continental Europe
Our Continental Europe tour operating business achieved a 
significantly improved performance in FY17, with revenues up 
9%. Stronger demand for our holidays, coupled with a continuing 
efficiencies programme, helped to increase EBIT by £25 million (35%) 
to £96 million.
In Germany, we maintained our market share in a highly competitive 
marketplace, growing revenues by 7%. Underlying EBIT increased 
by £13 million (29%) to £58 million, helped by business improvement 
initiatives, including expanding our online bookings by 22%, growing 
sales of holidays to own-brand hotels by 9%, expanding our 
relationships with distribution partners, and restructuring our back 
office functions.
Most of our other businesses in Continental Europe also experienced 
good demand growth and achieved higher EBIT. Sales in our Russian 
business more than doubled, amid a resurgence in demand for 
outbound holidays as Russian tourists returned to Turkey following 
a travel ban in the previous year. Our businesses in Eastern Europe 
also performed strongly during the year. 
Northern Europe
Our Northern Europe business reported revenue growth of 
7%, reflecting further expansion in our own-brand hotel range. 
Trading over the Summer period was notably stronger, after a 
Winter performance that was in line with the previous year, as 
we expanded sales of both classic package holidays and dynamic 
packages. As a result, underlying EBIT grew by a further £4 million 
to £102 million, further building on a very strong year last year. 
During the year, the business further strengthened its customer 
proposition, achieving the highest net promoter score in the 
Group of 51, up 7 points compared to FY16. We continue to refine 
and streamline the cost structures within the four Nordic source 
markets and to leverage the competitive strengths of our integrated 
business model.

Our Group Airline revenue increased by £272 million (9%) to 
£3,185 million on a like-for-like basis, driven by further expansion 
of our long-haul business from UK and Germany. In particular, our 
long-haul performance was driven by seat-only growth to new 
destinations including New Orleans, San Diego and San Francisco, 
together with growing third-party tour operator sales in Germany. 
In short and medium haul, a number of actions to turn around our 
Condor business resulted in an overall improvement in yields, while 
load factors increased by 110 basis points to 91.1%. In the UK, we also 
selectively added capacity to Turkey, in response to strong demand.
Ancillary revenues grew by 10%, partly as a result of the increase in 
long haul flying, which attracts higher ancillary sales than short and 
medium haul flights. In addition, we experienced growing demand 
for seat reservations, as well as for our pre-packaged duty free 
products sold under the “Airshoppen” brand. As a result, ancillary 
revenue per passenger increased by 4% over the year to £16.63 
(FY16: £16.10).
Operating cost increases due to volume-related growth and less 
favourable exchange rates were mitigated by cost efficiencies 
as part of our profit improvement programme, such that the total 
cost per ASK reduced by 0.03 pence to 4.37 pence per ASK. 
Underlying EBIT for our Group Airline grew by 42% (£34 million) to 
£115 million. The improvement was largely driven by the turnaround 
in Condor, which made good progress implementing the profit 
improvement measures that we set out in our FY16 results 
announcement in November 2016. These included re-routing capacity 
from the Spanish Islands to alternative destinations such as Italy, 
Bulgaria and Greece, and improving the flexibility of our flight 
planning, helping to optimise yields and to mitigate competitive 
pricing pressures in the market. As a result, Condor reported 9% 
higher revenue than last year, and improved Underlying EBIT by 
£24 million, to achieve a positive EBIT result of £12 million.
Our UK Airline reported revenue of 13% higher than last year, 
reflecting increases to the long haul and short/medium haul 
flight programme to take advantage of a recovery in demand to 
Turkey and growth in new and existing long haul destinations. 
As a consequence of further cost-out initiatives and a further 
strengthening of our seat-only offering, our UK airline delivered 
underlying EBIT in line with last year.
In Belgium, our airline recovered from the terror attacks at Brussels 
airport in March 2016 to deliver an Underlying EBIT improvement of 
£10 million compared to last year and broadly in line with FY15 levels. 
As previously announced, from November 2017, our Belgian airline 
business transferred to Brussels Airlines such that it is no longer 
part of the Group. STRATEGIC REPORT

NET FINANCE CHARGES 
Group net finance costs for the year of £143 million were broadly 
in line with last year (FY16: £140 million). Bank and bond interest 
charges reduced by £6 million following the replacement of our 
2017 and 2020 bonds with a new lower-coupon €750 million bond 
issued in December 2016. This was offset by a £6 million increase in 
non-cash interest charges relating to the discounting of long term 
provisions, within other interest costs.

TAXATION
The tax charge for the year increased to £34 million 
(FY16: £33 million). Current tax of £42 million is £3 million higher 
than last year due to increased tax payable in respect of our 
profitable business in Northern Europe. A net credit of £8 million was 
recognised during the year for deferred tax which largely reflects 
the increased recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of 
carried forward tax losses in our Spanish entities. 
UK tax legislation was enacted after the balance sheet date which 
will restrict the permitted level of utilisation of brought forward 
tax losses. The associated UK deferred tax asset will subsequently 
be recovered over an extended period of time. Although we expect 
this to impact the recognition of deferred tax assets in FY18 in 
respect of our sizeable UK tax losses, we do not expect there to be 
a significant impact on cash tax.

OPERATING LEASE CHARGES 
Operating lease charges in the year increased by £23 million

charges increased by £24 million to £144 million primarily due to the 
weakening of the pound against the US Dollar and changes to our 
narrow-body fleet.

Note:
(i) In addition the Group incurred seasonal wet lease costs of £75m (2016: £60m) during the year. 
The year-on-year increase was due in part to unplanned requirements as a result of grounded 
aircraft in Condor, as well as the expansion of our long-haul programme, increased summer 
demand in the UK and a fleet rollover on four aircraft, thus resulting in higher operating 
lease charges.  THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 49

Notes: 
(i)  The Group uses three non-statutory cash flow measures to manage the business. 
Operating Cashflow is net cash from operating activities excluding interest income and the 
cash effect of separately disclosed items impacting EBIT. Free Cash flow is cash from operating 
activities less capital expenditure and net interest paid. Net Cashflow is the net (decrease)/
increase in cash and cash equivalents excluding the net movement in borrowings, finance lease 
repayments and facility set-up fees
(ii)  Free cash flow is cash from operating activities less exceptional items, capital expenditure and 
net interest paid
(iii)  Other movements in net debt include currency translation and the reclassification of operating 
leases to finance leases
Free cash flow of £153 million was £93 million higher than last 
year (2016: £60 million), reflecting growth in EBITDA of £46 million 
to £552 million and an improvement in working capital as a result 
of stronger trading. These improvements were partially offset 
by increased outflows in relation to the timing of tax payments 
and additional one-off financing costs associated with the bond 
refinancing in December 2016.
Net cash interest paid was unchanged at £129 million. Bond and 
bank interest costs reduced by £9 million, whereas volume-related 
costs such as letters of credit increased by a similar amount.
Current year cash exceptional items are analysed as follows:

Net Assets decreased by £46 million from £326 million at September 
2016 to £280 million at September 2017. This includes a negative 
revaluation of £83 million for the Group’s derivatives in respect 
of fuel and currency hedging, due mainly to an increase in the 
differential between our hedged fuel prices and spot prices, 
together with a positive revaluation of our pension liability of 
£88 million due to an improvement in bond yields used to calculate 
the present value of the Group’s pension obligations.

facility of which £267 million was drawn at 30 September 2017 
(30 September 2016: £275 million). All of the combined £295 million of 
drawn balances have been used solely for bonding, and therefore is 
not reflected in our gross debt. These facilities were due to expire 
in May 2019. 
In November 2017 the Group entered into new financing 
arrangements amounting to £975 million, replacing our existing 
facilities. This is further discussed under “Borrowing facilities” on 
pages 146 to 147.
TREASURY AND CASH MANAGEMENT
The Group’s funding, liquidity and exposure to foreign currencies, 
interest rates, commodity prices and ﬁnancial credit risk are 
managed by a centralised Treasury function and are conducted 
within a framework of Board-approved policies and guidelines.
The principal aim of Treasury activities is to reduce volatility by 
hedging, which provides a degree of certainty to the operating 
segments, and to ensure a sufficient level of liquidity headroom 
at all times.
The successful execution of policy is intended to support a 
sustainable low risk growth strategy, enable the Group to meet its 
ﬁnancial commitments, and enhance the Group’s credit rating over 
the medium term. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 51
STRATEGIC REPORT
Due to the seasonality of the Group’s business cycle and cash 
ﬂows, a substantial amount of surplus cash accumulates during the 
Summer months. Efficient use and tight control of cash throughout 
the Group is facilitated by the use of cash pooling arrangements 
and the net surplus cash is invested by Treasury in high quality, 
short-term liquid instruments consistent with Board-approved 
policy, which is designed to mitigate counterparty credit risk. 
Yield is maximised within the terms of the policy but returns in 
general remain low given the low interest rate environment in 
the UK, the US and Europe.
A small portion of the Group’s cash is restricted in overseas 
jurisdictions primarily due to legal or regulatory requirements. 
Such cash does not form part of our liquidity headroom calculation.
HEDGING OF FUEL AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
AS AT 31 OCTOBER 2017 
The objective of the Group’s hedging policy is to smooth fluctuations 
in the price of Jet Fuel and foreign currencies, in order to provide 
greater certainty for planning purposes. The proportion of our 
exposures that have been hedged are shown in the table below.
Winter  
2017/18
Summer  
2018
Winter 
2018/19
Euro Fully Hedged 76% 39%
US Dollar Fully Hedged 83% 33%
Jet Fuel Fully Hedged 90% 51%
As at 31 October 2017.
As Fuel is priced in US Dollars, our net fuel costs are influenced by 
both the fuel price and the movements in the US Dollar against our 
base currencies.
While net fuel costs reduced by around £15 million in FY17 compared 
to the previous year, these benefits were partially offset by higher 
dollar-denominated non-fuel flying costs. For FY18, we are hedged 
at significantly below the current forward rate, and estimate that, 
as a result of our hedge position, our fuel costs will fall by a further 
£10 million.
The Group does not hedge the translation of overseas profits into 
Sterling, and as a result of currency movements during the year, 
underlying EBIT in FY16 was higher by £4 million.
The average and period end exchange rates relative to the Group 
were as follows:
Average Rate Period End Rate
FY17 FY16 FY17 FY16

THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 52
APPENDIX 1 – USE OF ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
The Directors have adopted a number of alternative performance 
measures (APM), namely underlying EBIT, net debt, underlying EPS, 
operating cash flow, free cash flow and net cash flow. The Group’s 
results are presented both before and after separately disclosed 
items. Separately disclosed items are disclosed in Note 7 of the 
consolidated financial statements.
These measures have been used to identify the Group’s strategic 
objectives of ‘Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBIT margin growth’ 
and ‘Net Debt’ reduction, and to monitor performance towards these 
goals. The alternative performance measures are not defined by IFRS 
and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies’ 
alternative performance measures. These measures are not 
intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements. 
The definition of each APM presented in this report, together with 
a reconciliation to the nearest measure prepared in accordance 
with IFRS is presented below.
UNDERLYING EBIT
This is the headline measure of the Group’s performance, and is 
based on profit from operations before the impact of separately 
disclosed items. Underlying EBIT provides a measure of the 
underlying operating performance of the Group and growth in 
profitability of the operations.

Profit from operations 231 197
Less: Separately disclosed items affecting loss from

Underlying EBIT 330 302
MANAGEMENT CASH FLOW STATEMENT
The Group uses three non-statutory cash flow measures to manage 
the business. Operating Cashflow is net cash used in operating 
activities excluding the cash effect of separately disclosed items. 
Free Cash flow is cash from operating activities less capital 
expenditure and interest paid. Net Cashflow is the net decrease 
in cash and cash equivalents excluding the net movement in 
borrowings, facility set-up fees and finance lease repayments. 
These cash flow measures are indicators of the financial 
management of the business. They reflect the cash generated by 
the business before and after investing and financing activities and 
explain changes in the Group’s Net Debt position.

UNDERLYING EPS
Earnings are based on results before separately disclosed items 
after a notional tax charge divided by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares, adjusted for any potential dilutive impact of the 
assumed conversion of the employee equity-settled share-based 
payment schemes outstanding.

notional tax charge on separately disclosed items of £10m (2016: £8m).
NET DEBT
Net debt comprises bank and other borrowings, finance lease 
payables and net derivative financial instruments used to hedge 
exposure to interest rate risks of bank and other borrowings, 
offset by cash and cash equivalents. Net debt is a measure of 
how the Group manages its balance sheet and capital structure. 
A strong balance sheet and efficient capital structure is essential 
to withstand external market shocks and seize opportunities. 
Accordingly, reducing net debt and the cost of the debt is a priority 
for the Group.

RISK MANAGEMENT
EMBEDDING A CULTURE 
OF RISK MANAGEMENT
OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
The Board is responsible for maintaining the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems, with a mandate that 
includes defining risk appetite and monitoring risk exposures and 
mitigations to ensure that the nature and extent of risks taken 
by the Group are aligned with its strategic objectives. 
RISK APPETITE 
The Board has undertaken a detailed exercise to consider the risk 
appetite in a number of key areas for the business. The results of 
this review indicate the relative appetite of the Board across the risk 
factors and behaviours. It is evident that this represents a view at 
a point in time; changes in the economic environment, strategy or 
performance of the business will impact this evaluation. 
The Board is aligned on the relative risks and has agreed the 
appetite for risk taking for Strategic Initiatives, Digital Delivery, 
Product Portfolio, and Talent is entrepreneurial. This position aligns 
with the strategic aims and targets set for the business. The Board 
seeks to minimise exposure to all Health and Safety, Reputational 
and Customer risks. In all other aspects, the Board takes a balanced 
view on risk taking.
The Board will use the results of this review to influence setting of 
Group strategy and support its ongoing decision-making process.
OUR APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT
Operating in a dynamic and continually volatile environment requires 
a flexible and responsive risk management process that can match 
the pace of change and provide Management with a concise view 
of the Group’s risk profile at any point in time. We continue to focus 
on embedding a culture of risk management that will contribute 
towards effective strategy execution, ensuring both risks and 
opportunities are identified and managed to deliver long-term 
value creation. 
During 2017, we focused on maturing our risk management 
programme. We strengthened our risk analysis and reporting 
through the incorporation of quantitative key risk indicators into 
the process. We advised the business on how to assess the risks 
inherent within the Group’s commercial partnership agreement 
with Expedia. We delivered project risk management training to the 
IT project management community, which will help ensure risks 
are appropriately considered and addressed during the delivery 
of strategic projects. 
TOP DOWN OVERSIGHT
In 2017, we enhanced our approach to risk management by 
incorporating the top down risk review process into the agenda of 
the Executive Committee, which is chaired by the CEO. The purpose 
of the top down risk review is to provide leadership, direction 
and oversight with regard to the Group’s overall risk framework, 
appetite, and relevant risk policies, processes and controls. As part 
of the new process, key strategic risks from the Group Risk 
Dashboard are reviewed on a quarterly basis to ascertain whether 
all risks are being mitigated appropriately and to take action where 
further mitigations are required. The Group Risk Dashboard is then 
presented and discussed at the Audit Committee, which ensures 
that the Audit Committee is provided with an enterprise-wide view 
of the Group’s current risk exposure. 
BOTTOM UP ASSESSMENTS
Each major business unit has a quarterly risk committee attended 
by the risk owners representing all areas of the business, as 
well as by the Group Risk Team. The risk committees analyse key 
business unit risks and ensure implementation of risk mitigation 
plans. Where appropriate, significant risks identified at business unit 
level are escalated and discussed during the Executive Committee 
risk review. 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee considers risk exposure against risk appetite 
by profiling key risks in respect of their potential impact and 
likelihood of occurrence, after consideration of mitigating actions 
that are in place. During the year, the Audit Committee has reviewed 
both top down and bottom up risk analyses and the Board has 
undertaken a detailed exercise to consider its risk appetite. 
The results of these activities have informed the Annual Audit Plan, 
which will enable a risk-based approach to the ongoing internal 
audit and assurance programme. The report of the Audit Committee 
can be found on page 74. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 55
STRATEGIC REPORT
VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Directors have assessed the prospects of the Group 
in accordance with provision C2.2 of the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
The Directors believe a five-year period is appropriate to consider 
viability as this duration is in line with the Thomas Cook Group 
business plan (the ‘Business Plan’) and the maturity of the Group’s 
bank facility. 
In order to assess the viability of the Group, the Directors reviewed 
each of the principal risks and uncertainties, taking into account 
current operational and financial performance as well as the 
Business Plan. The key assumptions which underpin the Business 
Plan include:
 > revenue growth of 4% per annum; 
 > the benefits of the Group’s strategic plans are delivered in full; and
 > financing facilities in the form of debt or aircraft leases will 
continue to be available. 
As part of the analysis, stress testing focusing on the following 
scenarios was performed: 
 > A major terrorist incident or natural disaster in one of the 
Group’s larger destinations that leads to a significant decline 
in customer demand 
 > The Group fails to fully deliver the efficiency targets or new 
business initiatives included in its business plan
Based on the results, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation 
and to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five-year period 
of their assessment.
ASSESSMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS
The Group’s risk management system works effectively in assessing 
the Group’s risk appetite and has supported a robust assessment 
by the Directors of the principal risks facing the Group. The principal 
risks are reviewed throughout the year and discussed with the 
Board quarterly. This includes all relevant principal risks that could 
threaten Thomas Cook’s business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.

Disruption to airline operations
The success of our Group Airline 
business depends on our ability 
to effectively manage our fleet by 
ensuring we maintain the right 
number and types of aircrafts and by 
operating those aircrafts to deliver 
a high-quality and cost-efficient 
service to our customers. 
Inability to operate the required 
number and types of aircraft in our 
fleet may lead to missed revenue 
or reduced margins. Inability to 
operate the fleet effectively may lead 
to customer dissatisfaction, cost 
increases and reduced profitability. 
This risk has always been monitored 
by the Group at an operational level. 
At the request of the Audit Committee 
this risk was added to the principal 
risks to ensure a more holistic 
disclosure of the Group’s risk profile.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
This report sets out how the Company applied the 
principles of the April 2016 version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’). It is the Board’s view 
that for the year ended 30 September 2017 the 
Company fully complied with the provisions applicable 
to this reporting period. The Code can be read in full 
at www.frc.org.uk.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
In my statement last year, I spoke about the focus of the Company to 
put the customer at the heart of our organisation. The Board shared 
this focus by dedicating time to getting to know our customers, our 
colleagues and our holiday offering more closely. This year as part 
of our governance activities we have used this insight to support 
Management to drive the right behaviours throughout the business 
and ensure we have the right people in place to do this. 
In spring, we reviewed our corporate values and redeveloped them 
based upon our Customer Promises, so that the behaviours within our 
own organisation align with the promises we make to our customers. 
We also updated our Code of Conduct to ensure it closely reflects 
both our values and Customer Promises. These initiatives reflect 
Management’s continued commitment to instill a customer centric 
culture. All of our colleagues have received training on the new values 
so that everybody can develop an understanding of what the values 
mean to them. The behaviour of our people is key to all that we do 
and I believe our new values will help ensure we are doing business 
in a way we can be proud of.
BOARD COMPOSITION
During our FY16 Board evaluation, we identified that the importance 
of the customer and our own-brand hotel portfolio to our strategy 
meant that we could benefit from additional Non-Executive 
expertise in these areas. Following a comprehensive search led by 
the Nominations Committee, I am delighted that Jürgen Schreiber 
and Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson agreed to join the Board. Jürgen is a 
highly accomplished executive with broad international experience 
across retail and consumer goods businesses. Paul is the CFO of 
InterContinental Hotels Group PLC so brings with him valuable 
expertise and in-depth knowledge of the hotel industry. 
During the year, the Nominations Committee continued to focus on 
executive succession planning and spent considerable time looking 
at the talent pipeline. In September, our CFO Michael Healy decided to 
retire following a very successful five years at Thomas Cook, during 
which time he has put the business on a much more stable financial 
footing. I am pleased that we were able to appoint a high-calibre 
successor to Michael from our own ranks. Bill Scott, currently Director 
of Financial Reporting, has a proven track record in the business, 
having taken a leading role in the Group’s key corporate transactions 
over the last five years, including the equity and debt raising as 
part of the Group’s recapitalisation in 2013 and subsequent debt 
refinancing exercises. As such, Bill’s appointment will ensure that 
we continue on our journey with a CFO who is perfectly positioned 
to keep driving the business forward in achieving its strategic goals. 
Together, these three appointments further strengthen the Board 
and will give us, I believe, the optimal balance of skills, experience 
and independence needed to deliver on our strategy.

BOARD EVALUATION
Recognising the need continually to develop the effectiveness 
of the Board this year, I engaged Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom 
Review Limited to conduct an independent evaluation of the 
Board’s operation. This rigorous and thorough assessment 
involved in-depth one-to-one interviews and individual feedback, 
as well as overall feedback to the Board. The review provided 
useful insight and identified practical actions that will help us to 
develop. More details about the evaluation process and outputs 
can be found on pages 70 to 71.
COMMITTEES
During the year, our Committees made good progress in delivering 
positive change in their respective areas.
With the continuing significant threat posed by cyber-attacks 
and the pending implementation of the General Data Protection 
Regulations, our Audit Committee has been particularly focused 
on the risks associated with cyber and information security and 
the controls we have in place to deal with them. The Committee 
continues closely to monitor progress in this area to ensure we do 
all we can to keep our customers’ data safe. The Audit Committee 
also oversaw the transition to our new auditor Ernst & Young, 
with FY17 being their first audit. I am pleased to report a smooth 
transition and effective audit, benefiting from the enhanced 
independence that a new auditor brings.
Our Health, Safety & Environmental Committee oversaw the 
introduction of a number of initiatives that demonstrate our 
commitment to doing business in a responsible way which puts 
our customer at the heart. Our Group Airline introduced the ‘Safe@
Heart’ initiative which aims to enhance the culture of safety in our 
Group Airline through a number of measures, including providing 
extra safety training to up to 7,000 Group Airline employees. In the 
area of sustainability, the Committee approved a new Sustainability 
Strategy which aligns with our main strategy for profitable growth. 
The Committee also oversaw the introduction of an industry-leading 
Animal Welfare Policy which takes a much stronger approach to 
ensuring the standard of care of the animals in attractions and 
aligns with our Customer Promises.
Meanwhile, our Remuneration Committee undertook the 
important task of setting targets for our Performance Share Plan 
which are stretching but not commercially sensitive, so that we 
can disclose them prospectively to our Shareholders. I believe 
this development represents a step forward in our reporting and 
demonstrates the Committee’s commitment to being as transparent 
as possible and acting upon feedback from our investors. 
More information about the Remuneration Committee’s activities 
can be found on pages 84-108. 
SUMMARY
Thomas Cook enters FY18 with a strong Board and an enhanced 
corporate culture, making us well-positioned to achieve our strategic 
goals and build Shareholder value. The actions we have taken in the 
last 12 months represent positive steps forward in our governance 
practice and I look forward to building on this momentum in the 
coming year.

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
THE CODE  
OF CONDUCT 
The Board-approved Code of Conduct sets out the 
behaviours expected of everyone in the organisation. 
During the year the Code of Conduct was updated 
to ensure it supports and aligns with the new 
Customer Promises and values (more information 
about our values can be found on page 37).
The Code of Conduct includes guidance to 
colleagues about their responsibility to report 
problems and issues that come to their attention 
and how they can do this. All colleagues are 
encouraged to use ‘Trustline’, the Company’s 
independent whistleblowing helpline, if they wish 
to raise concerns anonymously. Any significant 
issues brought to Management’s attention 
through the Trustline are investigated and 
reported to the Audit Committee.
THOMAS COOK LEADERSHIP  
COUNCIL (‘TCLC’) 
The TCLC comprises the top 170 senior leaders 
in the organisation. Information about the 
Company’s strategy and performance is regularly 
communicated to the TCLC, who in turn cascade 
to their teams to ensure everyone understands 
where they fit into the strategy and what they 
can do to help the Company achieve its goals.
More information about how our strategy and 
values are communicated throughout the 
organisation can be found on page 37.
DELEGATED  
AUTHORITY MATRIX 
The Board-approved Delegated Authority Matrix 
sets out levels of authority delegated by the Board 
to senior leaders within the business in respect 
of the decision making required for the day-to-day 
operation of the business. 
The Matrix is reviewed and updated annually. 
The Matrix is sent out to all members of the TCLC 
so that they can cascade to their teams. GOVERNANCE

Board composition 
As at 21 November 2017, the Board was made up of 11 Directors 
which comprised the Chairman, two Executive Directors and eight 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Frank Meysman was the Chairman throughout the year. The roles 
of the Chairman and CEO are separate and distinct. Dawn Airey is 
the Senior Independent and is available to Shareholders should they 
have concerns that cannot be resolved through the normal channels 
involving the Executive Directors or the Chairman.
Biographical details of all Directors can be found on 
pages 63 to 64 and on the Group’s corporate website at 
www.thomascookgroup.com. 
Changes to the Board and Committees
During the year, Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson and Jürgen Schreiber 
were appointed as Independent Non-Executive Directors with 
effect from 26 July 2017 and subsequently Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson 
was appointed to the Audit and Remuneration Committees and 
Jürgen Schreiber was appointed to the Audit and Health, Safety & 
Environmental Committees. 
Following these appointments, the Board reviewed the membership 
of its Committees and made further changes so that each Non-
Executive Director is a member of two Committees. Therefore, with 
effect from 1 October 2017, Dawn Airey stepped down from the Audit 
and Health & Safety Committees, Warren Tucker stepped down from 
the Nominations Committee, Emre Berkin stepped down from the 
Remuneration Committee and Peter Fankhauser stepped down from 
the Nominations Committee.
Director independence and time committment 
The Nominations Committee and the Board considered the 
independence of the Non-Executive Directors against the criteria 
specified in the Code and determined that each was independent. 
They also considered the independence of Directors whose three-
year terms were renewed during the year, before approving the 
renewal of these terms. 
The Chairman and each Independent Non-Executive Director have 
provided assurance to the Board that they remain fully committed 
to their respective roles and can dedicate sufficient time to fulfil 
their obligations. 
All Directors must obtain the prior consent of the Chairman before 
taking on any additional directorships. Before providing consent 
the Chairman will take into consideration any existing directorships 
and commitments and the nature, location and expected time 
commitment of the proposed new role. The Chairman will not 
approve any Director taking on additional commitments that he 
believes would interfere with their ability to dedicate sufficient time 
to the Company. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 67
GOVERNANCE
Directors’ conflicts of interest 
The Board has a set of principles for managing conflicts and an 
agreed process to identify and authorise potential conflicts where 
appropriate. The Nominations Committee reviews any potential 
conflicts, as and when they arise, and makes a recommendation to 
the Board as to whether the potential conflict should be authorised. 
The Nominations Committee regularly reviews all authorised 
conflicts. It also reviews the interests of candidates prior to making 
recommendations to the Board for the appointment of new Directors. 
This process was followed throughout the year to 30 September 2017. 
Re-appointment of Directors 
In accordance with the Code and the Company’s Articles 
of Association, all Directors are subject to re-election by 
Shareholders. At the AGM held in February 2017, each of the 
Directors in post at the time was submitted for re-election and 
successfully re-elected. Non-Executive Directors are initially 
appointed for a three-year term, subject to annual re-election by 
Shareholders, and rigorous review by the Nominations Committee. 
Each Non-Executive Director can serve up to a maximum of three 
such terms. 
Group Company Secretary 
The Group Company Secretary is responsible for advising and 
supporting the Chairman and the Board on corporate governance 
matters as well as ensuring that there is a smooth flow of 
information to enable effective decision making. All Directors have 
access to the advice and services of the Group Company Secretariat 
and through them have access to independent professional advice 
in respect of their duties, at the Company’s expense. The Group 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Board and its 
Committees. During the year, Alice Marsden held the position of 
Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. Biographical details 
can be found on page 64.
Meetings 
The full Board meets at least six times a year at its scheduled 
meetings, and in between these meetings when required. 
Board members communicate with each other and Management 
outside of formal Board meetings to keep up-to-date with business 
developments. The Chairman and the Committee Chairs hold 
planning meetings and calls with Management in respect of 
upcoming meetings.
At each Board meeting, the CEO presents a comprehensive update 
on the progress of the Group’s strategy and business issues arising 
across the Group, and the CFO presents a detailed analysis of the 
financial performance, both at Group and segment level. 
Packs for the Board and Committee meetings are circulated using 
a fully encrypted electronic portal system. This enables fast and 
secure distribution of information that can be accessed using 
electronic tablets. 
All Directors are invited to attend the meetings and receive the 
packs for all Committees, regardless of membership (unless not in 
line with governance best practice i.e. an Executive Director would 
not attend a Remuneration Committee meeting where their own 
remuneration was being discussed). This ensures all Directors 
remain well informed on all matters of the Board’s business and 
reduces the need for lengthy Committee feedback sessions during 
Board meetings. 
Attendance at scheduled Board and Committee meetings during the year is set out below:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
CONTINUED
During the year the Board spent significant time considering the 
Company’s key strategic projects, receiving deep-dive Management 
presentations and comprehensive updates. Projects included the 
launch of a €750 million guaranteed bond in November 2016; extending 
a partnership with Brussels Airlines to make them the leading carrier 
for Thomas Cook in Belgium and the sale of the Belgium Airlines ground 
operations and Airline Operating Certificate to SHS Aviation; entering 
into a strategic alliance with Expedia under which Expedia will become 
the preferred supplier of complementary city and domestic hotels; and 
entering into a partnership with LMEY Investments to develop and grow 
the Company’s own-brand hotel portfolio. Other important items on the 
Board agenda included the approval of the five-year business plan and 
risk mitigation matters, including agreeing the Board’s risk appetite.
In March, the Board held its meetings and strategy days in the 
Company’s Oberursel and Frankfurt airport offices in Germany, the 
head offices of the Tour Operator and Airline in Germany respectively. 
The strategy days included in-depth discussion of the Company’s 
strategy and presentations from various areas of the business including 
Thomas Cook China and Thomas Cook Money. In July, the Board held 
its meetings in the new Peterborough office, the head office of the 
UK Tour Operator, where it was able to meet colleagues and receive 
presentations on the UK business.
The Board dedicated half a day to people, where it spent time 
considering a Group-wide talent review which examined talent, 
succession, retention risk and diversity in respect of the top 100 roles 
in the business and how this feeds into the executive pipeline.

BOARD INDUCTION AND TRAINING 
A tailored induction programme is provided to each new Director 
on appointment. Inductions typically include: the provision of 
a comprehensive induction pack; meetings with other Board 
members and senior management across a wide variety of 
geographies; visits to the Company’s business operations; and 
presentations and briefings on the Company’s business and other 
relevant topics. Individual induction requirements are monitored by 
the Chairman, with the support of the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary. 
During the year Lesley Knox completed her comprehensive Non-
Executive Induction programme. Following positive feedback, a

In respect of the appointment of Bill Scott, who will take up post as 
Group CFO on 1 January 2018, a tailored induction programme has 
been designed. As Bill has been with the business for five years, he 
has an in-depth knowledge of the Company’s operations and well-
established relationships with key business leaders. Therefore his 
induction activities will focus on the new responsibilities he will 
take on as an Executive Director including a training session on 
Directors’ duties and responsibilities.
At Board meetings and, where appropriate, Committee meetings, the 
Directors receive updates and presentations on developments to the 
legislative and regulatory environments. In September 2017, the Board 
received a training session on Directors’ duties and responsibilities. 
The Board also holds deep-dive sessions on different aspects of the 
business which are presented by Management. GOVERNANCE

months to discuss progress.
OUTPUTS FROM 2017 EVALUATION
Strengths identified:
 > A positive Board culture focused on adding 
value to the Company with a shared strategic 
perspective, led by the CEO, and focused on 
the customer
 > An increasingly effective use of formal and 
informal Board and Committee time, including 
a good balance of strategy, performance and 
governance themes throughout the year 
 > Good attention to the risk and control 
framework, crisis management and visibility 
of and confidence in the lines of defence
Areas of focus identified: Actions:
Certain agenda items and the private sessions (i.e. the 
meetings of Non-Executive Directors in the absence of 
Management) can sometimes feel rushed as a result 
of lack of time available on a busy agenda.
The Group Company Secretary and Chairman will work to increase the overall 
time available for meetings and improve time allocation of the agenda.
The Nominations Committee should spend more 
time looking at long-term succession planning for 
the Chair and Committee chairs as well as the 
Executive Directors.
This will be added to the Nominations Committee agenda.
The Board has set a clear tone from the top in respect 
of culture but it could now benefit from spending 
more time monitoring how culture changes are being 
received and filtering down through the organisation. 
The annual employee engagement results will be presented to the Board by 
the Group HR Director and allocated time on the Board agenda for discussion. 
Exit interviews of any outgoing senior personnel will be conducted by the 
Senior Independent Director.  THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 71
GOVERNANCE
The Chairman and Group Company Secretary monitor progress against the action plan set. The below sets out progress in respect of 
the action points identified following last year’s internal evaluation:
OUTPUTS FROM 2016 EVALUATION
Areas of focus identified: Progress:
The format and quality of Board papers should continue 
to be developed to shift the emphasis from reporting 
past events to highlighting important matters that 
require the Board’s guidance.
The Group Company Secretary provided guidance to senior management on the 
structure and content of Board papers. Templates were created and provided to 
contributors to ensure consistency and papers must pass a more robust review 
and gatekeeping process before being provided to the Board.
The Board may benefit in the future from recruiting an 
additional Non-Executive Director with direct customer 
experience in the retail industry and/or relevant travel 
industry experience.
On the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, the Board appointed 
two new Independent Non-Executive Directors who possess the skills identified 
(see Nominations Committee report on pages 78 to 79 for more details).
The Nominations Committee should be given more time 
on the agenda.
The Group Company Secretary put in place an annual agenda plan and set aside 
more time for Nominations Committee meetings. During the year the Nominations 
Committee held six scheduled meetings and spent more time looking at succession 
planning (see Nominations Committee report on pages 78 to 79]for more details).
CHAIRMAN EVALUATION 
Separately, the Non-Executive Directors, under the leadership 
of the Senior Independent Director and with input from the 
Executive Directors, conducted an evaluation of the Chairman 
The outputs from that evaluation were discussed by the Board in 
the absence of the Chairman and feedback was given to him by 
the Senior Independent Director, and reported to the Board at its 
November meeting.
INDIVIDUAL EXECUTIVE EVALUATION
The individual performance of the Executive Directors is reviewed 
separately by the Chairman and the Remuneration Committee.
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATION AND ENGAGEMENT 
The Board promotes open communication with Shareholders. This is 
formalised within the framework of an ongoing investor relations 
programme conducted by the CEO, the CFO and the Investor Relations 
Team. The programme includes the presentation of preliminary and half-
year results (which can be accessed on www.thomascookgroup.com) 
and a large number of meetings with existing Shareholders and 
potential investors throughout the year. The Company makes every 
effort to ascertain investor perceptions and regular reports of investor 
and analyst feedback are provided to the Board.
The Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee engage with Shareholders on matters concerning corporate 
governance and executive remuneration respectively, and feed this 
back to the Board. Dawn Airey held the position of Senior Independent 
Director throughout the year, providing an additional channel through 
which Shareholders can engage with the Board if they so wish.
In respect of debt investors, the Company maintains regular 
dialogue with key relationship banks which includes semi-annual 
meetings with presentations from the Executive Management Team. 
During the year, it also held update and review meetings with Moody’s, 
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, the Company’s credit rating agencies. 
The Company hosts a dedicated conference call for bondholders on 
a semi-annual basis and during the year the CFO and Management 
also engaged with Bondholders both as a group, and, on a one-
to-one basis, at several investment-bank sponsored conferences. 
Additionally, the Board responded to ad-hoc requests for information. 
All Shareholders are entitled to attend the AGM. Shareholders are 
given the opportunity to lodge their votes by way of proxy and/or 
to attend the meeting in person where they have the opportunity 
to ask questions of the Board, including the chairs of the Board 
Committees, vote by way of a poll and meet informally with the 
Directors to discuss any issues they may wish to raise. 
In line with the authority given at its 2008 AGM, the Company uses 
its website and email as the primary means of communication with 
its Shareholders. This arrangement provides significant benefits for 
Shareholders and the Company in terms of timeliness of information 
and reduced environmental impact and cost. Shareholders may 
still opt to receive their communications in a paper format. 
The Company’s corporate website (www.thomascookgroup.com) 
contains information for Shareholders, including share price 
information and news releases.  GOVERNANCE
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 72
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL 
The Board recognises its ultimate accountability for maintaining 
an effective system of internal control and risk management 
that is appropriate in relation to both the scope and the nature 
of the Group’s activities, and complies with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. This is 
fully described in the Risk Management section on pages 54 to 59.
The Group’s internal control and risk management systems are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable, but 
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
These systems have been in place for the year under review and up 
to the date of approval of the Annual Report & Accounts. The Board 
has approved the framework and the standards implemented.
REVIEW OF SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL 
During the year the Board, through the work of the Audit Committee, 
has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control. The Board monitors the internal control 
processes on an ongoing basis, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls, under the auspices of the Enterprise 
Risk and Audit function. Regular reports on control issues are 
presented to and discussed with the Audit Committee and there is 
a follow-up process in place to ensure audit recommendations are 
fully implemented by Management. This work is also complemented, 
supported and challenged by the controls assurance work carried 
out independently by the external auditors, Ernst & Young, as part of 
the external audit. The Board has noted ongoing progress and active 
focus in the internal control processes during this year. The Board, 
in reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control, can 
confirm that necessary actions continue to be taken to remedy any 
significant failings or weaknesses identified from that review. 
GOING CONCERN 
The Directors have assessed the prospects of the Group over the 
medium term in the context of its current operating performance, 
the principal risks facing the business and its internal business 
plan for the next five years. In addition, the Group has prepared a 
sensitivity analysis on its business plan and evaluated the impact 
of certain principal risks occurring both individually and in unison, 
together with mitigating actions that could be implemented in 
such circumstances.
As part of their assessment, the Directors have also noted 
the refinancing of the Group’s bonds in December 2016, which 
further extended debt maturities and reduced borrowing costs, 
and the agreement of larger, more flexible banking facilities in 
November 2017. 
Having considered the above factors, the Directors have concluded 
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT IN 
RELATION TO THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS 
The Group has a thorough assurance process in place in respect 
of the preparation, verification and approval of periodic financial 
reports. This process includes:
 > the involvement of qualified, professional employees with an 
appropriate level of experience (both in Group Finance and 
throughout the business);
 > formal sign-offs from appropriate business segment Managing 
Directors and Finance Directors;
 > comprehensive review and, where appropriate, challenge from 
key internal Group functions;
 > a transparent process to ensure full disclosure of information 
to the external auditors. Engagement of a professional and 
experienced firm of external auditors; and
 > oversight by the Group’s Audit Committee, involving (amongst 
other duties):
 — a detailed review of key financial reporting judgements which 
have been discussed by Management; and
 — review and, where appropriate, challenge on matters including:
• the consistency of, and any changes to, significant accounting 
policies and practices during the year;
• significant adjustments resulting from an external audit;
• the Company’s statement on internal control systems, prior to 
endorsement by the Board; and
• the going concern assumption.
The above process, and the review by the Audit Committee of a 
comprehensive note that sets out the details of the preparation, 
internal verification and approval process for the Annual Report & 
Accounts, provides comfort to the Board that the Annual Report & 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy. 
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT, THE 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT AND 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,

Group and the Company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. The financial statements are required by law to 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and 
the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.

adopted by the European Union. 
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and the Group, and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the

DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE AND TRANSPARENCY 
RULES CONFIRMATION
Each of the Directors who were in office at the date of this report 
and whose names and functions are listed on pages 63 to 64, 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
 > the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the

includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, together with a description

FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
The Directors confirm that they consider the Annual Report & 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for Shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy. In making this confirmation, the Directors took into 
account their knowledge of the business, which is kept up-to-date 
with regular reports, updates and business reviews circulated 
prior to and discussed at each Board meeting, and supplemented 
by a variety of written reports, verbal updates and presentations 
(including the training and strategy support presentations detailed 
on page 58) given at Board and Committee meetings as well as a 
regular flow of information about the business between meetings. 
The Directors then took into account the thorough preparation and 
verification process in respect of the Annual Report & Accounts, 
which included sufficient time for the Directors to review the Annual 
Report & Accounts and to feed in their comments to Management 
before approving the document.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS 
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirms that: so far as they are aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and that they have taken all steps that they ought to 
have taken as a Director to make them aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware 
of that information. 
SHARE CAPITAL AND RELATED DISCLOSURES 
Disclosures in relation to the share capital of the Company, 
including the Company’s major Shareholders are given in the 
“Other Disclosures” section on pages 81 to 83.
DIVIDEND
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 0.6 pence per 
share, representing a distribution to shareholders of £9 million. 
This represents an increase of 20% compared to the dividend 
paid in respect of the previous year, reflecting the underlying 
progress made in FY17 and the confidence of the Board in the 
Group’s future.
The Board has a policy to target dividend growth that reflects 
the Group’s progress in underlying earnings per share. 
As previously stated, in view of the seasonality of the Group’s 
profit profile, it is not our intention to pay interim dividends for 
the foreseeable future.
The ex-dividend date will be 8 March 2018 and, subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2018 Annual General Meeting, the 
final dividend of 0.6 pence per share will be paid on 5 April 2018 
to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 
9 March 2018. GOVERNANCE

(and also those Non-Executive Directors who are not on the 
Committee) met with the Internal Audit and Risk functions and 
Ernst & Young, the Company’s external auditor in the absence 
of Management. 
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE 
The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set 
out in written Terms of Reference which are available at 
www.thomascookgroup.com. Some of their keys responsibilities are: 
 > monitoring the integrity of the annual, half-year and quarterly 
results statements, including reviewing the significant financial 
reporting judgements contained in them; 
 > reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and internal 
control and risk management systems; 
 > monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s 
Internal Audit function; 
 > establishing and overseeing the Company’s relationship with 
its external auditors, including monitoring their effectiveness 
and independence; and
 > monitoring matters raised pursuant to the Company’s 
whistleblowing arrangements. 
ACTIVITIES
Financial reporting and significant judgement areas
The Committee monitored the integrity of the annual, half-year and 
quarterly results statements, including a review of the significant 
financial reporting judgements contained in them. In May and 
November, the Committee reviewed a comprehensive paper prepared 
by the Director of Financial Reporting, which set out the Group’s 
accounting policies and basis of preparation. The Committee also 
reviewed a paper prepared by the external auditors, which included 
significant reporting and accounting matters. The Committee pays 
particular attention to matters that it considers to be important 
by virtue of their impact on the Group results and remuneration 
of senior management, or the level of complexity, judgement 
or estimation in their application in preparation of the Group’s 
financial statements. The significant issues considered by the Audit 
Committee are shown in the table overleaf.
During the year, the Company had correspondence with the 
FRC’s Corporate Reporting Review team in relation to its review 
of the Company’s FY16 Annual Report & Accounts
1
 in line with 
the FRC’s disclosed focus on the travel and leisure sector in 2017. 
The Company provided clarifications and rationale for disclosures in 
respect of separately disclosed items and alternative performance 
measures and committed to enhancing disclosure in these 
areas going forward. The FRC welcomed these commitments. 
Management presented the findings of the review to the Committee 
and the Committee reviewed and approved the correspondence 
with the FRC.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
CONTINUED
1  The FRC stated that the scope of their review was based on the Company’s FY16 Annual Report 
& Accounts and was conducted by staff of the FRC who have an understanding of the relevant 
legal and accounting framework. The review did not benefit from detailed knowledge of the 
Company’s business or an understanding of the underlying transactions entered into and 
therefore their review does not provide assurance that the FY16 Annual Report & Accounts 
are correct in all material respects. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 75
GOVERNANCE
Significant issues in relation to the financial statements 
considered by the Committee
How the issue was addressed  
by the Committee
Revenue Recognition: There are a significant number of transactions 
in relation to revenue, given the nature of the business. The accounting 
for revenue is susceptible to management override. This brings a risk 
around the completeness and accuracy of the revenue recognised 
during the year. 
The Committee evaluated the IT systems and the internal controls in 
place around revenue recognition. This included a review of the Group 
revenue recognition policies to ensure revenue is recognised in line 
with the policy. The Committee concluded that revenue was complete 
and accurate.
Accounting for aircraft maintenance provisions: Significant fixed 
assets for aircraft and provisions for maintenance and contractual end 
of lease obligations are held on the balance sheet.
There is an inherent level of estimation included in the calculation of the 
maintenance provisions which are based upon forecast aircraft usage 
and maintenance costs.
Furthermore, there is judgement needed to determine the appropriate 
discount rate for the provision. 
The Committee reviewed the methodology and key assumptions used 
by Management in accounting for aircraft maintenance provisions 
and concluded that the treatment was appropriate. In addition, the 
methodology for the calculation of the discount rate and the subsequent 
prior year correction as a result of this change was reviewed and agreed 
as appropriate. 
Separately disclosed items: The Group has an established policy of 
separately disclosing items that are either exceptional or not reflective 
of the underlying performance of the Group.
Separately disclosed items are not defined by IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and therefore judgement is required by the Directors to 
identify such items. Consistency in identifying and disclosing items as 
separately disclosed is important to maintain comparability of reporting 
year-on-year.
The Committee considered the presentation of the Group financial 
statements and the appropriateness of the presentation of separately 
disclosed items, in particular items relating to the New Operating Model 
and certain non-cash finance items. The Committee reviewed the 
nature of items identified and concurred with Management that the 
treatment was even-handed, consistent across years and appropriately 
presented movements on items which have an effect over a number 
of years. Consideration was also given to the quality of earnings within 
underlying results.
Carrying Value of Goodwill and Deferred Tax Assets: The Group 
holds significant goodwill and deferred tax assets on the balance 
sheet. Determining the carrying value of these assets is dependent 
on judgements about the future results of the business.
The Committee reviewed Management’s process for testing goodwill and 
deferred tax assets for potential impairment. This included challenging 
the key assumptions: principally cash flow forecasts, growth rates and 
discount rates for goodwill and taxable profit forecasts for deferred 
tax assets.
Provision for illness claims and associated recoveries: There has 
been a significant increase in the number of customer illness claims in 
the current year. Significant judgement is required and there is limited 
historical data available in determining the level of provision required.
In addition, in line with the increase in illness claims the level of 
recoveries from hotels relating to these illness claims has also increased. 
To determine the amount recoverable is subjective and requires 
Management judgement.
The Committee reviewed and challenged the assumptions that 
Management had used in determining the provision for illness claims 
to satisfy itself that the level of provisioning was appropriate. 
The Committee reviewed the methodology behind the hotel recovery 
position and challenged Management on the assumptions used. 
The Committee satisfied itself that the level of recovery recognised 
as appropriate.  GOVERNANCE

AND INTERNAL AUDIT
Risk Management 
The Audit Committee considers risk exposure against the risk 
appetite of the Group, as set by the Board, by profiling key risks 
to the business in terms of their potential impact and likelihood of 
occurrence, after consideration of mitigating and controlling actions 
that are in place. During the year, the Committee reviewed the key 
strategic risks and received updates from the Group Head of Risk 
in respect of the Group Risk Dashboard, highlighting any changes 
in the Company’s risk profile. The Committee also confirmed that 
appropriate mitigations were in place for the key strategic risks. 
These activities fed into the annual Internal Audit Plan, which 
enables a risk-based approach to be adopted as part of the ongoing 
Internal Audit and assurance programme. 
The Committee was supported in its work by the Executive 
Committee, which is comprised of relevant representatives of senior 
management and chaired by the CEO. The Executive Committee 
meets quarterly to monitor the risk dashboard.
Particular areas of focus for the Committee during the year 
included: fraudulent customer illness claims in the UK; information 
security; data protection; and cyber security. The Committee 
received presentations and regular updates from senior 
management on these issues. The Committee received regular 
updates in respect of the Group’s legal compliance programme 
which covered matters including: data protection; anti-bribery and 
corruption; competition law; the Package Travel Directive; hotel and 
accommodation contracting. 
As part of the ongoing In-Destination Compliance Programme, the 
Committee Chair and Group General Counsel & Company Secretary 
visited Cyprus and Turkey and met with key business partners to 
receive first-hand feedback in respect of the Company’s general 
governance and compliance practices in-destination. Findings from 
the review were reported to the Committee and an action plan to 
further enhance compliance in this area was put in place and is 
being monitored by the Committee.
The Committee reviewed reports of all cases lodged with 
Expolink, the Group’s whistleblowing line, and the outcomes of 
resulting investigations.
Internal Audit
The Committee continued to oversee and support development of 
the in-house Internal Audit function. The Committee challenged and 
approved the proposed Internal Audit Plan, and throughout the year 
monitored the allocation of Internal Audit resource and delivery 
against the Internal Audit Plan. The Committee closely monitored 
the recruitment process for a new Group Head of Internal Audit. 
The Committee considered an effectiveness review of the Internal 
Audit function, which measured performance against the Quality 
Assessment criteria provided by the Institute of Internal Auditors 
and concluded it remains satisfied with work of the Internal 
Audit function. 
During the year the Committee considered the findings of a number 
of reviews carried out by the Internal Audit function.
Internal Control
The Group’s internal control framework is managed by the Group 
Finance function. The Audit Committee receives updates on internal 
control matters at each meeting which provides the Committee 
with assurance that the internal controls in place are robust. 
Regular monitoring of the internal control framework allows timely 
identification of issues and formal tracking of remediation plans. 
The internal control framework includes Risk and Control Matrices, 
which act as a key mechanism to mitigate the risk of financial 
misstatement and fraud. Management of each Thomas Cook 
reporting entity certified compliance with the Risk and Control 
Matrix for the financial year. Group Finance ensure that agreed 
actions are being implemented to support a programme of 
maintaining and improving internal controls. Management also 
continues to refine the framework based on the findings of the 
reviews from Internal Audit.
To further support the Board’s annual assessment of the 
effectiveness of the internal control framework, Group Finance 
prepare a report on the Group’s internal control framework and 
its effectiveness, which describes the risk management systems 
and arrangements in place for internal control, as well as work 
conducted during the year to improve the control environment. 
Work in the current year has focused on further education on the 
internal control framework, to achieve consistency across the Group, 
as well as phased testing of reconciliations and controls. 
These activities, together with the regular reports from the external 
auditors, have supported the Audit Committee in providing its advice 
to the Board in respect of the effectiveness of internal controls (see 
section headed “Risk Management and Internal Control” on page 72).
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
CONTINUED THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 77
GOVERNANCE
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Company’s external auditor is Ernst & Young and Richard Wilson 
is the Audit Partner.
Independence 
During 2016, the Audit Committee conducted a competitive 
tender process, the details of which were reported in last year’s 
Annual Report & Accounts. The Board approved the Committee’s 
recommendation to appoint Ernst & Young as auditor in respect 
of the audit of FY17 onwards, and a resolution was approved by 
Shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting in February 
2017. Thorough conflict of interest checks were undertaken as 
part of the tender process and independence was one of the key 
considerations for the Committee when making its recommendation. 
Therefore the Committee considers that appointment of Ernst & 
Young will ensure a high level of independence is maintained and the 
Committee will continue to monitor this area.
Effectiveness
At its meeting in November 2017, the Committee considered the 
effectiveness of Ernst & Young as external auditor in respect of 
FY17. The review included consideration of comprehensive papers 
from both Management and the external auditor, and meetings 
with Management in the absence of the external auditor.
The effectiveness review considered matters such as: the 
competence of the key senior members of the team and their 
understanding of the business and its environment; the planning 
process; effectiveness in identifying key risks; technical expertise 
displayed by the auditors over complex accounting matters; 
communicating and resolving audit issues; timeliness of the 
audit process; cost; and communication of issues and risks to 
Management and the Committee.
Following the review, the Committee concluded that overall Ernst & 
Young had provided an effective and independent audit in respect 
of FY17. 
The Company confirms that it has complied with the provisions of 
the Competition and Markets Authority’s Statutory Audit Services 
Order in respect of the financial year under review.
Non-audit Fees
The Company has a Non-audit Fee Policy (the ‘Policy’) in place to 
ensure that the provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditor does not impair their independence or objectivity.
The Policy, which is appended as a schedule to the Audit 
Committee’s Terms of Reference, is published on the Group’s website 
at www.thomascookgroup.com. The Policy states that the external 
auditor should not be engaged in respect of services ‘blacklisted’ 
in the FRC’s Ethical Standard 2016. Any other material non-audit 
work must be authorised in advance by the Committee, unless the 
engagement is urgent, in which case the CFO can agree the work 
with the Committee Chair and report it to the next Committee 
meeting. The details of non-audit work (if any) are reported to the 
Committee on a six-monthly basis. 
Fees for non-audit services during the year totalled £202,604 
representing 13% of the fees paid to the external auditor (further 
information about non-audit fees can be found in Note 6 to the 
financial statements). Taking into consideration that £184,082 of 
this fee was in respect of the review of the Company’s half-year 
results, for which the Company’s external auditor must be used, 
the Committee considered the level of fees to be acceptable and 
did not consider it posed any risk to auditor independence. 
Planning
At its meeting in May 2017, the Committee considered and 
approved the external audit plan for the audit of the Group for FY17. 
The Committee considered significant risk areas for the audit, the 
proposed scope, the materiality threshold, the approach to internal 
audit and the transition from PwC to Ernst & Young.

MEETINGS ALSO ATTENDED BY: 
The other Non-Executive Directors, Peter Fankhauser (CEO), 
Michael Healy (CFO) and Alice Marsden (Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary). 
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE 
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for 
reviewing and proposing appointments to the Board and for 
recommending any other changes to the composition of the Board 
or its Committees. The principal responsibility of the Committee is 
to make recommendations to the Board on all new appointments to 
the Board, as well as Board balance and composition. The Committee 
ensures that there is clarity in respect of the role description and 
capabilities required for such appointments. The Committee is 
also responsible for reviewing the Directors’ potential conflicts of 
interest and for making recommendations to the Board in respect 
of authorising such matters. 
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee are available at 
www.thomascookgroup.com. 
ACTIVITIES
During the year, the Committee dealt with two significant tasks, 
firstly appointing two new Non-Executive Directors, and secondly 
appointing a new CFO.
The Committee considered the current skill set, experience and 
balance of the Board alongside the Company’s strategic goals 
and decided that, given the importance of the customer and the 
hotel portfolio to the Company’s strategy, it would recommend 
the appointment of two individuals with particular expertise in 
these areas.
The Committee provided a skills-based brief to executive search 
firm Egon Zehnder (who do not have any connection to the Company 
and are a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct of Executive 
Search Firms) and instructed them to compile a gender balanced 
long list of candidates for the roles. After a comprehensive search 
the Committee recommend that Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson, who has 
deep global hotel industry experience, and Jürgen Schreiber, who 
has extensive experience across retail and consumer goods, be 
appointed to the Board. More information about each Director can 
be found in the biography section on pages 63 to 64.
During the year the Committee also spent considerable time 
focusing on executive succession planning. Aware of the CFO’s 
intention to retire in the near future, the Committee oversaw a 
rigorous recruitment and selection process. Again the Committee 
instructed Egon Zehnder to compile a gender balanced long list 
of candidates and considered a number of external and internal 
candidates. This process resulted in the recommendation to appoint 
Bill Scott, currently Director of Financial Reporting, as successor to 
Michael Healy. In reaching its decision, the Committee considered 
Bill’s skill set, experience and achievements during his five years 
at the Company alongside the Company’s business plan and 
strategic goals. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
CONTINUED THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 79
GOVERNANCE
Other important work in the area of succession planning included 
considering how the annual talent review feeds into Executive 
succession planning and reviewing initiatives to strengthen 
the internal pipeline such as the ‘Leadership and Development 
Programme’ which aims to develop the leadership skills of c.90 
leaders in the business and the ‘Women’s Sponsorship Programme’ 
which aims to enhance the profile and opportunity for future female 
leaders. More information about the Group’s activities in this area 
can be found on page 39.
The Committee also considered:
 > the composition of the Committees following the appointment 
of two new Non-Executive Directors and recommended changes;
 > the extension of Annet Aris’ and Martine Verluyten’s appointment 
terms for a further three years;
 > re-appointment of Directors before making a recommendation 
to the Board regarding their re-election at the 2017 AGM; and
 > Directors’ potential conflicts of interests and independence.
BOARD DIVERSITY
The Board currently has 36% female representation which exceeds 
the Davies Review target for Boards to have a minimum of 33% 
female representation by 2020. The Chairman is a member of the 
30% Club, which has the aim of promoting the achievement of 30% 
of women on FTSE 100 Boards. The Committee continues to monitor 
gender diversity of senior management, including the Executive 
Committee and the TCLC (statistics for which are provided on 
page 39), and is mindful of the Hampton-Alexander Review targets 
in respect of gender diversity in senior management of FTSE 
100 companies.
The Board also acknowledges the target set by the Parker Review 
as a FTSE 250 company, to have at least one non-white Director by 
2024. As stated in the “People” section on page 39, ethnicity will be 
an area of increased focus for the Company in the coming year and 
the Committee will consider this aspect of diversity in the context 
of the Board. 
The Committee remains committed to ensuring a diverse and 
representative Board, and making appointments based on merit.

21 November 2017
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE 
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility to review, 
develop and oversee consistent policy, standards and procedures 
for managing health, safety and environmental risks to the Group’s 
business. It is also responsible for the review and oversight of 
compliance with relevant legislation and regulation relating to 
health, safety and the environment across the Group. 
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee are available at 
www.thomascookgroup.com. 
ACTIVITIES 
The Committee continued to put customer and employee safety at 
the forefront of its agenda. As well as closely monitoring activity 
in these areas, it provided strategic oversight and guidance to 
ensure that activities align with the Company’s strategy and values. 
The matters it considered within its four main areas of focus are: 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
CONTINUED THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 81
GOVERNANCE
POWERS OF DIRECTORS
The powers of the Directors are set out in the Articles. The Directors 
were authorised at the 2017 Annual General Meeting to allot shares 
equal to approximately one-third of the Company’s issued share 
capital as at 7 December 2016 or two-thirds in respect of a rights 
issue. The Directors were also given the power to allot Ordinary 
Shares for cash up to a limit representing approximately 10% of the 
Company’s issued share capital at 7 December 2016 without first 
offering them to existing Shareholders in proportion to their existing 
holdings (however more than 5% can only be used in connection 
with an acquisition or specified capital investment).
In accordance with its Articles, the Company has granted third-party 
indemnities, to the extent permitted by law, to each Director and the 
Group Company Secretary, which were in force during the financial 
year and up to the date of signing this report. The Company also 
maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance.
SHARE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS 
The Articles are designed to ensure that the number of the 
Company’s shares held by non-EEA nationals does not reach a level 
which could jeopardise the Company’s entitlement to continue to 
hold or enjoy the benefit of any authority, permission, licence or 
privilege which it, or any of its subsidiaries, holds or enjoys and 
which enables an air service to be operated (each an ‘Operating 
Right’). In particular, EC Council Regulation 1008/2008 on the licensing 
of air carriers requires that an air carrier must be majority-owned 
and effectively controlled by EEA nationals. 
The Articles allow the Directors, from time to time, to set a 
‘Permitted Maximum’ on the number of the Company’s shares 
which may be owned by non-EEA nationals at such level as they 
believe is in compliance with the Operating Rights, provided that the 
Permitted Maximum shall not be less than 40% of the total number 
of issued shares. 
The Company maintains a separate register (the ‘Separate Register’) 
of shares in which non-EEA nationals, whether individuals, bodies 
corporate or other entities have an interest (such shares are 
referred to as ‘Relevant Shares’ in the Articles). An interest in 
this context is widely defined (see below). The Directors may 
require relevant members or other persons to provide them with 
information to enable them to determine whether shares are, or are 
to be treated as, Relevant Shares. If such information is not provided, 
then the Directors will be able, at their discretion, to determine that 
shares to which their enquiries relate be treated as Relevant Shares. 
Registered Shareholders will also be obliged to notify the Company 
if they are aware either (a) that any share they hold ought to be 
treated as a Relevant Share for this purpose or (b) that any share 
they hold which is treated as a Relevant Share should no longer be 
so treated. In this case, the Directors shall request such information 
and evidence as they require to satisfy themselves that the share 
should not be treated as a Relevant Share and, on receipt of such 
evidence, shall remove particulars of the share from the Separate 
Register. If the Directors determine that such action is necessary 
to protect any Operating Right due to the fact that an Intervening 
Act (an “Intervening Act” being the refusal, withholding, suspension 
or revocation of any Operating Right or the imposition of materially 
SHARE CAPITAL 
The Company has the following three classes of shares in issue: 
Name

Ordinary Shares of €0.01 each 1,535,851,316
Deferred Shares of €0.09 each 934,981,938
Deferred Shares of £1 each 50,000
Ordinary Shares
The Ordinary Shares carry the right to the profits of the Company 
available for distribution and to the return of capital on a winding up 
of the Company. The Ordinary Shares carry the right to attend and 
speak at general meetings of the Company, each share holds the 
right to one vote. The Ordinary Shares are admitted to the premium 
segment of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock 
Exchange’s Main Market. 
Employees who hold shares under the Thomas Cook BAYE or vested 
shares under any of the Company’s executive share plans, are sent a 
Form of Instruction by the relevant trustee in respect of any general 
meetings of the Company, so that they may instruct the Trustee to 
vote on their behalf. 
Deferred Shares
Both classes of Deferred Shares carry no right to the profits of the 
Company. On a winding up, the holders of the Sterling-denominated 
Deferred Shares would be entitled to receive an amount equal to the 
capital paid up on each Sterling-denominated Deferred Share and the 
holders of the Euro-denominated Deferred Shares would be entitled 
to receive an amount equal to the capital paid up on each Euro-
denominated Deferred Share only after the holders of the Ordinary 
Shares and Sterling-denominated Deferred Shares have received, 
in aggregate, the amounts paid up thereon. The holders of both 
classes of Deferred Shares are not entitled to receive notice, attend, 
speak or vote (whether on a show of hands or on a poll) at general 
meetings of the Company. 
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION 
The Company’s Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’) may only 
be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of 
Shareholders. The Articles are available on the Company’s website 
at www.thomascookgroup.com. 
OTHER DISCLOSURES GOVERNANCE
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 82
OTHER DISCLOSURES 
CONTINUED
The Permitted Maximum is currently set at 45%. This Permitted 
Maximum may be varied by the Directors. If the Directors resolve 
to vary the Permitted Maximum to deal with shares as Affected 
Shares or relax the ownership limitations, they shall publish in at 
least one national newspaper in the UK (and in any other country in 
which the shares are listed) notice of the determination and of any 
Permitted Maximum. 
The Directors shall publish, from time to time: 
 > information as to the number of shares particulars of which have 
been entered on the Separate Register; and 
 > any Permitted Maximum that has been specified. 
The Directors may not register any person as a holder of shares 
unless such person has furnished to the Directors a declaration, 
together with such evidence as the Directors may require, stating 
(a) the name and nationality of any person who has an interest in 
any such share and, if the Directors require, the nature and extent 
of such interest or (b) such other information as the Directors may 
from time to time determine. 
The Directors may decline to register any person as a Shareholder 
if satisfactory evidence of information is not forthcoming. 
Existing holders of shares will be recorded on the Special Register 
unless and until they have certified, to the satisfaction of the 
Company, that they are EEA nationals. 
A person shall be deemed to have an interest in relation to Thomas 
Cook Group plc shares if: 
 > such person has an interest that would (subject as provided below) 
be taken into account, or which they would be taken as having, in 
determining for the purposes of Part 22 of the Companies Act 2006 
whether a person has a notifiable interest; or 
 > they have any such interest as is referred to in Part 22 of the 
Companies Act 2006, but shall not be deemed to have an interest 
in any shares in which their spouse or any infant, child or stepchild 
(or, in Scotland, pupil or minor) of theirs is interested by virtue of 
that relationship or which they hold as a bare or custodian trustee 
under the laws of England, or as a simple trustee under the laws 
of Scotland, and interest shall be construed accordingly. 
As at 30 September 2017, 527,456,364 Ordinary Shares (34.34%) were 
held on the Separate Register. 
inhibiting conditions or limitations on any Operating Right in either 
case, by any state or regulatory authority) has taken place or is 
contemplated, threatened or intended, or the aggregate number of 
Relevant Shares is such that an Intervening Act may occur or the 
ownership or control of the Company is such that an Intervening Act 
may occur, the Directors may, among other things: 
 > identify those shares that give rise to the need to take action 
and treat such shares as affected shares (‘Affected Shares’) (see 
below); or 
 > set a Permitted Maximum on the number of Relevant Shares that 
may subsist at any time (which may not, save in the circumstances 
referred to below, be lower than 40% of the total number of issued 
shares) and treat any Relevant Shares in excess of this Permitted 
Maximum as Affected Shares (see below). The Directors may serve 
a notice (an ‘Affected Share Notice’) in respect of any Affected 
Share. An Affected Share Notice can, if it so specifies, have the 
effect of depriving the registered holder of the right to attend, vote 
and speak at general meetings which they would otherwise have 
had as a consequence of holding such shares. Such an Affected 
Share Notice can, if it so specifies, also require the recipient to 
dispose of the Affected Shares (so that the Relevant Shares will 
then cease to be Affected Shares) within 21 days or such longer 
period as the Directors may determine. The Directors are also 
given the power to sell such Affected Shares themselves where 
there is non-compliance with an Affected Share Notice at the 
best price reasonably obtainable at the relevant time on behalf of 
the Shareholder. 
In deciding which shares are to be dealt with as Affected Shares, 
the Directors, in their sole opinion, will determine which Relevant 
Shares may give rise to the fact of risk of an Intervening Act 
occurring and, subject to any such determination, will have regard to 
the chronological order in which particulars of Relevant Shares have 
been, or are to be, entered in the Separate Register unless to do so 
would, in the sole opinion of the Directors, be inequitable. If there 
is a change in any applicable law or the Company or any subsidiary 
receives any direction, notice or requirement from any state or 
regulatory authority, which, in either case, necessitates such action 
to overcome, prevent or avoid an Intervening Act, then the Directors 
may either: 
 > lower the Permitted Maximum to the minimum extent that they 
consider necessary to overcome, prevent or avoid an Intervening 
Act; or 
 > resolve that any Relevant Shares shall be treated as Affected 
Shares. The rights of the Directors referred to above apply until 
such time as the Directors resolve that grounds for the making 
of a determination have ceased to exist, whereupon the Directors 
must withdraw such determination.  THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 83

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 30 September 
2017, our first report under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the 
‘Policy’) which was approved at our Annual General Meeting on 
9 February 2017. 
OUR PERFORMANCE IN FY17
This has been a year of real progress for Thomas Cook. In a very 
competitive environment, Management’s focus on executing our 
strategy for profitable growth has delivered a good financial 
performance for 2017 while at the same time transforming the 
Company’s opportunities for growth over the longer-term. 
Strong customer demand for our improved holiday offering across 
all source markets delivered a Group underlying EBIT of £330 million. 
This achievement is a strong sign of the Company’s resilience as a 
result of our ongoing transformation.
Nowhere is this transformation more clear than in our customers’ 
experience of Thomas Cook holidays. The Net Promoter Score, (NPS) 
– the key metric by which we measure customer satisfaction – 
increased a further 4 points in 2017. This reflects the very rigorous 
way our people now manage the quality and service at every stage 
of the holiday life-cycle. But it is also linked to a number of bold 
moves where the Company has innovated to modernise its offering 
and drive reappraisal of the package holiday such as the roll out 
of the 24-Hour Hotel Satisfaction Promise across 2,000 hotels – a 
strong sign of the Group’s commitment to putting customers at the 
heart of the business.
2017 also saw the announcement of a number of important 
developments that will transform the size and shape of the business 
for the future. These include the strategic alliance with Expedia 
and improving the Group’s financial position by both lowering 
the cost of financing and by extending the Group’s debt maturity 
profile. Taken together, the business has a strong platform on 
which to implement our clear strategy to deliver profitable growth 
and returns. 
The long-term sustainability of the business is based on the 
execution of a very clear strategy to transform Thomas Cook into 
a more streamlined business focused on a number of key areas 
where it can set itself apart from the competition. Our Policy directly 
links Executive Directors’ pay to the achievement of stretching 
performance targets which underpin that strategy. The Committee 
ensures that the performance measures selected in the incentive 
Plans reflect the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)of the business 
and therefore align the interests of the Executive Directors to those 
of your own.

PAY PHILOSOPHY
As a Committee, we remain very mindful of the sensitivities of 
executive pay felt by companies, employees, Shareholders and our 
customers. Our approach is to ensure that our Policy reflects our 
strategy, with outcomes that are fair and have a strong link to 
performance, and this remains our priority as a Committee. 
As set out in the Policy, fixed pay is set at median levels against 
the market, and the provision of benefits set by the local market 
in which the Executive Directors operates. Variable remuneration 
is a combination of both short and long-term incentives which are 
strongly linked to the rigorous execution of the strategy.
Stretching targets are set to incentivise and reward profitable 
growth, disciplined cash management, unrivalled customer service 
and long-term Shareholder value creation. The diagram below shows 
the alignment between our strategy (as set out on pages 4 to 5) and 
KPIs (as set out on page 32).

ANNUAL STATEMENT BY CHAIR OF REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
CONTINUED
THE 2017 POLICY
Last year, the Committee introduced an updated Policy which came 
into effect in February 2017 and included a number of best practice 
improvements. Whilst we were pleased that the Policy presented 
at the 2017 Annual General Meeting received approval, we recognise 
that there was a minority that voted against it, with particular 
concerns relating to the Strategic Share Incentive Plan (SSIP). 
Your support is very important to us. To alleviate some of your 
concerns around the SSIP, following the results of the Annual 
General Meeting, we made the commitment to make a future 
award under the SSIP only following full consultation with our 
major Shareholders as to the circumstances, the objective(s), the 
target(s) and the quantum of any award. We also committed to not 
proceeding without the full support of our major Shareholders. 
To date, the exceptional circumstances that would give rise to using 
the SSIP have not arisen and therefore the SSIP has not been used 
in FY17 and there are no plans to use it in FY18.
In addition, in response to your concerns around the maximum 
opportunity under the SSIP, we have capped the award to ensure 
that the maximum achievable under the SSIP will not exceed 
the maximum achievable under the PSP, being 200% of salary. 
An amended Policy with this change is not being presented for 
formal approval, however it has been reflected as notes to the 
future Policy table on pages 92 and 93.
The Committee also acknowledges your concerns with our approach 
to disclosing EPS targets retrospectively under the PSP. I would like 
to update you on the progress we have made here. To date, EPS 
targets have been directly linked to our business plan. This made 
them price sensitive and therefore we felt we could not disclose 
these prospectively. 
We have reviewed our target setting process and have developed 
a methodology that results in a target range which can now be 
disclosed prospectively. As such I am pleased to be able to share 
the target range for the upcoming PSP award to be made in FY18. 
In addition, in this report you will also find EPS target ranges for the 
two outstanding PSP awards. This brings our approach to disclosure 
in line with the market and aligns with our aim to be open and 
transparent on our long-term incentive plan targets.
As I mentioned earlier, a number of best practice changes were 
introduced during the year. These included: an increase to the 
shareholding requirement for Executive Directors; the addition of a 
holding period to all long-term incentive plans which provide for a 
five-year time horizon on all plans; aligning good leaver provisions; 
and capping the maximum employer pension benefit. We also 
reduced the level of vesting available for threshold performance 
under the PSP and improved bonus disclosure of targets by bringing 
forward disclosure by one year.
The changes we made and the way in which they have been 
implemented following approval of the Policy are set out in the 
table opposite:
Change made How we have implemented this change
Shareholding 
requirement for 
Executive Directors 
increased from 100%  
to 200% of salary
The CEO and CFO have holdings of 449% and 
300% respectively.
Good leaver provisions 
aligned across all Plans
The PSP vesting date for the CFO is aligned to 
the normal vesting date under each award. 
The bonus payment for the CFO will be made 
on the normal payment date and a proportion 
of the bonus will continue to be subject to a 
two-year deferral period.
Reduced the level of 
threshold vesting under 
the PSP from 30% to 25%
Put in place from the FY17 (December 2016) 
grant onwards.
Capped the maximum 
pension benefit within 
the Policy
New CFO pension arrangement set at a level 
below the cap – i.e. 20% if receiving the benefit 
as a cash allowance or 15% if receiving as 
an employer contribution into the pension 
scheme, instead of the Policy maximum of 
30%, to align more closely to the maximum 
an employee with long-service in the UK 
can receive.
Introduced a two-year 
holding period to the PSP 
(and SSIP)
Holding period written into the PSP rules ready 
for next grant in FY18 (December 2017). This 
means that all long-term incentive plans at 
Thomas Cook have a five-year time horizon in 
line with corporate governance guidelines and 
Shareholder expectations.
Strengthened malus and 
clawback
Whilst Thomas Cook was an early adopter of 
malus and clawback in the bonus plan and 
malus in the PSP, clawback events have been 
written into the PSP rules ready for next grant 
in FY18 (December 2017). Malus and clawback 
are now across all of our incentive plans.
Improved bonus target 
disclosure
Targets are now disclosed at the end of the 
performance year in line with corporate 
governance guidelines and Shareholder 
expectations. FY17 targets are disclosed in 
this report.
Improved EPS target 
disclosure
Last year we provided information on how 
EPS targets were set, and gave a performance 
update for targets under each outstanding 
award. This year we are prospectively 
disclosing target ranges for the upcoming 
PSP awards and disclosing target ranges for 
all outstanding awards. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 87
GOVERNANCE
CFO SUCCESSION
As previously announced, in January 2018, Bill Scott will succeed 
Michael Healy as CFO, following Michael’s decision to retire at the 
end of the year. The Board was delighted to make this internal 
promotion and look forward to welcoming Bill to the Board. 
The key components of Bill’s remuneration package were published 
on our Company website and announced via a regulatory news 
service (RNS) statement shortly after they were agreed, and are set 
out in detail on page 104.
Bill’s appointment will commence on 1 January 2018 following Michael 
stepping down from the Board. I would like to echo the Chairman’s 
comments on the significant contribution Michael has made to the 
Group as CFO and member of the Board.
The Committee agreed Michael’s leaving arrangements in line 
with the Policy and these were also disclosed at the time on our 
Company website and via the same RNS statement Full details of 
the arrangements are set out on page 104.
COMMITTEE AND ADVISER CHANGES
In addition to the forthcoming change to the Executive Board, we 
appointed two new Independent Non-Executive Directors to the 
Board. As mentioned previously by the Chairman on page 9, Paul 
Edgecliffe-Johnson was appointed to the Remuneration Committee 
on 21 September 2017. As part of the overall streamlining and 
reorganisation of the Committees, Emre Berkin stepped down from 
the Remuneration Committee effective 1 October 2017.
The Committee also took the opportunity to review the advisers 
to the Committee as part of its obligation to ensure continued 
independence, conducting a thorough and robust tender process 
during the year in which five firms were invited to participate. 
As described further on page 98, Mercer was selected and 
appointed, advising the Committee from September 2017.
Other Committee activities during the year included:
 > ongoing dialogue with Shareholders;
 > deciding the salary increases for the CEO and CFO for April 
2017, being an increase of 2 per cent in line with the overall 
employee population; 
 > determining performance against the targets set under the FY17 
annual bonus plan; 
 > deciding on the continued operation of the terms of the bonus plan 
and setting targets for the FY18 Plan;
 > determining award levels under the PSP for the grant to be made 
in FY18. As was the case last year, the PSP award will vest subject 
to challenging Relative TSR and EPS targets described more fully 
on page 104;
 > taking into consideration Corporate Governance updates 
throughout the year and;
 > performing annual governance checks; including the review of 
dilution limits, shareholding levels against Policy, reviewing risks 
associated with executive remuneration and the Committee’s 
activities against its Terms of Reference.
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES IN FY17
Short-term incentives
Progress has been made this year to deliver Group underlying EBIT 
growth, and strong cash flow management. Our ‘Customer at our 
Heart’ strategy continues to bear fruit and the Group has achieved 
another year of improvement in NPS.
This has resulted in a calculated achievement of 117 per cent of base 
salary for the CEO (77.7 per cent of the maximum bonus opportunity). 
The Group underlying EBIT and Group Free Cash Flow performance, 
along with strengthening the financial position of the Company, 
resulted in a calculated achievement of 128 per cent of base salary 
for the CFO (85.5 per cent of the maximum bonus opportunity). 
One third of bonus payments will be deferred in shares for a period 
of two years and will be subject to clawback during this time.
Targets and outcomes for the year are fully disclosed on page 100.
Long-term incentives
There were no awards made to Executive Directors during FY14, 
therefore no awards vested during FY17. 
The award made in FY15 (granted in March 2015) is subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions relating to FY17. The targets 
under this award reflected our aims of significant growth in 
earnings and a substantive improvement in our cash position, with a 
corresponding improvement in share price. As performance against 
the targets have not been achieved against the stretching targets, 
and share price performance is likely not to be achieved to the 
extent that the target requires, awards held by Executive Directors 
are anticipated to lapse in March 2018. The targets and outcomes 
under this award are shown on page 101.
Overall variable pay compared to the maximum available
Outcomes reflect progress made. However they also reflect that 
Thomas Cook is still in a period of business transformation and 
there is still a lot to do to deliver long-term value to Shareholders. 
Remuneration outcomes for the year were significantly lower 
than the maximum opportunity during FY17, as shown in the 
following charts:

APPROACH FOR FY18
Salary reviews
Salary reviews are undertaken annually in April of each year. 
Overall salary increases for the Group for 2018 have not yet been 
considered, with the exception of the following:
 > any increase that is awarded to Peter Fankhauser in April 
2018 will not exceed the increase provided to the general 
employee population
 > there will be no increase to Michael Healy’s base salary during FY18
 > Bill Scott, who will be assuming the role of CFO effective 1 January 
2018 will not receive a salary increase in April 2018
Short-term incentives
Two years ago, the bonus plan was reviewed to align to our 
‘Customer at our Heart’ strategy. The Plan was rolled out to all 
bonusable roles across the Group where possible, and continues 
to be operated consistently across the Group. For FY18, there will 
be full retrospective disclosure of targets and performance against 
these in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report. The annual 
bonus opportunity will remain at 150 per cent of base salary with 
one third of any payment being deferred into shares, this proportion 
aligns with the recently published Investment Association’s 
Principles of Remuneration which state that deferral should be 
applied to any bonus payments of more than 100 per cent of salary.
Long-term incentives
The Committee intends to grant PSP awards in FY18, shortly 
after announcement of our full year results. The award for 
Peter Fankhauser and Bill Scott will be at the normal grant level 
of 150 per cent. There will be no award made to Michael Healy 
following his notification to the Board of his forthcoming retirement. 
The performance conditions for the award will be Relative TSR and 
Basic EPS, the target range of which is disclosed on page 104.

judgement any formulaic output does not produce a fair result for either the individual Executive Director or the 
Company, taking account of the overall business performance or situation of the Company; and
 — the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment before vesting unless in specific ‘good leaver’ 
circumstances. Good leaver terms are described in more detail in the ‘Service Contracts and Loss of Office 
Payments’ section of this Policy.

level is capped 
at 200% (aligned 
to maximum PSP 
award)
 > The Committee 
will only use 
this award 
following 
consultation 
with major 
Shareholders
 > The Strategic Share Incentive 
Plan (SSIP) provides focus on 
near-term strategic targets 
that are important to the 
future strategic success of 
Thomas Cook
 > Long-term TSR targets 
support the creation of long-
term Shareholder value
 > A summary of the key features is set out below:
 — an individual Executive Director can only participate in the SSIP once every four years;
 — participation in the SSIP precludes participation in the PSP (or any other long-term incentive plan) in respect of that 
particular financial year;
 — an initial share-based award may be made based on the achievement against predefined strategic performance 
target(s) assessed over a period of at least two financial years;
 — the number of shares in the initial share-based award will be determined following the assessment of the strategic 
target(s);
 — the initial share-based award will be subject to a TSR multiplier measured over three years commencing in the year 
the individual is invited to participate in the SSIP;
 — awards will be subject to an additional holding period following the end of the TSR performance period, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise;
 — the Committee has full discretion to amend the level of vesting (upwards or downwards), if in its judgement any 
formulaic output does not produce a fair result for either the individual Executive Director or the Company, taking 
account of the overall business performance or situation of the Company; and
 — the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment before the initial share-based award is made, unless 
there are specific good leaver circumstances. If the participant leaves employment following the grant of the initial 
share-based award, the award will subsist on its original terms unless the Committee determines otherwise

PAYMENTS WHICH ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICY
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in connection 
with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting (the date the Company’s first Shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy came into effect); (ii) before the Policy set out above came into effect, provided that 
the terms of the payment were consistent with the Shareholder-approved Policy in force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a 
Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes 
‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the 
award is granted.

Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
 > Under the Plan rules, the aggregate value of all awards 
made in respect of any financial year must not exceed 
200% of base salary.
 > The normal maximum face value of awards is 150% of 
base salary. However, the Committee has a discretion 
to award up to the Plan rules maximum, when it 
believes the situation warrants a higher level of award. 
 > The performance measures for the PSP will be a combination of financial measures and share price-based measures, 
measured over at least a three-year performance period. Normally, the weightings will be as follows:
 — at least 40% will be based on financial measures;
 — at least 40% will be based on share price-based measures; and
 — the remaining proportion may be based either on financial or share price-based measures.
 > The performance measures may be adjusted, following grant, by the Committee to ensure a consistent basis of 
calculation and to provide a fair reflection of the Company’s performance
 > For achievement of a ‘threshold’ performance level (which is the minimum level of performance that results in any 
part of an award vesting), no more than 25% of each respective element of the award will vest
 > For achievement of a ‘maximum’ performance level (which is the highest level of performance that results in any 
additional vesting), 100% of each respective element of the award will vest
 > The Committee may determine that a ‘target’ level of performance is applicable to the award. The ‘target’ 
performance level will be between ‘threshold’ and ‘maximum’ performance levels and will be set in the context of the 
business Plan. For achievement of the ‘target’ performance, between 50% and 70% of each respective element of the 
award will vest
 > Normally, there will be straight-line vesting between ‘threshold’ and ‘maximum’, or when applicable, between 
‘threshold’ and ‘target’ and between ‘target’ and ‘maximum’
 > An initial award of shares of up to 150% of base salary 
can be made dependent on the achievement against 
strategic targets.
 > This initial award of shares may be increased by 33%

or decreased by 50% dependent on TSR performance 
(i.e. the overall maximum award size in respect of any 
financial year is 200%

performance that results in an initial award being made), no more than 25% of the maximum initial award will be 
made
 > For achievement of a ‘maximum’ performance level against the strategic targets (which is the highest level of 
performance that results in an initial award being made), an award equal to 100% of the maximum initial award will

EXPLANATORY DETAIL FOR FUTURE POLICY TABLE
Common award terms
Awards under any of the Company’s share Plans referred to in this 
report may:
a)  be granted as conditional share awards or nil or nominal-cost 
options or in such other form that the Committee determines has 
the same economic effect; 
b)   have any performance conditions applicable to them amended 
or substituted by the Committee if an event occurs which 
causes the Committee to determine an amended or substituted 
performance condition (s) would not be materially less difficult 
to satisfy; 
c)  incorporate the right to receive an amount (in cash or additional 
shares) equal to the value of dividends which would have been 
paid on the shares under an award, that vest up to the time of 
vesting (or where the award is subject to a holding period, at 
the end of the holding period). This amount may be calculated 
assuming that the dividends have been reinvested in the 
Company’s shares on a cumulative basis;
d) be settled in cash at the Committee’s discretion; and 
e)  be adjusted in the event of any variation of the Company’s share 
capital or any de-merger, de-listing, special dividend or other 
event that may affect the Company’s share price.
Explanation of chosen performance measures and the target 
setting process
Performance measures have been selected by the Committee to 
reflect the targets and key performance indicators that are critical 
to the delivery of our business strategy (as shown on page 85).
Challenging performance targets are set by the Committee each 
year for the annual bonus plan, PSP and when applicable, the SSIP. 
When setting these targets, the Committee will take into account 
a number of different reference points, including the Company’s 
business Plan and consensus analyst forecasts of the Company’s 
performance. Full vesting will only occur for what the Committee 
considers to be stretching performance against these targets. 
Malus and Clawback
As highlighted in the Policy table, malus and clawback arrangements 
are in place. The following elements of the remuneration package 
are subject to these provisions:
 > the cash part of the annual bonus will be subject to clawback 
provisions for a period of at least two years following payment; 
 > the unvested deferred annual bonus shares will be subject to 
malus provisions; and
 > the PSP and SSIP will be subject to malus and clawback provisions 
until the end of any holding period for a period of five years from 
the grant of a PSP award, or in the case of the SSIP, the date the 
Executive Director was invited to participate in the SSIP.
Malus and clawback may be applied in the following circumstances:
 > a material adverse misstatement or misrepresentation of the 
Company’s or any Group member’s financial statements; and/or
 > the participant or their team having engaged in gross misconduct 
or in conduct which resulted in significant losses, as determined 
by the Committee; and/or
 > the Company having suffered serious reputational damage or 
financial downturn, as determined by the Committee, as a result 
of any action (or in the case of awards under the new PSP or SSIP, 
any action or omission) taken by the participant, or their team.
Salary, pension and benefits are not subject to clawback. 
Shareholding requirements
Executive Directors are required to build and maintain a shareholding 
in the Company to a value of at least 200 per cent of base salary 
within a five-year period commencing on appointment as an 
Executive Director. 
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, those Executive 
Directors who do not at any point meet the shareholding 
requirements must hold any shares vesting net of tax under the 
Company’s share plans until the requirements are met.
Policy for the remuneration of employees generally
Remuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group 
based on the same principle of pay for performance. Reward should 
be achieved for delivery of our business strategy and should be 
sufficient to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre talent, without 
paying more than is necessary, with remuneration based on 
market rates.
Thomas Cook has operations based in a number of different 
countries and employees with different levels of skills and 
experience, and whilst based on the over-arching principle of 
pay for performance, reward policies may vary depending upon 
these factors. 
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION 
When agreeing a remuneration package for the appointment 
of a new Executive Director, the Committee will apply the 
following principles:
 > The remuneration package will be sufficient to attract, motivate 
and retain the high-calibre talent necessary to develop and deliver 
the business strategy
 > The Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than 
is necessary
 > In the next applicable Annual Remuneration Report, the 
Committee will explain to Shareholders the rationale for the 
relevant arrangements
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY 
CONTINUED THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 95
GOVERNANCE
The following variations may be considered by the Committee for 
inclusion in a recruitment package for an Executive Director:
Element Approach
Initial 
long-term 
incentive 
award
An initial long-term incentive award may be made in 
line with the opportunity in the Policy table (either 
200% under the PSP, or 150% under the SSIP with the 
opportunity to increase to 200%
1
 upon vesting subject 
to TSR performance). 
1
  The maximum award size was approved at 225%, however was 
subsequently capped at 200% and is reflected in the wording above and 
throughout this Policy.
The Committee will ensure:
 > the award is linked to the achievement of appropriate 
and challenging performance targets. The Committee 
has the flexibility to use different performance 
measures and weightings to those set out in the 
Policy table;
 > the award will be subject to the leaver provisions 
set out in the ‘Service Contracts and Loss of Office 
Payments’ section; and
 > awards will only be made following consultation.
Initial annual 
bonus 
opportunity
The initial annual bonus opportunity will be in line with 
the opportunity of 150%, as set out in the Policy table.
The Committee will ensure the award is linked to 
the achievement of appropriate and challenging 
performance targets. The Committee has the flexibility 
to use different performance measures and weightings 
to those set out in the Policy table.
Compensation 
for forfeited 
awards
The terms of any compensation will be determined 
by taking into account the terms of any forfeited 
awards, including:
 > performance achieved or likely to be achieved;
 > the proportion of performance/vesting period 
remaining; and
 > the form and timing of the original award. 
Notice period The initial notice period may be longer than the Company’s 
six-month Policy (up to a maximum of 24 months). 
However, this will reduce by one month for every month 
served, until the Company’s Policy position is reached.
Relocation 
costs
Where necessary, the Company will pay appropriate 
relocation costs, in line with market practice. 
The Committee will seek to ensure that no more 
is paid than is necessary.
Under reporting regulations, Thomas Cook is required to set out 
the maximum amount of variable pay which could be paid to a new 
Executive Director in respect of their recruitment. The Committee 
has set this figure in line with the maximum allowed under the 
short-term and long-term incentive Plans combined, being either 
350 per cent if a PSP award has been made, or 300 per cent (rising 
to a maximum of 350 per cent
1
 based on the TSR multiplier) if a SSIP 
has been made, in addition to the maximum opportunity under the 
annual bonus. This excludes the value of any compensation for 
forfeited awards.
1
  The maximum award size was approved at 225 per cent, however was subsequently capped at 
200 per cent and is reflected in the wording above and throughout this Policy. 
For an individual becoming Executive Directors as a result of an 
internal promotion from within Thomas Cook or as a result of an 
acquisition, any awards under other arrangements which were 
made prior to joining the Board may be allowed to continue under 
the original terms, or under a revised basis (such as a roll-over into 
Thomas Cook shares) if the Committee determines appropriate.
Fee levels for a new Chairman or new Non-Executive Directors 
will be determined in accordance with the Policy set out in the 
Policy table.
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LOSS OF 
OFFICE PAYMENTS
Executive Directors
 > Executive Directors have Company service contracts. For Peter 
Fankhauser and Michael Healy the service contracts provide 
for a six-month notice period, from both the Company and the 
Executive Director
 > If the Company terminates the employment of the Executive 
Director with immediate effect, a payment in lieu of notice may be 
made. This may include base salary, pension and benefits
 > The extent to which any performance linked elements of an 
Executive Director’s remuneration package will be delivered will 
depend on the circumstances of the Executive Director’s departure 
and whether the Committee considers the Executive Director 
to be a ‘good leaver’. A ‘good leaver’ scenario may constitute 
circumstances where the Executive Director leaves because 
of disability, injury, ill-health, redundancy or retirement or the 
Executive Director’s employing company or business being sold out 
of the Group, for any other reason that the Committee determines 
appropriate, or on the Executive Director’s death
 > If an Executive Director leaves as a ‘good leaver’ during the annual 
bonus performance year or before the normal bonus payment 
date, a bonus payment in respect of the year may be made, which 
will be pro-rated to reflect the portion of the performance year 
elapsed and performance achieved at the end of the performance 
year. This bonus may be paid in such proportions of cash and 
shares as determined by the Committee and paid on the normal 
payment dates
 > If the participant leaves as a ‘good leaver’ before the end of the 
deferral period, any unvested deferred bonus awards will vest at 
the normal vesting date
 > Any ‘good leaver’s’ unvested awards under the PSP vest to 
the extent determined by the Committee taking into account 
performance achieved against any relevant performance targets 
and the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed 
 > SSIP awards will lapse if the individual leaves prior to the initial 
share-based award being made, unless in a good leaver scenario, 
defined for the purposes of the SSIP as death, ill-health, injury 
or disability only. If a participant in the SSIP leaves after the 
initial share-based award has already been made, the award will 
continue to subsist on its original terms, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise GOVERNANCE
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 96
 > Where PSP and SSIP awards are subject to an additional 
holding period, they will be released following the end of the 
holding period, unless in the case of death when vesting will be 
accelerated. Awards structured as options shall be exercisable 
for a period of six months (or 12 months in the case of death) from 
vesting (or where subject to a holding period, release)
 > In the event of a takeover or winding-up of the Company (other 
than as part of an internal re-organisation of the Thomas Cook 
Group), PSP and SSIP awards may vest to the extent determined 
by the Committee, taking into account the performance achieved 
against any relevant performance targets and, the proportion of 
the vesting period that has elapsed (in the case of PSP awards) 
and the period of time that has elapsed since grant (in the case 
of SSIP awards where the strategic performance condition(s) 
have not yet been satisfied). Vested awards will be released from 
any holding periods at the time of transaction. Where a takeover 
occurs after an Executive Director has been invited to participate 
in the Plan but prior to the grant of the initial share-based award, 
the Committee may grant the individual an award which takes into 
account the Company’s performance and the length of time the 
individual has been a participant in the SSIP
 > Awards may alternatively be ‘rolled over’ into new shares of an 
acquiring company or at the Committee’s discretion be amended 
or allowed to subsist on their original terms. In the event of any 
demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which, in the 
Committee’s opinion, may affect the Company’s current or future 
share price, awards may, at the Committee’s discretion, vest (and 
be released) on the same basis as for a takeover
 > The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments 
in connection with an Executive Director’s cessation of office 
or employment where the payments are made in good faith in 
discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages 
for breach of such an obligation) or by way of a compromise or 
settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation 
of an Executive Director’s office or employment. Any such 
payments may include but are not limited to paying any fees for 
outplacement assistance and/or the Executive Director’s legal and/
or professional advice fees in connection with their cessation of 
office or employment
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, are appointed 
pursuant to a letter of appointment. The notice period for the 
Chairman is three months, and one month for the other Non-
Executive Directors. All Non-Executive Directors are subject to 
annual re-election by Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment continue 
until the date stated in their appointment letter unless they are 
terminated for cause, or on the notice period stated, or if they are 
not re-elected at the Annual General Meeting. The Directors’ service 
contracts and letters of appointment are kept for inspection by 
Shareholders at the Company’s registered office.
OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS
The Company recognises the benefits to the individual, and to the 
Group, of Executive Directors taking on external appointments 
as Non-Executive Directors. Subject to the approval of the 
Committee an Executive Director may accept such appointments 
at other companies or other similar advisery or consultative roles. 
The Committee has set a limit of one external appointment for 
each Executive Director, to one FTSE 100 or 250 company, or an 
international company of a similar size. The Board will review the 
time commitment of all outside appointments and ensure that it 
is satisfied that this will not negatively impact upon the Executive 
Director’s time commitment to the performance of Thomas 
Cook duties.
The Committee will allow Executive Directors to retain any 
fees payable.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONS 
ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY
When setting the Policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration, 
the Committee has regard to the pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere within the Group. This includes consideration of: 
 > salary increases for the general employee population;
 > overall spend on annual bonus;
 > participation levels in the annual bonus and any long-term 
incentive plans;
 > company-wide benefits (including pension); and
 > any other relevant factors as determined by the Committee
In order to take into account the views of the general employee 
population when formulating Executive Director pay Policy, the 
Committee may review information provided by the HR function and 
feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF 
SHAREHOLDER VIEWS 
The Company is committed to ongoing engagement and seeks major 
Shareholder views in advance of proposing significant changes to its 
remuneration policies.

ILLUSTRATIVE PERFORMANCE SCENARIOS 
This section illustrates the levels of remuneration that may be received by the current Executive Directors. Their remuneration  
is set in accordance with the Policy. The charts below show three scenarios: (a) fixed pay, comprising of base salary, benefits and pension, 
(b) mid and (c) maximum of overall potential:
In developing the scenarios, the following annualised assumptions have been made:
(a) Fixed Based on fixed pay being received only, for example, base salary, benefits and pension.
This is calculated for Peter Fankhauser and Michael Healy as follows:
 > Base salary at the date of this report
 > Benefits are based on the amount shown in the single figure table in this year’s Annual Report on remuneration
 > Pension measured by applying cash in lieu rate against base salary as at the date of this report
The calculation basis for Bill Scott is as follows:
 > Base salary at 1 January 2018
 > Benefits are based on an estimated amount based on the contractual arrangements
 > Pension measured by applying cash in lieu rate against base salary at 1 January 2018
Base salary (£’000s) Benefits (£’000s) Pension (£’000s) Total fixed (£’000s)
CEO £718 £76 £215 £1,009
CFO (Michael Healy) £541 £26 £135 £702
CFO (Bill Scott) £420 £16 £84 £520
(b) Mid If performance is in line with the Company’s expectations:
 > Annual bonus pays out at 60% of maximum for on-target performance, based on a maximum annual eligibility of 150% of salary
 > For Peter Fankhauser and Bill Scott only: A PSP award with a face value of 150% of base salary pays out 60% of maximum
(c) Maximum If performance is in line with the maximum eligibility levels:
 > Full pay-out of annual bonus i.e. 150% of salary with stretching performance achieved
 > For Peter Fankhauser and Bill Scott only: A PSP award with a face value of 150% of base salary pays out at 100% of maximum in line 
with stretching performance
Note: 
As required by the regulations, PSP awards (and amounts included within the bonus which have been deferred into shares) are set out at 
face value, with no share price growth assumptions.

ANNUAL REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION
The Remuneration Committee presents its Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration, which is set out within 
this section. Decisions taken on remuneration during the year are in line with our Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, which was approved at our Annual General Meeting in February 2017.
CONSIDERATION BY THE DIRECTORS OF MATTERS 
RELATING TO DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for recommending 
to the Board the Policy for Executive Directors and for setting the 
remuneration packages for each Executive Director.
The Committee also has input into the remuneration arrangements 
of the Executive Committee in conjunction with the CEO, and has 
oversight of the Policy and remuneration packages for other senior 
leaders with particular focus on the variable pay elements, ensuring 
incentives are consistently applied beyond the CEO and CFO to 
ensure the execution of the strategy throughout the organisation.
The aim of the Committee is to align Remuneration Policy to 
the overall strategy of the Thomas Cook Group, and to ensure 
remuneration reflects our Shareholders’ and customers’ interests, 
governed by our Policy and its philosophy and principles.
During the year, the Committee had six scheduled meetings. At the 
end of each financial year at the Committee’s meeting in September 
a review is undertaken of activities against its Terms of Reference 
(available on the Thomas Cook Group plc website) to ensure the 
Committee is properly fulfilling its duties and responsibilities.
Attendees
The Committee invites individuals to attend meetings, as it deems 
beneficial, to assist it in reviewing matters for consideration. 
Individuals who have provided support and advice to the Committee 
during the year include the Board members, Alice Marsden – Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary, Rachael Gillett – Group 
& UK HR Director, Caroline Forsyth – Group Head of Reward, Emily 
Hallett – Executive Remuneration Manager and a representative 
from each of the Committee’s independent external advisers, being 
Mitul Shah – Partner, Deloitte, and Pete Smith – Partner, Mercer. 
Warren Tucker, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is also 
a member of the Audit Committee and, as such, ensures there 
is knowledge and coordination in respect of risk and accounting 
issues. No Director or senior executive is present at the section 
of the meeting when their own remuneration arrangements are 
being discussed.
External advisers
Under its Terms of Reference, the Committee obtains the advice of 
external independent remuneration consultants and is responsible 
for their selection and appointment. The Committee also considers 
the independence and effectiveness of the Adviser, and it was 
decided that after a five-year period of working with Deloitte as 
adviser to the Remuneration Committee, it would be appropriate and 
good governance to put the role out to tender. Following a formal 
tender process involving five firms which included Deloitte, following 
references being undertaken, the Committee was delighted to 
appoint Mercer as its independent remuneration adviser.
Mercer commenced work with the Committee in August 2017 and 
fees for the two-month period were £43,050 for advice in relation 
to executive remuneration. Deloitte’s fees for the preceding 
part of the year were £79,500. Both fees covered attendance at 
Committee meetings, general advice and updates on remuneration 
developments with the total fees paid to advisers equating to 
£122,550 for FY17. 
Deloitte also provided advice in relation to miscellaneous consulting 
services as well as international mobility, tax, corporate finance and 
internal audit advice. Mercer provided advice in relation to pensions 
and insured benefits.
Mercer and Deloitte are both members of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group (RCG) and comply with its Code of Conduct. 
The Committee is satisfied that their advice was and continues to 
be objective and independent. 
The following pages set out the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors during FY17, and the intended approach for FY18. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 99

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THE SINGLE FIGURE TABLE (AUDITED)
Further information in respect of the base salary, pension, annual bonus and PSP amounts is shown in this section:
Salary
The table below shows the base salaries of Peter Fankhauser and 
Michael Healy at the end of FY17 and at the end of the previous 
financial year. Salary increases were effective 1 April 2017.
 
Salary at  
30 September 2017
Salary at

Percentage
increase
Peter Fankhauser £717,800 £703,800 2.0%
Michael Healy £541,200 £530,600 2.0%
The salary increases awarded to the Executive Directors were in line 
with the overall salary increase budget (expressed as a percentage) 
across the Group during the 2017 annual salary review and were 
in line with the level of increase awarded to the general employee 
population where individual performance was ‘effective’.
Pensions (audited)
Currently, both Peter Fankhauser and Michael Healy receive a 
taxable cash allowance of an amount equivalent to 30 per cent 
and 25 per cent of base salary respectively. These allowances are 
broadly in line with the equivalent maximum net contribution for 
UK-based employees who are eligible to receive up to 15 per cent of 
reference salary from the Company in pension contributions, which 
are paid as gross employer contributions into the Company’s defined 
contribution pension plan. 
FY17 Group Bonus Plan, (the Plan) (audited)
The maximum Plan opportunity for both Peter Fankhauser and 
Michael Healy was 150 per cent of base salary, one third of which is 
subject to deferral into shares to be held for two years, subject to 
malus (clawback before the vesting date), as described on page 94.
As described in the Chairman’s statement on page 87, bonus 
outcomes reflect the progress made against a number of the 
Group’s KPIs and progress in the delivery of the strategic and 
ongoing transformation of the business. Therefore there is an 
element of payout against each of the core bonus measures and 
role-specific objectives, as set out in the table on the following page. 
For the CEO, the role-specific objectives were partly achieved, (13 per 
cent out of 15 per cent) of the maximum bonus opportunity and is 
described below.
The role-specific leadership objective is measured by the overall 
engagement of colleagues across the Group, underpinned by 
rigorous performance management and customer focus of the 
leadership team. As described in the KPIs section on page 32 and in 
our people report on page 39, the very high core-index score of 74 
per cent was maintained in 2017, resulting in an achievement of 3 per 
cent out of the 5 per cent for this element of the Plan.  GOVERNANCE
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 100
ANNUAL REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
CONTINUED
The second role-specific objective, (equating to 10 per cent of the 
maximum bonus opportunity) was achieved through the partnership 
entered into with Expedia. This partnership gives our customers 
a much bigger choice of hotels in City and Domestic and delivers 
on the Complementary part of our Group-wide strategy that was 
set out last year. It is a catalyst for restructuring the business 
and simplifying systems and processes, so that the focus on core 
package holidays can be achieved. By using Expedia’s superior 
technology, leveraging their global reach, volume and expertise, 
the Group will be able to significantly reduce costs and complexity 
within the business for the long-term. This objective was therefore 
fully achieved.
For the CFO, achievement against the role-specific objectives was 
in respect of the implementation of a Board-approved financial plan 
that delivered tangible steps towards improving the Group’s financial 
position. In December 2016, the Company took advantage of positive 
market sentiment to issue a new €750 million bond due in 2022, with 
a coupon of 6.25 per cent. The proceeds from this bond were used to 
repay two more expensive bonds due in 2017 and 2020. As a result, 
this refinancing exercise improved the Group’s financial position by 
both lowering the cost of financing and by extending the Group’s 
debt maturity profile. Accordingly, the Committee has concluded 
that this refinancing fully satisfies the achievement of this element 
(50 per cent) of the CFO’s bonus criteria for FY17.

1  As disclosed in prior years, bonus targets in relation to Group underlying EBIT are set on a fixed currency basis at the beginning of the performance period, therefore the achievement used for bonus 
purposes is different from the achievement stated earlier in the report
2  Group underlying EBIT is defined as Earnings before interest and tax excluding exceptional items measured on a constant currency basis.
3  Group Free Cash Flow is defined as Group Cash Flow for the financial year before payments/receipts in respect of tax and payments/receipts associated with exceptional items, where exceptional items 
include restructuring costs and asset disposals.
4  Net Promoter Score (NPS): NPS is the main customer key performance indicator of the Group. It shows the degree of customer loyalty and recommendations by reference to responses from our 
customer feedback survey when asked, ‘How likely would you recommend Thomas Cook to your friends & family?’. It is calculated by taking the percentage of promoters and deducting the percentage 
of detractors.
Note: In order for there to be any payment under the Plan, the two financial hurdles of Group underlying EBIT and Group Free Cash Flow must be achieved. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 101

The graph below shows the TSR for holders of Thomas Cook Group plc Ordinary Shares for the nine-year period since 30 September 2008, 
measured against the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure Index. These indices were chosen as relevant comparators, 
as the Company is a member of both indices, with one reflecting a broad equity index and the other being specific to the travel sector. 
The calculation of TSR is in accordance with the relevant remuneration regulations and is broadly the change in market price together with 
reinvestment of dividend income. This graph shows the value of £100 invested in Thomas Cook Group plc on 30 September 2008 compared

COMPONENTS OF THE CEO
The table below sets out the percentage change in the remuneration 
of the CEO. It also sets out the average percentage change in the 
remuneration of other employees in the Group. A peer group of 
UK-based employees has been selected. We have selected this peer 
group as the CEO is UK-based and therefore pay movement in this 
peer group is subject to similar external market conditions. We have 
excluded employees subject to long-term collective agreements for 
the same reason, in order to ensure that the comparison is on a

Notes:
1  The main benefits provided to UK-based employees are private health insurance, life assurance, 
travel concessions and car allowances. The increase in benefits for the CEO is a result of 
increased premiums on private health insurance, life assurance and the continuation of tax 
advice relating to Peter’s former expatriate arrangement. 
2 In order to provide the most direct comparison possible, the above calculation includes all UK-
based employees participating in the Thomas Cook Bonus Plan which have a significant Group 
element to the Plans. Bonus payouts in FY16 were 22% for the CEO and on average 36% for those 
in the Group Bonus Plan. In FY17, achievement for the CEO was 78% and for those who are UK-
based and in the Thomas Cook Bonus Plan the average payout level will be 73%. The difference 
is caused by the achievement of the UK and Airline element of the Plans being lower than the 
Group achievement,

FINANCIAL YEAR
2018 salary reviews
Salary reviews for the Group are in April each year. The Committee 
will undertake the annual salary review for the CEO at this time, 
with no increase in April 2018 for the new CFO due to the timescales 
associated with the appointment.
FY18 Group Bonus Plan
FY18 maximum opportunity for Executive Directors’ annual bonus will 
remain at 150 per cent of base salary. Any payments under the FY18 
Plan will be subject to financial hurdles for the Group underlying 
EBIT and Group Unlevered Free Cash Flow measures being met. 
Core measures focus on our customer, profit and cash measures 
to drive business performance and growth, with role-specific 
objectives set to support the delivery of our ‘Customer at our Heart’ 
strategy through the continued growth of our own-brand hotel 
offering, delivering on the new partnerships entered into where we 
can leverage our brand to tap into new opportunities for growth. 
For FY18, Group Unlevered Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flow 
before payments/receipts in respect of interest and any cash 
amounts associated with acquisitions/disposals, payment of 
dividends or the refinancing of the Group’s bank facilities and bonds.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Committee will grant the next award under the PSP following 
the announcement of our FY17 results in accordance with the 
current Policy. Peter Fankhauser and Bill Scott will each be made 
awards equating to a face value of 150 per cent of salary. There will 
be no award made to Michael Healy. 
In line with the Remuneration Policy and our previous two PSP 
grants, the awards will vest to the extent stretching EPS and 
Relative TSR targets (weighted equally) are achieved over a three-
year performance period. Following the end of the vesting period, 
awards will be subject to a two-year holding period.
Targets under the award are set out below:

strategy, expectations for future years as incorporated into our 
long-term Business Plan, growth expectations within our sector, and 
historical performance. 
The EPS vesting schedule is non-linear with an intermediate point. 
The Committee may take into account the impact of any major 
restructuring plans (not envisaged when setting the target) when 
assessing performance against the EPS target, to ensure the 
PSP rewards actions taken by management which are in the best 
long-term interests of Shareholders. Details of the intermediate 
point will be disclosed retrospectively following the end of the 
performance period.
EPS targets ranges for both outstanding awards are shown on

CFO TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS
Michael Healy stands down from the Board and his role as CFO 
with effect from 31 December 2017. He remains available to Peter 
Fankhauser, Bill Scott and the Board to assist with the transition 
and will leave employment with Thomas Cook on 31 March 2018. 
Michael will be retiring from the Company and will be treated as 
a good leaver in respect of his outstanding awards. The leaving

approved by Shareholders at the 2017 Annual General Meeting:
 > There are no payments for loss of office
 > Salary and benefits will be paid in full on a monthly basis during 
the notice period
 > The FY17 bonus is disclosed on page 100. One third of this bonus 
will be deferred for a period of two years
 > The FY18 bonus will be determined by the Committee in November 
2018 following the end of the financial year, and will be prorated to 
reflect the period employed in the year. One third of the FY18 bonus 
will also be subject to deferral for a period of two years however 
will be deferred as cash as Michael will not be an employee of the 
Group at the time of grant
 > There will be no FY18 PSP award made
 > All outstanding PSP awards will vest at the normal vesting date i.e. 
on the three-year anniversary from grant and will be prorated to 
reflect the period employed
 > Outstanding deferred bonus awards will vest in full at the normal 
vesting dates, subject to there being no clawback events occurring 
during the vesting period
 > Malus and clawback provisions remain in force throughout
After ceasing employment with Thomas Cook, Michael will continue his 
Non-Executive Director roles in Thomas Cook China and Thomas Cook 
Money. The single consolidated fee for these Board roles will be £80,000 
per annum in total, with any additional consultancy fee for advisery 
work to the Thomas Cook Group plc paid at a rate of £5,000 per day. It is 
expected that the latter fees will not exceed £60,000 per annum.
Bill Scott will be appointed as an Executive Director and CFO with 
effect from 1 January 2018. His remuneration for FY18 for the period 
in which he is Executive Director will be reported in the FY18 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. The key terms were disclosed via 
RNS on 28 September 2017 following the Board’s decision to appoint 
Bill, and are also summarised below:
 > Annual base salary: £420,000; next salary review date April 2019
 > Pension: 15 per cent contribution into the Thomas Cook defined 
contribution pension scheme, or if taken as cash, a taxable 
allowance of 20 per cent of salary
 > Car allowance: £12,000 per annum
 > Annual bonus: 150 per cent of base salary of which one third is 
subject to deferral for a period of two years
 > PSP award: 150 per cent of base salary
 > Shareholding requirement of 200 per cent of base salary
 > Benefits in line with Policy
In addition to existing PSP awards granted within the Policy, Bill Scott 
also has an existing share award granted to him in December 2016 
under the Restricted Share Plan (RSP). The Committee has determined,

SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENT (AUDITED)
Under our Shareholding Requirement Policy, Executive Directors are 
required to build up within five years of appointment to the Board, 
and maintain a minimum shareholding of 200 per cent of base 
salary, increased from 100 per cent earlier during the year. Until the 
shareholding requirement is met, vested shares cannot be sold, 
other than to pay tax in respect of the relevant award. 
To ensure alignment with Shareholders and to encourage a 
share ownership culture across the senior team, members of the 
Executive Committee are required to build up within five years of 
becoming an Executive Committee member, and maintain 50 per 
cent of base salary in the Company’s shares. 
In line with the Policy, the value of the Directors’ holding has 
been calculated by taking the greater of: a) the initial financial 
commitment; and b) the market value at 30 September 2017.
At 30 September 2017, the shareholding of Peter Fankhauser 
and Michael Healy were 449 per cent and 300 per cent of salary 
respectively, as shown below:

DETAILS OF SHARE PLANS
Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
Under the DBP, one third of any bonus payment made to Executive Directors under the Group Bonus Plan is deferred into shares for a period 
of two years on a compulsory basis. The DBP awards shown in the previous table represent one third of the FY15 bonus and FY16 bonus 
respectively. DBP awards are made at the earliest opportunity following bonus payment date, and are released on the second anniversary of 
the actual bonus payment date. 
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Under the PSP, participants are awarded a conditional award of shares in Thomas Cook Group plc. Shares under the awards will vest to 
the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions measured over three years being met. Performance conditions for awards up to 
and including March 2015, were based on absolute share price, Group underlying EBIT and Group Cash Conversion. For subsequent awards, 
granted from December 2015 onwards, the performance conditions are Relative TSR and Basic EPS. Performance conditions for the 
outstanding awards are shown on the following page.

The Board acknowledges the views of Shareholders who voted against the above resolutions at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
The Board’s aim is to consult regularly with major Shareholders and achieve the maximum possible support for all proposals. On this 
basis, the Board consulted with a number of key Shareholders and proxy advisory bodies at the start of the 2017 financial year, and again 
in the weeks leading up to the Annual General Meeting. This showed that there was misalignment with a small number of institutional 
Shareholders and was a serious concern to the Board. Therefore, we listened to the feedback which are set out below, and took the 
following actions:
Policy Review and SSIP (Remuneration Policy Resolution)
A number of Shareholders raised concerns in relation to the SSIP. From the feedback, it was clear that concern centred on the level of 
disclosure in respect of potential strategic objectives and the maximum potential award level. It also became clear that views were split 
with no clear consensus on the issue amongst Shareholders.
The SSIP was put in place to cater for exceptional circumstances that would warrant an alternative long term incentive plan. The Committee 
did not make use of the SSIP in FY17 and has no need to in FY18.  In response to Shareholder concerns following the AGM the Board made the 
following commitments:
 > The Committee would use the SSIP following consultation and with the support of our major Shareholders and;
 > The maximum opportunity under the SSIP, if it were used, would be capped so that it would not exceed that of the PSP (i.e. 200% of salary)
A revised Policy has not been presented back to Shareholders for approval. However, the current approved Policy has been updated to reflect 
the above commitments.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Target Disclosure (Remuneration Report Resolution)
Some Shareholders wanted to see EPS targets under the PSP disclosed prospectively. The need to provide Shareholders with assurance that 
the PSP is based on stretching targets that drive strong performance and have a direct positive impact on Company performance, and thus 
an increase in Shareholder value, is clear.
Up to and including the FY17 award granted in December 2016, EPS targets had been explicitly and directly linked to the business plan. 
This made them price sensitive. However, following Shareholder feedback, as described earlier in this report the Committee has developed 
a new methodology for setting targets that is based on a number of other factors and does not directly link to the business plan. This new 
methodology has enabled the prospective disclosure of EPS target ranges for the FY18 PSP grant in the FY17 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
There are also two outstanding awards where EPS targets have not been previously disclosed. In the commitment made to Shareholders to 
provide greater transparency, the FY17 Directors’ Remuneration Report has also disclosed target ranges for these two awards.
Finally, the maximum size of awards under the PSP is 200% of salary but the normal award to Executive Directors is 150% of salary. 
In December 2016, Peter Fankhauser, CEO was granted an award of 165% of salary under this provision to incentivise his continued leadership, 
drive and commitment he demonstrates and the profitable growth he is expected to deliver over the long-term. Some Shareholders felt there 
was not a strong enough rationale to support this. For FY18, the award for Peter Fankhauser will be set at the normal award level of 150% of 
base salary. 
I would like to take this final opportunity to assure you, our Shareholders, that we take seriously your views and act upon them, which I 
hope you can see we have demonstrated this year.

those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. 
We are independent of the Group and Company in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and 
viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the 
Annual Report, in relation to which the ISAs(UK) require us to report to 
you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
 > the disclosures in the Annual Report set out on pages 56 to 59 that 
describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
 > the Directors’ confirmation set out on page 72 in the Annual Report 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 > the Directors’ statement set out on page 72 in the financial 
statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements;
 > whether the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern 
required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in 
the audit; or 
 > the Directors’ explanation set out on page 72 in the Annual Report 
as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period 
to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 110
Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee 
Revenue recognition due to the susceptibility to management override through inappropriate manual journals (£9,007m, FY16 restated: £7,810m)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 75); Accounting policies (page 127); and Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 130 to 133)
The accounting for revenue is 
susceptible to management override 
through the recording of manual, 
top side journal entries either in the 
underlying ledgers or via consolidation.
We understood the Group’s revenue recognition policies and how they are applied. 
We identified a change in the application of the accounting policy for revenue recognition 
on third-party commission income in the UK during the year.
We have assessed the design of key controls and where appropriate, tested the operating 
effectiveness of controls over revenue and the financial statement close process.
For a number of reporting units, as part of our overall revenue recognition testing 
we used data analysis tools on 100% of revenue transactions in the year to test the 
correlation of revenue to cash receipts to verify the occurrence of revenue. For those 
in-scope businesses where we did not use data analysis tools, we performed appropriate 
alternative substantive procedures over revenue recognition including tests of details for 
a sample of revenue transactions.
Other audit procedures specifically designed to address the risk of management override 
of controls included journal entry testing, placing particular focus on manual journal 
entries in revenue.
Using data extracted from the accounting system, we tested the appropriateness of 
journal entries impacting revenue, as well as other adjustments made in the preparation 
of the financial statements.
We performed cut-off testing for a sample of revenue transactions around the period end 
date, to check that they were appropriately recorded as revenue or revenue received in 
advance based on the date of travel and other attributes of package holidays.
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk area in 28 locations, 
which covered 86% of the Group’s revenue.
Based on the audit procedures performed 
we did not identify evidence of material 
misstatements in the revenue recognised 
in the current year. The impact of the 
change in application of the accounting 
policy was not material to the 
financial statements.
Our journal entry testing procedures did 
not identify any instances of inappropriate 
management override in the recognition 
of revenue across the Group.
Leased aircraft maintenance provisions (£366m, FY16 restated: £330m)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 75); Accounting policies (page 127); and Note 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 155 to 156)
The Group recognises provisions for 
maintenance obligations in relation 
to leased aircraft. The calculation 
of aircraft maintenance provisions 
requires complex judgements and 
estimates to be made based on 
forecast aircraft utilisation, estimates 
of future maintenance costs, planned 
rollover and renewal of the aircraft 
fleet. In addition judgement is required 
to determine the appropriate rate to 
discount the provision.
We have evaluated the methodology and key assumptions adopted by Management in its 
calculation of aircraft maintenance provisions and walked through the controls over the 
process. This involved the following procedures:
 > Understanding the process and testing the arithmetical accuracy and integrity of 
the data in the provision models
 > Challenging the consistency and reasonableness of the assumptions adopted. 
This included a review of discount rates, testing of source data in the model to 
information from lessors and comparison of assumptions to contract terms
 > Testing the cost estimates of future maintenance events to the latest rate reviews 
in contracts, tenders or historical cost experience 
 > For the timing of future maintenance, we corroborated the maintenance interval limits 
to the manufacturer’s information and tested the actual flight hours to the technical logs 
and the forecast flying hours to the forecast flying hour plans
We have tested the completeness of the provisions by comparison to fleet and financing 
registers and reviewing lease agreements for hand back obligations.
We assessed the discount rate applied to the provision. Using our valuation specialists, 
we determined the appropriate rate to be applied to this provision by reference to IFRS 
guidance in this area.
We concluded the assumptions within the 
models used to calculate the provision 
before discounting as at 30 September 
2017 were appropriate and supported by 
underlying evidence.
We concluded an adjustment for credit 
risk that had been applied to the risk-free 
discount rate was not required. This also 
applied to previous years. An adjustment 
to correct this was recorded as a prior 
year adjustment. See Note 33.
Provision for illness claims and associated recoveries from suppliers (Illness provision £24.4m, FY16: 19.9m;  
Recoveries from suppliers £20.6m, FY16 (restated): £8.0m)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 75); Accounting policies (page 126); and Note 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 155 to 156)
There has been a significant increase 
in the number of illness-related claims 
from customers in the UK. Significant 
judgement is required in determining 
the level of provision required 
particularly in respect of underlying 
assumptions such as the total amount 
of potential compensation, probable 
amount to be settled in respect of 
claims, and the likelihood of having 
a valid defence against such claims. 
In addition, there is a risk that expected 
recoveries from suppliers in respect of 
such claims are recognised when such 
income is not virtually certain.
We have evaluated the methodology and key assumptions adopted by Management 
in its calculation of provision for illness claims and walked through the controls over 
the process. This included:
 > Challenging the consistency and reasonableness of the assumptions adopted
 > Testing the arithmetical accuracy and integrity of the data in the provision models
 > Testing manual adjustments to provisions to understand their rationale and ensure 
that they are appropriate
In respect of recoveries we have challenged whether appropriate evidence exists to 
support the recoveries, such as acknowledgement from a hotel that they were at fault and 
intend to reimburse the Group, or a signed agreement in place in relation to that claim.
In respect of recoveries we identified that the contractual terms indicates that liability 
rests with the hoteliers. We have sought evidence that signed contracts are in place with 
hoteliers. In instances where signed contracts were not available or where the recovery 
is with parties that are not hotels we have sought additional evidence that there is 
acknowledgement of liability.
Our year-end audit procedures did not 
identify any material misstatement 
of provisions for illness claims and 
the assumptions in the underlying 
calculations were assessed 
as reasonable.
We identified that the recoverability of 
certain balances from suppliers was not 
virtually certain at the balance sheet date. 
We concluded that these did not result in 
a material misstatement to the financial 
statements as a whole.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE  
MEMBERS OF THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC 
CONTINUED THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 111
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee 
Classification of separately disclosed items (£140m, FY16 (restated): £128m)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 75); Accounting policies (pages 127 to 128); and Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 135 to 136)
The Group separately discloses items 
in the income statement that are 
considered non-recurring and material 
either because of their size or nature. 
Separately disclosed items are 
not defined by IFRS and therefore 
considerable judgement is required 
in determining the appropriateness 
of such classification. Consistency in 
items treated as separately disclosed 
is important to maintain comparability 
of reporting year-on-year.
We have reviewed the separately disclosed items to understand the rationale for the 
separate classification and have challenged the appropriateness by confirming they are 
material and non-recurring to warrant separate disclosure.
We compared separately disclosed costs incurred with the budgets approved by the Board 
to ensure consistency with the plan. We have also assessed consistency with the nature 
of separately disclosed items reported in the prior year.
We challenged the treatment of a number of items of expenditure that we considered 
would be more appropriately classified as underlying.
We have reviewed the enhanced disclosures regarding items classified as separately 
disclosed and conclude they provide further transparency on the nature of these items 
which provides clarity on those items excluded from underlying performance of the Group.
In light of the guidelines published by 
ESMA we recommend that Management 
continues to focus on the nature of 
expenses classified as exceptional 
and the disclosures provided in the 
financial statements. There is significant 
judgement in determining the appropriate 
type of expenditure to separate from the 
Group’s underlying performance.
We challenged the classification of 
certain items of expenditure recorded 
as separately disclosed items which we 
believe should be recorded in underlying 
profit and concluded that those that 
remained unadjusted were not material.
Carrying value of goodwill (£2,627m, FY16: £2,595m)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 75); Accounting policies (page 123); and Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 139 to 140)
The Group holds significant goodwill 
on the balance sheet. The Group’s 
business is geographically diverse and 
the changing geopolitical environmental 
and economic landscape will continue 
to influence business performance 
and could impact the carrying value 
of goodwill.
The annual impairment test of 
goodwill includes several key areas 
of estimation and judgement over the 
future performance of the business 
and specific assumptions such as 
discount rates and terminal growth 
rates. Changes to these assumptions 
or adverse performance could have 
a significant impact on the available 
headroom and any impairment that may 
be required.
We understood the methodology applied by Management in performing its impairment test 
for each of the relevant CGUs.
For all CGUs we calculated the degree to which the key inputs and assumptions would 
need to fluctuate before an impairment was triggered and considered the likelihood of this 
occurring. We performed our own sensitivities on the Group’s forecasts and determined 
whether adequate headroom remained.
We performed detailed testing to critically assess and corroborate the key inputs to the 
valuations, including:
 > analysing the historical accuracy of budgets to actual results to determine whether 
forecast cash flows are reliable based on past experience;
 > working with our internal specialists, corroborating the discount rate used by obtaining 
the underlying data used in the calculation and benchmarking it against market data and 
comparable organisations; and
 > validating the growth rates assumed by comparing them to economic and 
industry forecasts.
We assessed the disclosures in Note 12 against the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of 
Assets, in particular in respect of the requirement to disclose further sensitivities for CGUs 
where a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would cause an impairment. 
The audit procedures performed to address this risk were performed by the Group 
audit team.
We agreed with Management’s conclusion 
that no impairments were required, based 
on the results of our work.
Of the Group’s goodwill, that relating 
to the Airline CGU is most sensitive 
to reasonable possible changes in 
key assumptions.
Sensitivities have not been disclosed 
in the ‘Intangible assets’ note to 
the Group financial statements as 
Management believe any reasonable 
change in assumptions would not cause 
an impairment. We concur that this 
is reasonable.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets (£216m, FY16: £228m)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 75); Accounting policies (page 128); and Note 24 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 154 to 155)
Judgement is required in assessing 
the recoverability of the deferred 
tax assets based on the likelihood of 
taxable profits arising in the future 
periods and the likelihood that the tax 
assets will be utilised.
Management applies judgement in assessing the deferred tax assets to be recognised 
in each jurisdiction, based on the application of tax law and probability that sufficient 
taxable profits are available.
We performed detailed testing to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
recognised which included:
 > testing Management’s process to prepare the deferred tax calculation;
 > assessing the period over which deferred tax assets will be utilised and corroborating 
to supporting forecasts of future profits;
 > testing adjustments made to forecast profits required to assess the level of forecast 
taxable profits available to support the recoverability of the deferred tax asset; and
 > audited individual transactions that gave rise to additional deferred tax assets 
recognised or utilised during the year.
We have considered the recognition 
period over which deferred tax assets 
will be recovered and concluded they 
were reasonable. 
We noted full recognition of deferred tax 
assets on brought forward losses and 
other temporary differences in Spain, 
resulting in an increase in the period over 
which they will be recovered.
We concur with the basis of recognition 
due to supporting taxable profit forecasts. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 112
The risks of material misstatement to the financial statements as 
set out in the table above differ from those reported by Thomas Cook 
Group plc’s previous external auditor. We have included provisions 
for illness claims and associated recoveries from suppliers due to 
the significant increase in illness claims in the UK observed during 
the current financial year which we considered increased the risk 
of material misstatement. In addition, we have included revenue 
recognition, including the risk of management override, as a key 
audit matter as we view revenue as an area susceptible to material 
misstatement. During the course of preparing the financial statements 
in the current year the Company identified a number of prior year 
adjustments which have been adjusted and are disclosed in Note 33 to 
the financial statements. In the course of our audit we have confirmed 
the appropriateness of the adjustments made.
We have omitted the following areas in the auditor’s report that were 
included in the prior year: recoverability of hotel prepayments, defined 
benefit pensions valuation, treasury operations and use of derivative 
instruments, and going concern. Whilst we agreed that these were 
areas of increased risk for our audit they were not assessed as being 
areas subject to significant Management judgement or areas where 
there were significant findings in our audit.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form 
an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. In determining 
our audit scope, we take into account size (based on contribution 
to Group underlying profit from operations and Group revenue), risk 
profile (including country risk, risks from the complexity of operations 
and accounting treatment and judgements, controls findings and risk 
arising from change in the period including changes to IT systems and 
key management personnel) and the number of significant accounts 
based on performance materiality and any other known factors when 
assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
The Group structures its operations around its three geographical tour 
operators and group airline, with sub-consolidations being performed 
at the tour operator locations. Our approach to scoping has been at 
the individual reporting unit level and the Group team has directed 
the sub-scoping in each of the segments to ensure that we have the 
appropriate level of involvement to enable us to obtain sufficient audit 
evidence as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage 
of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 135 
reporting components of the Group, we selected 37 components 
covering entities within the four reporting segments outlined 
above, which represent the principal reporting units within the 
Group. This constituted 12 country component teams and the group 
engagement team and included one non-EY component auditor to 
perform full scope procedures over one reporting unit and specific 
scope procedures over accounts we concluded were significant at one 
further reporting unit. 
Of the 37 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of 20 components (‘full scope components’) which 
were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the 
remaining 17 components (‘specific scope components’), we performed 
audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that 
we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the 
significant accounts in the financial statements either because of 
the size of these accounts or their risk profile. The audit scope of 
these components may not have included testing of all significant 
accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage 
of significant accounts tested for the Group.
The full and specific scope reporting components where we performed 
audit procedures accounted for 85% of the Group’s underlying profit 
from operations and 86% of the Group’s revenue.
Of the remaining 98 components that together represent 15% of 
the Group’s underlying profit from operations, none are individually 
greater than 5% of the Group’s underlying profit from operations 
or individually greater than 2% of the Group’s revenue. For these 
components, we performed other procedures, including analytical 
review, review of the legal register and discussions with the in-house 
legal counsel, testing of unusual, one-off transactions and testing of 
consolidation journals, intercompany eliminations and foreign currency 
translation recalculations to respond to any potential risks of material 
misstatement to the Group financial statements. 
Thomas Cook Group plc’s previous external auditor performed full 
and specific scope audit procedures on components accounting for 
75% of the Group’s underlying profit from operations and 80% of the 
Group’s revenue.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by 
component auditors from other EY global network firms operating 
under our instruction. Of the 20 full scope components, audit 
procedures were performed on two of these directly by the Group 
audit team, 17 by component auditors of the EY global network 
and one by a non-EY component team. For the 13 specific scope 
components, where the work was performed by component auditors, 
we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to 
determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis 
for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
During the current year’s audit cycle, the Senior Statutory Auditor 
or other members of the Group audit team visited the component 
teams in Northern Europe, UK and Continental Europe where sub-
consolidations of results within that region are performed; 15 of the full 
scope and specific scope reporting units are audited by these teams. 
In addition, the Senior Statutory Auditor visited the Airlines Germany 
team. In addition to our visits the Senior Statutory Auditor and other 
members of the Group team attended the year-end closing meetings 
with local management.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE  
MEMBERS OF THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC 
CONTINUED THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 113
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
These visits involved meeting with our component team to discuss and 
direct its audit approach, reviewing and understanding the significant 
audit findings in response to the risk areas including leased aircraft 
maintenance provisions, provisions for illness claims and revenue 
recognition, holding meetings with local management and obtaining 
updates on local regulatory matters. The primary team interacted 
regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various 
stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and were responsible 
for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the 
additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate 
evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the 
audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in 
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides 
a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £15m, which is 5% of 
underlying profit from operations. We believe that underlying profit 
from operations is the most relevant performance measure to the 
stakeholders of the Group. 
Starting basis Adjustments Materiality
 >Profit from 
operations – 
£231m for the 
year ended 
30 September 
2017
 > Separately disclosed 
items impacting profit 
from operations – £99m
 > Less amortisation of 
business combination 
intangibles – (£8m)
 > See Note 7 to the 
financial statements
 >Underlying profit 
from operations 
£322m excluding 
amortisation 
of business 
combination 
intangibles (basis 
for materiality)
 >Materiality of £16m 
(5% of materiality 
basis)
The above materiality is our reassessment based on the final results 
for the year. Our audit was conducted at the lower preliminary 
materiality of £15m.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment 
of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 50% of our planning materiality, namely 
£7.5m, reflecting that this is our first period as auditor of Thomas Cook 
Group plc.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining 
audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. 
The performance materiality set for each component is based on 
the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole 
and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. 
In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to 
components was £1m to £3.8m. 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as 
being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all 
uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.75m, which is set at 5% of 
planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, 
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
OTHER INFORMATION 
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual 
Report including the Overview, the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report set out on pages 1 to 108, other than the financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the 
other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such 
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we 
are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement 
in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are 
required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 114
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our 
responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other 
information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of 
the other information where we conclude that those items meet the 
following conditions:
 > Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 73 – the 
statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual 
Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
Shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained 
in the audit; or 
 > Audit Committee reporting set out on page 74 –the section 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
 > Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code set out on page 55 – the parts of the Directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing 
provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with 
Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit:
 > the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 > the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the 
parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic 
Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 > the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 > certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set 
out on pages 65 to 66, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view in accordance, and for such internal control as the 
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements the Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either 
intends to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered 
capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify and 
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements 
due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through 
designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond 
appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. 
However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection 
of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity 
and management.
Our approach was as follows: 
 > We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 
frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that 
the most significant frameworks which are directly relevant to 
specific assertions in the financial statements are those that relate 
to the reporting framework (IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and the 
UK Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant tax compliance 
regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. 
In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws 
and regulations which may have an effect on the determination 
of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements being 
the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, and those regulations 
relating to health and safety and employee matters.
 > We understood how Thomas Cook Group plc is complying with those 
frameworks by making enquiries of Management, enterprise risk and 
internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures 
and the Group legal counsel. We corroborated our enquiries through 
our review of Board minutes, papers provided to the Audit Committee 
and Board and correspondence received from regulatory bodies.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE  
MEMBERS OF THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC 
CONTINUED THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 115
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 > We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to 
material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting 
with Management from various parts of the business to understand 
where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also 
considered performance targets and their influence on efforts made 
by Management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions of 
analysts. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group 
has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, 
deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those 
programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be 
higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified 
fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and 
were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements were free from fraud or error.
Based on this understanding, we designed our audit procedures to 
identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in 
the paragraphs above. Our procedures involved journal entry testing, 
with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating 
large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the 
business; enquiries of legal counsel, Group management, enterprise 
risk and internal audit, segment management and Management at full 
and specific scope entities; and focused testing, as referred to in the 
Key audit matters section above.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address
 > Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were 
appointed by the Company on 9 February 2017 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ending 30 September 2017 and subsequent 
financial periods.
  The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and re-appointments is one year, covering the year ending 
30 September 2017.
 > The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the Company and we remain 
independent of the Group and the Company in conducting the audit. 
 > The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the 
Audit Committee

Other reserves consist of the merger reserve, the capital redemption reserve and own shares held. The capital redemption reserve was 
created as a consequence of the share buyback programme during the year ended 30 September 2009.
The merger reserve arose on the reverse acquisition of Thomas Cook Group plc and MyTravel Group plc by Thomas Cook AG (currently known 
as Thomas Cook GmbH). In the case of Thomas Cook Group plc, the merger reserve represents the difference between the existing share 
capital and share premium of Thomas Cook AG and the share capital of Thomas Cook Group plc issued in exchange, and in the case of 
MyTravel Group plc, the merger reserve represents the difference between the fair value and the nominal value of the share capital issued 
by Thomas Cook Group plc.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1 GENERAL INFORMATION 
Thomas Cook Group plc is a public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 
and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office is 3rd Floor, South Building, 200 Aldersgate, London EC1A 4HD. 
The principal activities of the Group are discussed in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 59. 
These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 21 November 2017. 
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) and Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
After making enquiries and taking into account the matters set out in the Risk Management section on pages 54 to 59, the Directors confirm 
that they consider it appropriate to use the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report & Accounts.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities 
(including derivative financial instruments) at fair value through the profit or loss, share-based payments and defined benefit 
pension obligations. 
The financial statements have been rounded to the nearest million in Great British Pounds. Amounts in pence have been rounded to the 
nearest tenth of a pence.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial information presented in this document are set out below. 
These policies have been applied consistently to the periods presented unless otherwise stated. 
Management identified several adjustments that, in their opinion should be applied to Thomas Cook’s financial statements for the year 
ended 30 September 2016. As a result these have been restated. Refer to Note 33 for further details of the restatement.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
3A CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY AND DISCLOSURE 
No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 October 2016 have 
had a material impact on the Group or parent company.
New or amended standard and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or EU endorsed 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been 
issued but are not yet effective or EU endorsed:
IFRS 9   “Financial instruments” is a replacement for IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’ and covers three distinct areas. Phase 1 contains new 
requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. Phase 2 relates to the impairment of 
financial assets and requires the calculation of impairment on an expected loss basis rather than the current incurred loss basis. 
Phase 3 relates to less stringent requirements for general hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for periods commencing on or 
after 1 January 2018, and therefore will be applied by the Group in fiscal year 2019. Based on our preliminary assessment, the Group 
does not currently anticipate a material impact from the new standard other than in providing additional disclosures in the 
Annual Report.
IFRS 15   “Revenues from Contracts with Customers” introduces a five-step approach to the timing of revenue recognition based on 
performance obligations in customer contracts. IFRS 15 is effective for periods commencing 1 January 2018 and therefore will be 
applied by the Group in fiscal year 2019. The Group continues to assess the possible impact of IFRS 15, which involves: 
 > an examination of key contract types in order to identify any distinct performance obligations in the context of the 
contractual arrangement;
 > assessing the point at which the Group delivers promised services to its customers and whether this presents a requirement 
to change the timing of its revenue recognition; and
 > understanding the specific new disclosure requirements prescribed.
   Based on our preliminary assessment, the Group does not currently anticipate a material impact from the new standard other than 
in providing additional disclosures in the Annual Report.

3A CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY AND DISCLOSURE CONTINUED
IFRS 16  “Leases” provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for all 
applicable leases. The leasing standard is expected to have a material impact on net debt, gross assets, profit from operations and 
interest. IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, and therefore will be applied by the Group in 
fiscal year 2020. Management have commenced a project across the Group to assess the overall impact of the standard, including 
considering the systems and processes required for implementation and the options around transition. We expect to report on the 
impact in the 2018 Annual Report. In addition, the Group awaits the result of ongoing HMRC consultation to understand the impact 
on taxes.
IFRS 17  “Insurance Contracts” is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 subject to endorsement by the EU. IFRS 17 
establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope 
of the standard. The Group plans to assess the impact of IFRS 17 closer to implementation date.
IFRIC 23  “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments” is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019 with early adoption 
permitted. IFRIC 23 clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurements requirements in IAS12 ‘Income Taxes’ when there is 
uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRIC 23.
There are no further IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. 
3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group’s financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiaries are all entities (including 
structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 
fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Joint venture and associates 
Entities, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exerts significant influence, but not control or joint control, are associates. 
Entities which the Group jointly controls with one or more other party under a contractual arrangement are joint ventures. 
The Group’s investments in its associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the 
investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition 
date. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor 
individually tested for impairment.
Foreign currency 
The presentation currency of the Group is Sterling. 
Average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency 
other than Sterling. The balance sheets of such entities are translated at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences are 
recorded through a separate component of equity. 
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities held at the year end are translated at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange 
gain or loss is recorded in the Costs of providing tourism services within the Income Statement. When a foreign entity is partially disposed 
of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Intangible assets – goodwill 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Group’s 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the 
acquiree are assigned to those units. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or 
loss on disposal.  124

3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Intangible assets – other 
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are carried on the Group’s balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other than capitalised development costs, including those that are internally generated, expenditure is reflected in the income statement in 
the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the intangible asset’s useful life, when finite, as follows:
Brands  9 years to indefinite life 
Customer relationships  1 to 15 years 
Computer software  3 to 10 years 
Indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they 
are expected to generate net cash inflows. These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands 
and the level of marketing support. The nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately 
supported by advertising and marketing spend. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually at the CGU level by comparing their carrying 
amount to their recoverable amount. All other intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date for indications of impairment. If such 
indications exist, the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the 
carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of straight-line depreciation and any provision for impairment. Where costs are incurred 
as part of the start-up or commissioning of an item of property, plant or equipment, and that item is available for use but incapable of 
operating in the manner intended by Management without such a start-up or commissioning period, then such costs are included within the 
cost of the item. Costs that are not directly attributable to bringing an asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended by Management are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, upon which no depreciation is provided, is calculated on a straight-
line basis and aims to write-down their cost to their estimated residual value over their expected useful lives as follows: 
Freehold buildings  40 to 50 years 
Leasehold properties  Shorter of remaining lease period and 40 years 
Aircraft  23 years (or remaining lease period if shorter) 
Aircraft spares  5 to 15 years (or remaining lease period if shorter) 
Other fixed assets  3 to 15 years 
Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually. 
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Aircraft overhaul and maintenance costs 
Major overhaul expenditure, including replacement spares and labour costs, is capitalised and amortised over the average expected life 
between major overhauls. All other replacement spares and other costs relating to maintenance of fleet assets (including maintenance 
provided under ‘pay-as-you-go’ contracts) are charged to the income statement on consumption or as incurred respectively.
Provision is made for the future costs of major overhauls of operating leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes by making 
appropriate charges to the income statement, calculated by reference to hours flown and/or the expired lease period, as a consequence of 
obligations placed upon the Group under the terms of certain operating leases.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents purchase price. Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.  125 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange and fuel price risks arising from 
operational, financing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial 
instruments for trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument and if so the nature of the item being hedged.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value, on derivatives not designated as a hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Derivatives are presented on the balance sheet on a gross basis. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset 
whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a 
non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 
12 months. 
Hedge accounting
For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value hedges are recognised 
in the income statement as part of finance income or cost line, where they offset the changes in fair value on the hedged item. Where the 
hedged item is designated in a fair value hedge relationship of a financial liability held at amortised cost, the change in fair value in respect 
to the hedged risk is recorded as a fair value adjustment within finance income or cost.
Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that point in time the changes in fair value on the hedging instrument will continue to be recognised immediately 
into the income statement, while the hedged item will no longer be adjusted for fair value changes.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value on derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of 
future cash flows is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement within net operating expenses. 
Forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options are not designated as part of the hedging relationship and 
therefore are recorded in the income statement within costs of providing tourism.
Changes in fair value deferred through the hedge reserve are recognised in the income statement in the same period, or periods, in which 
the hedged highly probable forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive 
income are retained until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or 
loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Non-derivative financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers substantially all the risks (and rewards) relating to the financial asset or when 
the contractual rights to the cash flows associated with the financial asset expire. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation 
is discharged, cancelled or expires. The measurement of particular financial assets and liabilities is set out below.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, term deposits and investment in money market funds which are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less. 
Where the Group operates centrally pooled accounts and has the legal right along with the intention and ability to pool account balances, 
the net cash or overdraft position is disclosed. Where the intention or ability to pool balances together is absent, the cash and overdraft are 
disclosed on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet and the overdraft is excluded from cash and cash equivalents for the purpose 
of the consolidated statement of cash flows. 126

3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. An allowance for irrecoverable amounts is established when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value. Gains or losses (except for impairment 
losses and foreign exchange gains and losses) are recognised directly in equity until the financial asset is derecognised. At this point, the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement. Any impairment losses, foreign exchange 
gains or losses or dividends receivable are recognised in the income statement.
Held for trading investments 
Short-term investments and derivatives that are not designated in a hedge relationship such as natural hedges of a balance sheet exposure 
are classified as held for trading and are recognised and subsequently measured at their fair value. Gains or losses are recognised in the 
income statement.
Other non-current asset investments 
The fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured using an 
appropriate valuation technique. Where a fair value cannot be reliably measured, the investment is measured at cost. Loans and receivables 
are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Borrowings 
Interest bearing borrowings are initially recognised at their fair value net of any directly attributable transaction costs. They are 
subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings that are designated as hedged items in a fair value hedge relationship are adjusted for changes in their fair value in respect of 
the hedged risk. The adjustment will be amortised to the income statement at the time when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for 
changes in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk.
Provisions 
The Group recognises a provision when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are recognised at the Director’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted to its present value.
Pensions 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes. The pension liabilities recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these 
schemes represent the difference between the present value of the Group’s obligations under the schemes (calculated using the projected 
unit credit method) and the fair value of those schemes’ assets. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise 
within the statement of comprehensive income and expense. The current service cost, representing benefits accruing over the year, is 
included in the income statement as a personnel expense. The unwinding of the discount rate on the scheme liabilities and the expected 
return on scheme assets are presented as finance costs and finance income respectively. Past service costs are recognised immediately in 
the income statement in personnel expenses.
Pension costs charged against profits in respect of the Group’s defined contribution schemes represent the amount of the contributions 
payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Share capital 
Ordinary Shares including share premium are classified as equity. 127 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Leases 
Leases under which substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are finance leases. All other leases 
are operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their expected 
useful lives. The interest element of finance lease payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is 
charged to the income statement over the period of the lease. 
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Share-based payments 
The Group issues equity-settled share options to certain employees as part of their total remuneration. The fair values of the share options 
are calculated at the date of grant, using an appropriate option pricing model. These fair values are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the expected vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase in equity. This credit is not considered to 
be distributable under the Companies Act 2006.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a 
capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the 
vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity. 
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the 
date at which they are granted. 
Revenue recognition
The Group’s revenue is measured as the aggregate amount of gross revenue receivable from inclusive tours, airline travel services, hotel 
services, travel agency commission and other travel services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business. The Group records 
revenue on a net basis after deducting trade discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and compensation vouchers granted to customers. 
Revenue relating to travel services arranged by the Group’s leisure and airline travel providers, are taken to the income statement on the 
date of holiday and flight departure. Revenue relating to other services provided by the Group is taken to the income statement as earned. 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the significant risks and rewards of ownership is transferred to the customer, usually 
on delivery of the goods. Monies received by the balance sheet date relating to holidays commencing and flights departing after the period 
end are included within current liabilities as revenue received in advance.
Expenses 
Direct expenses relating to inclusive tours arranged by the Group’s leisure travel providers are taken to the income statement on holiday 
departure or over the period to which they relate as appropriate. Indirect expenses are recognised in the income statement over the period 
to which goods and services are received by the Group.
Separately disclosed items 
The Group separately discloses to profit before tax in the income statement: non-recurring items, impairment of goodwill and amortisation of 
business combination intangibles; and IAS 39 fair value remeasurement.
Separately disclosed items, namely items that are material either because of their size or their nature, or which are non-recurring, are 
presented within their relevant income statement category, but highlighted through separate disclosure. The separate reporting helps 
provide a full understanding of the Group’s underlying performance.
Items which are included within the separately disclosed category include:
 > profits/(losses) on disposal of assets or businesses and costs of acquisitions;
 > costs of integration of significant acquisitions and other major restructuring programmes which may extend over a number of years;
 > significant goodwill or other asset impairments;
 > material write-down of assets/reassessment of accruals, reflecting a more cautious evaluation in light of current trading and economic 
conditions; and
 > other individually material items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence.
Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG (currently known 
as Thomas Cook GmbH) and MyTravel Group plc and other business combinations made in subsequent years. The amortisation of these 
intangible assets is significant and the Group’s Management considers that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding 
of the Group’s results. 128

3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
IAS 39 fair value remeasurement includes movements in forward points related to foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of 
options in cash flow hedging relationships. Both items are subject to market fluctuations and unwind when the options or forward contracts 
mature and therefore are not considered to be part of the Group’s underlying performance. Interest income and charges arising on the 
Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and interest charges arising on the unwind of discount on exceptional provisions and contingent 
consideration are not considered to be part of the Group’s underlying performance.
In addition, certain finance costs or income that derive from one-off events or transactions are not considered to be part of the Group’s 
underlying performance. The Group’s Management considers that these items should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding 
of the Group’s results.
Finance income and costs 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, expected return on pension plan assets, changes in the fair value of held for 
trading interest-related derivatives, and fair value adjustments to hedged items in a designated fair value hedge. 
Finance costs comprise interest costs on borrowings and finance leases, unwind of the discount on non-current liabilities, interest cost 
on pension plan liabilities, changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives and changes in fair value of derivatives 
designated in a fair value hedge relationship.
The changes in fair value on derivatives designated in a fair value hedge relationship and the fair value adjustment on hedged items in a fair 
value hedge relationship are separately disclosed in Note 7 under the description “Finance related charges”.
Tax
Current tax
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for a period.
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on 
tax rates and laws that are substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its 
tax base, with the following exceptions: 
 > Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting or taxable profit or loss; 
 > In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements, where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future; and 
 > Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, tax losses or credits carried forward can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset 
is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Allocation of tax charge or credit between income statement, other comprehensive income and equity
Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to an item recognised directly within other comprehensive income, in which case 
the associated tax is recognised directly in other comprehensive income respectively.
Earnings per share 
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its Ordinary Shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit 
or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the 
period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive 
potential Ordinary Shares. EPS measures for continuing operations have been presented in accordance with IAS 33. The Group also presents 
a basic and diluted underlying EPS measure based on underlying profit before tax as defined in the “Separately Disclosed Items” section 
above. Further details of the EPS calculation are presented in Note 11.  129 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
3C CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS 
In applying its accounting policies, the Group has made estimates and assumptions concerning the future, which may differ from the related 
actual outcomes. Those estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. 
Revenue recognition 
A key judgement in recognising revenue is to distinguish where the Group’s businesses act in the capacity of principal or agent so to 
determine the accounting as either gross or net respectively, in line with IAS 18 Revenue Recognition. The Group exercises judgement to 
assess principal or agency by considering if it is the prime obligor in all the revenue arrangements, has pricing discretion and is exposed 
to inventory and credit risk, in which case the Group will be principal to the arrangement. 
Impairment of goodwill 
Judgements have been made in respect of the amounts of future operating cash flows to be generated by certain of the Group’s businesses 
in order to assess whether there has been any impairment of the amounts included in the balance sheet for goodwill or intangible assets 
with an indefinite life in relation to those businesses. 
Aircraft maintenance provisions 
Provisions for the cost of maintaining leased aircraft and spares are based on forecast aircraft utilisation, estimates of future maintenance 
costs and planned rollover and renewal of the aircraft fleet. 
Provisions for illness claims and associated recoveries 
In calculating the level of provisions required, judgements have been made on the probability of success in defending legal claims and 
estimated outcome of such claims. In assessing associated recoveries, judgements have been made been on the estimate of the amounts 
that will be recovered from hotel suppliers. 
Tax 
Judgements have been made in respect of the probable future utilisation of tax losses, and deferred tax assets have been recognised as 
a result. The recoverability of these assets is dependent on the agreement of the losses with the relevant authorities and the estimates 
of future profitability.  130

4 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION 
During the year, the Group refined its organisational structure resulting in a reassessment of its reportable segments. In line with 
this change the Group reassessed its reporting segments. The principal activities of the Group are therefore presented in the 
following segments: 
 > Tour operations and associated activities (‘Group Tour Operator’) within the Group’s 17 source markets: 
 > Airline-related services, including both scheduled and charter services, and associated activities (‘Group Airline’) within the Group’s four 
airlines; and
 > Certain residual businesses and corporate functions that are not allocated to these divisions and are shown separately as Corporate. 
These reportable segments are consistent with how information is presented to the Group Chief Executive (chief operating decision maker) 
for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of performance. Segment information for the year ended 30 September 2016 has

New Operating Model implementation and restructuring costs
Implementation costs relating to the New Operating Model total £42m (2016: £50m) and primarily relate to efficiency programmes in 
Continental Europe and the UK. These programmes commenced in 2015 and were planned over a 3 year period, with a focus on generating 
efficiencies within the Group by co-operating more closely across all source markets; rather than duplicating activity in each individual 
market. The costs that we have separately disclosed in relation to these programmes include the cost of external professional advice and 
redundancies, as well as the cost of dedicated personnel (both external consultants and internal employees) assigned to New Operating 
Model projects. The work of these teams focuses on aligning and driving harmonised activities across the Group in each business area, 
including finance, digital, marketing, product and yield management. This work represents an investment in our transformation, resulting 
in a temporary increase in costs by doubling up resource in some business areas, as we transform our business model into one that is 
horizontally aligned across the Group under a matrix structure. Once processes are fully co-ordinated and harmonised in these areas, these 
additional costs will fall away. Accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to separately disclose these costs. The New Operating Model was 
initially established as a three year transformation project and these costs are expected to continue to be incurred until implementation 
is complete.
Restructuring costs of £12m (2016: £20m) largely relate to legacy rationalisation in Continental Europe, namely France and Russia.
Reassessment of contingent consideration
In December 2016, the Group announced its intention to acquire full control of its UK retail store network, following notification by 
The Co-operative Group (‘the Co-op’) of the decision to exercise its option over its stake in their UK retail joint venture. In line with the 
requirements of IFRS, the Group has reassessed the carrying value of a contingent obligation to acquire the Co-op shares and this 
reassessment resulted in a reduction of £32m to the liability previously accrued. As part of the reassessment it was noted that a payment of 
£4m was made in the prior period which has been restated in the comparatives above (refer to Note 33). 
Onerous leases and store closures
Onerous leases and store closures of £30m (2016: £21m) relates to a provision associated with loss-making UK stores. The provision follows 
the results of a strategic review of the UK store network as part of the New Operating Model. 
Asset revaluation reviews
Asset valuation reviews of £15m primarily relate to write-offs of property, fixtures and fittings of closed UK stores and IT assets in the UK no 
longer required as part of the implementation of the New Operating Model. 136

Amortisation of business combination intangibles 
Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc 
and other business combinations made in subsequent years. The amortisation of these intangible assets is significant and the Group’s 
Management considers that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results. 
Other 
Other separately disclosed items of £24m includes £15m in relation to investment in the set-up of partnerships and new business 
developments, £6m of costs incurred relating to repatriation of guests net of insurance received for Hurricane Irma and £6m of costs 
incurred for fraudulent illness claims. In addition there is a £6m gain from the movement in forward points related to foreign exchange 
forward contracts and the time value of options in cash flow hedge relationships. Both items are subject to market fluctuations and unwind 
when the options or forward contracts mature and therefore are not considered to be part of the Group’s underlying performance. 
Finance related charges 
The Group has provisions for future liabilities arising from separately disclosed circumstances, primarily deferred acquisition consideration. 
A notional interest charge of £11m on the discounted value of such provisions is recognised within separately disclosed finance related 
charges. In addition, the Group incurred an interest charge of £23m as a result of issuing a new Euro bond in December 2016 which 
refinanced the Group’s debt at a lower interest rate, while net interest charges arising on the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes 
were £7m.

(2016: 20%) of the estimated assessable profit/(loss) for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the 
respective jurisdictions. 
Surplus losses not recognised in deferred tax of £2,222m (2016 restated: £2,132m) are available predominantly in France, Germany and the UK 
for offset against future profits. 138

Impairment Testing 
In accordance with IFRS, the Group tests the carrying value of goodwill and brand names with indefinite lives for impairment annually and 
whenever events or circumstances change. 
Impairment testing is performed by comparing the carrying value of each cash-generating unit (CGU) to the recoverable amount, determined 
on the basis of the CGU’s value in use. The value in use is based on the net present value of future cash flow projections discounted at pre-
tax rates appropriate for each CGU.
During the year, the Group refined its organisational structure resulting in a reassessment of its reportable segments. This has resulted in 
a reassessment of its CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing, which now consist of UK Tour Operator, Northern Europe Tour Operator, 
Continental Europe Tour Operator and Group Airline. 
The future cash flow projections used to determine the value in use are based on the most recent annual budgets and four-year plans for 
each of the CGUs. The key assumptions used to determine the business’ budget and four-year plans relate to capacity and the pricing of 
accommodation and fuel inputs. Capacity is based on Management’s view of market demand and the constraints to managing capacity such 
as aircraft lease commitments. The accommodation pricing is primarily driven by the underlying bed rate and the foreign exchange hedges 
in place. The former is based on the businesses’ ongoing dialogue with bed suppliers and local cost inflation. The fuel pricing assumption 
is primarily driven by the fuel hedges in place and the forward fuel curve at the time that the budget is set. The key assumptions used to 
determine the Independent business’ budget and four-year plans relate to passenger volumes and commission rates, and are based on the 
individual businesses’ view of the market conditions.
Cash flow forecasts for years beyond the four-year plan are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate of 2%.
A a pre-tax discount rate of between 9.8% – 10.2% reflecting the specific risks of each CGU is used to calculate the value in use for each of 
the CGUs. 
Sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed as Management believes that any reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the 
carrying value of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount. 141 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The average credit period taken on invoicing of leisure travel services is eight days (2016: nine days). No interest is charged on the 
receivables. The credit risk in respect of direct receivables from customers is limited as payment is required in full before the services are 
provided. In the case of travel services sold by third party agents, the credit risk depends on the creditworthiness of those third parties, but 
this risk is also limited because of the relatively short period of credit. 
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of 
those supplies. The Group’s current policy is that deposits and prepayments will normally be made for periods of up to two years in advance. 
There is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during those periods. Deposits and prepayments also include 
£7m (2016: £5m) of deposits on aircraft lease arrangements.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where 
there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Allowances for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivable balances are managed in the business units where the debts arise and are 
based on local Management experience. Factors that are considered include the age of the debt, previous experience with the counterparty 
and local trading conditions. Trade receivables arise from individual customers as well as businesses in the travel sector. The Directors do 
not consider there to be significant concentration of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables. 144

cash and cash equivalents.

value £1,767m; fair value £1,025m). £1,183m (2016: £1,025m) of the fair value which relates to issued bonds has been calculated using quoted 
market prices. 
For all other borrowings, the Directors consider that the fair value of £291m (2016: £742m) is approximate to the carrying amount. In 2017, the 
Group has £32m as security to aircraft (2016: £63m) and £37m as a security to property (2016: £29m).
Borrowing facilities
As at 30 September 2017, the Group had undrawn committed debt facilities of £472m (2016: £481m) and undrawn committed debt facilities 
plus cash available to repay revolving credit facility of £1,824m (2016: £2,212m). Whilst these facilities have certain financial covenants they are 
not expected to prevent full utilisation of the facilities if required. The Group has complied with its covenants throughout the year. 
In December 2016 we issued a new €750 million bond. The new bond, bearing a coupon of 6.25% and maturing in June 2022, enabled us to 
redeem in full both the outstanding £200 million principal of our £300 million bond due in June 2017, and our entire €525 million bond due in 
June 2020. 147 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
19 BORROWINGS CONTINUED
In November 2017 the Group entered into new financing arrangements being an enlarged £875 million revolving credit facility and bonding 
and guarantee facility, maturing in November 2022. In addition the Group has secured £100 million of annual rolling bilateral funding from 
one of their insurance providers. These new arrangements replace the Group’s existing facility, which provided £800 million of facilities until 
May 2019.
Covenant measures
The covenant measures are tested quarterly on a rolling 12-month basis and consist of a leverage covenant and a fixed charge covenant. 
The leverage covenant is a measure of pre-exceptional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft operating 
lease rentals compared to net debt. The fixed charge covenant is a measure of pre-exceptional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation and operating lease charges compared to net interest and operating lease charges. The leverage and fixed charge covenant 
hurdles vary depending on the period that they relate to, reflecting the seasonality of the Group’s business.

2017 (2016: carrying value £183m; fair value £191m). The fair values quoted were determined on the basis of the interest rates for the 
corresponding terms to repayment as at the year end.
The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.  148

Fair value hierarchy 
The fair value of the Group’s financial instruments are disclosed in hierarchy levels depending on the valuation method applied. The different 
methods are defined as follows: 
Level 1:  valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments. 
Level 2:   derived using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). The fair value of financial instruments is determined by discounting expected 
cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Level 3:   valued using techniques incorporating information other than observable market data as at least one input to the valuation 
cannot be based on observable market data.

The fair values of financial instruments have been calculated using discounted cash flow analysis. 
In December 2016, the Group announced its intention to acquire full control of its UK retail store network, following notification by  
The Co-operative Group of the decision to exercise its option over its stake in their UK retail joint venture. The Group’s contingent 
consideration is now fixed, therefore is no longer classified as a Level 3 financial liability. There were no other Level 3 financial assets or 
liabilities as at 30 September 2017. 
Currency hedges are entered into up to a maximum of 24 months in advance of the forecasted requirement. As at 30 September 2017, the 
Group had in place currency hedging derivative financial instruments with a maximum maturity of May 2019 (2016: February 2018).
The Group also uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in the price of fuel. The Group enters into fixed 
price contracts (swaps) and net purchased options in the management of its fuel price. All fuel hedges are designated as cash flow hedges. 
Fuel price hedges are entered into up to a maximum of 24 months in advance of forecasted consumption of fuel. Trades with maturities 
longer than 24 months need additional approval in line with treasury policy. As at 30 September 2017, the Group had in place fuel price 
hedging derivative financial instruments with a maximum maturity of March 2019 (2016: March 2018).  150

In addition, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate exposures. The Group enters into interest rate swaps 
to hedge against interest rate movements in connection with the financing of aircraft and other assets and to hedge against interest rate 
exposures on fixed rate debt. The Group also enters into cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate and the currency 
exposure on foreign currency external borrowings. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency contracts in designated fair value hedge relationships at 30 September 2017 was a 
liability of £1m (2016: £16m asset).
As at 30 September 2017, the maximum maturity of interest rate derivatives was June 2022 (2016: June 2020).
The fair values of the Group’s derivative financial instruments have been calculated using underlying market prices available on 
30 September 2017.
During the year, a gain of £60m (2016: £105m loss) was transferred from the hedge reserve to the income statement following recognition 
of the hedged transactions. The amount included in each line item in the income statement is shown below. In addition, a gain of £6m was 
recognised in the income statement in respect of the forward points on foreign exchange cash flow hedging contracts (2016: £2m gain) and 
a gain of £nil in respect of the movement in the time value of options in cash flow hedging relationships (2016: £3m gain).

used to hedge Group balance sheet exposure. 
The closing hedging reserve, excluding the impact of tax, was a loss of £44m (2016: £36m gain). The periods in which the cash flows are 
expected to occur and when they are expected to impact the income statement are a loss of £35m (2016: £26m gain) within one year and a 
loss of £9m (2016: £10m gain) between one and five years.  151 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar arrangements above, each agreement 
between the Group and the counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle 
on a net basis. In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis, however, each party to the 
master netting agreement or similar agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the 
other party.
22 FINANCIAL RISK 
The Group is subject to risks related to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, fuel prices, liquidity and counterparty credit within the 
framework of its business operations. 
Interest rate risk
The Group is subject to risks arising from interest rate movements in connection with the issue of Eurobonds, bank debt, aircraft financing 
and cash investments. Interest rate swaps are used to manage these risks and are designated as both cash flow and fair value hedges.
Foreign exchange rate risk
The Group has activities in a large number of countries and is therefore subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. These risks arise 
in connection with the procurement of services in destinations outside the source market. For example, US Dollar exposure arises on the 
procurement of fuel and operating supplies for aircraft, as well as investments in aircraft.
The Group requires segments to identify and appropriately hedge all exposures in line with approved treasury policies designed to reflect 
the commercial risk of each underlying business. Each segmental hedging policy includes the hedging build up and permitted instruments. 
The maximum hedge tenor is 24 months and each segment should achieve at least an 80% hedge ratio prior to the start of the season. 
The Group uses currency forwards, currency swaps and currency options to manage transactional currency risks and these are usually 
designated as cash flow hedges.
The Group does not hedge translation exposures arising from profits generated outside the UK. 152

Fuel price risk
Exposure to fuel price risk arises due to flying costs incurred by the Group’s aircraft.
The Group requires segments to identify and appropriately hedge all exposures in line with approved treasury policies designed to reflect 
the commercial risk of each underlying business. Each segmental hedging policy includes the hedging build up and permitted instruments. 
The maximum hedge tenor is 24 months and in general each segment should achieve at least an 80% hedge ratio prior to the start of 
the season. 
The Group uses commodity derivative contracts, including fixed price contracts (swaps) and net purchased options to manage fuel price risk 
and these are usually designated as cash flow hedges. 
The market risks that the Group is subject to have been identified as interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and fuel price risk. 
The impact of reasonably possible changes in these risk variables on the Group, based on the period end holdings of financial instruments

22 FINANCIAL RISK CONTINUED
Liquidity risk 
The liquidity position of the Group is significantly influenced by the booking and payment pattern of customers. As a result, liquidity is at its 
lowest in the winter months and at its highest in the summer months. The Group manages the seasonal nature of its liquidity by making use 
of its bank facility, the terms of which, including the covenant measures, are detailed in the borrowings note (refer to Note 19). The Group also 
uses liquidity swaps to manage short-term currency positions. These liquidity swaps are presented as held-for-trading financial instruments. 
The undrawn committed debt facility plus the cash available ranged between £993m and £1,824m during the current financial year 
(2016: £586m–£2,212m).
Surplus short-term liquidity is invested in accordance with approved treasury policy.
Financial liabilities are analysed below based on the time between the period end and their contractual maturity. The amounts shown are 
estimates of the undiscounted future cash flows and will differ from both carrying value and fair value.

liabilities of £165m (2016: £148m) which have not been analysed above.
Counterparty credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to deposits, outstanding derivatives and trade and other receivables. 
The maximum exposure in respect of each of these items at the balance sheet date is the carrying value. The Group assesses its 
counterparty credit risk exposure in relation to the investment of surplus cash, fuel contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging 
contracts and undrawn credit facilities. The Group primarily uses published credit ratings to assess counterparty strength and to define the 
credit limit for each counterparty in accordance with approved treasury policies. 
The Group’s approach to credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is explained in Note 16. 154

23 INSURANCE 
Management of insurance risk
Incidental to its main business, the Group, through its subsidiary White Horse Insurance Ireland DAC, issues contracts that transfer 
significant insurance risk and that are classified as insurance contracts. As a general guideline, the Group defines as significant insurance 
risk the possibility of having to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder. 
Business written is travel insurance for both Group and non-Group customers. 
The principal nature of travel insurance risks is one of short-term, low value and high volume. Underwriting performance is monitored on an 
ongoing basis and pricing reviewed annually for each individual contract. 
Exposure is capped by specific limits within the insurance policy and by using reinsurance contracts for any claims in excess of these 
retention limits. 
Insurance risk is spread across several European countries where the Group operates including the UK, Ireland and Continental Europe. 
When estimating the cost of claims outstanding at the year end, the principal assumption underlying the estimates is the Group’s past 
development pattern. This includes assumptions in respect of historic claims costs, average claims handling expenses and market 
developments. The Group has an Actuarial Function to review its liabilities to ensure that the carrying values are adequate. Any changes to 
these variables are not expected to have a material effect on the Group financial statements. 
The Group operates a reinsurance policy approved by the White Horse Insurance Ireland DAC Board of Directors which ensures that 
reinsurers have a financial stability rating of A (S&P). The Group has assessed these credit ratings as being satisfactory in diminishing the 
Group’s exposure to the credit risk of its insurance receivables.

At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of £3,182m (restated 2016: £3,274m) available for offset against future profits. 
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised to the extent that the business has forecast future taxable profits against which the assets 
may be recovered. 
As a result of the continuing robustness of the Spanish business it is now considered appropriate for all Spanish losses and deductible 
temporary differences to be recognised.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses of £2,222m (restated 2016: £2,132m) due to the unpredictability of future 
profit streams. £2,219m of these losses have no expiry date, with the remaining £3m expiring within 5 years. 155 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
24 DEFERRED TAX CONTINUED
Other temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided primarily relate to the difference in book to tax value on qualifying tax 
assets, provisions for which tax relief was not originally available, and fair value accounting on assets acquired as part of the merger.
In addition, the Group had unused other temporary differences amounting to £432m (2016: £374m) for which no deferred tax asset has been 
recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Deferred tax liabilities were offset against the corresponding deferred tax assets as appropriate within territories.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because 
the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Factors affecting the tax charge in future periods 
In addition to the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017), a further reduction to 17% (effective from 
1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. Deferred tax on temporary differences and tax losses as at the balance sheet 
date is calculated based on the substantively enacted rates at which the temporary differences and tax losses are expected to reverse. 
The Group’s future tax charge could be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to;
 > the UK’s proposal to amend the tax rules relating to the utilisation of brought forward losses and the deductibility of interest were 
substantively enacted on 31 October 2017. These new rules apply retrospectively from 1 April 2017. With substantive enactment taking place 
after the Group’s balance sheet date, the accounting standards do not require the impact of these rules to be accounted for until the 
period ended 30 September 2018. Due to the complexity of the legislation it is too soon to quantify the impact on UK deferred tax; and 
 > any tax reforms in jurisdictions where we have a taxable presence, including any reforms which may arise from the UK’s proposed exit 
from the EU, from the European Commission’s proposals for a Common Corporate Tax Base across the EU or any reforms adopted from the 
OECD’s BEPS actions such as those in relation to the deductibility of interest, anti-avoidance or transfer pricing.

25 PROVISIONS CONTINUED
The aircraft maintenance provisions relate to maintenance on leased aircraft and spares used by the Group’s airlines in respect of leases 
which include contractual return conditions. This expenditure arises at different times over the life of the aircraft with major overhauls 
typically occurring between two and 10 years. The aircraft maintenance provisions are reassessed at least annually in the normal course of 
business with a corresponding adjustment made to either non-current assets (aircraft and aircraft spares) or aircraft costs.
Insurance and litigation represents costs related to legal disputes, customer compensation claims (including EU 261) and estimated costs 
arising through insurance contracts in the Group’s subsidiary, White Horse Insurance Ireland DAC.
Reorganisation and restructuring plans predominantly represent committed restructuring costs in the Group Tour Operator segment.
Other provisions includes items such as onerous contracts, dilapidations and emissions trading liabilities. Of the £31m charge recognised in 
the year, £13m has been classified as a Separately Disclosed Item within ‘Onerous leases and store closures’. For further details refer to Note 
7. Onerous lease provisions will be utilised over the lease terms.

Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for Shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt (net of related hedging instruments), cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable 
to equity holders of the parent (as shown in the Group balance sheet). At the balance sheet date the Group had total capital of £320m 
(2016: £495m).

includes £75m (2016: £60m) for seasonal wet leases. Operating lease rental payable charged to the income statement for property and other 
was £92m (2016: £93m) which includes £13m of onerous lease provisions recognised in the year (2016: £16m). 
Operating lease payments principally relate to rentals payable for the Group’s retail shop and hotel properties and for aircraft and spares 
used by the Group’s airlines. Shop leases are typically negotiated for an average term of four years.
Leases for new aircraft are typically negotiated for an average term of 12 years, leases for second hand aircraft and extensions are typically 
considerably shorter.

The Group complies with all the standards relevant to consumer protection and formal requirements in respect of package tour contracts 
and has all the necessary licences for the various sales markets. The customers’ right to reimbursement of the return travel costs and 
amounts paid in case of insolvency or bankruptcy on the part of the tour operator or travel agency is guaranteed in all Thomas Cook sales 
markets in line with local legislation and within the various guarantee systems applied. In the United Kingdom, there is a fund mechanism 
whereby travel companies are required to collect and remit a small charge for each protected customer upon booking. Customer rights in 
relation to Thomas Cook Group in Germany, Belgium and Austria are guaranteed via an insolvency insurance system, in Ireland, Scandinavia 
and France via guarantees provided by banks, insurance companies, accredited associations and in The Netherlands via a guaranteed fund.
In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to commercial disputes and litigation including customer claims, employee 
disputes, taxes and other kinds of lawsuits. These matters are inherently difficult to quantify. In appropriate cases, a provision is recognised 
based on best estimates and Management’s judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions will result in an accurate 
prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred. These are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position 
of the Group. 158

30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS 
Pension schemes for the employees of the Thomas Cook Group consist of defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, with the 
defined benefit plans being both funded and unfunded. The obligations arising from defined contribution plans are satisfied by contribution 
payments to both private and state-run insurance providers. The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 
2017

2016

Present value of funded obligations 1,315 1,442

(Surplus)/Deficit of funded plans (110) (28)
Present value of unfunded obligations 435 485 
Total deficit of defined benefit pension plans 325 457 
Unfunded defined benefit pension obligations
Unfunded defined benefit pension obligations primarily relate to the Group’s employees in the German businesses of Thomas Cook AG and 
the Condor Group. Provisions are established on the basis of commitments made to those employees for old-age and transitional pensions 
based on the legal, tax and economic circumstances of the individual countries and on the period of employment and level of remuneration 
of the respective employees.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations totalling £367m (2016: £416m) were attributable to the pension commitments of the Condor 
Group (Condor Flugdienst GmbH, Condor Berlin GmbH and CF GmbH). For employees who joined a Condor Group company prior to 1995, the 
total pension commitment of the pensions authority of the German federal government and regional states was adjusted and maintained in 
the form of a company pension scheme.
The flight crews were additionally entitled to a transitional provision for the period between the termination of their in-flight employment 
and the time they became eligible for a state-run or company pension. In both cases, the benefit commitment depended on the final salaries 
of the employees concerned prior to the termination of their in-flight employment (final salary plan). Employees who joined a Condor Group 
company from 1995 onwards participate in a company pension scheme under which the pension entitlements are based on the average 
salaries of those employees (average salary plan). The Condor Group also has retirement obligations arising from individual commitments and 
transitional provisions. 
In accordance with IAS 19, all these commitments are classified as unfunded defined benefit obligations and classified as such in these 
financial statements.
The Condor Group defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants (with the exception of pilots) since 2004.
There are additional unfunded defined benefit obligations comprising individual commitments to executive staff at Thomas Cook Group and 
obligations in respect of past service for employees in the Group Tour Operator segment. 
The unfunded pension schemes are accounted for as part of liabilities for retirement benefit obligations in the balance sheet.  160

Funded defined benefit pension obligation
The pension entitlements of employees of Thomas Cook UK and employees in Norway and The Netherlands are provided through funded 
defined benefit schemes, where pension contributions are paid over to the schemes and the assets of the schemes are held separately from 
those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. These schemes are closed to new entrants and continue to accrue future benefits 
for existing active members.
The plans are final salary pension plans which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. 
The level of benefits provided depends on a member’s length of service and their salary in the final years of active membership. In the UK 
plans, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with retail price index, pensions in deferment are generally updated in line with 
consumer price index.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries in each country. The fair value of the pension assets in 
each scheme at the year end is compared with the present value of the retirement benefit obligations and the net difference reported as 
a pension asset or retirement benefit obligation as appropriate. Pension assets are only recognised to the extent that they will result in 
reimbursements being made or future payments being reduced.
The funded defined benefit obligation primarily relates to the Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan. The assumptions used in arriving at the present 
value of the obligations at 30 September 2017 have been updated following the 2014 triennial actuarial funding valuation. The mortality 
assumptions used in arriving at the present value of those obligations at 30 September 2017 are based on the S2PA pensioner tables 
with 2013 CMI projection model until 2014 and then 2016 CMI projection model with a long-term trend rate of 1.5% for males and females. 
The mortality assumptions adopted for the plan liabilities indicate a further life expectancy for members currently aged 65 of 23.3 years 
for men and 25.2 years for women. The Company and Board of trustees are responsible for governance of the plans and ensuring it is 
sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefits. The trustees appoint advisers to carry out the administration actuarial work and 
investment advice. 161 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED
Following the 2014 actuarial valuation of the Thomas Cook UK pension plan, the Recovery Plan agreed with the pension trustees to fund the 
actuarial deficit was extended. In line with that agreement, during the year ended 30 September 2017 Thomas Cook UK paid instalments 
totalling £26m in line with the recovery plan.
The valuation of the Thomas Cook UK pension plan at 30 September 2017 resulted in a surplus of £123m (2016: £52m), this is included 
within the net Group pension deficit of £327m (2016: £457m). The £123m has been disclosed as a pension asset in the statements of 
financial position.

The scheme assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by the 
Group. The scheme currently has part of its assets invested in a liability driven investment portfolio. These assets, in combination with the 
other protection assets in the portfolio, provide interest rate and inflation rate protection.
Sensitivities of the defined benefit obligation
The Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: 
Asset volatility
The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets underperform this 
yield, this will create a deficit. However, the Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the 
supporting group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Group’s long-term strategy to manage the plans 
efficiently. See below for more details on the Group’s asset-liability matching strategy.
Changes in bond yields 
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ 
bond holdings.
Inflation risk
Some of the group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps 
on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation). The majority of the plan’s assets are either 
unaffected by (fixed interest bonds) or loosely correlated with (equities) inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase 
the deficit.
Life expectancy 
The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the plans’ liabilities.  163 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 30 September 2016 is 24.6 years.
Defined contribution schemes 
There are a number of defined contribution schemes in the Group, the principal scheme being the Thomas Cook UK DC Pension Scheme, 
which is open to all UK employees. Cash contributions paid into the defined contribution schemes are accounted for as an income statement 
expense as they are incurred. The total charge for the year in respect of this and other defined contribution schemes, including liabilities in 
respect of insured benefits relating to workers’ compensation arrangements, amounted to £51m (2016: £46m).
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. 164

33 PRIOR YEAR RESTATEMENTS 
During the year management identified that long term aircraft maintenance provisions had been measured using an incorrect discount rate. 
An adjustment has been calculated to restate the carrying value of these provisions using a risk free rate based on government bond rates 
of similar currency and term to the related obligations. The impact of this restatement principally affects the opening balance at 1 October 
2015 and prior periods and has resulted in a £46m increase in aircraft maintenance provisions recorded within opening reserves as at 
1 October 2015. The effect of applying these revised discount rates would not be material to the results of 2016.
During the year a reassessment of contingent consideration to be settled in the period has been performed. This has resulted in a £4m 
reduction to the prior year separately disclosed items, within the income statement, and corresponding reduction in non-controlling interest. 
Following the cessation of the Hotels 4U business in the UK at the end of 2016, it was identified during the year that there were a number of 
balances that were assessed as no longer recoverable. This resulted in a reduction in prior year profit of £6m, of which £2m was in respect 
of the impairment of property and recognition of onerous leases recorded in separately disclosed items. A further £4m was recognised in 
underlying profit in respect of a reduction in trade and other receivables.
During FY16 an estimate of the TOMS (Tour Operator Margin Scheme) liability was recognised, however it was subsequently identified that the 
final liability was understated by £2m. This has been recorded as an adjustment to underlying profit with a corresponding decrease in trade 
and other payables. 
Management identified a deferral of a profit on a historic sale and leaseback transaction had not been correctly recorded over the life of the 
lease. This resulted in an adjustment of £4m being recorded in opening reserves in the prior year.
Amounts of £7m previously recognised receivables have been reassessed as irrecoverable, this included £3m that related to pre-FY16 and 
therefore has been taken through the opening reserves. The remaining £4m related to FY16 and resulted in an adjustment to separately 
disclosed items in 2016. 
The errors have been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for the prior periods, as follows: 
Impact on equity – increase/(decrease) in equity 30 September 2016 £m
Trade and other receivables (11)
Plant, property and equipment (1)

Software and intangible assets are initially measured at cost. The direct costs associated with the development of business software and 
intangibles are capitalised where project success is probable and the capitalisation criteria is met. Following initial recognition, software and 
intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Software and intangible assets with a finite life 
are amortised from the date the asset is ready for use on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life which is four years (websites 
five years).
At each reporting date, Thomas Cook Group plc reviews the carrying amounts of its software and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. Where estimated useful lives or recoverable values have 
diminished, amortisation is accelerated. 172

12 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company’s financial instruments comprise investment in subsidiary undertakings, amounts due to/from subsidiary undertakings, cash 
and cash equivalents, and other payables and receivables. The Company’s approach to the management of financial risks is discussed on 
pages 151 to 153. The Company believes the value of its financial assets to be fully recoverable.
2017: The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily 
Euro).  The Company estimates that a 5% strengthening in Euro would increase profit before tax by £nil, while a 5% weakening in Euro would 
decrease profit before tax by £nil.
2016: The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily 
Euro).  The Company estimates that a 5% strengthening in Euro would increase profit before tax by £nil, while a 5% weakening in Euro would 
decrease profit before tax by £nil.
The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments is exposed to movements in interest rates. The Company estimates that a 1% 
increase in interest rates would increase profit before tax by £nil (2016: 1% increase in interest rates increase loss before tax by £nil), while a 
0.25% decrease in interest rates would decrease profit before tax.

The Company is exposed to credit risk in relation to cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and amounts due from 
subsidiary undertakings. The maximum exposure in respect of each of these items at the balance sheet date is their carrying value. 
The Company assesses its counterparty exposure in relation to surplus cash using credit limits based on counterparty credit ratings. 
For amounts due from subsidiary undertakings and receivables, future operating cash flows are assessed for any indication of impairment. 
In the opinion of the Directors, the fair value of the Company’s investments is not less than the carrying value as stated in the balance sheet. 
As of 30 September 2017, Company receivables from Group undertakings were not past due and were expected to be recovered in full.
The Company’s approach to credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is explained in Note 9.

mechanism, whereby travel companies are required to collect and remit a small charge for each protected customer upon booking.

All Shareholders can submit their proxy vote for the AGM 
electronically at www.sharevote.co.uk. To register their vote, 
Shareholders will need the numbers detailed on their form of proxy.

with Shareview can submit their proxy vote by logging on to 
www.shareview.co.uk and clicking on the link to vote underneath 
their Thomas Cook Group plc holding. 
SHARE REGISTER AND SHAREHOLDER ENQUIRIES 
The Company’s share register is maintained by Equiniti. 
Queries relating to Thomas Cook Group plc shares should be 
addressed to:
The Registrar  
Equiniti  
Aspect House  
Spencer Road  
Lancing  
West Sussex BN99 6DA 
Tel: 0371 384 2154*  
(International telephone number: +44 (0)121 415 0182)
* Lines are open 8.30am to 5.30pm (London time), Monday to Friday (excluding UK public holidays). 
Shareholders should quote the Company reference number 3174 and 
their Shareholder reference number (which can be found on their 
share certificates), when contacting the Registrar. 
SHAREVIEW 
To be able to access information about their shares and other 
investments online, Shareholders can register with Shareview 
(www.shareview.co.uk). Registration is free; Shareholders will 
need their Shareholder reference number which is shown on their 
form of proxy and share certificate. By registering for this service, 
Shareholders will: 
 > help reduce paper, print and postage costs;
 > help the environment;
 > be able to submit their queries by email; and 
 > be able to manage their shareholding easily and securely online. 
Once registered, whenever Shareholder documents are available, 
Shareholders will be sent a link to the appropriate website, 
where the documents will be available to view or download. 
Receiving documents online does not affect Shareholders’ rights 
in any way. 
WEBSITE 
The Group’s corporate website, www.thomascookgroup.com, 
provides information including:
 > news, updates, press releases and regulatory announcements;
 > investor information, including the Annual Report, financial results, 
financial calendar and share price information;
 > details of Shareholder meetings and poll results;
 > biographies of the Board of Directors;
 > the Company’s Articles of Association, the Terms of Reference for 
the Committees of the Board and the Board Appointments Policy; 
and
 > sustainability reporting. 
MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS ON THE SHARE REGISTER 
If a Shareholder receives two or more sets of the documents 
concerning the AGM, this means that there is more than one account 
in their name on the Shareholder register, perhaps because either the 
name or the address appears on each account in a slightly different 
way. For security reasons, Equiniti will not amalgamate the accounts 
without the Shareholder’s written consent. Therefore, if a Shareholder 
would like their multiple accounts to be combined, they should write 
to Equiniti, detailing the different Shareholder reference numbers, and 
request that they be combined into one account. 
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS 
At the AGM on 10 April 2008, the Company passed a resolution 
allowing the Group’s corporate website to be used as the primary 
means of communication with its Shareholders. A consultation card 
was sent to Shareholders enabling them to choose either to:
 > receive notification by email when Shareholder documentation is 
available on the website; or
 > continue to receive Shareholder documentation in hard copy.
Shareholders who did not respond were deemed, in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006, to have agreed to receive Shareholder 
documentation via the Company’s corporate website.
These arrangements for electronic Shareholder communications 
provide Shareholders with the opportunity to access information in 
a timely manner and help the Company to reduce both its costs and 
its environmental impact. 
DIVIDEND
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 0.6 pence per share.
The ex-dividend date will be 8 March 2018 and, subject to 
Shareholder approval at the 2018 Annual General Meeting, the final 
dividend of 0.6 pence will be paid on 5 April 2018 to Shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 9 March 2018.
More information about our dividend policy can be found on page 73. 
If you have any questions about the payment of this dividend, please 
contact our Registrars Equiniti, whose contact details are set out on 
this page.

THOMAS COOK AG/MYTRAVEL GROUP PLC 
MERGER
Thomas Cook Group plc was formed in June 2007 upon the merger 
of Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc.
MyTravel Group plc Shareholders received one Thomas Cook 
Group plc Ordinary Share for every one MyTravel Group plc share 
previously held. MyTravel Group plc share certificates are no longer 
valid and can be destroyed. Replacement Thomas Cook Group plc 
share certificates were sent to Shareholders, who held shares in 
certificated form, on or around 19 June 2007. If you have any queries 
relating to this, please contact the Registrar. 
WARNING TO SHAREHOLDERS ABOUT SHARE 
FRAUD 
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure 
investors into scams.
They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or 
non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an 
upfront payment.
While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way 
you will probably lose your money.
5,000 people contact the Financial Conduct Authority about share 
fraud each year, with victims losing an average of £20,000. 
How to avoid share fraud 
If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted 
shares, a premium price for shares you own, or free company or 
research reports, you should take these steps before handing over 
any money: 
1.  Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to 
contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
2.  Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person 
and firm contacting you and then end the call.
3.  Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk 
to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by 
the FCA.
4.  Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details.
5.  Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want 
to call it back.
6.  Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact 
details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
7.  Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/
scams.
8.  Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm 
you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
9.  Think about getting independent financial and professional 
advice before you hand over any money.
10. Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
REPORT A SCAM 
If you are approached about a share scam you should tell the FCA 
using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.gov.uk/scams, 
where you can find out about the latest investment scams. You can 
also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. If you have 
already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action 
Fraud on 0300 123 2040. 
SHAREGIFT 
Shareholders with a small number of shares, the value of which 
make it uneconomical to sell, may wish to consider donating them 
to the charity ShareGift (Registered Charity Number 1052686), 
which specialises in using such holdings for charitable benefit. 
Find out more about ShareGift at www.sharegift.org or by 
telephoning +44 (0)20 7930 3737. 
SHAREVIEW DEALING 
A telephone and internet dealing service has been arranged 
through the Registrar to provide a simple way of buying and 
selling Thomas Cook Group plc shares for existing and prospective 
UK-based Shareholders. For telephone dealing call 03456 037 037 
(international telephone number: +44 (0)121 415 7560) between 
8.00am and 4.30pm (London time), Monday to Friday (excluding UK 
public holidays), or visit the website: www.shareview.co.uk/dealing.
