Note: The way we view the business going forward has changed in line with our 
strategic objectives; see 8 and Note 36 for further details on this. Macro-economic factors and strategy 
In 2017 energy prices were significantly 
less volatile than in 2016, when they  
hit ten-year lows, with Brent crude oil 
rising through a range of USD 47-67/
bbl1. The recovery in oil prices has been 
driven by OPEC and non-OPEC countries, 
mainly Russia, first agreeing to and then 
extending their production cuts at the  
end of 20171, which also supported  
a strong year-end finish in the oil price. 
In addition to production cuts, IOCs 
continue to invest selectively with typical 
projects being sanctioned on the basis of 
an oil price of USD 60/bbl2 or less which 
further supports energy prices. However , 
North American shale capacity and the 
ability to ramp up production quickly acts 
as a natural brake to significant price 
increases and this dynamic between 
shale and OPEC’s self-imposed cuts is 
expected to continue throughout 2018. 
Within the Middle East, NOC investment 
is driven more by considerations related 
to market share and funding government 
budgets, and investment in the region is 
expected to continue or even grow from 
recent years
3,4
.  
While the traditional oil industry faces 
some uncertainty, the renewables industry 
continues to develop rapidly and attract 
investment, especially in the offshore 
wind environment which is Lamprell’s 
area of focus in this growing market. 
The known global portfolio of offshore 
wind has the potential to deliver 92GW, 
with circa 75GW still to be awarded and 
built. Europe leads the way globally, with 
the UK and Germany by far the largest 
participants to date in this market5.  
The offshore wind industry is undergoing 
a fundamental shift from an industry that 
needs subsidies to attract investment, 
to one that is commercial and attracts 
investment in its own right. The 2017 UK 
Contract for Difference (CfD) Round 2 
auction delivered a strike price of  
£57.50/MWh for two wind farms, some 
50% below that achieved two years 
earlier6, and these cost reductions are 
expected to continue through technology 
innovation, economies of scale and 
higher project volumes7. As offshore wind 
power reaches parity with traditional 
power generation, and with some national 
governments setting policy to eliminate 
petrol and diesel cars from the roads in 
the next decades8, the future of offshore 
wind as a source of abundant green 
energy appears assured and is a long-
term market opportunity for Lamprell. 
Strategic report
Markets, pipeline and opportunities
04
The medium-term forecast for the global energy industry is predicting 
modest growth. Bidding in our traditional oil & gas market remains key 
to our business but is highly competitive due to limited project flows. 
Conversely, the renewables sector is developing rapidly and offers us 
an opportunity to diversify .

Market sectors and our opportunities
Renewables
The discipline shown by IOCs over the last few years has meant 
a significant drop in annual spend on capital projects, with some 
IOCs reporting reductions of 35% from 20131, and this continues 
to translate into reduced project flow into the supply chain for 
contractors such as Lamprell. With oil prices expected to be 
relatively flat over the near future within our oil & gas market, 
activity is mainly focused on the shallow water and shelf projects 
in the Middle East, UK and Norwegian sea sectors where 
projects are proceeding. 
In 2017 Saudi Aramco awarded nearly USD 3 billion worth of 
shallow water EPC(I) projects2 to support offshore oil production. 
They have also committed to continue additional investment  
in the Arabian Gulf to increase their offshore production and 
in the Red Sea to progress offshore development in 2018 
and beyond. Lamprell is well positioned in Saudi Arabia to 
take advantage of this through our investment with our newly 
inaugurated International Maritime Industries (“IMI”) marine  
yard joint venture with Saudi Aramco, Bahri and Hyundai  
Heavy Industries. We also see opportunities in the UAE where 
ADNOC has recently committed significant capital spending  
in its onshore and offshore oil & gas programmes3. Being a  
UAE-based company with a long history of working and 
delivering to ADNOC, Lamprell is well placed to participate  
in this next wave of investment in the UAE.
In the Norwegian and Barents Sea, Statoil is progressing with  
its major field developments at Castberg and Johan Sverdrup 
Phase 2, recently awarding several EPC(I) packages3. In 
addition, other field developers such as AkerBP , OMV and Lundin 
are moving towards final investment decisions in 2018 and 2019  
on various Barents Sea projects. With Lamprell’s history of 
delivering projects in the North Sea, we are making use of our 
cost-effective, safe and high-quality offering as the basis for 
selectively bidding work in the region.
Oil & gas
The renewables offshore wind market has gathered pace over 
the past 12 months with a large number of new enquiries 
received as a result of Lamprell’s proactive marketing efforts in 
this area, in line with our strategic objectives. The main driver is 
the improving economics of wind farms due to the economies of 
scale and technological advancements across the supply chain. 
Up until recently, government subsidies were a political barrier 
to projects reaching sanction, and while they are still in place in 
the latest round of UK awards, they represent a fraction of those 
seen in earlier projects. As subsidies are expected to decrease 
or be eliminated in the medium term, we anticipate a continued 
high volume of enquiries and a more traditional bid cycle where 
timelines are less drawn-out. We also expect less governmental 
involvement, consistent with its role in the oil & gas industry . 
Within the offshore wind market, Lamprell is pursuing options 
across three areas of supply: (i) providing foundations for the 
wind farm turbines similar to those on our current East Anglia 
One project for Scottish Power Renewables; (ii) delivering HVAC 
and HVDC substations leveraging our offshore experience in the 
North Sea; and (iii) constructing Wind Turbine Installation Vessels 
(“WTIV”) consistent with our significant experience building such 
vessels for the likes of Seajacks and Fred Olsen. For foundations, 
we are only pursuing jacket-based projects where our fabrication 
expertise is a differentiator . As wind turbines are expected to get 
larger , and wind farms expected to migrate into deeper water 
offshore, jacket-based projects will predominate over monopiles. 
We have a number of enquiries in hand for jacket foundations 
and substations, predominantly focused in the European market. 
For WTIVs, vessel owners are positioning for the next generation 
of turbine installation, with turbines evolving from 8 MW to larger 
10, 12 or even 15 MW turbines4 although capital investment in 
larger and more costly vessels (which would be required for 
larger turbines) is unlikely to proceed without commitments from 
offshore developers. Lamprell’s approach is, therefore, to focus 
on foundations and substations and to take a more selective view 
of projects to construct WTIVs.

Commitment to safety, employee  
well-being and quality  
Lamprell will continue to put the  
safety of our employees at the forefront 
of our thinking, targeting year-on-year 
improvements in our TRIR performance 
30. We aim to be a regional employer 
of choice, our commitment to safety  
is a key factor to enable us to achieve this 
and we are proud of our staff retention 
record 31, which demonstrates 
this. Similarly, we train our people and 
measure their performance which 
translates into the high quality of the 
products and services we provide.
Competitive offering
Lamprell operates in markets which have 
suffered from the depressed energy 
prices since mid-2014, and so we 
recognise the importance of maintaining 
a competitive offering to our clients. We 
are strategically located in the Middle 
East which will continue to be the world’s 
largest producer of oil with a 37% market 
share by 20351. This allows us to recruit 
highly skilled people from across the 
globe at attractive remuneration levels 
but also to flex our workforce to reflect 
changing workloads. We recognise 
that the energy market supply chain is 
currently under a great deal of pressure 
to reduce costs and so we strive to 
manage our supply chain on a global 
basis to support our products and 
services in ways which are consistent 
with our key strengths.
Lamprell relies on its marketing expertise to identify  
and convert prospects into awards. We are committed  
to working collaboratively and transparently,  
with a view to ensuring project success and  
long-term growth, and value for our shareholders.
COMMITMENT TO 
SAFETY, QUALITY 
AND LONG-TERM 
COLLABORATION  
Working closely with clients and partners
We seek to establish long-term business 
relationships with our clients and partners, 
as evidenced by the repeat business  
from existing clients. We are proud of  
our relationship with ADNOC Drilling,  
for whom we have delivered nine new 
build jackup drilling rigs between  
2007-2017, and with Saudi Aramco  
who is our lead partner at the IMI yard  
in Saudi Arabia 12. We aim to build  
our relationships on a collaborative  
and transparent basis as this allows  
us to resolve issues with our business 
partners more effectively and to deliver 
what the clients want. This is reflected 
in the quality of our workforce where 
Lamprell is selectively building internal 
capability to support our strategic goal 
of moving up the value chain to directly 
access EPC(I) opportunities. We are in 
discussions with strategic partners who 
will help us build more rapidly and allow 
us to offer a single one-stop delivery 
model for our clients 08.
Potential risks to the business model
The prolonged downturn in the oil & 
gas market for more than three years 
threatens Lamprell’s business model as 
we are dependent on clients’ decisions  
to sanction major capital programmes. 
There are various potential risks to 
Lamprell’s business 34, and we look  
to mitigate or control them through our 
risk management processes.

5
Build on our rig refurbishment and land rig position
Maintain base-load of contracts in rig refurbishment and land rigs as the market 
recovers 
Leverage key strengths to service the rig refurbishment sector; build on 
our long-term relationship with drilling community 
Repeat customer contracts
In light of the continuing delays to project 
awards in the oil & gas market, recovery 
will be slow for the foreseeable future. We 
are confident that we can convert bids 
into profitable awards in markets where 
we have a differentiated offering and 
strong track record. 
Our business is structured to approach 
opportunities by way of our strategic 
objectives in rigs, selected EPC(I) projects 
and in Saudi Arabia 11, and we will 
maintain our bidding discipline to ensure 
we target projects that fit this profile. While 
oil & gas has traditionally underpinned 
our business, it is crucial we continue to 
diversify into the renewables market and 
other geographies, notably Saudi Arabia.  
We have repositioned the way that 
we approach the markets 05, by 
simplifying our business units around  
Rigs, EPC(I) and Contracting Services  
and by populating those business units 
with specialist and experienced personnel. 
This has included the investment into 
additional resources in order to strengthen 
our competencies as required.
Rigs
Through our 20% investment in the  
IMI yard, the joint venture has signed  
an offtake agreement with Saudi Aramco 
to build 20 jackup drilling rigs over the 
coming ten years. Lamprell will support 
this by constructing significant parts  
of the first two rigs using Lamprell’s  
new proprietary rig design. The LJ43,  
developed in collaboration with GustoMSC,  
has been selected as the base design 
for the 20 rigs to be constructed at the 
IMI yard in Saudi Arabia 12. Our other 
traditional areas of strength in the rig 
refurbishment and land rig businesses 
remain important revenue streams for 
Lamprell. We are proactively seeking to 
agree long-term cooperation agreements 
in the drilling community .
EPC(I)
Lamprell is well placed to support the 
offshore investment programmes by 
ADNOC, Saudi Aramco and other leading 
clients, and we aim to move up the value 
chain to be a prime EPC(I) contractor . 
We will leverage our track record and 
relationships in the region, and selectively 
invest in key resources and our people 
to bolster our EPC(I) capability . Lamprell 
was proud to secure our first renewables 
contract, East Anglia One, with Scottish 
Power Renewables late in 2016. While 
this project has been challenging with 
the Company incurring significant losses, 
this market segment is attractive going 
forward. As a result of the experience 
gained on this project, we have moved far 
up the learning curve as we strengthened 
our capabilities and made changes to 
personnel to improve our competencies. 
Contracting services
Our smaller business streams comprising 
of O&M and Sunbelt Safety Services 
continue to support both Lamprell and 
our clients by providing highly skilled 
specialists for various projects.  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

NEW 
MANAGEMENT 
TEAM  
IN PLACE
“Lamprell has been working collaboratively 
with its partners on the establishment of 
the IMI business since 2015, and we are 
pleased to see such tangible progress 
towards the operational phase. This is a 
transformational project in many aspects 
and we are proud to be part of it as IMI is 
capable of becoming a leading regional 
and global service provider to the rig and 
vessel markets.”

VP Business Development  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
11 On 31 May 2017 Lamprell signed 
a joint venture agreement with 
Saudi Aramco, Bahri and HHI 
which will establish and operate 
a maritime yard in the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia. Our new 
management team is in place 
to help deliver the joint venture 
established as “International 
Maritime Industries” or “IMI”. 
This is a cornerstone project in 
the Saudi Vision 2030 and will 
help us to establish Lamprell’s 
business in Saudi Arabia.
Progressing towards operational phase
Once fully operational, IMI will provide 
a broad range of services to the oil & 
gas and maritime industries with the 
primary focus being the construction 
and maintenance, repair and overhaul 
(“MRO”) of offshore rigs, commercial 
vessels and offshore service vessels.  
The yard is part of a development 
known as “The King Salman International 
Complex for Maritime Industries & 
Services”. The yard will comprise of four 
main production zones – A, B, C and 
D.  Lamprell has been chosen to be a 
technical partner for zones A and D and 
so our team will have a key ongoing role in 
developing the yard’s capabilities. Zone A 
will be used to provide MRO services for 
jackup drilling rigs and vessels whereas 
zone D will be used for the construction  
of new build jackup drilling rigs.

John Malcolm
Non-Executive Chairman  Strategic report
International Maritime Industries
14 IMI has been identified as a 
priority initiative towards the 
Saudi Government’s Vision 
2030 programme for economic 
development and represents 
a fully integrated engineering, 
fabrication and services shipyard 
for vessels and offshore rigs.
Project overview 
The integrated maritime yard will be 
the largest in the region in terms of 
production capacity and scale, providing 
an unprecedented mix of products and 
services in the area. IMI will enable its 
customers to meet their engineering, 
manufacturing, construction and MRO 
requirements for offshore drilling rigs, 
offshore support and commercial vessels, 
as well as VLCCs. 
The yard is unique in scale and 
integration as it will have:
• the largest combined drydock  
area compared to any other yard  
in the region;
• the largest ship lift in the world with  
a capacity of 25,000te;
• the largest combined lift capability  
over a drydock of 2,150te; and 
• the region’s longest quayside of 
approximately 8,600 million metres. 
The new facility will have the annual 
capacity to manufacture four offshore rigs, 
over 40 vessels including three VLCCs, 
and service over 260 maritime products. 
A unique combination of expertise and 
capabilities are made available through 
IMI, with Lamprell and HHI offering their 
technical expertise, track record and 
capabilities while Saudi Aramco and Bahri 
will conclude offtake agreements with 
IMI and make available their operational 
knowledge and market access. Also, 
IMI is in the process of establishing 
long-term strategic partnerships with 
original equipment manufacturers and 
supply chain companies with the aim to 
positively influence the overall lifecycle 
costs of the fleets of IMI’s customers and 
create a fully integrated maritime industry 
ecosystem in Saudi Aramco. 
Highly skilled and experienced staff  
from Lamprell are working with the 
joint venture partners to establish and 
implement IT systems, engineering 
capabilities, procurement systems, 
production processes and quality 
assurance policies and procedures that 
have been proven to be successful at 
both Lamprell and partner facilities. 
IMI will have its first order intake  
from Saudi Aramco and Bahri in  
2018 and 2019 respectively, for the 
procurement of new rigs and tanker 
vessels. Lamprell’s new proprietary rig 
design, LJ43, developed in collaboration 
with GustoMSC, has been selected  
as the base design for the 20 rigs. The 
fabrication capabilities are expected  
to commence in 2H 2019 with the facility 
reaching its full production capacity  
by 2022.
Financial overview 
The IMI joint venture company has been 
officially established by four joint venture 
parties in collaboration with the Saudi 
Government. The partners committed  
to a total investment of more than  
USD 1.7 billion (of which USD 1 billion 
will be provided by the Saudi Industrial 
Development Fund) for the start up of 
operations as well as the procurement of 
equipment, while the Saudi Government 
has started constructing the infrastructure 
for the industrial complex and developing 
the surrounding industrial city . 
IMI activities are projected to provide 
a robust return on the investment for its 
shareholders as well as a solid impact 
on the gross domestic product of Saudi 
Arabia, especially in terms of import 
substitution, job creation/training of Saudi 
nationals to form a high percentage of the 
workforce and supply chain management.
Strategic highlights
Lamprell directly benefits from its 
participation in IMI as a technical partner 
due to the diversification of markets and 
exposure to new but complementary 
market segments. Synergies are created 
in production methodologies, product 
development, engineering activities 
and skills development of the staff. It 
is expected that the partnership in IMI 
is an initial step in the collaboration 
between the partners in the future, and 
that multiple commercial initiatives will be 
developed among the partners directly . 
“The IMI yard will become the largest  
in the region in terms of production 
capacity and scale. The facility will serve 
offshore oil & gas rigs, offshore support 
vessels, and commercial vessels including 
very large crude carriers (“VLCCs”).  
By becoming the technical partner for  
the rig building and MRO zones within  
the maritime yard, Lamprell is enhancing 
its reputation both regionally and  
globally as a company of choice  
for rig builds and services.”

Saudi Vision 2030
The IMI yard is a cornerstone project 
of the Vision 2030 programme which is 
being driven by the Government of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to stimulate 
its economy and diversify its revenues. 
Lamprell’s investment in the yard in Saudi 
Arabia demonstrates its commitment to 
support the country . At the same time 
Lamprell will aim to grow and diversify 
its ongoing business at its existing UAE 
facilities. 
Commitment to local investment
Lamprell is committed to developing 
businesses and personnel in Saudi 
Arabia as part of this project. It is actively 
working with Saudi companies to develop 
the local supply chain network and 
has partnered with a Saudi company 
to develop its presence in-Kingdom. In 
addition, a further goal of IMI is training 
of the Saudi workforce. We will see the 
first group of Saudi apprentices join the 
IMI yard training academy, which hopes 
to deliver 750 trades personnel within the 
next two years and increase Saudization 
in line with Vision 2030.
The joint venture is expected 
to increase revenue generating 
opportunities for Lamprell 
within the UAE with significant 
component parts for the first two 
jackup drilling rigs expected to 
be subcontracted to Lamprell’s 
UAE facilities during the initial 
construction phase of the IMI yard.

Future pipeline
Over a 10-year period, Bahri will place 
orders with the IMI yard to construct a 
minimum of 52 different vessels including 
20 VLCCs plus use IMI for most of its 
vessel MRO requirements.

Our people at IMI
The combination of world-leading 
oilfield operators, vessel owners, rig and 
shipbuilders bring a vibrant multicultural 
mix of people together and as a technical 
partner , Lamprell is contributing an array 
of technical experts who are focused  
on preparing the IMI yard for the start  
of operations.

repair projects.
IMI Board
Lamprell has two representatives on the IMI Board, CEO Christopher McDonald and 
CFO Tony Wright. The new IMI Board consists of a total of nine members; they are 
pictured here with the newly appointed IMI CEO and CFO following their first Board 
meeting which was held in December 2017.  Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
16 We expected 2017 to be the toughest 
year to date for Lamprell. It was. 
Unfortunately, in addition to the revenue 
pressures anticipated by the broader 
industry, we encountered major 
operational challenges on the East 
Anglia One project which resulted in 
a significant loss for the Group and 
negatively impacted our financial 
statements accordingly . The Group’s 
operational and financial performance in 
2017 fell well short of our expectations 
even though we made good progress 
in delivering our strategic goals.
Clear strategy
It is critical to preserve the long-term 
perspective amid immediate challenges, 
and 2017 has been a year of change and 
strategic repositioning for Lamprell. Our 
immediate priority was the operational 
demands of our ongoing projects. In 
a global energy environment marked 
by complexity and uncertainty, the 
Board focused on developing a clear 
strategy with solid deliverables to 
ensure Lamprell’s future. Despite initial 
indications of a recovery in the oil & gas 
industry, we do not expect the new build 
jackup rig sector to recover in the near to 
mid-term as capital expenditure amongst 
oil producers remains restrained and new 
project awards continue to slip 04. 
We therefore are determined to access 
alternative markets, in particular in the 
renewables sector , and broaden our 
service offering by participating in larger 
and higher value EPC(I) contracts through 
partnership options.   
Another pillar of our strategic vision is 
gaining access to resilient markets and 
in particular Saudi Arabia. In spite of 
being one of the most influential regional 
players in the Middle East with a 40+ year 
track record in fabrication, Lamprell has 
not previously done business with Saudi 
Aramco, one of the most significant global 
oil majors. This finally changed in 2017 
and we are delighted to have entered 
into a joint venture agreement with the 
company along with Bahri and Hyundai 
Heavy Industries to build a new maritime 
facility in eastern Saudi Arabia, which 
will become one of the largest yards in 
the world 12. For a company of our 
size, this is a critical point of entry into a 
dynamic market committed to ongoing 
growth and a major stepping stone 
towards our strategic goals. 
Our investment will enable Lamprell to 
build on its core expertise in jackup 
rigs and will also provide consistent 
contributions to our revenue streams.  
Our commitment to invest in this project 
has also offered an inroad into one of 
the most sought-after and selective 
processes in the industry as Lamprell  
has pre-qualified for a shortlist of 
companies being considered for a 
long-term agreement to deliver EPC(I) 
projects to Saudi Aramco. Our confidence 
in the prospects of this partnership was 
almost unanimously supported by our 
shareholders when they voted for the final 
investment decision in June last year .  
We were pleased to receive full backing 
of our banking syndicate for this venture 
as well.
Ability to deliver
We experienced significant challenges  
on the East Anglia One project 26.  
This was a very disappointing outcome  
for our shareholders which resulted  
in a total USD 98.1 million loss for the 
Group. We have undertaken a root cause 
analysis to determine the factors causing 
the significant, additional costs on the 
project which started with insufficient 
rigour during the bidding phase, 
compounded by inexperienced project 
leadership in this new market. With these 
learnings, we have already implemented 
many performance improvement 
initiatives to return to productivity levels 
close to historic norms and to prevent 
recurrence, 26. The lessons learned 
and experiences from this project, 
although painful, have confirmed our 
commitment and our ability to deliver to 
the industry in general. The fundamentals 
of the renewables market are solid and, 
backed by European policy 05, it is 
anticipated to become a major pillar of 
global energy supply over the coming 
years. Therefore, we now view this as an 
investment in securing Lamprell’s position 
in this emerging industry . 
The prudent approach we have taken 
towards cost management in the past  
two years has allowed us to preserve  
the strength of our balance sheet
 20, which in turn enables us to focus 
on delivery of strategic growth amid 
market and operational challenges. 
We are being selective in our new 
business pursuits, targeting only realistic 
opportunities that fit with our core 
competencies and our diversification 
Lamprell’s operational and financial performance was disappointing  
in 2017. Lamprell is now entering a critical phase where it must  
learn from 2017 and deliver the strategic objectives on the path  
to long-term growth.
A YEAR OF 
CHANGE
TO THE 
BUSINESS  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
17 goals while generating robust margins. 
This approach has refocused our bid 
pipeline 04, and we have upskilled 
our workforce and invested in additional 
resources to broaden our in-house 
expertise and match our capabilities with 
the strategic goals set for the business. 
Addressing new markets is rarely 
straightforward and often comes at a cost. 
In its 40+ year growth history, the Group 
has faced setbacks, most notably as we 
diversified from rig refurbishment into 
new build jackup fabrication in the late 
1990s. Our efforts and investment proved 
worthwhile then and I am confident they 
will do so again. 
The lessons we learnt in 2017 are not 
only applicable to the renewables sector; 
they have led us to review our overall 
approach to accessing new opportunities. 
The Board is now closely involved in 
senior leadership planning to ensure 
our in-house expertise matches our 
strategic objectives and we are capable 
of delivering not only on quality but also 
on cost. 
Board changes
In September 2017 I replaced John 
Kennedy as Lamprell’s Chairman. John’s 
leadership has taken the Group onto a 
new strategic path as the industry entered 
a significant downturn. I thank John for 
his efforts over the last five years and very 
much look forward to taking the vision 
to the next level. In 2017 we welcomed 
Nick Garrett and James Dewar as new 
Non-Executive Directors; their collective 
experience in delivering strategic 
transformations within major industry 
players will be highly valuable. Following 
these appointments, the Board has made 
a number of changes to the composition 
of its Committees which are detailed on 
page 42 of this report. 
Final dividend
Given the significant challenges the 
Group encountered in 2017 and the 
uncertainty in the industry, the Board does 
not recommend a final dividend for the 
year . We are grateful for the confidence 
and support of our shareholders and our 
lending banks as we work through the 
near-term issues facing the Group and 
look to deliver long-term growth. 
Looking to the future
We experienced significant challenges 
throughout 2017 and these have had 
a profound effect on the way that we 
approach and implement our vision. We 
streamlined the business over the past two 
years and we have adapted and added 
to our resources to support the strategic 
objectives. We are now entering into a 
phase of delivering on our goals. The 
Board is confident that transformational 
growth and diversification is the right 
strategy for Lamprell for future success.

John Malcolm
Non executive Chairman 2017 was my first full year as CEO, and 
it has been a year of repositioning for 
Lamprell. It has also been dominated 
by the problems on the East Anglia One 
project which we have worked hard to 
overcome, as detailed below. Despite 
early signs of recovery in the wider oil 
industry, the global jackup rig market 
remained dormant. Therefore, building 
upon our core competencies, Lamprell 
has adopted a strategy of geographical 
and sector diversification by addressing 
opportunities in the renewables sector 
as well as broadening our expertise and 
partnership options to access EPC(I) 
projects. We have also strengthened our 
position in our core geographic region 
and the new build jackup rig market by 
partnering with major energy industry 
players to establish a large-scale 
maritime yard in Saudi Arabia 11. This 
will broaden our global reach, product 
expertise, and secure a foothold in one 
of the few oil & gas markets committed 
to growth in the current environment. 
Investing in people will be vital to 
implement our strategy 08.   
Health and safety
I am pleased to report that we achieved 
a TRIR of 0.30 for 2017, in line with 
industry best practice. This achievement 
is particularly noteworthy given the large 
numbers of new employees hired during 
2017. In May 2017 we appointed a new 
Vice President of HSESQ 29 who has 
brought new energy to drive improvement 
in our safety standards. Although the 
results of this effort are impressive, we 
are looking for new ways to improve safety 
performance as our TRIR statistics should 
not be allowed to stagnate. An area of 
specific focus will be safety practices at 
remote site locations where the risks of 
an incident can be higher due to reduced 
oversight. We are striving to provide 
a best practice safety and wellbeing 
environment for our employees 30. 
Operational update 
2017 saw the completion of three new 
build jackup rigs, two for NDC (now known 
as ADNOC Drilling) and one to Shelf 
Drilling. We also completed the large-scale 
UZ-750 module fabrication project for 
Petrofac 27.
With the delivery of the above projects, 
our operational focus moved onto the 
execution of the two major projects 
awarded at the end of 2016: the  
USD 90 million rig upgrade project for 
Master Marine and the contract for the 
fabrication of 60 foundations for the 
UK’s East Anglia One offshore wind farm 
project. While we made good progress on 
Master Marine, 27, I am disappointed 
with the outcome of the East Anglia One 
project which has resulted in a significant 
loss for the Company, especially as we 
successfully delivered five major projects 
in 1H 2017 including the above three rigs. 
Renewables is a new sector for us and 
one which we believe offers significant 
long-term potential. It turned out that our 
first project involved a steep learning 
curve. Having said this, we have learned 
the hard way how to be competitive in 
future in this sector . 
Based on our root cause analysis for this 
project, we did not spend enough time 
and effort during the bidding stage to 
develop a robust project execution plan 
that adequately addressed project risks.  
We compounded this problem by initially 
assigning a project leadership team that 
was experienced in our traditional core 
competencies but not this new market. 
We have learned by experience that the 
risks and challenges associated with 
constructing and shipping 60 jackets 
in an assembly line process are very 
different from constructing multiple rigs 
concurrently .

As the downturn in the oil industry continues to affect our traditional 
sources of revenue, in 2017 we struggled to execute on our entry 
into the renewable foundations market. This is a major new market for 
Lamprell which presents both significant opportunities and challenges.

19 towards the end of the project, we would 
have made a profit in line with our return 
expectations. This gives me confidence 
that going forward we can compete 
successfully in this important and fast-
growing sector .
Our rig refurbishment segment continues 
to demonstrate solid performance, and  
we noted a recovery in new orders 
towards the end of the year , although  
the scope of work requested remains 
below historical norms. 
In other segments, we reported 
successful completion of a mid-size 
project for Schlumberger comprising of 
two land rigs of their new design. The 
client is deploying them for operation in 
the region. This project has reinforced 
our emerging reputation for constructing 
high-quality land rigs in a safe and timely 
manner , and we will be looking to build on 
this in the coming years.
Implementing the strategic objectives
During 2017, the Group successfully 
implemented a number of steps towards 
fulfilment of its strategy as it looked to 
diversify and de-risk its exposure to oil 
price volatility and to access revenue 
generating opportunities in new sectors 
and geographies.  
Our most ambitious step in the journey 
of transformation was the joint venture in 
May 2017 to establish a major maritime 
yard in Saudi Arabia see 11. This 
was the culmination of many months 
of negotiation and due diligence, and 
so it was pleasing not only to sign the 
agreement with the partners, but also 
to see such overwhelming support 
from our shareholders for the project. 
When fully operational, the yard will 
provide Lamprell with an unprecedented 
opportunity to access a major growth 
market. Construction works have 
already commenced, and we expect full 
commissioning of all zones by 2022. 
Not only has this strengthened our 
position in new build jackup rigs, it has 
also led to further regional opportunities 
which are aligned with our long-term 
strategy . We prequalified for a long-term 
agreement with Saudi Aramco which, 
if successful, would make us one of a 
limited number of companies bidding for 
approximately USD 3 billion of offshore 
EPC(I) contracts each year . To access 
this opportunity, we are partnering with a 
renowned offshore installation partner to 
complement our construction expertise. 
In addition to the LTA, we are also 
pursuing EPC(I) work in other regions 
representing an annual opportunity 
set of approximately USD 3 billion. We 
have reinforced our in-house resources 
to be able to address the bidding and 
execution to a high standard and have 
invested in building a team with expertise 
in the segment, as well as specifically in 
working within an LTA framework.    
Our first win in the renewables sector in 
2016 has affirmed our intention to solidify 
our position in this fast-growing industry 
and having learned from the substantial 
project challenges we encountered at the 
start we remain enthusiastic about future 
opportunities – around 45% of our current 
bids are focused on this sector .  
Outlook
With many of our strategic opportunities 
coming into focus, 2018 is set to become 
a critical year for Lamprell. Our revenue 
levels will come under further pressure in 
2018 in the absence of significant new 
awards in 2017. That said, we are working 
to convert some key opportunities during 
the year: the first two jackup rigs from the 
Saudi joint venture are expected to be 
awarded with portions of the work to be 
subcontracted to our facilities in the UAE, 
and we will also know the outcome of 
the highly competitive selection process 
for the LTA in 2H 2018. In addition, some 
of the bids in our current pipeline are 
expected to be awarded towards the 
end of 2018. We are, however , seeing an 
increase in activity in our bid pipeline, 
which stood at USD 3.6 billion at the 
end of 2017 and are confident that the 
diversification strategy along with market 
recovery in the medium term will allow us 
to deliver on our growth ambition. Over 
the years Lamprell has proved time and 
again its ability to address temporary 
challenges and to emerge a more resilient 
and reliable industry player . That was only 
possible with an exceptionally committed 
and experienced workforce 31, and 
I thank the team for their full dedication 
during these challenging times.

Financial review
20 As anticipated, the Group’s financial 
performance came under pressure as the 
capital expenditure cuts in the oil & gas 
industry over the last four years affected 
our levels of new project awards and 
therefore our revenues. Our revenue for 
2017 was USD 370.4 million, a significant 
but expected reduction on USD 705.0 
million reported in the prior year . 
The first half of the year showed steady 
revenue flows with a number of major 
project completions 25 and the 
resulting final milestone payments. Second 
half revenues were driven primarily by 
the East Anglia One and Master Marine 
projects, the contract with Schlumberger 
for the construction of two land rigs and 
the slow recovery of the rig refurbishment 
segment where we saw an increase in 
activity towards the end of the year 27. 
The newbuild jackup rig segment 
generated USD 49.4 million in revenue 
during the reporting period, a sharp 
reduction (2016: USD 567.6 million) 
driven by the prolonged market downturn. 
Revenue for oil & gas contracting 
services, which includes the Master 
Marine project, increased to USD 131.3 
million (2016: USD 47.6 million). The 
offshore platforms segment, which 
includes the East Anglia One project, 
generated USD 140.7 million in revenue  
(2016: USD 12.8 million). 
Modules revenue amounted to  
USD 3.0 million (2016: USD 40.8 million) 
and operations, maintenance and 
manpower supply USD 46.1 million  
(2016: USD 36.2 million).
Margin performance 
Despite strong margin contributions 
from project completions in the first half 
of 2017, the Group made a gross loss 
of USD 50.2 million for the year ended 
2017 as a result of reduced revenues as 
well as the significant losses incurred on 
the East Anglia One project (2016 gross 
profit: USD 57.2 million). The negative 
net margin was thus 13.5%. The Group 
has delivered a reduction in overheads 
for the sixth consecutive year; in 2017 
our overheads amounted to USD 82.4 
million (2016: USD 98.4 million). We will 
continue to control overheads in line with 
current market outlook but expect an 
increase in 2018 as we continue to invest 
in Lamprell’s strategic initiatives. 
Group EBITDA from continuing  
operations amounted to USD (70.5) 
million (2016: USD 30.6 million1). EBITDA 
margin was (19.0)% compared to 4.3% 
reported in 2016.
Finance cost and financing activities
In 2017, lower levels of debt, facilities 
commitment fees and bonding 
commissions resulted in a reduction  
in net finance cost to USD 5.1 million 
(31 December 2016: USD 9.9 million). 
Gross finance costs were USD 9.0 million. 
Our higher levels of cash in 2017 have 
resulted in our finance income increasing 
to USD 3.9 million (2016: USD 2.9 million).  
Net (loss)/profit before exceptional items 
Due to the operational challenges on 
the East Anglia One project the Group 
recorded a loss before exceptional items 
for 2017 attributable to the equity holders 
of USD 98.1 million (2016: loss of  
USD 0.4 million). The fully diluted loss  
per share for the year was 28.70 cents 
(2016: loss per share of 53.94 cents).
Capital expenditure
The Group’s operational capital expenditure 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 
decreased to USD 23.7 million, compared 
to USD 25.6 million in 2016. Strategic 
capital expenditure of USD 20 million is 
attributable to the Group’s first installment 
of our capital injection into the IMI yard 
11 to fund the joint venture formation 
activities. Over the coming years the 
Group will be required to make further 
contributions on an annual basis totaling 
up to USD 140 million over the five to six 
year construction period. We expect to 
fund this project from our balance sheet.
Lamprell retains considerable flexibility 
in capital expenditure on its existing 
operations and our current commitments 
reflect the strength of the balance sheet 
and our net cash position.
Cash flow and liquidity
The Group’s net cash flow from operating 
activities for the full year ended 2017 
reflected a net inflow of USD 32.4 million 
(2016: net inflow of USD 99.9 million), 
which was driven primarily by the 
conversion of working capital into cash 
on the completion of projects, offset in 
part by increased working capital on 
Lower levels of capital expenditure in the oil & gas industry led to a fall 
in revenues for Lamprell with further margin pressure resulting from 
operational challenges. We have a strong focus on cash conservation 
aligned with our strategic investment.

capital movements and the payment of 
employees’ end of service benefits, the 
Group’s net cash outflow was USD 56.3 
million (2016: inflow of USD 41.1 million).
Cash and bank balances decreased by 
USD 38.2 million to USD 296.4 million. 
Throughout 2017 we continued to focus 
on cash flow and on preserving our 
strong cash position. We will diligently 
protect the cash position of the Group 
in 2018, but there will be a reduction in 
our net cash as a result of the funding 
requirement of USD 30 million on the East 
Anglia One project, an equity contribution 
of USD 38 million in the Saudi Maritime 
Yard (“IMI”) and continued investment 
of USD 10 million in capital expenditure 
to deliver efficiency improvements in our 
yard facilities. The final payment of  
USD 41 million for the two S116E rig kits 
(which we contracted for in 2015 from 
Cameron Le Tourneau to secure our 
supply chain) will come due in 2018 in 
line with the amended delivery schedule. 
Whilst the cash flows relating to the 
East Anglia One project will reduce the 
Group’s tangible net worth in 2018, the 
cash out flows into the IMI, the S116E 
rig kits and the operational capital 
expenditure will increase our tangible 
asset base. We believe it is important to 
use our financial strength to make these 
investments and position the Group to 
take advantage of future opportunities.
Balance sheet
At USD 257.0 million the Group’s net  
cash was marginally below 2016 levels 
(31 December 2016: USD 275.2 million). 
This reflects the initial investment in the 
Saudi Maritime Yard 11 as well as 
working capital requirements on our  
major projects. 
The Group’s total current assets  
at 31 December 2017 were USD 498.9 
million (31 December 2016: USD 616.8 
million). Trade and other receivables 
decreased to USD 164.7 million  
(31 December 2016: USD 275.3 million). 
Shareholders’ equity reduced to  
USD 460.8 million (31 December 2016: 
USD 555.4 million).
Borrowings
Borrowings at 31 December 2017 were 
USD 39.5 million (31 December 2016: 
USD 59.5 million). The Group’s facilities 
comprised (a) a USD 100 million term 
loan amortised over five years, of which 
USD 60 million had been repaid  
by the end of the reporting period;  
(b) USD 50 million for general working 
capital purposes which remained 
unutilised; and (c) USD 100 million of 
working capital for project financing 
(reduced from USD 200 million), also 
undrawn. In 2017 the USD 150 million 
committed bonding facility (which 
reduced from USD 250 million in 2016) to 
be used in connection with new contract 
awards funded by the above working 
capital facility , was reduced by a further 
USD 100 million to 50 million as it was 
replaced by lower cost bilateral bonding 
facilities. The Group’s debt to equity ratio 
at 31 December 2017 was low at 8.6%.
Amendments to debt facility covenants
The Group’s balance sheet remains 
strong. The Board believes that 
maintaining significant liquidity is 
beneficial to the Group. As a result, in 
2017 the Group obtained debt facility 
amendments from its lenders in relation 
to certain of the financial covenants, to 
provide financial flexibility . These include 
a waiver of the ratio of EBITDA to debt 
service covenant up to the period ended 
31 December 2018 and the ratio of 
borrowings to EBITDA covenant for the 
periods ended 31 December 2017 and  
30 June 2018. The tangible net worth 
covenant was also amended to a level 
of USD 325 million for the remaining 
duration of the facility . Securing these 
waivers further demonstrates the strong, 
continuing support that the Group 
receives from its lender group. 
Going concern
The Group continues to adopt the going 
concern basis as detailed on 72. 
Dividends
In the context of ongoing market 
challenges, the low revenue levels in 2017 
and the investment for future growth in the 
Saudi maritime yard, the Directors do not 
recommend the payment of a dividend for 
the period in relation to the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017.

who went through rigorous training at 
Lamprell’s Assessment and Training 
Centre. Using mostly FCAW technology ,  
our welding teams have been given 
specific KPI targets which results in

Senior Welding Engineer  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
25 We started 2017 well with  
the successful delivery of the 
final two jackup drilling rigs  
for ADNOC Drilling out of  
a series of nine, as well as 
handover of the second rig  
“Shelf Drilling Krathong” to  
Shelf Drilling. We also completed 
the UZ750 module project and 
the Kaombo project for HMC.  
As we brought those projects  
to a successful completion, we 
turned our attention to the new 
Master Marine and East Anglia 
One projects. 
Overview
Project completions early on in the year 
and the slow pace of new contract 
awards brought yard activities to a 
relatively low level in 1H 2017. However , 
once fabrication work commenced on 
the East Anglia One project, as well 
as our major upgrade for the “Haven” 
mobile operating unit on behalf of Master 
Marine, yard activity quickly picked up. 
We had over 2,000 new employees join 
us throughout 2017, and our Lamprell 
Assessment and Training Centre was 
kept busy with ongoing induction, safety 
and other training throughout the second 
half of the year . While the upgrade of 
the “Haven” unit proceeded as planned, 
we experienced a steep learning curve 
on the East Anglia One project which 
was our first foray into the wind farm 
foundation market 18.
“2017 saw the completion of our largest 
and longest-running project so far with 
delivery of the final two jackup rigs for 
ADNOC Drilling. Bringing the eight-year 
project for construction of nine rigs in 
total to a successful conclusion was a 
memorable milestone for the team. Our 
project management teams are dedicated 
to delivering Lamprell’s projects safely , 
within budget and on schedule.”

Project Manager Strategic report
Operational review
26 Safety first
Lamprell considers the safety of its 
employees as its top priority . In early 
2017, a large number of our employees 
had been contracted to work at a client’s 
worksite but, following a deterioration in 
various safety processes at the site, we 
responded proactively to address these 
concerns and protect our workforce. We 
attempted to collaborate with the client 
to improve safety standards, but once 
it became clear that this would not be 
possible, we decided to terminate the 
relationship with the client and withdraw 
our employees from the site. The health 
and well-being of our employees is 
of paramount importance, even when 
working on remote locations. At Lamprell 
yards we saw a significant ramp-up in 
our manpower as we staffed up to work 
on the East Anglia One and Master 
Marine projects and, as part of that, we 
implemented a number of campaigns 
to educate and train the new employees 
up to the rigorous safety standards that 
Lamprell expects and maintains. This 
proved to be highly successful and, 
while our rolling TRIR increased early 
in 2017 due to the remote site issues, 
the exemplary performance in our own 
yards ensured that our safety track record 
returned to historical strong performance 
levels as we ended the year with a TRIR 
of 0.30 30. 
Transformational joint venture
After lengthy discussions, the Group 
signed a joint venture agreement with 
Saudi Aramco, Bahri and HHI to establish 
and operate a maritime yard in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through a joint 
venture company 11. Lamprell will 
be the technical partner in two zones, 
focusing on construction of offshore 
jackup rigs as well as MRO services 
for rigs and commercial vessels. The 
construction process at the site is under 
way with dredging and associated 
activities in progress. A full briefing  
on this project can be found on pages  
10 to 15. 
Amicable settlement
In August 2017, we reached an amicable 
settlement with Cameron, a subsidiary of 
Schlumberger , in respect of the issues 
associated with their jacking equipment 
supplied in 2016. We are pleased to 
have successfully resolved the issues 
and to preserve a healthy relationship 
with Schlumberger , who commissioned 
Lamprell to fabricate two land rigs in 
accordance with the client’s proprietary 
rig design. We completed the rigs and 
this further strengthened Lamprell’s 
credentials in the land rig sector .
New proprietary rig design 
In November 2017, Lamprell and 
technology partner GustoMSC unveiled 
the “LJ43”, an advanced jackup rig 
design, at the Abu Dhabi International 
Petroleum Exhibition and Conference. 
Lamprell’s new proprietary rig design, 
LJ43, developed in collaboration with 
GustoMSC, has been selected as 
the base design for the 20 rigs to be 
constructed at the IMI yard in Saudi 
Arabia 12. Our investment in a new 
rig design helps to underpin Lamprell’s 
future in the new build rig market for the 
foreseeable future.
Renewables market 
East Anglia One is Lamprell’s first major 
renewable foundations contract, and we 
are disappointed that our performance 
on this project in 2017 was below 
historical levels, given our delivery of five 
major projects in early 2017. The poor 
performance originated at bidding stage 
when we underestimated the complexities 
of the work scope and planning 
requirements as this represented a new 
sector for us. During the early stages 
of project execution, our initial project 
management team was slow to address 
key issues such as change management, 
management of the supply chain and 
recruitment of specialist welders which 
compounded the difficulties.
As a result, we have faced a steep 
learning curve incurring significant 
additional costs and experiencing 
inefficiencies as we worked to deliver the 
project as per our client requirements. 
We are very disappointed with our 
execution on this project, however , we 
have already implemented many steps 
to improve performance. These include 
considerable investment in resources 
and new talent with specialist sector 
experience, improved and transparent 
manpower forecasting, greater scrutiny

Daniel O’Doherty
Deputy Project Manager Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
27 Lamprell has fabricated and successfully 
delivered a total of 22 new build jackup 
drilling units to the oil & gas market.
The land rigs “501” and “502” which were 
awarded to Lamprell by Schlumberger 
in 2017 are complete after being fully 
assembled in Lamprell’s Hamriyah yard. 
The client is deploying them for operation 
in the region and we are looking to foster 
this collaborative partnership into a long-
term relationship.
The Master Marine project progressed well 
throughout the year , and all construction 
work in our UAE yards was completed 
successfully . There were significant 
safety milestones including the 2.4 million 
manhours reached by the close of 2017 
without any DAFWCs. The Lamprell project 
team mobilised to Norway where they will 
carry out final installation work during the 
first half of 2018.
While 1H was relatively quiet in rig 
refurbishment projects, the second half 
of 2017 saw a significant increase in 
bids and projects with clients coming 
back to Lamprell due to our proven track 
record of quality , completing projects on 
a compressed timetable and because of 
our first class quayside facilities that allow 
us to conveniently stack rigs.
By the close of 2017, our rig 
refurbishment business completed a total 
of 13 projects and our stacking facility 
housed approximately 14 rigs for various 
lengths of time throughout the year .  
close to our historical norms, but we have 
also learned the hard way how to be 
competitive in the future in this sector .
We have recognised the importance of 
meeting our client’s expectations in terms 
of schedule and quality , and we have 
embedded the many lessons learned 
to create a production line mentality 
for the construction and delivery of 
the 60 foundations. Completion of this 
renewables project is one of our primary 
focus areas for 2018 to demonstrate our 
capabilities in this market. With these 
performance improvement measures in 
place, we can compete effectively and 
profitably in similar future projects in what 
is a strategic, growing market.
With regard to rigs destined for the 
renewables market, Lamprell will bid  
for WTIVs on a selective basis, similar 
to those that we have constructed in the 
past. There are limited numbers included 
in our bid pipeline 04 but this is also  
a potentially attractive market given  
the likely expansion of the renewables 
market 05.

February and April 2017 saw the delivery 
of new build jackup drilling rigs “ Al 
Hudairiyat” and “ Al Lulu” respectively to 
ADNOC Drilling. Also in April, Lamprell 
successfully delivered the rig “Shelf 
Drilling Krathong” which was deployed 
alongside its previously constructed sister 
rig operating offshore Thailand. To date,

In 1H 2017 Lamprell delivered the  
final modules for the UZ750 Abu Dhabi-
based project to Petrofac, bringing the 
total number of module deliveries to 
45. The project team celebrated the 
achievement of over 6.5 million manhours 
DAFWC free during the final celebration 
and awards ceremony held in Lamprell’s 
Jebel Ali facility .
The E&C business unit successfully 
delivered the final buoyancy tanks for the 
HMC Kaombo project located in Angola 
in 1H 2017. They also delivered numerous 
pressure vessels and provided fabrication 
and maintenance services to various 
clients throughout 2017.   
 
Contracting services
Throughout the year the O&M business  
unit continued to provide skilled labourers 
and supervisors to various clients spread 
across the UAE. They also played a 
crucial role in assisting with initial ramp-
up requirements for tradesmen and 
particularly specialist welders on the East 
Anglia One and Master Marine projects.
Sunbelt Safety Services did better than 
anticipated in 2017 winning nine new 
contracts after a slow start to the year . 
Project locations were spread across the 
Middle East in KSA, the UAE and Qatar .

“Paying attention to detail is how we will 
move towards improving our safety record 
and being recognised as a leader in 
HSES. We use vital tools such as toolbox 
talks, Take 5, SOAP and risk assessments 
to prepare for our projects and execute 
our work. We then audit to ensure

Phil Baron 
HSES Manager Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
29 Maintaining the highest 
standards of safety remains a 
core value for Lamprell but we 
go further and aim to link safe 
activities with supplying high-
quality products on time and 
budget. Our approach follows 
the belief that exceptional safety 
management contributes to good 
business performance, giving 
a higher probability of better 
returns for all of our stakeholders.
Robust sustainability structure 
2017 included numerous audits  
across HSES and Quality , client visits 
and staff training which were all very 
successful. In terms of environment, 
our ongoing commitment to reduce 
our carbon footprint improved further 
reducing our waste to landfill percentage 
from previous years. We delivered against 
our HSES activity targets and maintained 
our key certifications.
We took particular interest in the 
occupational health of our employees 
and continued this approach with 
various health-related campaigns and 
the reinforcement of our successful heat 
stress campaign which is key to ensuring 
the safety of our employees during the hot 
summer months in the UAE.
“ At Lamprell, we have the systems needed 
to create sustainable improvement in our 
safety and environmental performance, 
and to compete on a global stage by 
measuring our progress against agreed 
targets. Safety has strategic relevance 
for Lamprell because safe operations are 
efficient operations and our performance 
forms an important differentiator during  
the bidding and evaluation process  
by our clients.”

30 Q How much of an impact and 
influence does the management 
team have in leading HSES within 
Lamprell? 
Iain Walker  The management team 
10 has a significant impact on and 
desire to be part of developing an 
embedded safety culture. At Lamprell, we 
believe safety is not owned by the HSES 
department, but rather by our employees, 
the leadership, managers and supervision 
teams. HSES is a support function role 
which effectively helps identify trends and 
areas of improvement, then provides the 
tools, guidance and assistance to the 
management and supervisory personnel 
to roll out and implement. We all want 
our employees to go home injury-free at 
the end of each shift. Our management 
plays an active role every day and each 
manager regularly does site inspections 
across all Lamprell’s facilities and staff 
accommodation. Examples of key 
activities they led in 2017 include: 
• Weekly worksite walkabout inspections;
• Attendance at HSES inductions to 
welcome new employees, communicate 
their expectations and support the 
“Stop Work Authority” programme; 
• Hosting of regular HSES Town Halls to 
communicate HSES performance; and
• Contributing to the observation and 
intervention card system.
Rising 1H 2017 TRIR figures 
seen in the graph above were 
heavily influenced by incidents 
occurring on external project 
sites not controlled by Lamprell. 
Following crucial decisions 
by our leadership team, 
our performance improved 
significantly in 2H 2017 resulting 
in a year-end figure consistent 
with historic trends.
Q What was the most significant 
HSES challenge in 2017?
Iain Walker  Although we marginally 
failed to meet the annual TRIR target, we 
turned our HSES performance around in 
2H 2017 to bring us back within range. 
The 0.30 outcome by year-end was a 
remarkable recovery . The turning point 
in the year came with a pivotal decision 
to withdraw Lamprell personnel from 
a remote site which was not under our 
supervision. This was the main contributor 
of recordable incidents in 1H 2017 and 
almost single-handedly drove the TRIR 
trend upwards. This move demonstrated 
that Lamprell management will not put 
commercial considerations before the 
safety of its workforce. In addition, we 
implemented a self-imposed HSES 
improvement plan called “Back to 
Basics”. The aim was to refocus on what 
we do to manage risk and behaviours to 
a detailed level. After the first month of 
implementation the improvement began, 
and by December there had been a five-
month sustained improvement despite a 
steady month on month increase in new 
personnel, manhours and activity . The 
ongoing challenge will be to take the 
momentum and positive changes forward 
and continue improving our performance 
into 2018. We have kicked this off with our 
‘Safe Start 2018’ initiative.

31 Q How do you make Lamprell an 
attractive place to work?
John Macdonald  For the last five years 
we have continually placed emphasis 
on employee work-life balance. We 
coordinated an annual calendar of 
employee sports and social events, 
including football, cricket, rugby, bowling 
and badminton tournaments, as well 
as talent shows and quizzes. 2017 
concluded with over 1,000 employees as 
well as senior management participating 
in and watching the annual sports day 
at our Jebel Ali yard. These events bring 
together our multi-cultural workforce of 
over 40 nationalities, and we believe that 
they have a positive impact on employee 
engagement and loyalty towards the 
Group as evidenced by our low employee 
attrition rates, long service culture and 
nationally recognised employee welfare 
awards received between 2014-2016 at 
the Daman Corporate Health event. 
Q What differentiates Lamprell 
from other employers in the 
Middle East?
John Macdonald  Initiatives that we 
believe differentiate us from many other 
employers within our regional industry 
sector are our yard staff accommodation 
and daily transportation facilities, the 
quality of our medical and life insurance 
provisions which are significantly ahead 
of the minimum requirements, and the 
channels of communication that we 
maintain for our workforce to interact with 
management. Examples of this include 
Q What are the key focus areas to 
take forward into 2018?
Iain Walker  Observation and 
intervention, if done correctly, is an 
effective and efficient way to identify 
unsafe acts or conditions and correct 
them at an early stage to prevent potential 
accidents. We will continue to empower 
the workforce to use their “Stop Work 
Authority” where there are legitimate 
safety concerns. There were many 
improvements in HSES performance in 
2017 compared to prior years, however 
high-level focus will be on the reduction 
of all incidents as they affect the 
organisation in various ways whether it 
be reputational, monetary or in human 
safety terms. Hand and finger injuries 
were the most common and accounted 
for approximately 38% of all injuries (see 
graph on 32). We plan to extend our 
campaigns on this topic in 2018 through 
a refreshed approach. Additionally, the 
most frequent root cause of incidents 
was “lack of care and attention”. The data 
collected from our incident investigations 
showed that the majority were not caused 
by HSES management system failures, 
but rather were behaviour-related. 
They are therefore avoidable but this 
requires further training and education 
for our workforce. With that in mind, 
improvements in behaviours, procedural 
compliance, hazard and situational 
awareness will be high focus areas. Asset 
damage incidents decreased from 2016, 
and we will focus on further reducing  
this with a goal of eliminating these  
types of incidents. 
our employee welfare committees for 
our yard workforce, our “Bright Ideas” 
suggestion scheme, the twice-yearly CEO 
Town Hall meetings, the frequency of our 
yard staff and supervision toolbox talks 
and our whistle-blowing hotline which 
enables employees to raise concerns or 
issues confidentially and securely . 
Q What was Lamprell’s employee 
attrition rate in 2017?
John Macdonald  Voluntary attrition 
remains at around 5% for our admin 
workforce for the second year running 
and, in 2017, was down to 5.15% 
amongst our yard workforce compared 
to 8.04% in 2016. Our employee loyalty is 
evidenced by the fact that 28% of admin 
employees and 34% of yard employees 
have more than ten years’ service. This 
is formally recognised through our Long 
Service Award programme.
“At Lamprell, as a senior management 
team, we aim to ensure that employees 
have sufficient channels of communication 
available to contribute ideas, ask questions 
or raise issues and concerns. Employees 
must feel comfortable interacting with 
senior management on any topic, and 
we place a high priority on management 
visibility and accessibility .”
John Macdonald
Vice President HR & Admin
“We believe that employee work-life 
balance is key to ensuring our workforce 
deliver our projects safely . In addition 
to our full calendar of sports and 
entertainment events, we regularly have 
medical professionals come and speak to 
our staff about health and well-being. We 
believe in promoting a healthy lifestyle and 
appreciate the full support we receive from 
our senior management team in carrying 
out these activities.”

Highlights 
Successfully recertified by third party 
certification body to OHSAS 18001 
standards with zero non-conformances
Strong safety performance achieved 
across all Lamprell managed sites  
despite increased levels of activity  
and potential risks
We successfully retained the leading 
international safety management system 
standard, OHSAS 18001, with no 
non-conformances. Such certifications 
indicate our systems are being 
implemented, monitored and managed 
properly . The award is based on the ability 
to comply with the clauses within the 
standard through auditing and interviews 
with key personnel within the organisation. 
The requirement to show evidence of the 
system in action is key to verifying we do 
what we say we do.
The third party certifying authority 
auditors were highly complimentary 
on how Lamprell’s systems were being 
managed and maintained in all areas. 
They further support our commitment 
to manage our approach to safety in a 
conscientious manner as a responsible 
employer and contractor .
In 2017 the Group reduced the number of 
recordable injuries by 23% in comparison 
to 2016. This is significant as it reflects 
a reduction in the number of personnel 
hurt who required treatment more than 
minor first aid. Incidents classified as high 
potential (Level 3) were reduced by 46%. 
The Jebel Ali site managed to complete 
one year without a single recordable injury 
which was a remarkable achievement. 
Our inability to reach and improve on 
our TRIR target in 2017 was primarily 
due to a 46% increase in incidents at 
remote sites where the activities operated 
under the supervision and systems 
of the client. We have reviewed our 
current approach to recording hours and 
incidents in contracts where we do not 
have management control or influence, 
and a new approach will be adopted in 
2018 which brings the organisation more 
in line with current industry practices. 
However , we will also continue our focus 
and training on employees assigned 
offsite where Lamprell is not providing 
the supervision, empowering them 
to intervene when they consider an 
operation to be unsafe.
Lamprell’s ultimate goal is to reach zero 
injuries in the workplace. In pursuit of this, 
our sites across Hamriyah, Jebel Ali and 
Sharjah have all achieved the following 
significant milestones showing total 
manhours expended without a DAFWC:
Jebel Ali  17,200,000hrs
Sharjah  16,600,000hrs
Hamriyah  7,300,000hrs
Note: Each clock represents 1 million manhours worked.

certification
Competitiveness and customer focus
As part of Lamprell’s business strategy 
to develop its EPC(I) capabilities and 
maximise competitiveness, the overall  
QA/QC functional leadership team has 
been strengthened. The significant 
changes included a transfer of welding 
engineering from the production 
department to the QA/QC function and 
the development of in-house non-
destructive testing capability . In May 
2017, our Hamriyah facility attained ASME 
approval, which certifies Lamprell’s 
ability to manufacture, repair and modify 
products according to the American 
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) 
‘U’, ‘U2’, ‘S’ and National Board ‘R’ and 
‘NB’ standards. The ASME accolade 
is highly regarded as the hallmark of 
acceptance and certification. As part of 
Lamprell’s strategy to target the European 
market, we are working towards additional 
certifications such as ISO 3834 and  
EN 1090 (CE Marking). This certification 
process was kick-started in 2017 with the 
aim to be certified in 1H 2018. Lamprell 
also successfully completed a number of 
audit assessments as part of our ongoing 
business development efforts. These 
audits support the Group’s participation in 
bidding activities with prospective clients. 
Incidents breakdown  
by body part throughout 20171
Out of all the body-related injuries, hand and fingers were the most 
common followed by body (core) and ankle. Injuries occurred from a 
number of different causes resulting in slip, trips and falls, burns and 
entrapment between pinch points.

Greenhouse gas emissions  
In 2017, Lamprell was once again successful 
in decreasing gross CO₂e emissions. This was 
achieved through a combination of investment  
in cleaner energy options and efficient use  
of resources.  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
33 Environment
Highlights 
36% reduction in annual gross CO₂e 
emissions from Company operations

Certification to latest ISO:14001 2015 
EMS standard
Maintained C Carbon Disclosure Score
In 2017, Lamprell was successful in 
improving its environmental performance 
across a range of sustainability metrics. 
These improvements include an increase 
in waste recycling from 85% to 90% 
diversion from landfill and a decrease 
in gross CO₂e emissions for the third 
year running, with emissions decreasing 
by approximately 36% in 2017 from the 
previous year’s 14% decrease.
Lamprell also completed the transition 
to the new ISO 14001:2015 certification 
standard for Environmental Management 
Systems. The certification to this latest 
international standard highlights the 
best-practice approach to environmental 
protection taken by the Group. 
In 2017, we launched the inaugural 
UAE Clean Coastline Initiative, in which 
volunteers from Lamprell partnered with 
a government agency to clear a beach of 
assorted waste. This successful initiative 
resulted in the removal of 300 kilograms 
of waste, thereby reducing a serious risk 
to both bird and marine life. 
Corporate social responsibility
Highlights 
Group continues to support local and 
global CSR initiatives
Employees sponsored to take part in CSR 
events 
During 2017, Lamprell employees 
participated, with the financial support 
of the Group, in a number of local 
community initiatives, two of which  
were global events. In May, Lamprell-
sponsored employees took part in a 
fund-raising event for the “Wings for Life” 
Foundation, a non-profit organisation that 
funds spinal cord research. The event 
took place concurrently in 58 countries 
and 111 locations worldwide. 
In November our employees participated 
in the Relay for Life 24 hour walk, the 
world’s largest fundraising event which 
is organised on behalf of the “Friends of 
Cancer Patients” group. 100% of funds 
are donated to those impacted by cancer , 
either as patients or their support network. 
Employee welfare
Highlights 
Continued focus on promoting employee 
health and wellness 
Recognition of International Women’s Day 
and Breast Cancer Awareness month 
Over 2,000 employees take up company 
subsidised flu vaccinations
Having been nationally recognised by a 
leading corporate health organisation for 
our high standards of employee wellness 
on three occasions in the last four years, 
we continued to build on our strategy of 
promoting employee wellness through a 
series of health awareness campaigns 
throughout 2017. 
In March, the Group hosted a Women’s 
Wellness Seminar to recognise 
International Women’s Day with talks 
on nutrition, diet, sleep and exercise. 
This was followed by a Breast Cancer 
Awareness seminar held in September .
Aside from a number of other health 
awareness events focusing specifically on 
posture, bone mineral density and summer 
heat awareness, the Group subsidised flu 
vaccinations and made them available to 
the whole workforce resulting in take-up of 
over 2,000 participants.
Once again the Group maintained its 
highly regarded and successful heat 
stress awareness campaign during the 
hot summer months of June to September . 
This provides an early warning and 
"Stop Work Authority"  system when 
temperatures and humidity rise above 
certain tolerance levels and also mandates 
all of our yard workforce to carry adequate 
supplies of drinking water at all times.

Principal risks and uncertainties
34
A robust risk management framework  
We continue to have a single depository 
for all major risks that the Lamprell Group 
faces – our Enterprise Risk Management 
(“ERM”) system. A robust assessment 
of all major risks is undertaken by senior 
management and the Audit and Risk 
Committee twice a year , as a minimum. 
The process reported in previous years 
has been retained whereby all risks 
are ranked taking into account both a 
probability and an impact assessment, 
and on a gross (pre-mitigation) and net 
(post-mitigation) basis. Regular review 
and updates to our risk management 
procedures improve our ability to identify 
risks promptly and help ensure that we 
maintain our processes in line with best 
industry practices. 
The poor performance on the East 
Anglia One project 26 highlighted a 
number of weaknesses in our processes 
notably around bidding and estimation, 
in change management procedures and 
in welding engineering. The Group has 
also been taking steps to address the 
issues that were identified in the 2016 
rig projects, specifically around supply 
chain management. We have taken 
steps to embed these lessons learned 
into our processes and enhance our risk 
management systems to ensure that 
we are able to bid competitively and 
effectively on future workscopes.
The register provides an efficient 
analytical tool to assess the position of 
our business risks at any given time, with 
identified risks being evaluated to develop 
adequate mitigation plans. In addition, 
the register provides a valuable audit trail 
of our management of risks through their 
lifecycles. 
Internal communication of business risks 
is essential for the effectiveness of our 
risk management process. Individuals 
within the business who are best placed 
to manage identified risks work with 
project managers, senior management 
and our Board of Directors to ensure that 
there is a full understanding of recorded 
risks. In addition, such communication 
ensures that the approach to appropriate 
mitigation strategies amongst stakeholders 
is aligned.
We believe that our approach to  
risk management provides a clear 
framework that allows for decisions  
to be made on an informed basis.  
Internal participation in the process 
improves stakeholder relations and 
ensures effective collaboration in order  
to protect Lamprell’s business interests.
Principal risks and uncertainties  
for Lamprell 
Lamprell faces a variety of risks, and 
these may change annually depending on 
internal and external factors. Our profiling 
of project risks confirms that, like 2016, 
the strategic category had the highest 
number of key risks for this reporting 
period. We believe that this is due to 
the anticipated upturn in the energy 
sector being slower than initial market 
predictions. This has had a significant 
impact on Lamprell’s ability to win new 
work 04.
Lamprell’s risk management processes have been developed to 
ensure that clear alignment exists between the strategic objectives of 
the Group and its everyday business decisions in order to ensure risks 
are highlighted prior to making judgements.

Economic conditions  
Levels of expenditure by oil & gas 
companies and those involved in 
renewable energy directly affect 
demand for the Group’s products 
and services. The oil & gas and 
renewables sectors remain unstable, 
and such instability could contribute 
to more cautious spending habits. 
• We aim to ensure that Lamprell has a diversified 
portfolio to cover multiple market sectors.
• We actively work to maintain and develop a 
robust bid pipeline.
• Utilisation of our Client Relationship 
Management system ensures that we retain 
regular contact with our client. 
• Active investigation of potential partnerships/
alliances to aid diversification of products, 
services and territories.
• Focus on leveraging in our key locations in 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE where capital 
expenditure remains in a growth mode.
Mergers and acquisition  
With the prolonged downturn, 
low levels of backlog and current 
operational challenges, the Group 
could see an opportunistic approach 
for purchase at a suppressed price.
• The Group has a clear long-term growth 
strategy with plans to achieve strategic 
objectives. 
• Lamprell’s majority shareholder can act as a 
negative veto to hostile approaches based on 
unreasonably low valuations.  
• We have appointed a professional advisory and 
broking team who provide advice to the Board 
of Directors and senior management. 
• We actively maintain a robust bid pipeline with 
high bidding activity . 
Ability to win new work 
The Group is dependent on a 
relatively small number of contracts 
at any given time, some of which are 
for the same customers, and strong 
client relationships are critical for a 
sustainable business. In addition, 
Lamprell’s ability to retain current 
clients and compete successfully 
in the market depends on its ability 
to provide on time, low cost, high-
quality products and services. If 
the Group fails to be competitive 
(technically and commercially), it will 
not win new project awards.
• A highly customer focused business development 
team targets strategic and growth markets. 
• Leverage on our quality and safety performances.
• We work to ensure that benchmarking and 
estimating tools are current to provide 
competitive pricing. 
• Continual improvement of the skillsets of our 
personnel through dedicated training initiatives 
and project reviews. 
• Dedicated internal initiatives have been 
implemented to improve cost control, 
productivity and overall efficiency .
• Implementation of thorough QA/QC procedures 
ensures that adequate quality is maintained 
throughout all projects. 
Third party alliances 
 
To conduct business in certain 
jurisdictions, the Group places 
reliance on key relationships with 
local partners, agents and the 
members of joint ventures and 
consortia that Lamprell forms part 
of. Ineffective management of these 
relationships could leave Lamprell 
exposed to additional contractual 
and/or execution liability or render 
the Group’s operations in certain 
jurisdictions uncompetitive.    
• All agreements have a clear strategic goal and 
are documented through a formal contractual 
process. 
• Advice is obtained from external experts where 
necessary . 
• We work to retain strong partner relations at 
senior management level.
• Board has oversight of all proposed and current 
joint venture/consortium initiatives and is given 
appropriate opportunity to review and challenge 
proposals.

Financial risks

Ability to fund business 
The Group’s continuing operations 
and future growth, including strategic 
investments, may be dependent on 
the ability to fund the business, either 
through its balance sheet or through 
the availability of funding. As the 
Group’s assets and particularly cash 
decline, or if the Company cannot 
raise debt or equity funding, a lack 
of funds could threaten the long-term 
viability of the business. 
• Balance sheet is strong and includes significant 
net cash as at 31 December 2017.
• Debt facility in place until mid-2019.
• Good relations and regular dialog with  
banking syndicate.
• Debt to equity ratio in the business is low  
at 8.6%.
• Effective cash management processes in place

Legal risks
Risk description Business implication Mitigation
Contractual commitments  
The continuing market downturn 
has led to clients adopting a firm 
line on contractual terms, meaning 
that acceptance of certain risks 
cannot be negotiated. As part of 
contractual arrangements, Lamprell 
may, therefore, be subject to some 
onerous terms which could impact 
revenue or earnings as a result of 
breach or non-performance. This 
may include liability for product 
defects, faulty workmanship or  
errors in design.
• A thorough risk analysis of contract terms and 
conditions is implemented, with development 
of appropriate mitigation strategies where 
possible.
• Upskilling and employee training programmes 
to improve project execution.
• Implementation of the “lessons learned” on 
previous projects aims to avoid repeats of any 
identified inefficiencies.
• Effective project risk processes are developed 
and actively implemented across all projects.

Risk description Business implication Mitigation
Geopolitical    
The Group is subject to the legal, 
economic and political conditions 
of operating in emerging markets, 
in which regulatory or contractual 
enforcement may be difficult, and 
such emerging markets may be 
prone to corruption issues. Also, with 
the Group’s increasing exposure to 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia due to 
its IMI investment and ongoing LTA 
bid 09, the Group is dependent 
on a stable political and business 
environment in that country .
• Regular input from advisers for any key changes 
in regulatory or contractual regimes.
• Strong partner relationships developed and 
maintained, including with our partners at the 
IMI yard.
• Phased investment into IMI yard over a number 
of years.
• HSESQ monitors and advises on security and 
political risks.
• Major operations take place in the UAE, which 
is considered to be politically and financially 
stable.
Project execution   
As the Group diversifies into new 
markets and product offerings, it 
faces additional risks surrounding 
project execution including bid 
estimation, scheduling, supply 
chain management including 
optimal use of vessels, training 
of specialist workers and delivery 
planning. Failure to execute, project-
manage and deliver a project in 
accordance with contractual terms 
and conditions may expose the 
Group to additional costs, damage 
to reputation, losses or reduced 
revenues.  
• Improved bidding and estimation procedures to 
account for all relevant costs and remove silos 
between departments.
• Implementation of the “lessons learned” on 
previous projects aims to avoid repeats of any 
identified inefficiencies.
• Transparent project risk management processes 
and “gap identification and analysis” exercises 
ensure awareness of contemplated issues. 
• Upskilling of existing workforce and additional, 
experienced resources hired.
• Development of strong relationships with 
clients allows a better understanding of their 
requirements.

37 1) Assessment of prospects
Lamprell’s strategy and business model 
are central to an understanding of its 
prospects 6. Lamprell has been 
operating for more than 40 years and its 
business model has proven to be resilient 
and able to withstand the industry’s 
project cycles. Our strategy focuses 
heavily around safety, quality , close 
client relationships and value for money . 
Further , as is the norm in our industry, 
cost control and providing a competitive 
product are also critical to the long-term 
viability of the business model. Decisions 
relating to major new projects are made 
by reference to a review of the key risks 
and are subject to an escalating system 
of approvals.
The Company’s current top priority  
is to develop its presence in the Saudi 
market 10, due to the substantial 
opportunities noted in that market. The 
Board has considered the changes 
in the risk profile that this entails and 
determined that they are acceptable as 
part of the expansion into new markets 
and entry into new geographies.
The Group’s prospects are assessed 
primarily through its strategic review 
process. This includes an annual review 
of the strategy and budget, led by the 
CEO and Executive Committee. The Board 
participates through a dedicated strategy 
review each year as well as assessment 
of progress against the agreed strategic 
objectives during regular meetings. These 
objectives 8-9, are a key output from 
the strategy review process. The Board’s 
assessment considers the Group’s cash 
flows, available debt, capital recycling 
levels and other financial ratios over  
the period. These metrics are subject  
to sensitivity analysis which involves 
flexing the main assumptions underlying 
the forecasts. 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the Code and taking into account 
the Group’s principal risks 34, the 
Board determines the prospects of the 
Company over a longer period than the  
12 months required by the ‘Going 
Concern’ statement 72. The Board 
considers that an assessment period of 
three years is appropriate for the following 
reasons: (i) the strategic review covers a 
period with visibility on likely prospects for 
the coming three or more years; (ii) most 
major projects undertaken by the Group 
last for a period of approximately two 
years; (iii) the long-term incentive awards 
for management are structured around  
a three-year performance period; and  
(iv) the Company has a reasonable ability 
to evaluate its likely backlog for a period 
of two to three years. 
The key assumptions in the financial 
forecasts, reflecting the overall strategy, 
include:
• The global outlook for the energy 
industry remains weak in 2018 and 
becomes positive in the medium to  
long term, driven by growth within 
emerging markets and demand from 
developed markets; 
• Actions taken over the past two years 
to reduce the Group’s cost base enable 
the business to remain competitive 
in the face of the ongoing weak 
commodity prices;
• The lessons learned and implemented 
following the significant losses on the 
East Anglia One project allow us to 
maintain high standards of safety and 
execution in the delivery of projects; and
• A debt refinancing package will  
be available on reasonable terms  
after expiry of the current terms in 
August 2019.
These key assumptions are reflected in 
the Group’s principal risks 34. The 
purpose of the risks report is primarily 
to summarise those matters that could 
prevent Lamprell from delivering on its 
strategy or could threaten its ability to 
continue in business in its current form 
(considered further below).
2) Assessment of viability
Although the strategy reflects the 
Directors’ best estimate of the Group’s 
prospects, the Board has also examined 
several scenarios which represent severe 
but possible adverse circumstances 
potentially faced by the Group including:
• Continued depression of energy prices, 
increasing pressure on customer 
spending and impacting prospects for 
future awards;
• Project delivery failure resulting 
in delayed payments, settlement 
payments, reputational damage and 
reduced future work; and
• Risk of cost overruns on lump  
sum contracts.
The results of this stress testing showed 
that, due to the core strength of the 
Company’s balance sheet and business 
model, and taking into account actions 
taken by management and the Board 
to mitigate the stress events, the Group 
would be able to withstand the impact of 
these scenarios over the viability period. 
VIABILITY  
STATEMENT
Based on the results of the analysis below, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue  
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
period of their assessment ending on 31 December 2020. 38

Corporate governance
Directors’ Report  
Letter from the Chairman
As detailed in the Strategic Report 08, last year was a period of 
significant change for the Group and the Board has demonstrated a 
critical leadership and governance role as the Company responded to 
major issues, both from a corporate and an operational perspective.
Dear Shareholders, 
Lamprell saw key changes in 2017 
including my appointment to the role of 
Chairman. I took over last September 
at a time when the Company faced 
significant challenges driven initially 
by the prolonged market downturn but 
compounded by our own business issues. 
The Board has an important leadership 
role to play in overcoming the current 
challenges and overseeing this longer-
term transformation.
Investment in people
People are the foundation of our business. 
It is therefore critical that every one of us 
applies high standards of governance 
to assure effective implementation of our 
strategy to the benefit of shareholders. 
We have invested in the upskilling of our 
workforce; we added new resources in 
support of our strategic objectives in 
the EPC(I) and renewables sectors; we 
are supporting management in its use 
of data-gathering and lessons learned 
processes to measure performance 
and improve results. The Board has 
also recognised the importance of 
adapting the Company’s governance 
structure to support the business and so 
changed the scope of the Remuneration 
and Development Committee 58 to 
oversee senior leadership performance 
management and development, ensuring 
that talent management is aligned with the 
Group’s strategy and business plans.
Succession planning was a Board 
priority for 2017 and this change to 
the Remuneration and Development 
Committee’s terms of reference was an 
important first step towards that. However , 
the Board has decided to retain this as 
a Board priority for 2018 because of the 
need to prepare for the market recovery 
and the Group’s move into new markets.  
At Board level, I was pleased to welcome 
Nick Garrett and James Dewar as 
Directors. Nick’s knowledge of growth 
strategies for companies, corporate 
transactions and access to capital will 
prove invaluable as Lamprell looks to 
implement its growth strategy in the 
coming years. James has worked for 
many years in senior roles in the global 
energy industry . We are already making 
considerable use of his business and 
finance experience as he has taken 
over Ellis Armstrong’s role as the chair 
of the Audit and Risk Committee, as 
Ellis has decided to transition out of the 
Company in 2018. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank Ellis for his 
contribution over the last five years.
Implementing our strategy
Christopher McDonald was brought in as 
CEO to develop our strategy and expand 
the Lamprell franchise into new markets. 
As a result, the Directors have spent 
considerable time during 2017 reviewing 
Lamprell’s strategy and this was a regular 
agenda item at Board meetings, plus the 
Board held its annual two-day strategy 
review during its July meeting.  
The Goup is aiming to diversify away from 
its historic reliance on jackup rigs and 
instead is focussing on strategic moves 
into EPC(I) projects, the renewables 
sector and accessing the Saudi Arabian 
market 08. 2017 has seen the Group 
make progress on all three although 
notably our first project in the renewables 
market – the East Anglia One wind 
farm foundation project – has come 
at a significant cost as there was a far 
steeper learning curve than anticipated, 
resulting in a USD 80 million loss. This is a 
disappointing result for shareholders and 
it is imperative that the Group learns the 
lessons to generate profitable returns on 
future projects in this alternative market.  
On the positive side, the Group made 
a major entry into the Saudi Arabian 
market with the conclusion of the 
joint venture agreement with partners 
including Saudi Aramco 11. This 
project is expected to be transformational 
for Lamprell and the Board noted the 
shareholders’ emphatic support of 
the decision with a nearly unanimous 
vote in favour at the extraordinary 
general meeting in June last year .
Governance structure
In 2015, the Board adopted a formal 
gender policy for the first time. Last 
year , the Directors considered that it 
was important to update and extend the 
policy in order to improve gender diversity 
levels among the workforce where female 
representation has been stagnant. 
Accordingly , in mid-2017, the Board 
reviewed and updated the gender policy, 
details at 51.

IN CHANGING 
TIMES   Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
41 The Company is incorporated in the 
Isle of Man and has a Premium Listing 
on the Official List of the London 
Stock Exchange. The Board makes 
considerable efforts to ensure that 
during the relevant period the Company 
applies and complies with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016 as 
the pre-eminent set of global standards 
for corporate governance (the “Code”, 
available at www.frc.org.uk). Where 
the Company does not comply, this is 
explained in this Annual Report and 
Accounts, and typically in this Corporate 
Governance Report specifically .  
A company’s governance structure should 
be appropriate for the size and complexity 
of its business. The Board continues 
to evaluate its composition, size and 
performance regularly, bearing in mind 
the current challenges but also the long-
term growth strategy . As this is my first 
letter to the shareholders in my capacity 
as Chairman, I would like to thank you 
for your continued support of Lamprell 
and I hope to meet with you in 2018, to 
ask for feedback on ways to enhance our 
governance structure.

discontinued operations after income 
tax and exceptional items for the 
year amounted to USD 98.1 million 
(2016: losses of USD 184.3 million). 
The Directors do not recommend the 
payment of any dividend for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2017.

Directors’ Report
The Directors collaborate to reach collective decisions that they 
consider to be in the best interests of the Group as a whole following 
evaluation of all relevant factors. In this way, the Board works as an 
effective leadership team for the business.
The Board operates together as a team 
and is collectively responsible for the 
long-term success of the Group, aiming 
to achieve this through effective risk 
management, robust and constructive 
dialogue with the executive team and 
transparency in its decision-making. 
Given the prolonged market downturn and 
the operational challenges on the East 
Anglia One project, the Board meeting 
agendas were structured predominantly 
around the growth strategy and ways to 
deal with near-term issues. In this way, the 
Directors had adequate time to discuss 
all business-critical issues.
Board composition
The Board is comprised of the Non-
Executive Chairman, CEO, CFO, four 
independent Non-Executive Directors 
(“NEDs”) and another Non-Executive 
Director; 39 for biographical details. 
During 2017, there were a number of 
changes among the Directors. John 
Kennedy stepped down from Executive 
Chairman to Non-Executive Chairman  
on 24 April and then left the Board on  
20 September , at which point John 
Malcolm took over as Non-Executive 
Chairman. Nick Garrett was appointed 
as a Non-Executive Director on 24 March 
2017 and James Dewar was appointed as 
a Non-Executive Director on 1 November 
2017. All other Directors served as usual 
throughout 2017. The CEO and the CFO 
are the Executive Directors currently on 
the Board.
Roles and responsibilities 
The roles and duties of the Chairman and 
CEO are separate, in line with the best 
practices set out in the Code, as agreed 
by the Board. This will ensure that strong 
governance is maintained at Board level.
The Chairman is a Non-Executive Director 
and his primary responsibility is to provide  
effective leadership for the Board and the 
Group as a whole including strategy and 
direction. He chairs all Board and general 
meetings within an effective corporate 
governance framework. In addition, the 
Chairman is responsible for ensuring the 
integrity and effectiveness of the Board/
Executive relationship. 
The CEO is responsible for the day-to-
day running of the Group’s business, 
including execution of the Group’s 
strategic objectives, its business plans 
and for communicating decisions from/
recommendations to the Board. The 
CEO is also the primary conduit for 
communications with the shareholders 
and other key stakeholders.
The CFO is responsible for the financial 
stewardship, navigation and control 
activities of the Group as well as the 
investor relations activities. The role of 
all NEDs is critical to ensure an effective 
counterbalance to executive management 
on the Board. The NEDs are primarily 
responsible for challenging constructively 
all recommendations presented to the 
Board, based on their broad experience 
and individual expertise.

Nationalities on the Board
The Senior Independent Director acts as 
a sounding board and confidante to the 
Chairman and is available to shareholders 
to answer questions which cannot be 
addressed by the Chairman or CEO. 
Mr Armstrong was appointed as Senior 
Independent Director in mid-2015 and 
continues to hold this role.
Board meetings and attendance
The Directors met in person on six 
occasions during the course of 2017 and 
all meetings took place in Dubai, UAE. 
However , where required and in order 
to receive an interim update on ongoing 
matters, the Directors convened ad hoc 
at short notice by way of conference 
call with attendance outside of the UK. 
Meetings in person generally take place 
over the course of two days and will 
ordinarily include meetings of both the 
Board and the Committees.
Directors are expected to attend all 
scheduled Board and relevant Committee 
meetings, unless they are prevented from 
doing so by unavoidable prior business 
commitments or other valid reasons. All 
Directors are provided with full papers 
in advance of each meeting. Where a 
Director is unable to attend a meeting,  
he/she is encouraged to discuss any 
issues arising with the Chairman or  
CEO as appropriate. 
The Company Secretary is responsible 
to the Board and provides the Board 
and each of the Directors with advice 
and assistance on governance matters. 
He ensures that all Board materials and 
other information are delivered in a timely 
fashion, typically five to seven days before 
scheduled Board meetings through a 
secure, online software system.
As well as the Directors and the Company 
Secretary, it is common for members of 
the Executive Committee to attend parts 
of the Board meetings and to deliver 
presentations on operational or business 
topics in greater detail. In this way, the 
Board gains an in-depth understanding 
of business-critical functions and the 
presenting managers are able to interact 
with the Directors and gain experience 
for their own personal development. From 
time to time, the Board may also invite 
guest external presenters on key subject 
matters.
How the Board operates
There is a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to the Board and the Board 
retains discretion to approve decisions 
on key subject matters such as the 
Group’s strategy, annual budget and 
financial statements. The Board also 
reviews other relevant matters including 
standing agenda items and key topics 
for discussion at that relevant time of 
year or as a result of current business 
requirements. In all cases, the agenda 
focuses on topics in pursuit of the 
Company’s strategic objectives  
08 underpinned by our core values, 
rather than administrative matters. The 
Chairman sets the agenda for each 
meeting in consultation with the CEO and 
the Company Secretary . At the meeting, 
the Executive Directors give an update 
on business, operational and financial 
matters, thereby enabling the Board to 
understand progress within the business 
but also anticipate likely forthcoming  
risks 34.  
During 2017, there were detailed 
presentations from key managers 
including the Vice Presidents of Business 
Development, Operations, Supply Chain 
Management and HR & Administration on 
matters such as strategy and in particular 
the Group’s renewables strategy, its entry 
into Saudi Arabia, operational issues 
around the East Anglia One project and 
talent development and performance 
management. In addition, from time to 
time, the Board invites external presenters 
to speak to the Directors. Experts from 
the oil & gas industry and the Company’s 
brokers (J.P . Morgan Cazenove (JPMC) 
and Investec Bank plc (Investec)) and 
lawyers presented to the Board.

Corporate governance
Directors’ Report
The Board makes decisions based on 
the reports or presentations produced, 
or on the recommendations from one of 
the principal Committees. It is therefore 
critically important that such reports 
and presentations are comprehensive 
and the requests for approval are clear . 
By way of example, the VP of Business 
Development made a detailed and high 
quality presentation to the Board in 
relation to the Company’s renewables 
strategy at the November Board meeting 
and the Board was able to give clear 
direction and feedback on implementation 
of this strategy .
Between Board meetings, management 
distributes a monthly report to the Board 
providing a summary of the financial 
performance of the Group, highlighting 
developments and key risks 34. 
Principal Board Committees
There are three principal Board Committees 
– the Audit and Risk Committee, the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
and the Remuneration and Development 
Committee – and much of the Board 
oversight of the executive management 
team is conducted by delegation through 
these Committees. It is important for the 
Directors to operate in an environment of 
trust and for delegated responsibilities 
to be effective. Certain authorities are 
delegated either to the Committees or to 
the executive management team.
An open and forthright environment is 
encouraged in meetings of the Board 
Committees. Each of the Committees 
has written terms of reference, which are 
reviewed annually and are available on 
the Company’s website.
In addition, the Company has a 
Disclosure Committee, comprising the 
CEO, CFO and Company Secretary . The 
Company is required to make timely and 
accurate disclosure of all information that 
is required to be so disclosed to meet the 
legal and regulatory requirements arising 
from its listing on the London Stock 
Exchange.
Meetings structure 
The Board is primarily responsible for the 
leadership of the Company and wider 
Group; however it is ably supported 
both by the Board Committees and the 
management team which makes use of a 
number of management level committees 
– see above for details. It is a core principle 
for all that there is an effective working 
relationship between each of the Directors,

Board size and composition There continues to be a 
strong combination of industry, regional and operational 
experience among the Directors enhanced by the diverse 
professional competences of each Board member . Following 
John Kennedy’s decision to step down from the Board, 
the Board prioritised the process to identify a suitable 
replacement as Chairman. The Board considered the options 
for identifying potential candidates and evaluated the market 
conditions, and determined that the appointment of a highly 
qualified, internal candidate in John Malcolm was in the best 
interests of the Company . The Board also aims to refresh its 
membership on a regular and phased basis in order to bring 
relevant experience and independence to the Board while  
at the same time ensuring continuity and stability . With this  
in mind, the Board welcomed the addition of James Dewar 
and Nick Garrett as Non-Executive Directors during 2017  
and noted that Ellis Armstrong decided not to stand for  
re-election at the 2018 AGM. 
and at the management level. Structurally 
and from a governance perspective, this 
provides a robust framework for achieving 
the Company’s strategic objectives.  
Accordingly , there are regular discussions 
outside of scheduled Board meetings, 
particularly between the Chairman and 
the CEO, as well as between the Chairman 
and the other Directors, with a view to 
reaching a mutual understanding of views 
prior to wider discussions at meetings.  
At in person Board meetings, the NEDs 
and the Non-Executive Chairman meet 
without the CEO or CFO present and 
share insights on matters of governance 
and discuss concerns regarding 
management of the business, if any . 
Independence and conflicts
In accordance with the Code, at least half 
of the Board (excluding the Chairman) 
is comprised of independent NEDs 
who are free from any business or other 
relationships that could materially interfere 
in the exercise of their independent 
judgement. The percentage proportion 
of independence on the Board is 
50% including the Chairman and 57% 
excluding the Chairman. Throughout 
2017, the percentage proportion of 
independence on the Board (excluding 
the Chairman) always exceeded 50% 
although the actual figure varied as a 
result of the changes at the Board level. 
At the date of publication, Ellis Armstrong, 
Debra Valentine, James Dewar and Mel 
Fitzgerald are all considered by the Board 
to be independent NEDs as defined by 
the Code. 
At the beginning of each year , the 
Company asks each of the independent 
NEDs to re-confirm their independence. 
The Chairman of the Board was 
considered to be independent on his 
original appointment in May 2013.
Integrity is a core value for the Group. 
Each Director recognises the importance 
of transparency in trying to avoid any 
actual or potential conflict of interest and 
will promptly declare such conflict, if one 
arises. This enables the Board to assess 
the possible impact of any conflict and 
take appropriate and timely action. The 
following procedures are in place for 
dealing with conflicts:
• Any new Director is required to provide 
information on any conflicts of interest 
by means of a questionnaire prior to 
appointment; 
• Conflicts are declared and addressed 
during Board meetings and noted in the 
minutes; and
• For conflicts arising between Board 
meetings, these are submitted to the 
Chairman for consideration, prior to 
deliberation at the next meeting.
No conflicts of interest were noted 
from the Directors in 2017, save that 
each Director was excluded from any 
discussions or decisions around his or 
her change of role in the Company and/
or remuneration. All conflict management 
procedures were adhered to and 
operated effectively .
“Every year the Board evaluates its 
composition, size and independence 
to determine whether any changes are 
required to maintain an appropriate 
balance. A key development last year 
was the return of the Chairman role to a 
non-executive capacity , in line with best 
practice governance standards, as well 
as the adoption of an updated gender 
diversity policy .”

Independent Non-Executive Director 46
Corporate governance
Directors’ Report
Appointments to the Board
There is a formal, rigorous and 
transparent process for the appointment 
of new Directors to the Board and this  
is led by the Nomination and Governance 
Committee which then makes any such 
recommendations to the full Board for 
approval. Prior to embarking on a search, 
the Committee on the advice of the  
VP HR & Administration will prepare  
a list of key criteria for any candidates, 
taking into account the Board’s 
composition, and will ordinarily appoint 
external search consultants to prepare 
candidate lists and assist with the 
recruitment/evaluation process.
Following the announcement in April 2017 
that John Kennedy was planning to step 
down from the Board in September , the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
considered the options for appointment 
of a new Chairman, and, after due 
consideration, the Nomination and 
Governance Committee recommended 
the appointment of an internal candidate, 
John Malcolm, given his knowledge of the 
Company and long industry experience.  
In addition, the Board made two further 
appointments to the Board: 
• Nick Garrett was nominated as a 
potential candidate for the role of 
a Non-Executive Director by the 
Company’s major shareholder , Lamprell 
Holdings Limited 49. While this 
nomination prevents Mr Garrett from 
being considered as ‘independent’ in 
accordance with the Code, the Board 
considered Mr Garrett’s knowledge of 
strategy, corporate transactions and 
access to capital would be a valuable 
addition to the Board. Mr Garrett was 
also part of the JPMC team that led 
the Company’s initial public offering in 
2006 and he continued to advise the 
Company until 2012.
• James Dewar joined Lamprell as 
a Non-Executive Director on the 
Board following an extensive and 
in-depth recruitment process which 
was overseen by the Nomination and 
Governance Committee and which 
made use of senior management 
recruitment specialists, Korn Ferry, 
to advise the Committee on potential 
candidates.
Training and development 
All Directors are encouraged to attend 
relevant external seminars and, on 
an ongoing basis, there is training for 
the Directors as a whole by way of 
presentations to the Board from guest 
presenters. The individual Directors 
also make efforts to remain current with 
the latest regulatory obligations for UK 
listed companies with the assistance of 
our brokers and lawyers. Similarly, any 
Director is entitled to take independent 
professional or legal advice on Company 
matters, as and when needed. Nick 
Garrett took advice in relation to his 
position as a Non-Executive Director 
that had been nominated by the major 
shareholder . John Kennedy took advice 
as part of the process for his decision 
to step down from the Board. No other 
director sought independent advice during 
the financial year .
The Audit and Risk Committee also 
benefits from regular briefings from the 
external auditors on any new accounting 
requirements as well as developments in 
the area of corporate governance.
Board performance evaluation
As the Board had made use of an 
external facilitator to assist with its 
2015 performance evaluation process, 
it continued with the internally driven, 
cost-effective evaluation process for 
2017. This process was conducted under 
the stewardship of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee. 
The evaluation included a review of the 
Board’s activities, performance and 
teamwork and made use of an online 
questionnaire (with questions asking for 
quantitative ranking and for qualitative 
feedback to the Board, principal Board 
Committees and the Directors). It also 
included feedback from each Director as 
well as specific, invited key executives 
who have had regular interaction with 
either the Board or the Board Committees. 
The final report summarised the results 
of the evaluation on an aggregated and 
confidential basis and was subsequently

Incorporating lessons

Identifying and developing 
internal candidates as 
part of succession planning
Matter(s) considered Observation(s) Board Priority(ies)
There should be a more structured 
approach to bidding with clearer 
bidding pack to the Board allowing 
informed decision to be made based on 
complete information and on review of 
individual project risks.
The challenges on the East Anglia One 
project had highlighted some gaps in the 
risk management processes which had 
to be incorporated to ensure earlier 
warning of key risks. Also, high level risk 
assessments could result in superﬁcial 
analysis which had to be addressed.
Eective succession planning would be 
critical for the business, both in terms 
of talent development and retention of 
key personnel in a market which could 
recover in the coming 12-18 months. 
The bidding on new projects (and especially major/non-core 
projects) must be conducted through more systematic and 
‘deep-dive’ processes based on all key information being 
provided to the Board by management with a focus on the risks 
and proposed mitigations.
The ERM and project risk management processes will be 
improved to take on board all lessons learned from the 
East Anglia One project. Further value would be achieved 
by spending more time on deeper dives into individual risks, 
rather than high level assessments.
The overall succession planning should operate in a way to 
identify potential internal candidates that could step into senior 
roles and develop those candidates so as to achieve their full 
potential. Remuneration packages should be structured to 
retain candidates within the Company .

Induction of new Directors  Upon joining, Mr Dewar 
was given an induction into the Group’s business and this 
included visits to the Group’s main facilities in the UAE, 
presentations from all key managers and a meeting with the 
Chairman and Company Secretary to discuss governance 
and regulatory matters, as well as Board procedural  
matters. Mr Garrett completed similar activities following  
his appointment to the Board, although his prior knowledge  
of the Group provided a solid, existing knowledge base  
of the business.
provided to the Board which then 
discussed the results in open session.  
As a result of this process, the Board has 
been able to structure its priorities for 
2018 around the results 46. The NEDs, 
led by the Senior Independent Director , 
evaluated the Chairman’s performance 
and confirmed that he was performing 
effectively . The Board considers that it 
is beneficial to take time to evaluate its 
own performance as this strengthens 
and enhances the performance and 
transparency of discussions and 
decision-making at the Board level.
General Meetings of the Company
In May 2017, the Company held its AGM 
in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and the 
Directors able to attend were present and 
stood for re-election. As John Kennedy 
had previously advised that he would be 
standing down in September 2017, he did 
not stand for re-election. We encourage 
our shareholders to attend the AGM as an 
opportunity to engage in a constructive 
dialogue with the Board members. As 
has been the norm, all resolutions were 
passed on a show of hands; however 
as a matter of good governance and 
in accordance with the changes to the 
Code, voting on resolutions 7, 9, 11 
and 13 (which related to the re-election 
of the independent Non-Executive 
Directors) was conducted by independent 
shareholders only (i.e. excluding the 
“controlling shareholders”) 49. 
The Company plans to hold its 2018 
AGM on 23 May 2018 in Dubai and full 
details will be set out in the Notice of 
Meeting which accompanies this report 
and is also available on our website. All 
Directors are planning to attend and will 
be available to answer questions from 
shareholders. Each item will be presented 
as a separate resolution. Any shareholder 
unable to attend in person but wishing to 
submit a question for consideration by the 
Directors, is invited to submit questions to 
investorrelations@lamprell.com.
Pursuant to the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the Directors are required 
to submit themselves for re-election by 
shareholders at least every three years 
and, in the case of James Dewar , at 
the first available AGM of the Company . 
However , in line with the Code and best 
practices, the Board has decided that 
all Directors will retire and stand for re-
election at the 2018 AGM.  
As also required, the Company makes 
the terms and conditions of Directors’ 
engagement available for inspection at 
the registered office of the Company 
during normal business hours and also  
at the Company’s AGM 15 minutes prior  
to the meeting and during the meeting.
In June 2017, the Company held an 
extraordinary general meeting in Dubai, 
“The Company had arranged a thorough 
and personalised induction programme 
for me when I joined which ensured that I 
could get up to speed on business issues 
quickly . I was particularly pleased to spend 
time walking around the yards and talking 
directly with operations managers; in this 
way I got a good sense of the real issues 
facing the workforce.”

Directors’ Report
United Arab Emirates. This EGM was held 
in order for shareholders to consider the 
proposal for the Company to enter into the 
proposed joint venture in Saudi Arabia  
11. Shareholders voted overwhelmingly 
to approve the proposal with more than 
99.9% of shareholders voting in favour of 
the resolution. 
Communications with shareholders
As in previous years, Lamprell focused 
heavily on effective and open 
communications with its shareholders, 
not least because of the conclusion of 
the joint venture relating to the IMI yard in 
Saudi Arabia 11. Whilst the Chairman 
assumes overall responsibility for 
communication of shareholder views to 
the Board, investor relations activities are 
primarily handled by the CEO and CFO 
with the support of a dedicated investor 
relations team. During 2017, over 100 
investor and analyst meetings were held 
by the investor relations team face-to-face 
or over the phone; of these, the CEO and/
or CFO attended over 55%.
As in previous years, Company 
representatives met with major institutional 
shareholders and market analysts 
following the announcement of our 
financial results and at other key times 
during the year such as around trading 
updates to the market. To the extent 
possible, the Company will aim to make 
analyst site visits (similar to the ones 
organised in previous years) a regular 
occurrence. In addition, the Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director are 
available to speak with shareholders  
and did communicate from time to time 
with shareholders on specific issues 
during 2017.
The Company has made use of the 
services of JPMC and Investec as its 
joint corporate brokers, with JPMC 
acting as the lead broker since its listing 
in 2006. JPMC has supported and 
advised the Board through a number of 
challenging corporate transactions since 
2012 including the rights issue of 2014. 
Investec acted as the Company’s broker 
and adviser in relation to the proposed 
joint venture in Saudi Arabia leading to the 
above-mentioned EGM in June 2017.
The Company also views the AGM 
as an important process for liaising 
with shareholders. The Company has 
strived to take on board comments from 
shareholders and has engaged with 
investor advisory groups to understand 
any concerns with the aim of maximising 
the votes in favour of resolutions 
submitted for approval at the AGM. 
With the exception of the resolution 2 
(relating to the Directors’ Annual Report 
on Remuneration for 2016), all resolutions 
were passed with at least 98% of the 
votes cast in favour of the respective 
resolutions. Resolution 2 received more 
than 90% of the votes cast in favour and 
this is discussed further in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report 58.

By virtue of the size of its shareholding 
in the Company, Lamprell Holdings 
Limited and its ultimate owner , Steven 
Lamprell, are “controlling shareholders” 
for the purposes of the UK’s Listing 
Rules. Accordingly, they were required 
to enter into an agreement with the 
Company to ensure compliance with the 
independence provisions set out in the 
Listing Rules (“Controlling Shareholder

The Controlling Shareholder Agreement 
regulates the ongoing relationship 
between the Company and these 
controlling shareholders. The Company 
has complied with the independence 
and all other provisions in the Controlling 
Shareholder Agreement. So far as the 
Company is aware, the controlling 
shareholders have also complied 
with the independence and all other 
provisions in the Controlling Shareholder 
Agreement. The Controlling Shareholder 
Agreement represents a key component 
of the Company’s corporate governance 
structure. 
Communications with other key 
stakeholders
Lamprell’s core lending group is 
another key stakeholder for the 
business and the debt facility terms 
represent a fundamental part of the 
Group’s governance structure as it 
includes certain banking covenants 
and restrictions. The management team 
provides regular updates on key aspects 
of the business to the lending group and 
the CFO communicates frequently with 
each of the lending banks to address  
any queries.
Finally, the Board places considerable 
importance on positive and effective 
interaction with the Group’s workforce 
and Lamprell’s internal Corporate 
Communications team coordinates 
campaigns for the management team 
to cascade key messages throughout 
the organisation. In 2017, there were 
campaigns relating to significant safety 
matters such as the risk of heat stress 
in the hot summer months in the UAE 
and cyber attacks. In continuation of 
the process undertaken by the previous 
CEO, Christopher McDonald conducted 
a regular series of “townhall meetings” 
at each of the three main facilities 
in the UAE, which were focused on 
the Company’s performance and on 
developments within the business. The 
management team considers that such 
close communication with the workforce 
enables employees to voice concerns 
but also allows the CEO to set out key 
developments within the business and the 
ways that employees can help to deliver 
the Company’s strategic goals.
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration and Development 
Committee is primarily responsible for 
determining the Company’s remuneration 
policy, taking into account the best 
practices as well as the advice from 
external consultants. Details of the 
Company’s policy on remuneration, the 
Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 
31 December 2017 and their interests in 
the ordinary shares of the Company can 
be found in the Directors’ Annual Report 
on Remuneration 64.
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover
Each year , the Board reviews and 
approves the level of the Directors’ 
and Officers’ liability insurance cover to 
ensure that it is appropriate in light of 
the circumstances, size and risks within 
the business. This is subject to the usual 
exclusions such as fraud or dishonesty  
by a Director .

Nomination and Governance 
Committee Report
Committee attendance 
The Committee is comprised of  
four members, three of whom are 
considered to be wholly independent, 
plus the Chairman of the Board. Aside 
from the members, the Company 
Secretary and the Group’s VP of HR 
are typically invited to attend meetings. 
Following John Malcolm’s appointment  
as the new Chairman in September ,  
Mel Fitzgerald became chair of the  
Committee in his place.
Remit of the Committee 
The Committee has primary responsibility 
for the structure, balance, diversity and 
experience on the Board and Committees, 
and for leading the evaluation of the 
Board’s performance and effectiveness. 
It also assesses the succession planning 
needs at the most senior level. In addition, 
the Committee considers the implications 
of any changes in the regulatory and 
governance framework and advises the 
Board on the same. With the increased 
global concerns around security, the 
Board also delegated responsibility for 
overseeing the Group’s security activities 
to the Committee. The Committee’s written 
terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website.
Activities during 2017
As required by the Code, the Committee 
took a leadership role with regard to 
succession planning at the Board level 
during 2017. This was important to ensure 
the transition from the previous Chairman, 
John Kennedy, to the new Chairman, John 
Malcolm, which followed Mr Kennedy’s 
decision to step down from the Board in 
September . The Committee also advised 
the Board in connection with the change 
from Executive Chairman to Non-
Executive Chairman which took place 
earlier in the year .  
The appointment of John Malcolm as 
the new Non-Executive Chairman was 
made following consideration of various 
factors, notably his deep knowledge 
of the Company and long experience 
of working in the oil & gas market, a 
core market for the Group. Accordingly, 
the Committee determined that the 
appointment of an internal candidate, 
rather than a potentially time-consuming 
external search process, was the optimal 
solution for hiring the new Chairman for 
the Company .
The Committee devoted considerable 
time to the appointment of the two new 
Non-Executive Directors. The appointment 
of James Dewar followed a review and 
interviews of a number of short-listed 
candidates, all with the assistance of 
Korn Ferry, a recruitment specialist firm. 
Once Mr Dewar had been identified as 
the preferred candidate, the Committee 
acted as the primary evaluating body 
for his candidacy, but regularly reported 
to the full Board on progress. The 
Company made use of Korn Ferry 
The Committee was involved in managing the Board  
succession process, with the transition from the previous  
Chairman to the new Chairman, as well as the appointment  
of two new Non-Executive Directors.

because of its strong profile in the 
industry, proven assessment processes 
and broad contact networks from which 
to source candidates. Save in relation 
to this process, Lamprell had no other 
connection with this company .  
In relation to Mr Garrett, the Committee 
carefully considered Mr Garrett’s 
credentials to be a Non-Executive  
Director in light of his candidacy being 
proposed by the major shareholder , 48. 
The Committee concluded that, while he 
would not be considered as independent 
for the purposes of the Code, he brought 
additional strengths and expertise  
to the Board as well as his long history  
of working with the Group.
Leadership succession planning 
The Board considers succession planning 
and internal talent management to be 
significant for delivery of the Group’s 
strategy . This was a Board priority for 
2017 and the Committee recommended 
that it should continue to manage 
succession planning for the Directors 
and especially for Executive Directors. 
However , talent development, notably 
for the next level of management, was 
best suited to the Remuneration & 
Development Committee, hence the 
amendment to its terms of reference, 
58. While the Board considered that 
positive progress was made in this area 
during 2017 as a result, this remains a top 
priority for the business, particularly for 
any key retention risks in anticipation of  
a market recovery in 2019 and beyond.
Gender diversity
Lamprell recognises that the quality of 
our people is fundamental to our success 
and aims to recruit on merit and hire the 
best candidates with the widest range 
of skills and experience, whatever their 
background or gender . Our sector of 
fabrication, engineering and construction 
projects continues to be a predominantly 
male-dominated profession; however , 
the Group is committed to building its 
diversity pipeline as a long-term objective 
for the whole organisation. We believe that 
diversity creates a dynamic and creative 
environment which contributes to solving 
issues as they arise and thereby will 
support the future growth of our business.
The Board has also considered the 
recommendations of the Hampton-
Alexander Review and in 2017 issued 
its gender diversity policy for Board 
appointments. Given the current 
size and balance of experience of 
Lamprell’s Board and the refreshing 
of the Board’s independent Non-
Executive Directors in 2015 and 2017, 
it is unlikely that Lamprell will be fully 
compliant with the recommendations 
of the Hampton-Alexander Review 
in the short-to-medium term.

Committee Report
However , looking ahead as the Group 
grows and as new positions become 
available, the Board diversity policy 
commits the Group to:
• A corporate culture which hires 
candidates on merit based on the 
most appropriate range of skills and 
experience for a role, and offers 
equal opportunities for all employees, 
regardless of gender (as well as 
ethnic origin, background or physical 
disabilities);
• Secure senior leadership commitment 
to the diversity agenda and to raise 
awareness about the benefits of a 
diverse workforce;
• Require external recruitment consultants 
to submit their diversity policies to the 
Group before taking on any Board or 
executive management search;
• Ensure that external consultants submit 
candidate shortlists reflecting an 
appropriate gender balance, relative 
to the target recruitment market, for 
consideration by the Nomination 
and Governance Committee in 
connection with any Board or executive 
management appointment;
• A target of at least one female Director 
on the Board; and
• An annual review by the Nomination 
and Governance Committee of its 
progress complying with the best 
practice recommendations for  
gender diversity .
Service agreements and letters  
of appointment 
Executive Directors are employed 
under Directors’ service contracts with 
termination notice periods of not more 
than 12 months.
Non-Executive Directors are engaged 
pursuant to letters of appointment which 
do not have fixed terms but they are 
subject to re-election by the Company’s 
shareholders at intervals of not more than 
three years. 
All existing Directors and new Directors 
will be proposed for election by the 
shareholders at the 2018 AGM.

Committee attendance 
Throughout 2017, membership of the 
Committee was comprised solely of 
independent NEDs. Debra Valentine  
was appointed to the Committee when 
John Malcolm stepped down to take  
up the role of Chairman of the Board. 
James Dewar was added as a member 
of the Committee when he joined the 
Company in November and became 
Committee Chairman effective  
1 January 2018. Both James Dewar and 
Ellis Armstrong have relevant financial 
experience for the purposes of the Code, 
thereby ensuring the strong background 
in both financial metrics and industry 
experience, to assess the matters 
presented to the Committee. 
As a “smaller company” under the Code, 
the Committee needs only have two 
members but the Board determined 
that it was in the best interests for 
the Committee to have at least three 
members. Aside from the members, the 
Company Secretary and the Group’s 
CFO are typically invited to attend the 
meetings. In addition, the external and 
internal auditors are invited to meetings 
at key times during the year . On occasion, 
other Board members and managers 
attend by invitation.
Remit of the Committee 
The Committee has primary responsibility 
for overseeing the integrity of all of the 
Company’s announcements relating to 
its financial performance, including its 
financial results, and for considering 
all matters relating to the terms of 
appointment for , performance and 
independence of the Company’s external 
auditors. The Committee advises the 
Board on whether the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair , 
balanced and understandable.
The Committee also oversees the 
Company’s enterprise risk management 
system 34 as well as its internal control 
systems, and monitors the effectiveness 
of such systems particularly against 
potential ethical or fraudulent activities. 
This includes assessment of the 
whistleblowing hotline activities.
The Committee’s written terms of 
reference are available on the Company’s 
website.

Audit and Risk Committee  
Report
Activities during 2017
The Committee’s main activities during 
2017 were as follows:
• overseeing management’s effort to 
forecast and manage its cash and cash 
equivalents through the continuing, 
prolonged market downturn;
• assessing the basis and impact of the 
goodwill impairment as part of the 2016 
financial results;
• reviewing the year-end/interim financial 
statements for the Company including 
ongoing risks and opportunities;
• considering the funding scenarios 
for the potential joint venture in Saudi 
Arabia 11;
• evaluating the external Auditor’s 
independence, objectivity and the 
effectiveness;
• assessing the basis and impact of the 
additional costs on the East Anglia One 
project 26;
• monitoring the Group’s progress for 
implementing systems and processes 
to cater for the introduction of VAT in 
the UAE as from 1 January 2018;
• assessing the Group’s enterprise  
risk management database and  
how enterprise risks are identified  
and mitigated;
• reviewing the internal audit reports, 
outstanding action points and the 2018 
audit plan;
• ongoing assessment of the control 
environment and systems; and
• reviewing the whistleblowing statistics 
and reported cases.
Significant judgements in 2017
The Committee considered the 
significant judgements 55 during 
2017. The Committee was satisfied that 
the judgements made by management 
were reasonable and that appropriate 
disclosures have been included in the 
accounts.
External auditor – activities and 
performance
Deloitte LLP has been the Company’s 
auditors following a formal tender process 
in 2015. During 2017, Deloitte LLP 
presented to the Committee on various 
matters (including their audit report 
on the 2016 financial results) on two 
occasions. Deloitte LLP also provided 
the Committee with updates on changes 
to accounting, regulatory and corporate 
governance laws and regulations that 
impact the Company and the Group. The 
Committee remains satisfied as to the 
Auditor’s effectiveness and, in making 
this assessment, had due regard to 
their expertise and understanding of 
the Group, their resourcing capabilities, 
independence and objectivity .
The Company’s Policy on Auditor 
Independence, which is available on 
the Group’s website, is designed to 
safeguard the objectivity of our external 
auditors and to ensure the independence 
of the audit is not compromised. Under 
the policy, all audit-related services or 
non-audit services must receive specific 
pre-approval from the Audit and Risk 
Committee if the total annual fee for all 
such services exceeds 50% of the sum 
of the annual fees for audit services. Any 
and all audit-related services or non-audit 
services in excess of this amount must 
be expressly pre-approved by the Audit 
and Risk Committee. Further , in respect 
of all such other services, a tender 
process is required for any project or 
scope of work which is anticipated to 
generate fees in excess of USD 250,000. 
Accordingly , Deloitte LLP could, under 
certain conditions, be engaged to 
undertake non-audit services provided 
that it does not compromise the integrity 
of their audit work. However , the policy 
also sets out services that Deloitte LLP is 
prohibited from undertaking under any 
circumstances. There was no breach of 
the policy .
In 2017, Deloitte LLP provided  
non-audit services with a total value  
of USD 0 (2016: USD 0) against an  
annual audit fee including Group audit 
fees with a total value of USD 596,000 
(2016: USD 520,000). This continues the 
positive developments to minimise the 
amount of non-audit services conducted 
by the external auditors (as compared 
to audit services) commenced in 2015. 
During the year , the Committee reiterated 
the importance of ensuring that the  
non-audit fees remain below 50% of  
the total audit fee.
James Dewar  
Committee Chair and Non-Executive Director Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
55 Given the oversight by the Committee, the 
minimal non-audit services undertaken 
by Deloitte LLP and the change of auditor 
in 2015, the Committee considers that 
the objectivity and independence of 
the external auditor were safeguarded 
throughout the financial year . 
Performance and effectiveness of the 
external auditor
Under the Committee’s terms of 
reference, it assesses the auditor’s 
independence, performance and 
effectiveness at least on an annual basis, 
by reference to the activities of Deloitte 
LLP and also by way of feedback from 
several sources: the Committee relies 
on self-assessment by Deloitte LLP 
of its performance, on feedback from 
certain senior managers that work closely 
alongside the auditors including the  
CFO and the Company Secretary, and 
on its own evaluation of Deloitte LLP’s 
services based on the results of its audit 
work and the challenges presented  
to the views and positions of the  
Group’s management.
In light of the accumulated feedback, the 
Committee remains satisfied of Deloitte 
LLP’s independence and effectiveness 
and the Board concurs with the 
assessment by the Committee.
Auditor tender process 
The Code provides that a listed company 
should put its external audit contract out 
to public tender at least every ten years. 
As noted above, the Company retendered 
for its external audit services in 2015 
which is in line with best practice.  
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness 
to be appointed and continue to act  
as external auditor and a resolution  
to appoint Deloitte LLP will be proposed 
at the forthcoming 2018 AGM for  
their services in respect of the  
2018 financial year .
FRC review and findings 
During the year the Financial Reporting 
Council (“FRC”) conducted a review of 
the audit performed by Deloitte LLP of the 
Group’s financial statements for the year 
ended 31st December 2016. The scope 
of the FRC review covered the audit work 
performed in the following areas:
• Estimate of project costs and  
revenue recognition;
• Recoverability of goodwill and  
other assets;
• Review of subjective provisions;
• End of service liability benefits; and
• First year audit procedures.
The review also covered the quality of 
communication with the Committee, 
plus certain matters relating to ethics, 
independence, quality control and 
completion. The outcome of the review 
was that the audit work in two of the areas 
covered required limited improvements. 
These were the impairment of non-current 
assets and the end of service liability 
benefits. Deloitte LLP and Lamprell have 
taken actions to make improvements 
in these areas. The Committee would 
like to thank the FRC for the rigorous 
and professional manner in which they 
conducted the review.
Interaction with internal auditors
The Company has a well-established and 
embedded internal audit (“IA ”) function 
and the Head of IA presents to the 
Committee at least on a bi-annual basis, 
providing updates and analysis for the 
internal audits, as well as making key 
recommendations and observations to 
the Committee and submitting a proposal 
for the internal audits proposed for the 
subsequent year . 
Aside from leading the annual control self-
assessment exercises undertaken during 
the year , the IA function conducted the 
following audits during 2017:
• Surprise cash count;
• Operations & Maintenance  
business unit;
• Yard labour management;
• Procurement function;
• Projects management: new build and 
onshore/offshore;
• Inventory management: ERP 
configuration and utilisation;
• Third party QC inspection services;
• Camp assets disposal process; and
• Late project costs review.
There has been close interaction between 
the IA and Group risk functions in order 
to formulate the 2018 planned internal 
audits. Necessary amendments to the  
IA plan are made during the year , subject 
to the Committee’s approval, in instances 
where the level of risk had increased, or

Signiﬁcant judgments considered 
by the Committee during 2017
View/actions of the Committee 
with respect to signiﬁcant judgements
The Committee reviewed the reasonableness of judgements made regarding the cost to complete estimates, 
recognition of variation orders and contractual claims, and the adequacy of contingency provisions to 
mitigate contract speciﬁc risks. In particular the Committee focused on any onerous contract to ensure 
that the assumptions made to assess the contract loss were appropriate. The Committee concluded that 
the quantiﬁcation and timing of revenue, margin and loss recognition continues to be in line with IFRS 
requirements and satisﬁed itself that Company’s ﬁnancial statements had been prepared on the basis 
of the accounting policy and noted that the external auditors had audited the methodology on that basis.  
At each meeting, the Committee evaluated management’s report on material subjective provisions taken 
in respect of matters including doubtful debts, contract accruals, project risks and warranty issues. The 
Committee considers the appropriateness, adequacy and consistency of approach to provisioning at each 
meeting and all material provisions are discussed and challenged. Given the uncertain economic climate 
for supply chain companies in the oil & gas sector , there was a focus in the year on the recoverability of 
receivables and on the processes in place to monitor credit risk.  
At both the half year and the year end, the Committee considered whether indicators of impairment 
existed and the results of any impairment reviews conducted. Given the decline in both revenues 
and proﬁts in 2016 and 2017; and the projected fall in revenues in 2018, the Group had considered it 
appropriate to review for the possible impairment of property , plant and equipment and the Committee 
considered the appropriateness of the assumptions and challenged the factors used in the review process.  
After discussion, it was satisﬁed that the assumptions and the disclosures in the year-end ﬁnancial 
statements were appropriate.     56

decreased significantly, or circumstances 
within the Group have changed, or as 
specifically requested by management. 
The Committee will assess, by reference 
to the highlighted risk trends within the 
business and best practice, the key 
recommendations, and approve actions 
and the forward-looking internal  
audit plan. 
As a matter of best practice the 
Committee meets with the internal auditor 
without executives present to discuss any 
sensitive matters or concerns. Equally 
and in much the same way as with the 
external auditors, the Committee reviews 
the performance and effectiveness of the 
IA function and remains satisfied with the 
effectiveness of the IA function.
Enterprise risk management
Each of the Directors acknowledges 
and accepts that the Board as a whole 
takes responsibility for risk management 
in line with the Code requirements. The 
Board has delegated the administration 
and monitoring of the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems to the Committee. 
However , the day-to- day responsibility for 
developing and implementing the internal 
control and risk management procedures 
resides with the executive management 
team which then reports on risk to the 
Committee. In 2017, management formally 
presented on two separate occasions to 
the Committee (in May and November). 
The purpose of such presentations was to 
ensure that the Committee, and therefore 
the Board, has appropriate oversight of 
enterprise risks and their potential impact 
on the business, with a particular focus 
on the risks that are specific to the Group. 
In addition, the Board discussed the key 
risks facing the Company and business 
as part of the processes for release of the 
2016 financial results in March and the 
2017 half-year results in September .
This two-way disclosure and monitoring 
system for enterprise risks facing the 
Group provides the Directors with 
reasonable (but not absolute) assurance 
against material misstatements and 
losses. The structure of the risk 
management mechanisms as well  
as the results of this system can be seen 
in the information relating to the principal 
risks and uncertainties faced by the 
Group 34.  
The executive team has been working to 
embed risk management into the daily 
activities of all Lamprell employees. 
However , in light of the significant 
losses incurred on the East Anglia One 
project, it was recognised that additional 
improvements had to be made around 
project risk reporting, measurement  
of performance against metrics and 
feeding lessons learned from previous 
projects into future bidding activities. 
There have been a series of workshops  
in the management team to identify the 
risks on the EA1 project as well as the 
systems and controls required to identify 
potential hazards and risks on a project  
at an early stage and take mitigating 
actions accordingly .  
Risk is assessed formally at the business 
unit level through the maintenance of 
project and department risk registers. The 
updating of the risk registers is a regular 
process, involving the regular effective 
identification, evaluation and management 
of risks by individual managers. 
Internal controls framework
The Company has a system of internal 
controls based around the following key 
features:
• a strategy defined and implemented  
by the Board;
• financial planning including annual 
budgets, quarterly reviews and  
three-year forecasting;
• oversight and approval of projects 
and/or contract awards either through 
executive management and/or , where 
required on major projects, the Board;
• implementation and use of an 
integrated enterprise resources 
planning system, linking the various 
business functions;
Audit & Risk Committee conducts an annual 
review of the eectiveness of the systems of 
ﬁnancial, operational and compliance

Managing risk appropriately during 2017 Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
57 • policies and procedures which define 
the Group’s standards of business 
including a schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board, a clear 
organisation structure and a  
delegation of authority matrix; and
• the Company’s Business Code of 
Conduct framed according to the 
Group’s core values.
There are also various policies and 
procedures which embed regulatory 
requirements into the daily operations 
of the Group such as the anti-bribery 
and corruption policy, the share dealing 
code, the insider dealing and market 
abuse policy and the whistleblowing 
policy . They are all available on the 
Company’s website www.lamprell.com. 
With the issuance of the Market Abuse 
Regulation (“MAR”) in July 2016, the 
Board updated and reissued its share 
dealing code to comply with MAR and 
has also implemented a more formalistic 
process for identifying and disclosing 
inside information which includes the use 
of a Disclosure Committee.
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 was 
enacted during 2016 and requires 
companies to evaluate internal and 
external risks related to human trafficking 
and modern slavery . Lamprell has 
amended its procedures and practices 
to highlight risks among the workforce 
in relation to trafficking and slavery . The 
Group also employs other processes to 
educate the workforce on the importance 
of high standards of behaviour and ethics 
such as training around the Company’s 
Business Code of Conduct and annual 
conflict of interest declarations for 
managers and key personnel. The 
Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking 
policy statement for Lamprell, which 
includes the Board’s assessment of our 
practices and procedures in this area, 
was published and is available on the 
Company’s website.
There is a multi-lingual, secure 
whistleblowing hotline which was set 
up to allow staff members to report 
ethical breaches, irregularities or simply 
concerns on a confidential basis without 
any fear of recrimination. They are all  
key elements of an internal control  
system which is designed to assist  
in the achievement of the Group’s 
business objectives.  
Finally, the Committee undertakes an 
annual review of the effectiveness of 
the systems of internal control including 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems. 
This is performed in collaboration with 
both the internal and external auditors 
and, where weaknesses have been 
identified, the management team 
is tasked with implementing further 
safeguards which will then be re-tested by 
the audit teams. The Committee reports 
on its monitoring and observations to the 
Board at least annually . The Directors are 
satisfied that, as a result of the systems 
and the oversight functions, and the 
improvements made in light of the issues 
and learnings on the East Anglia One 
project, the internal control environment is 
operating effectively .

Directors’ Remuneration  
Report
Dear Shareholder ,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
introduce the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 31 December 
2017. We have listened to your comments 
in previous years and we shall be seeking 
your support for each part of this report 
at the forthcoming AGM on 23 May 2018. 
Performance and reward in 2017 
As a result of major , unplanned costs on 
the East Anglia One project that caused 
significant losses 22, the Company did 
not meet the minimum threshold required 
in relation to the EBITDA target to trigger 
any STIP pay-out. As such no STIP pay-
outs were made to any of the Executive 
Directors in respect of the 2017 plan.
As a further consequence of the 
Group’s 2017 performance and its 
impact on cumulative EBITDA, end 
of period backlog and relative TSR, 
the performance shares awarded to 
Tony Wright on 9 April 2015, with a 
performance cycle related to the three 
years ending 31 December 2017, 
failed to achieve the minimum vesting 
requirements in all three metrics and as 
such resulted in nil vesting.
Long-term incentive awards were granted 
in October 2017 to the CEO, Christopher 
McDonald, and the CFO, Tony Wright, 
in accordance with the rules of the 
performance share plan, 66. 
John Kennedy stood down as Executive 
Chairman on 24 April 2017 and as a 
non-executive director on 20 September 
2017. Mr Kennedy was eligible for a 
share-based and performance-related 
short-term incentive award in relation to 
his period of appointment as Executive 
Chairman and he vested in 116,047 
retention shares under the Company’s 
2009 Retention Share Plan. Details of 
both these awards are given 66.
As reported in last year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, Christopher 
McDonald was eligible for certain 
compensatory awards in relation to 
forfeited incentives with his previous 
employer . Details of awards that vested  
in 2017 are given 66.
Remuneration policy for 2018 
The Remuneration & Development  
Committee has continued to monitor 
emerging trends in UK executive 
remuneration practices and has engaged 
actively in reviewing the need for any 
potential changes in policy for 2018.  
The Committee is satisfied that the current 
remuneration policy that was approved  
at the 2016 AGM is broadly aligned with 
the UK market.
The Committee is also satisfied that the 
remuneration policy continues to maintain 
a strong link between executive reward 
and high performance and will ensure that 
we can recruit and retain the right calibre 
of senior management to maximise 
shareholder value and deliver sustainable 
growth over the longer term.
During the year , the Committee’s terms of 
reference were extended to incorporate 
a focus on executive succession and 
development. This has enabled the 
Committee to establish and maintain 
effective oversight of talent management 
and retention.
On behalf of the Board, I recommend  
this remuneration report to you and  
I hope that you will find it clear , concise 
and understandable.
Debra Valentine 
Chair of the Remuneration  
& Development Committee
21 March 2018
The Remuneration & Development Committee now has a collective 
focus on executive reward and retention as well as succession 
planning and development. This ensures that the Committee  
maintains a more holistic oversight of executive performance  
and talent management.

Remuneration Policy
This part of the report sets out the 
remuneration policy for the Company and 
has been prepared in accordance with 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. The 
Remuneration Policy for the Company  
has been developed taking into account 
the principles of the Code and the views 
of our major shareholders and describes 
the policy applied from the 2016 AGM 
onwards. The Policy Report was put  
to a binding shareholder vote and 
approved at the 2016 AGM1.
Policy overview
The Committee is responsible, on behalf 
of the Board, for establishing appropriate 
remuneration arrangements for the 
Executive Directors and other senior 
management in the Group.
Our remuneration policy aims to drive 
continuous improvements in business 
performance and maximise shareholder 
value by offering remuneration packages 
that are appropriately balanced and 
are designed to enable the recruitment, 
retention and motivation of talented 
executive directors and senior 
management. 
In setting the remuneration policy, the 
Committee considers the remuneration 
policy and levels of remuneration for the 
wider employee population, compensation 
policies and practices in the UAE and 
also in the wider market. The Committee 
will ensure that the arrangements are in 
the best interests of both the Group and 
its shareholders, by taking into account 
the following general principles:
• To attract, retain and motivate the best 
talent without paying more than is 
necessary;
• To ensure total remuneration packages 
are simple and fair in design and 
valued by participants; 
• To ensure that the fixed element of 
remuneration is determined broadly in 
line with market rates, taking account of 
individual performance, responsibilities 
and experience; and that a significant 
proportion of the total remuneration 
package is linked to performance-
related incentives;
• To balance performance pay  
between the achievement of  
financial performance objectives  
and delivering sustainable stock market 
out-performance; creating a clear line  
of sight between performance and 
reward and providing a focus on 
sustained improvements in profitability 
and returns; 
• To calibrate carefully all performance 
metrics and associated sliding scale 
ranges to ensure that performance 
is incrementally rewarded through 
stretching targets and that executives 
are not inadvertently incentivised to 
take inappropriate business risks; 60
Corporate governance
Directors’ Remuneration  
Report
• To maintain the highest possible health 
and safety standards where any fatality 
that takes place in a facility operated by 
the Company or any of its subsidiaries 
may result in discretionary withdrawal 
of incentive eligibility;
• To provide a significant proportion 
of performance linked pay in shares 
allowing senior management to build 
significant shareholding in the business 
and therefore aligning management 
with shareholders’ interests and the 
Group’s performance; and
• To maintain appropriate governance 
and risk management through the 
application of holding periods and 
clawback provisions on incentive  
plan awards.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Company is committed to maintaining 
good communications with investors 
and in particular around compensation 
matters. The Committee also considers 
the AGM to be an opportunity to meet  
and communicate with investors and 
consider shareholder feedback received 
as a result of the AGM each year and 
guidance from shareholder representative 
bodies more generally . This feedback, 
together with any additional feedback 
received from time to time, is then 
considered as part of the Company’s 
annual review of its remuneration policy . 
The Committee will also seek to engage 
directly with major shareholders and 
their representative bodies should 
any material changes be made to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy . Details 
of the votes cast for and against the 
resolution to approve last year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.

Corporate governance
Directors’ Remuneration  
Report
Performance metric selection
The annual bonus is predominantly based 
on key financial performance indicators, 
to reflect how successful the Group has 
been in managing its operations. The 
balance is determined on performance 
against individually determined strategic 
objectives and annual operational targets, 
including HSES.
The LTIP performance measures 
reward significant long-term returns to 
shareholders and long-term financial 
growth. Targets take account of internal 
strategic planning and external market 
expectations for the Company and 
are set appropriate to the economic 
outlook and risk factors prevailing at 
the time, ensuring that such targets 
remain challenging in the circumstances, 
whilst remaining realistic enough to 
motivate and incentivise management. 
Only modest rewards are available for 
achieving threshold performance with 
maximum rewards requiring substantial 
out-performance of challenging strategic 
plans approved at the start of each year . 
Discretion
The Committee will operate the incentive 
plans in accordance with their respective 
rules, the UK Listing Rules and the HMRC 
rules where relevant. The Committee, 
consistent with market practice, retains 
discretion over a number of areas relating 
to the operation and administration of 
certain plan rules. These include (but are 
not limited to) the following: 
• who participates; 
• the timing of the grant of award  
and/or payment;
• the size of an award (up to plan/policy 
limits) and/or a payment;
• the result indicated by the relative 
TSR performance condition may be 
scaled back (potentially to zero) in the 
event that the Committee considers 
that financial performance has been 
unsatisfactory and/or the outcome has 
been distorted due to the TSR for the 
Company or any comparator company 
being considered abnormal;
• discretion relating to the measurement 
of performance in the event of a 
change of control or reconstruction;
• determination of a good leaver (in 
addition to any specified categories) 
for incentive plan purposes and the 
treatment of leavers;
• adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring and special 
dividends); and
• the ability to adjust existing 
performance conditions for exceptional 
events so that they can still fulfil their 
original purpose. 
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving 
this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, 
authority is given to the Company  
to honour any commitments entered  
into with current or former directors  
(such as, the vesting or exercise of  
past share awards).
Relative to pay and employment 
conditions in the Group 
The Committee takes account of 
remuneration levels offered to the 
senior management team in the Group 
as well as the awards affecting the 
wider employee population. When 
considering the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration structure and levels, 
the Committee reviews base salary 
and incentive arrangements for the 
management team, to ensure that 
there is a coherent approach across 
the Group. Employees may be eligible 
to participate in an annual bonus 
arrangement and receive awards under 
the LTIP , Executive Share Option Plan 
(“ESOP”), Retention Share Plan (“RSP”) 
or Free Share Plan (“FSP”). Opportunities 
and performance metrics may vary by 
workforce level with specific business 
metrics incorporated where possible. 
While the Company sees communication 
among its employees as a key priority it 
does not formally consult with employees 
in respect of the design of the Executive 
Director remuneration policy, although the 
Committee will keep this under review. 
Remuneration scenarios for the  
Executive Directors* 
The charts below show an estimate  
of the potential range of remuneration 
payable for the Executive Directors in 
2018 at different levels of performance. 
The charts highlight that the performance-
related elements of the package 
comprise a significant portion of the 
Executive Directors’ total remuneration  
at maximum performance. 
Directors’ recruitment and promotions 
The Committee takes into account  
the need to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and senior managers 
of the highest calibre, while at the same 
time ensuring a close alignment between 
the interests of shareholders and 
management.
If a new Executive Director were to be 
appointed, the Committee would seek 
to align the remuneration package with 
the remuneration policy approved by 
shareholders, including discretion to 
award an annual bonus up to 100% of 
base salary and an LTIP award up to 
120% for the CEO and 100% for other 
Executive Directors, with discretion, in 
exceptional circumstances, to grant an 
award of up to 150% of base salary . 
Flexibility would be retained to set base 
salaries at the level necessary to facilitate 
Assumptions:
1. Base salary levels applying on 1 January 2018.
2. Benefits are estimated, based on the annualised 
value for the year ended 31 December 2017.
3. The end of service gratuity is estimated, based on 
the accrual for the year ended 31 December 2017.
4. Minimum performance assumes no award is earned 
under the annual bonus plan and no vesting is 
achieved under the LTIP; at on-target, typically, 60% 
of the maximum is earned under annual bonus plan 
and typically 40% vesting is achieved under the 
LTIP; and at maximum full vesting under both plans. 
5. As per the legislation, share price movement and 
dividend accrual have been excluded from the 
above analysis.
the hiring of candidates of appropriate 
calibre in external markets and to 
make awards or payments in respect 
of deferred remuneration forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer . In terms of 
remuneration to compensate forfeited 
awards, the Committee would look to 
replicate the arrangements being forfeited 
as closely as possible and, in doing so, 
would take account of relevant factors 
including the nature of the remuneration, 
performance conditions and the time over 
which the awards would have vested or 
been paid. 
In exceptional circumstances and only 
on recruitment (e.g. to buy out the value 
of awards forfeited) the Committee 
may also award share options of up to 
150% of base salary under the ESOP . 
Options will vest dependent on the 
achievement of agreed performance and/
or retention conditions over a three-year 
period and will be exercisable up to the 
10th anniversary of the date of grant.

Dividends that accrue during the vesting 
period may be paid in cash or shares at 
the time of vesting, to the extent that the 
options become exercisable.
For an internal appointment, any incentive 
amount awarded in respect of a prior 
role may be allowed to vest on its original 
terms, or adjusted as relevant to take 
into account the appointment. Any other 
ongoing remuneration obligations existing 
prior to appointment may continue.
The Committee may also agree that the 
Company will meet certain relocation and 
incidental expenses as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new  
Non-Executive Chairman or NED,  
the fee arrangement would be set 
in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy at that time. 
Directors’ service agreements and 
payments for loss of office 
The Committee reviews the contractual 
terms of the service agreements to 
ensure these reflect best practice. 
The Group’s policy is that Executive 
Directors should be employed on  
a rolling term, with a notice period not 
exceeding 12 months and in the event 
of early termination, the Company will 
not make any payments beyond its 
contractual obligations. 
The Executive Directors’ service 
agreements are terminable on up to 
12 months’ notice. In circumstances of 
termination on notice, the Committee will 
determine an equitable compensation 
package, having regard to the particular 
circumstances of the case. The 
Committee has discretion to require 
notice to be worked or to make payment 
in lieu of notice or to place the Director  
on garden leave for the notice period.  
In case of payment in lieu or garden 
leave, base salary, benefits and end of 
service gratuity will be paid for the period 
of notice served on garden leave or paid 
in lieu. If the Committee believes it would 
be in shareholders’ interests the Company 
may elect to make payments in three 
separate tranches; 50% within seven 
working days of the termination date;  
25% three months after the termination 
date; and 25% six months after the 
termination date. 
The annual bonus may be payable in 
respect of the period of the bonus plan 
year worked by the Director; there is no 
provision for an amount in lieu of bonus 
to be payable for any part of the notice 
period not worked. The bonus will be 
scaled back pro-rata for the period of  
the incentive year worked by the Director 
and will still be payable at the normal 
payment date. 
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives granted under the 
LTIP will be determined by the plan rules 
which contain discretionary good leaver 
provisions for designated reasons (e.g. 
participants who leave early on account 
of injury, disability or ill health, or any 
other reason at the discretion of the 
Committee). In these circumstances a 
participant’s awards will not be forfeited 
on cessation of employment and 
instead will vest on the normal vesting 
date. In exceptional circumstances, 
the Committee may decide that the 
participant’s award will vest early on the 
termination date. In either case, the extent 
to which the awards will vest depends 
on the extent to which the performance 
conditions have been satisfied and a 
pro-rata reduction of the awards will 
be applied by reference to the time 
of cessation (although the Committee 
has discretion to disapply performance 
conditions and time pro-rating if the 
circumstances warrant it). In the case of 
death of the participant, the award will 
vest at that time, irrespective of whether 
or not any performance conditions have 
been satisfied, and the award will not be 
time pro-rated. 
In respect of legacy options outstanding 
under the ESOP , the options will be 
determined by the plan rules which 
contain discretionary good leaver 
provisions for designated reasons 
(e.g. participants who leave early on 
account of injury, disability or ill health, 
a sale of their employer or business in 
which they were employed or any other 
reason at the discretion of the Board). 
In these circumstances a participant’s 
options will not be forfeited on cessation 
of employment but will vest on the 
termination date instead. The extent to 
which the options become exercisable 
depends, unless the Board determines 
otherwise, on the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been 
satisfied up until the termination date 
or such longer period as the Board 
may decide within six weeks of the 
grant date. The performance period 
will end on the termination date unless 
the Board determines otherwise. In 
the case of death of a participant, the 
option will become exercisable at that 
time, irrespective of whether or not 
any performance conditions have been 
satisfied, and the option will not be time 
pro-rated.
In the event of a change of control all 
unvested awards under the long-term 
incentive arrangements would vest, to the 
extent that any performance conditions 
attached to the relevant awards have 
been achieved. The awards will, other 
than in exceptional circumstances, be 
scaled back pro-rata for the period of 
the incentive year worked by the Director 
(although the Committee has discretion to 
disapply performance conditions and time 
pro-rating if the circumstances warrant it).

Corporate governance
Directors’ Remuneration  
Report
Responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing 
with the Board the policy on Executive Directors’ remuneration, 
including setting the over-arching principles, parameters and 
governance framework and determining the initial remuneration 
package of each Executive Director . In addition, the Committee 
monitors the structure and level of remuneration for the senior 
management team and is aware of pay and conditions in 
the workforce generally . The Committee also ensures full 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation 
to remuneration. From 2017, the Committee’s terms of reference 
were extended to ensure the appropriate level of Board attention 
is given to executive performance, talent development  and 
retention through effective succession planning and identification 
of succession issues. The Committee’s terms of reference are 
available for review on the Company’s website. 
Members and activities of the Committee
The members of the Committee throughout the relevant period 
were John Malcolm (Committee Chair and member until 
19 September), Debra Valentine (Committee Chair from 20 
September), Ellis Armstrong, Mel Fitzgerald (from 20 September) 
and James Dewar (from 1 November). Membership is comprised 
solely of independent NEDs. None of the current Committee 
members has day-to-day involvement with the business nor do 
they have any personal financial interest in the matters to be 
recommended. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the Committee and the Vice-President, Human Resources and 
Administration attends meetings on a regular basis to present 
and provide related support. The number of formal meetings 
held and the attendance by each member is shown in the table 
below. The Committee also held informal discussions as required. 
External advice received (unaudited)
During the year , the Committee received independent advice 
on remuneration matters from New Bridge Street (“NBS”), a 
trading name of Aon plc. NBS did not provide other services to 
the Group during the year under review and there is no other 
connection between NBS and the Company or the Directors. 
The Committee also consulted with the CEO, CFO and Executive 
Chairman but not in relation to their own remuneration. 
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of 
Conduct and adheres to the Voluntary Code of Conduct in 
relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The 
Committee has reviewed the operating processes in place at 
NBS and is satisfied that the advice it receives is objective and 
independent.
The fees paid to NBS during the year were £11,900.
This report has been prepared in accordance with Part 3 of the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 and 9.8.6R of the UK’s Listing 
Rules. The Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM. The information 64 to 69, save as 
where indicated, has been audited.

Implementation of the  
Remuneration Policy for 2018
Base salary (unaudited)
In setting base salaries for 2018, the Committee considered  
external market data as well as the challenging market 
environment that has driven the continued need for overhead 
cost reductions. Accordingly the base salaries of the Executive 
Directors in 2018 will remain the same for the second  
successive year .
The base salaries for 2018 are as follows:
Base salary  
from 1 January
%
increase
2017 2016
Christopher McDonald USD 700,000 700,000 0%
Tony Wright USD 410,000 410,000 0%
Annual bonus for 2018 (“STIP”) (unaudited)
For 2018 the annual bonus opportunity will be 100% of base 
salary for the CEO and 85% of base salary for the CFO, 
payable in cash. 40% of the bonus will be based on sales, 
20% will be based on gross profit, set in relation to the Group’s 
budget, 15% will be based on net cash at 31 December 2018 
and the remaining 25% will be based on strategic and/or 
personal targets, including safety performance. This structure 
is intended to provide a rounded assessment of the Group and 
management’s performance against challenging targets which 
are aligned with the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The sales targets will be within a range from USD 375 million 
to USD 750 million with associated pay-outs within the range 
of 20-100% of target. The Committee considers any disclosure 
of future gross profit and net cash targets to be commercially 
sensitive, however , full retrospective disclosure of targets and 
performance against them will be disclosed in next year’s Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Clawback provisions will apply to all bonus pay-outs. Clawback 
may apply in a number of circumstances, for example, where a 
misstatement of performance or events arises after the payment 
of a bonus or in circumstances where misconduct may lead to 
significant reputational damage.
Long-term incentives (unaudited)
Subject to compliance with the Listing Rules, awards will be 
made in 2018 and the maximum LTIP potential will be 120% 
of base salary for the CEO and 100% for the CFO. 50% of the 
award will be based on relative TSR (relative to the FTSE World 
Oil Equipment & Services Index), 25% on cumulative EBITDA 
and 25% on end of period backlog. 
Relative TSR, cumulative EBITDA and end of period backlog  
are considered to be the most appropriate measures of  
long-term performance for the Group in that they ensure  
the Executive Directors are incentivised and rewarded for  
the financial performance of the Group as well as returning  
value to shareholders.

Outside appointments (unaudited)
The Board allows Executive Directors to accept appropriate 
external, commercial non-executive director appointments 
provided the aggregate commitment is compatible with their 
duties and does not cause a conflict of interest with the role  
of an Executive Director . Such Executive Directors may retain 
fees paid for these services, which will be subject to approval  
by the Board. 
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors (unaudited)
The Non-Executive Chairman’s remuneration is determined by 
the Committee and the Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is

which is based on the responsibility and time committed to the 
Group’s affairs and appropriate market comparisons. Individual 
Non-Executive Directors do not take part in discussions 
regarding their own fees. Non-Executive Directors receive no 
other benefits. A summary of the current fees is as follows:

1. All Directors’ pay is reported above in USD. Christopher McDonald’s pay is 
determined in USD and paid in AED. Tony Wright is remunerated in AED; Ellis 
Armstrong and Debra Valentine’s remuneration is determined in GBP and paid  
in USD and the remuneration of John Kennedy, John Malcolm, Mel Fitzgerald,

insurance, club membership, the use of a company car , private fuel card,  
airfare tickets and utility expenses. The table below summarises the main  
benefits and allowances.
3. End of service gratuity is the provision accrued during the year . In accordance 
with the provisions of IAS 19, the present value of Directors’ end of service 
gratuity obligations under UAE Labour Law have been valued using the projected 
unit credit method, as at 31 December 2017 and 2016. Under this method an 
assessment has been made of a Director’s expected service with the Group and 
the expected base salary on the date of termination. As part of the valuation we 
have assumed an average base salary increment of 2% p.a. (2016: 2%).  
The expected liability on the date of termination has been discounted to its net 
present value using a discount rate of 3.2% p.a. (2016: 3.5% p.a).
4. The annual bonus for 2017 was based on performance against financial  
and non-financial performance targets. Performance against these targets  
is set out in the tables below. No annual bonus payments were made in respect  
of the 2017 plan.
5. Details of the long-term incentives and other payments to Christopher McDonald 
are given on page 66. Vested share-based long-term incentive amounts are 
calculated by reference to average share price and £/USD exchange rate in 10 
dealing days to 7 March 2018.
6. John Kennedy stood down as an Executive Director on 24 April 2017 and  
as a Non-Executive Director on 20 September 2017.

Directors’ Remuneration  
Report
Long-term incentive awards granted during the year
An award of 705,484 performance shares was made to 
Christopher McDonald and an award of 344,343 performance 
shares was made to Tony Wright on 2 October 2017 in 
accordance with the Company’s performance share plan rules 
with associated performance conditions. These 2017 LTIP 
conditional share awards vest in full on 1 October 2020, subject 
to achieving the performance conditions relating to relative TSR, 
three-year cumulative EBITDA and end of period backlog 66. 
The awards are subject to a holding period of two years following 
the date of vesting.
Directors’ interests in share plan awards 
The Directors hold interests in long-term incentive awards under 
the Company’s incentive plans as at 31 December 2017 as set 
out below. 
In the ordinary course, awards will normally vest on the third 
anniversary of the date of grant of the award, subject to any 
applicable performance conditions having been satisfied 66.
Directors’ interests in ordinary shares 
The Committee has adopted a formal policy requiring the 
Executive Directors to build and maintain, through the award 
of shares by the Company, a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent to 200% of base salary for the CEO and 150% of 
base salary for the CFO, when appointed. Until such time as this 
threshold is achieved there is a requirement for executives to 
retain the net proceeds of all vested share awards. Mr McDonald 
and Mr Wright have not currently achieved these targets.  
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Company discloses 
the beneficial interests of the Directors in the share capital of 
the Company as at 31 December 2017 as set out below. There 
were no changes to the interests of the Directors in the ordinary 
shares of the Company in the period from 1 January 2018 to  
21 March 2018, being the last practicable date that the Company 
is able to report on Directors’ interests.

Statutory information and 
Directors’ statements
Memorandum and Articles of Association 
The Company’s Memorandum of 
Association sets out the objectives and 
powers of the Company . The Articles of 
Association detail the rights attaching to 
each share class, the method by which 
the Company’s shares can be purchased 
or re-issued and the provisions which 
apply to the holding of and voting at 
general meetings. The Articles also 
set out the rules relating to Directors 
(including by way of example, their 
appointment, election, retirement, duties 
and powers).  
Capital structure and corporate 
authorities
Details of the authorised and issued 
share capital together with details of 
movements in share capital during the 
year are included in Note 24 to the 
financial statements. The Company has 
one class of shares in issue, ordinary 
shares of 5 pence each, all of which are 
fully paid. Each ordinary share in issue 
carries equal rights including one vote 
per share on a poll at general meetings of 
the Company, subject to the terms of the 
Articles and applicable laws. There are no 
restrictions on the transfer of shares.
Details of the Company’s employee share 
schemes are disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report 64 and in Note 8 
to the financial statements.
The awards under the Lamprell plc Free 
Share Award Plan, Retention Share Plan 
and Long-Term Incentive Plan are granted 
at nil price.
Pursuant to the Company’s share 
schemes, the Employee Benefit Trust as 
at the year-end, held a total of 16,268 
(2016: 16,268) ordinary shares of 5p, 
representing less than 0.01% (2016: 
0.01%) of the issued share capital. The 
voting rights attaching to these shares 
cannot be exercised directly by the 
employees, but can be exercised by 
the trustees. However , in line with good 
practice, the trustees do not exercise 
these voting rights. In the event of another 
company taking control of the Company, 
the employee share schemes operated 
by the Company have set change of 
control provisions. In short, awards may, 
in certain circumstances and approved 
proportions, be allowed to vest early or to 
be exchanged for awards of equivalent 
value in the acquiring company .
The Company was given authority at the 
2017 AGM to make market purchases of 
up to 33,000,000 ordinary shares of 5p, 
which represented approximately 10% 
of the Company’s then issued ordinary 
share capital. This authority will expire 
at the 2018 AGM, where approval from 
shareholders will be sought to renew the 
authority for approximately 10% of the 
Company’s current issued ordinary share 
capital.
Approval from shareholders will be 
sought to authorise the Directors 
to allot the unissued shares up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £4,900,000, 
representing approximately 30% of 
the Company’s current issued ordinary 
share capital (excluding treasury shares) 
to existing shareholders and to issue 
equity securities of the Company for 
cash to persons other than existing 
shareholders, other than in connection 
with existing exemptions contained in the 
Articles or with a rights, scrip dividend, 
or other similar issue, up to an aggregate 
nominal value of £825,000 representing 
approximately 5% of the current 
issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company . Authorities were given by the 
shareholders at the 2017 AGM to issue

Contracts of significance
In 2017, the Group entered into a joint 
venture agreement for the establishment 
of a major new maritime yard in Saudi 
Arabia 11. This agreement commits the 
Company to invest up to USD 140 million 
into this new yard (subject to satisfaction 
of conditions precedent) over the course 
of the coming 5-6 years and includes 
certain provisions which may impact 
the Company’s fair market value upon a 
change of control in the Company . Details 
are available on the Company’s website 
and were approved by shareholders at 
the EGM in June 2017 47. Except for 
this joint venture agreement, the debt 
facility agreements which were concluded 
in 2014 and the Controlling Shareholder 
Agreement 49, the Company or Group 
does not have contractual or other 
arrangements which are significant to its 
business with any person.
Directors’ responsibility statements
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year . Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare the 
financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial statements 
are required by law to give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• state that the financial statements 
comply with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue 
in business. 
The Directors confirm that they have 
complied with the above requirements in 
preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company and the Group’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Isle of Man 
Companies Acts 1931 to 2004. They 
are also responsible for the system of 
internal control, for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the Isle of Man governing 
the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 72
Corporate governance
Statutory information and 
Directors’ statements
In accordance with the principles of 
the Code, the Group has arrangements 
in place to ensure that the information 
presented in this Annual Report is fair , 
balanced and understandable. The 
Audit and Risk Committee oversees the 
implementation of this approach. The 
Directors consider , on the advice of the 
Audit and Risk Committee, that the Annual 
Report, taken as a whole, is fair , balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy .
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed 39, confirms that, to 
the best of his/her knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report includes a 
fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.
As far as each Director is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware. In 
addition, each Director has taken all the 
steps that he/she ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make him/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
Going concern and Viability Statement
The Company’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance 
and position are set out in the Strategic 
Report 8. The financial position of 
the Company, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial Review 20. 
The Company’s consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis. After reviewing its 
cash flow forecasts for a period of not 
less than 12 months from the date of 
signing these financial statements, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. The 
Directors have concluded therefore that 
it is appropriate for the Group to continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing its financial statements. The 
financial information has been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, 
except as disclosed in the accounting 
policies below. 
The Directors’ Viability Statement and 
accompanying basis of assessment can 
be found in the Strategic Report 37.

AUDITOR’S REPORT
to the members of Lamprell plc 
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the  
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the  
year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Isle of Man Companies Act 
1931-2004 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Lamprell plc  
(the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’)  
which comprise:
• the consolidated income statement;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of changes 
in equity;
• the consolidated cash flow statement;
• the statement of accounting policies; and
• the related Notes 1 to 37.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial  
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 74
Financial statements
Independent Auditor’s  
Report
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Recoverability of non-current assets: Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) and 
intangibles; and
• Estimation of project costs and revenue recognition, most notably in respect of the 
East Anglia One project.
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with  and any key audit 
matters which are the same as the prior year identified with .
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was USD 4.6 million  
(2016: USD 3.4 million) which was determined as 1% of net assets. 
Scoping We performed a full scope audit of the consolidated Lamprell Group, covering 100% of 
the Group’s net assets and 100% of revenue. 
Significant changes in our approach Previously we identified a key audit matter relating to goodwill; this was fully written off in 
the year ended 31 December 2016. 
Due to the expected low levels of activity in 2018 and ongoing market downturn,  
we identified a key audit matter in the current year relating to the recoverability of other 
non-current assets.
As noted above, we determined materiality with reference to net assets. This is a change 
from the prior year where we used adjusted profit before taxation.
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in Note 2 to the financial statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s 
and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the 
statement is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were 
consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the 
knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and 
the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether 
we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on page 34 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation on page 34 that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 37 as to how they have assessed the prospects of 
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to 
be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects 
of the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Recoverability of non-current assets: PP&E and Intangibles 
Key audit matter 
description
The Group has property, plant and equipment ‘PP&E’ with a carrying amount of USD 171.7 million  
(Note 16) and intangible assets of USD 31.7 million (Note 17) as at 31 December 2017. Due to the 
expected low levels of activity in 2018 and ongoing market downturn, the Group identified impairment 
indicators for these non-current assets. Management performed an impairment assessment as at  
31 December 2017, in accordance with IAS 36.
As disclosed in Note 17 the recoverability of non-current assets is driven by management’s assumptions 
over expected business activity , including the anticipated timing and value of future contract awards, 
assumptions over the forecast contract margin, discount rate, terminal growth rate and yard capacity . 
The Group’s accounting policy for impairment of non-financial assets is included in Note 2.22 in the 
summary of significant accounting policies. The assessment of the recoverability of non-current assets 
requires management to exercise judgement as described in the “critical accounting judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty” section of the Annual Report in Note 4 and the “significant 
judgements” section in the Audit & Risk Committee report on page 55.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
Our audit work assessed the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions in preparation of the 
PP&E and intangibles impairment assessment. Specifically, our work included, but was not limited to, 
the following procedures:
• an assessment of the design and implementation of relevant controls over the preparation of the 
PP&E and intangibles impairment assessment;
• benchmarking and analysis of revenue growth assumptions against market data and analyst 
forecasts;
• benchmarking of the discount rate, the terminal growth rate applied and review of management’s 
cash flow model with involvement from our valuation specialists and recalculation of the recoverable 
amount of PP&E and intangibles;
• evaluating management’s historical forecasting accuracy, specifically including revenue, gross profit 
margins and overheads;
• agreement of estimated new contract awards to tender requests or enquiries received where 
applicable;
• review of the forecast revenue and the yard capacity required to deliver this forecast revenue to 
assess the potential impact on the currently mothballed Sharjah Yard, mothballed operational assets 
and challenging the operational capacity to deliver forecast revenue;
• verification of estimated future costs by agreement to approved budgets and where applicable,  
third party data; and 
• assessment of any evidence contradictory to management’s assumptions.
Key observations We are satisfied that the recoverability of non-current assets has been assessed in accordance with the 
requirements of IAS 36: Impairment of Assets.  76

Independent Auditor’s  
Report
Estimation of project costs and revenue recognition 
Key audit matter 
description
The Group’s operations are characterised by contract risk with significant judgements involved in the 
assessment of both current and future contract financial performance.
The Group’s accounting policy for revenue recognition is included in Note 2.2(a) in the “summary of 
significant accounting policies”.
Revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of individual contracts, calculated on the 
proportion of total costs at the reporting date compared to the estimated total costs of the contract.
The status of contracts is updated on a regular basis. In doing so, management are required to 
exercise significant judgement in their assessment of the valuation of contract variations, claims and 
liquidated damages (revenue items); the completeness and accuracy of forecast costs to complete; 
and the ability to deliver contracts within forecast timescales.
Management is required to forecast expected total costs to complete projects, based on professional 
judgement and historical experience. This drives the calculation of percentage of completion and 
ultimately revenue recognition. In light of the inherent judgement in estimating future contract costs, 
there is a risk around the completeness and accuracy of the forecast costs, and consequently the 
recognition of revenue.
Furthermore, there is a risk around the timing and valuation in recognition of variation orders and 
variable revenue. In the current year the Group encountered major operational challenges on the  
East Anglia One project which resulted in a significant loss for the Group (USD 80.4 million). The most 
significant project judgement included in the recognised loss is in respect of potential liquidated 
damages on the East Anglia One project as disclosed in Note 4 and the ability of the Group’s 
subcontractor to deliver on time and in accordance with the project’s revised delivery dates.
The assessment of revenue recognition requires management to exercise judgement as described in 
the “critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty” section of the Annual 
Report in Note 4 and the “significant judgements” section in the Audit & Risk Committee report on  
page 55. Management’s assessment requires an estimation of the total cost to complete each project, 
and the Group’s right to revenue as a result of variation orders and claims. Management has included 
the impact of sensitivity to the costs to complete in Note 4.2 as a key source of estimation uncertainty .
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
Our work on the recognition of contract revenue, contract costs, margin and related receivables and 
liabilities included:
• an assessment of the design and implementation of relevant controls over the recognition of contract 
revenue, contract costs and forecast margin;
• meeting with operational project management to understand contract performance;
• selecting a sample of contracts based on qualitative and quantitative factors in order to challenge 
both current and future financial performance on the most significant and more complex contract 
positions. For sampled contracts, we challenged management’s key judgements inherent in 
the forecast revenue and costs to complete that drive the accounting under the percentage of 
completion method, including the following procedures:
• reviewing the contract terms and conditions by reference to contract documentation;
• testing the valuation of claims and variations both within forecast contract revenue and forecast 
contract costs via inspection of customers’ instructions and contracts with customers and the 
supply chain;
• reviewing insurance experts’ reports received on contentious matters;
• testing the forecast costs by agreeing a sample of forecast costs to subcontractor agreements 
and through interviews with commercial and operational management to assess the impact of any 
commercial and operational risk on the cost estimates;
• assessing the ability to deliver contracts within budgeted timescales and any exposures to 
liquidated damages for late delivery of contract works; 
• Involvement of our internal engineers and quantity surveyor specialists to review the East Anglia 
One contract to assess the specific contractual and commercial risks and then to determine 
the reasonableness of the completeness and accuracy of the management forecast and 
assessments of these risks in the project cost estimates;
• Reviewing of key contractual terms around delivery dates and any contractual milestone dates 
and the terms for liquidated damages under the contract;
• Reviewing the actual achievement of the contractual delivery dates or milestone dates against 
the contractual dates to assess the exposure to liquidated damages; Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
77
Estimation of project costs and revenue recognition (continued) 
 
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter 
(continued)
• reviewing post-balance sheet contract performance to challenge year end judgements.
• assessing the recoverability of related receivables, including testing of post year end cash receipts, 
and completeness and validity of any contract loss provisions through completion of the above 
procedures; and
• on the East Anglia One project, understanding the basis for and obtaining evidence in respect of 
management’s judgement that the maximum potential exposure of USD 33.8 million of LDs that could 
be levied under the contract have been reduced through ongoing work with their client and their 
subcontractor to meet revised key delivery dates, as explained in the key judgement Note 4.
Key observations Management have made certain judgements in relation to estimated project revenue, estimated  
project costs and the estimated margins recognised on projects including the significant loss making 
project, East Anglia One. Based on audit work performed we are satisfied that that the estimation  
of project costs, project margins and the recognition of revenue are appropriate and in accordance 
with IAS 11: Construction contracts.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit 
work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Materiality Group: USD 4.6 million (2016: USD 3.4 million). 
Parent company: USD 4.4 million (2016: USD 3.2 million).
Basis for determining materiality The Group materiality that we used in the current year was determined as 1% of net 
assets. This is a change from the prior year where we determined materiality based  
on adjusted forecast profit before taxation.
The parent company materiality was determined as 1% of net assets and then has 
been capped at 95% Group materiality .
Rationale for the benchmark applied Given the volatility in the Group’s performance, we considered a number of 
performance and asset measures and determined that a net asset measure  
provided a stable basis and the most appropriate reflection of the size of the  
Group’s operations. Our determined Group materiality is equivalent to 1.2% of 
Revenue and 4.7% of the Group’s loss before tax.
Parent company materiality was determined using net assets on the basis that it acts 
as a holding company for the Group.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of USD 230,400  
(2016: USD 168,000) for the Group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation  
of the financial statements.  
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement at the Group level. 
We performed a full scope audit of the Group’s operations which is primarily in the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) and comprises  
100% of the Group’s net assets and 100% of revenue. 
The Group team was responsible for the work performed on the components. The Group team also tested the consolidation process. 
We have obtained an understanding of the Group’s system of internal controls and undertaken a combination of procedures, all of 
which are designed to target the Group’s identified risks of material misstatement in the most effective manner possible.  78
Financial statements
Independent Auditor’s  
Report
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except 
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we 
are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected 
material misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair , balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that 
they consider the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is 
fair , balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee 
does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; 
or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – 
the parts of the directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to 
the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing 
provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect  
of these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error .
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error , and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 15 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 
1982. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Opinions on other matter prescribed by our engagement letter
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied to the company .
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Isle of Man Companies Act 1931 to 2004 we are required to report in respect 
of the following matters if, in our opinion:
• proper books of account have not been kept by the company and that proper returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the books of account and returns; 
or
• we have not received all the information and explanations which to the best of our 
knowledge and belief, are necessary for the purpose of our audit.
We have nothing to report in respect  
of these matters.
Directors’ loans and remuneration
Under the Isle of Man Companies Act 1931 to 2004 we are required to report in respect 
of the following matter if, in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ loans and 
remuneration specified by law are not been complied with.
We have nothing to report in respect  
of this matter.

2  Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated and parent company financial statements  
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the financial statements of the parent company have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and the Isle of Man 
Companies Acts 1931 to 2004. In accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982, the Company has not 
presented its own statement of comprehensive income. 
After reviewing its cash flow forecasts for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of signing of these financial statements, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Therefore, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting  
polices below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also  
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving  
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated and  
parent company financial statements, are disclosed in Note 4.
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group 
IAS 7 (amendments), ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ to ‘disclosure initiative’, these disclosures enable the users of financial statements to 
evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. 
Consistent with the transition provisions of the amendments, the Group has not disclosed comparative information for the prior period. 
Apart from the additional disclosure in Borrowings (Note 30), the application of these amendments has had no impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. 
IAS 12 (amendments), ‘Income Taxes’ – Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses, the amendments clarify how 
an entity should evaluate whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which it can utilise a deductible temporary 
difference. The application of these amendments has had no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements as the Group 
has no deductible temporary differences on assets that are in the scope of amendments.
IFRS 12 (amendments), Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities, clarifies that an entity need not provide summarised financial 
information for interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that are classified (or included in a disposal group that is 
classified) as held for sale. The amendments clarify that this is the only concession from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 12  
for such interests. The application of these amendments has had no effect on the Group’s consolidated financial statements as the 
Group has no interest classified, as held for sale. 
(b)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017  
and not early adopted
IFRS 2 (amendments), ‘Share-based Payment’ – Classification and Measurement of Transactions, addresses three main areas:  
the effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction; the classification of a  
share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for withholding tax obligations; and accounting where a modification  
to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled.  
On adoption, entities are required to apply the amendments without restating prior periods, but retrospective application is permitted  
if elected for all three amendments and other criteria are met. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2018, with early application permitted. The Group does not anticipate that application of the amendments in future will have 
a material impact as it does not have any cash-settled share-based arrangements.
IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial  
liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification 
and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary 
measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and fair value 
through P&L. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable 
option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that 
replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities, there were no changes to classification and 
measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair 
value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness 
tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same 
as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different 
to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.  
Early adoption is permitted.  90

and not early adopted continued
IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ continued
Impact assessment of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
Based on an analysis of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 December 2017 on the basis of the facts  
and circumstances that exist at that date, the management have assessed the impact of IFRS 9 to the Group’s financial statements  
as follows:
Classification and measurement:
All financial assets and financial liabilities will continue to be measured on the same basis as is currently adopted under IAS 39.
Impairment:
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables (Note 15) and amounts due from customer under construction contracts (Note 21) 
will be subject to the impairment provisions of IFRS 9.
The Group expects to apply the simplified approach to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for its trade receivables, due 
from related parties and amounts due from customer under construction contracts as required or permitted by IFRS 9. In general, 
management anticipate that the application of the expected credit loss model of IFRS 9 will result in earlier recognition of credit losses 
for the respective items and will increase the amount of loss allowance recognised for these items.
Hedge accounting:
Existing hedge relationships (Note 27) would appear to qualify as continuing hedge relationships upon adoption of the new standard.
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from 
an entity’s contracts with customers. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer 
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in 
exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has 
the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the goods or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 
‘Construction Contracts’ and related interpretations. The Group intends to adopt these amendments no later than the accounting 
period beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Impact assessment of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
Based on analysis of the Group’s revenues from contracts with customers as at 31 December 2017, management of the Group has 
assessed the impact of IFRS 15 to the Group’s financial statements as follows:
• Contract revenue
The Group provides lump-sum fabrication and engineering services to the oil & gas and renewable energy industry . Currently,  
the Group accounts for the lump-sum construction contracts as a single performance obligation and recognises the contract 
revenue by reference to the stage of completion on the overall contract (see current revenue recognition policies on Note 2.2).
Management has assessed the construction contracts and considered IFRS 15’s guidance on contract combinations, contract 
modifications arising from variation orders, variable consideration, and the assessment of whether there is a significant financing 
component in the contracts, particularly taking into account the reason for the difference in timing between the transfer of control 
of goods and services to the customer and the timing of the related payments. Management has assessed that revenue from 
these construction contracts should be recognised over time and the input method currently used to measure the progress 
towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations will continue to be appropriate under IFRS 15.
• Variable consideration 
Currently, the Group recognises revenue from the construction contracts measured based on the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable, net of any allowances. If revenue cannot be reliably measured, the Group defers revenue recognition 
until the uncertainty is resolved. Such provisions give rise to variable consideration under IFRS 15, and will be required to be 
estimated at contract inception.
IFRS 15 requires the estimated variable consideration to be constrained to prevent over-recognition of revenue. The Group 
continues to assess individual contracts to determine the estimated variable consideration and related constraint. As the current 
major contracts are at an advanced stage of negotiation and in our view would meet the requirements of the constraint, we do 
not anticipate, based on our current knowledge, there to be any variable consideration that could materially affect the revenue 
recognised to date.
• Warranty obligations 
The Group generally offers a one year warranty for defects on work carried out and does not provide extended warranties  
or maintenance services in its contracts with customers. Management estimates the related provision for future warranty claims 
based on historical warranty claim information, as well as recent trends that might suggest that past cost information may differ 
from future claims. These costs are included in estimated contract costs. As such, the Group expects that such warranties will be 
assurance-type warranties which will continue to be accounted for under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets consistent with its current practice. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

(b)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017  
and not early adopted continued
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ continued
Conclusion 
Other than providing more extensive disclosures on the Group’s revenue transactions, management do not anticipate that the 
application of IFRS 15 will have a significant impact on the financial position and/or financial performance of the Group.
Management intends to use the modified transition approach as permitted by IFRS 15. Therefore, the cumulative impact of any 
required adjustments at the date of initial application, though not expected to be significant, will be recognised in 2018 without 
restating comparatives. 
IFRS 16, ‘Leases’, specifies how an IFRS reporter will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides  
a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months 
or less or the underlying asset has a low value. Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16’s approach  
to lessor accounting substantially unchanged from its predecessor , IAS 17.
Impact assessment of IFRS 16 Leases
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of USD 109.4 million. IAS 17 does not require 
the recognition of any right-of-use asset or liability for future payments for these leases; instead, certain information is disclosed as 
operating lease commitments in Note 34. 
A preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16, and hence the  
Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability in respect of all these leases unless they qualify for low value  
or short-term leases upon the application of IFRS 16. 
The new requirement to recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability is expected to have a significant impact on the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and the Directors are currently assessing its potential impact. It is not 
practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until the Directors complete the review.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 17, ‘Insurance Contracts’, replaces IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’ and covers recognition and measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of all types of insurance contracts. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. 
The standard is not applicable to the Group as it pertains to insurance companies.
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments), deal with situations where there is a sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its 
associate or joint venture. The amendments state that the gains or losses resulting from the loss of control of a subsidiary that does  
not contain a business in a transaction with an associate or joint venture that is accounted for using the equity method are recognised 
in the parent’s profit or loss to the extent of the unrelated investors interest. The effective date of the amendment has yet to be set by 
the IASB. The Group does not anticipate the amendments will have a material impact.
IAS 40 (amendments), ‘Investment property’ regarding transfers of Investment Property, clarify that transfers to, or from, investment 
property can only be made if there has been a change in use that is supported by evidence. The amendment is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Application of these amendments will have no impact on the Group as it does not have 
investment property . 
IFRIC 22, ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration’, addresses how to determine the date of transaction for the 
purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of an asset, expense or income when consideration for the item 
is paid or received in advance in foreign currency which resulted in recognition of a non-monetary asset or liability . The interpretation 
specifies the date of transaction is the date on which the receipt is initially recognised. The interpretation is effective for annual periods 
beginning 1 January 2018 and the Group does not anticipate this will have an impact as it currently accounts for such transactions  
in a way consistent with the amendments.
2.2 Revenue recognition
(a) Contract revenue
Contract revenue is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work 
performed to total estimated costs. When the contract is at an early stage and its outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is 
recognised to the extent of costs incurred up to the year end which are considered recoverable. 
For contracts as to which the Group is unable to estimate the final profitability due to their uncommon nature, including first-of-a-kind 
projects, the Group recognise equal amounts of revenue and cost until the final results can be estimated more precisely . For these 
contracts, the Group only recognise gross margin when reliably estimable and the level of uncertainty has been significantly reduced. 
With respect to fixed price construction contracts with an expected contract duration of 18 months or greater , the Group generally 
determine this when the contract has progressed to 20% based on the total estimated cost of the contract.
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it is probable that the customer will approve the variation and the amount of 
revenue arising from the variation can be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is probable 
that the customer will accept the claim and the amount can be measured reliably .
Losses on contracts are assessed on an individual contract basis and provision is made for the full amount of the anticipated losses, 
including any losses relating to future work on a contract, in the period in which the loss is first foreseen. 92

2  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.2 Revenue recognition continued
(a) Contract revenue continued
The aggregate of the costs incurred and the profit/loss recognised on each contract is compared against progress billings at the  
year end. Where the sum of the costs incurred and recognised profit or recognised loss exceeds the progress billings, the balance  
is shown under trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts. Where the progress billings exceed the sum of 
costs incurred and recognised profit or recognised loss, the balance is shown under trade and other payables as amounts due to 
customers on contracts.
In determining contract costs incurred up to the year end, any amounts incurred, including advances paid to suppliers and  
advance billings received from subcontractors relating to future activity on a contract, are excluded and are presented as contract 
work-in-progress.
(b) Products and services 
Revenue from sale of products and services is recognised in the accounting period in which the risks and rewards are transferred  
or the service is rendered net of value added tax. 
(c) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest rate method.
Refer to Note 2.1(b) for a statement on the impact of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with customers’. 
2.3 Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the 
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity . Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They 
are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owner of the acquiree and 
the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from 
a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group 
recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share  
of the recognised amount of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The excess of the consideration transferred over the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair 
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, 
the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Business combinations involving entities 
under common control do not fall within the scope of IFRS 3. Consequently, the Directors have a responsibility to determine a suitable 
accounting policy . The Directors have decided to follow the uniting of interests’ method to account for business combinations involving 
entities under common control.
Under the uniting of interest method, there is no requirement to fair value the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities and hence 
no goodwill is recorded as balances remain at book value. Consolidated financial statements include the profit or loss and cash flows 
for the entire year (pre- and post-merger) as if the subsidiary had always been part of the Group. The aim is to show the combination 
as if it had always been combined.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have 
been changed or adjustments have been made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, where necessary, to ensure consistency 
with the policies adopted by the Group.
(b) Disposal of subsidiaries
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is 
lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purpose of 
subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of related 
asset or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(c) Joint arrangements
The Group has applied IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either 
joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor . The Company has assessed the 
nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. 
Under the equity method of accounting, interest in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise 
the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses in the consolidated income statement. When the Group’s share of losses in 
a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interest that, in substance, forms part 
of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the joint ventures. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
93
2  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.3 Consolidation continued
(d) Associates 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding  
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to 
recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates 
includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement, and its share of post-
acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income  
with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. 
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured 
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments  
on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is  
impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount  
of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of an associate’ in the 
consolidated income statement.
2.4 Investment in subsidiaries
In the Company’s separate financial statements, the investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost less provision for impairment.  
Cost is the amount of cash paid or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the investment. Income from such investments  
is recognised as dividend in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.5 Foreign currency translation 
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The Group’s activities are primarily carried out from the UAE, 
whose currency, the UAE Dirham, is pegged to the United States Dollar (“USD”) and is the functional currency of all the entities in the 
Group (except MISCLP whose functional currency is Omani Riyal, MISQWLL whose functional currency is Qatari Riyal, LAK whose 
functional currency is Kazakh Tenge, LIN whose functional currency is Euro, LSAC whose functional currency is Saudi Riyal and for 
EBT and LUK whose functional currency is the Great British Pound). The consolidated and parent company financial statements are 
presented in US Dollars. 
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at  
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement, except when deferred into other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated income statement 
within ‘finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the consolidated income statement 
within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have  
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
• assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
• income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates for the year; and
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, are taken to other 
comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity 
are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the gain or loss on sale. 94
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements
2  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.6 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment is the 
purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 
expected useful economic lives of the assets as follows:
Years
Buildings and infrastructure 3 – 25
Operating equipment 3 – 20
Fixtures and office equipment 3 – 5
Motor vehicles 5
The assets’ residual values, if significant, and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. This 
review indicated that the actual lives of certain operating equipment were longer than the estimated useful lives used for depreciation 
purposes in the Group’s financial statements. As a result, effective 1 January 2017, the Group changed its estimates of the useful lives 
of its operating equipment to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. The estimated useful 
lives of the operating equipment that previously averaged 3 – 15 years were increased to an average of 3 – 20 years. The effect of this 
change in estimate was to reduce 2017 depreciation expense and net loss by USD 1.4 million.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably . All repairs and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they  
are incurred.
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. When commissioned, capital work-in-progress is transferred to property, plant and 
equipment and depreciated in accordance with Group policies.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount (Note 2.22). 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within  
‘other gains/(losses) – net’ in the consolidated income statement.
2.7 Intangible assets
(a) Trade name
A trade name acquired as part of a business combination is capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of 
acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably . Amortisation  
is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over its estimated useful life. The useful life of a trade 
name is reviewed on an annual basis. 
(b) Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the 
date of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably . 
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life. The useful  
life of customer relationships is reviewed on an annual basis.
(c) Operating lease rights
Intangible assets representing operating leasehold rights are carried at cost (being the fair value on the date of acquisition where 
intangibles are acquired in a business combination) less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any . Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the leasehold right over its estimated useful life. 
(d) Computer software
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs.  
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs 
previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Computer software development  
costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives. 
(e) Work-in-progress
Work-in-progress pertains to assets in the course of development and stated at cost. When commissioned, work-in-progress is 
transferred to intangible assets in accordance with Group policies.
2.8 Inventories
Inventories comprise raw materials, finished goods, work-in-progress and consumables which are stated at the lower of cost  
and estimated net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average basis and comprises direct purchase, direct  
labour and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
95
2  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.9 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts receivable from customers for billing in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one 
year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. Trade receivables are recognised 
initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.  
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor , probability that 
the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the 
trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in 
the consolidated income statement within ‘general and administrative expenses’. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written 
off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
‘general and administrative expenses’ in the consolidated income statement.
2.10 Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current 
liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.
2.11 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate of the amount  
of the obligation can be made. 
2.12 Employee benefits
(a) Provision for staff benefits 
A provision is made for the estimated liability for performance related bonus and employees’ entitlements to annual leave and air fare 
as a result of services rendered by the employees up to the balance sheet date. This provision is disclosed as a current liability and 
included in trade and other payables.
Labour laws in the countries in which the Group operates require the Group to provide for other long-term employment benefits. 
Provision is made, using actuarial techniques, for the end of service benefits due to employees, for their periods of service up to the 
balance sheet date. The provision relating to end of service benefits is disclosed as a non-current liability . Actuarial gains and losses 
arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they arise. The current service cost and interest cost is recognised in the income statement in 
‘Employees’ end of service benefits’.
(b) Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received 
in exchange for the grant of the shares/options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period 
is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares/options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions 
(for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
shares/options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of shares/options 
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.
The Company has granted rights to its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary companies conditional upon the completion 
of continuing service with the Group for a specified period. The total amount of the grant over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted and is recognised in each period as an increase in the investment in the 
subsidiary with a corresponding credit to retained earnings. 
In the separate financial statements of the subsidiary, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant  
of the equity instruments of the Company is recognised as an expense with a corresponding credit to equity .
2.13 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the consolidated 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Refer to Note 2.1(b) for a statement on the impact of IFRS 16, Leases. 
2.14 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current accounts with banks less margin deposits, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturity of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities on the balance sheet. 96

2.15 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the repayment value is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. The Group capitalises general and specific 
borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that 
asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised in consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan. The fee is capitalised and amortised 
over the period of the facility to which it relates. 
2.16 Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the Group’s consolidated and parent company financial statements in the period 
in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders.
2.17 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker . 
The chief operating decision-maker , who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors that makes strategic decisions. 
2.18 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity . In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively . 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes 
provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However , deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if 
they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss. 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred income tax 
liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.19 Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables. 
Currently, the Group does not have any available-for-sale and held-to-maturity financial assets. The classification depends on the 
purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. 
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category 
if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are 
designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in 
the consolidated income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have 
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ category are presented 
in the consolidated income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’ in the period in which they arise. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2.19 Financial assets continued
(b) Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as 
non-current assets. 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade receivables (Note 2.9), other receivables (excluding prepayments), receivables 
from a related party and cash and cash equivalents (Note 2.14) in the consolidated balance sheet and amounts due from related 
parties (Note 23), other receivables and cash at bank (Note 22) in the Company balance sheet.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost less 
provision for impairment. The amortised cost is computed using the effective interest method. 
Loans and receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the counterparty have expired or have been 
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of the ownership.
(c) Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial 
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is 
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss 
event”) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial 
assets that can be reliably estimated.
Refer to Note 2.1(b) for a statement on the impact of IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’.
2.20 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at 
their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability , or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as 
its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, 
both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective 
in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in 
the consolidated income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur , the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in equity is immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 27. The full fair value of a hedging 
derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current 
asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income 
statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the item affects profit or loss (for example, when 
the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’. However , when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset (for example, contracts work-in-progress or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity 
are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately 
recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of contracts work in progress or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.
2.21 Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations is a component of the Group’s business that has been disposed of, or meets the criteria to be classified  
as held for sale. Discontinued operations are presented on the consolidated income statement as a separate line and are shown  
net of tax.
2.22 Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.  
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash 
flows (cash generating units). Non-financial assets are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.  
Any impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement and separately disclosed. 98

financial statements
2  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.23 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity . Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown  
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The excess of proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs over the par value of the shares are credited to the share premium.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including  
any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity  
holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net 
of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
2.24 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Material transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include write 
downs or impairments of assets including goodwill, restructuring costs or provisions and litigation settlements. See Note 33 for full 
details of exceptional items.
3 Financial risk management 
3.1 Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange and cash flow interest rate risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis to assess and manage critical exposures. 
The Group’s liquidity and market risks are managed as part of the Group’s treasury activities. Treasury operations are conducted 
within a framework of established policies and procedures. 
(a) Market risk – foreign exchange risk
The Group has foreign exchange risk primarily with respect to balances in Euro, Great British Pound, Norwegian Kroner and Saudi 
Riyal with certain suppliers. During the year ended 31 December 2017, if foreign exchange rates on foreign balances had been 10% 
higher/lower , the exchange difference would have been higher/lower by USD 0.2 million (2016: USD 0.1 million).
(b) Market risk – cash flow interest rate risk
The Group holds its surplus funds in short-term bank deposits. During the year ended 31 December 2017, if interest rates on deposits 
had been 0.5% higher/lower , the interest income would have been higher/lower by USD 1.2 million (2016: USD 1.0 million).
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest 
rate risk which is covered by taking fixed interest rate swaps against the variable rates. Under these swaps, the Group agrees with 
other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts 
calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts. During the year ended 31 December 2017, if interest rates on 
borrowings had been 0.5% higher/lower , the interest expense would have been higher/lower by USD 0.3 million (2016: USD 0.4 
million).
(c) Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is detailed in Notes 15, 21, 22 and 27. The Group has a policy for dealing with customers with  
an appropriate credit history . The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution. 
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks, financial assets 
carried at fair value through profit or loss, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments. The Group has a 
formal procedure of monitoring and follow up of customers for outstanding receivables. For banks and financial institutions, only 
independently rated parties with the equivalent of investment grade and above are accepted unless if the bank is situated in a frontier 
market where minimal balances are held. The Group assesses internally the credit quality of each customer , taking into account its 
financial position, past experience and other factors.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had a concentration of credit risk with nine of its largest customer balances accounting for 62% 
(2016: 86%) of trade receivables outstanding at that date. Management believes that this concentration of credit risk is mitigated 
as the Group conducts credit checks internally and through expert third party providers for new counterparties or in support of 
major contracts, payment terms under contract are carefully managed and protection against non-payment is built into contractual 
documentation to ensure the Group has a right to remedy in the event of delayed/non-payment.   Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

(d) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of 
committed credit facilities. The Group is currently financed from shareholders’ equity and borrowings. 
The Group’s liquidity risk on derivative financial instruments is disclosed in Note 27.

3.2 Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, or issue new 
shares to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is 
calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the balance sheet) less cash and bank 
balances. Total capital is calculated as “equity” as shown in the balance sheet plus net debt. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group has no net debt and was therefore un-geared.
3.3 Fair value estimation
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined  
as follows:
(a) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
(b) Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability , either directly (that is,  
as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and
(c) Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These 
valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific 
estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or 
more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. 
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
(a) Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments; and
(b) Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
4  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The Group makes judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning the future. These are continually evaluated and are based 
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
4.1 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
Apart from those involving estimation (see Note 4.2), the Group has made following critical judgements in applying accounting policies 
in the process of preparing these consolidated financial statements. 
4.1.1 Provisions for liquidated damages claims (LDs)
The Group provides for liquidated damages where there have been significant delays against defined contractual delivery dates 
or contractual milestones and it is considered probable that the customer will successfully pursue these penalties. This requires 
management to estimate the amount of liquidated damages payable under the contract based on a combination of an assessment 
of the contractual terms, the reasons for any delays and evidence of cause of the delays to assess who is liable under the contract 
for the delays and consequently whether the Group is liable for the liquidated damages or not. Furthermore, there is an assessment 
by management of any liquidated damages which can be recovered against subcontractors or the supply chain due to late delivery 
against contractual delivery dates or milestones which are the direct cause of the delays under the contract with the customer and 
which the supply chain are liable for . Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
101
4  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
4.1 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies continued
4.1.1 Provisions for liquidated damages claims (LDs) continued
The Group experienced significant challenges on the East Anglia One (“EA1”) project and that caused the Group to incur additional 
costs as it worked to rectify the shortcomings – see page 26 and Note 4.2.2. While the Group is maintaining an overall delivery 
schedule for the client, certain key dates have been affected and are subject to ongoing discussions with the client with a view to 
determining the implications these might have on the overall project master programme.
In view of the above, management have made a significant judgement within the forecast loss calculation in ascertaining the extent  
to which liquidated damages will arise on the project. In making this judgement, management has considered the following:
• The outcome of ongoing  constructive discussions with our client regarding certain key delivery dates and how the delays to the 
progress of works can be mitigated without impacting any related contractors or any other project activity which minimises the risk 
of these related contractors pursuing liquidated damages against the client, which the client would in turn seek to recover; and
• The progress of the insurance claim related to the first shipment of the flat packs to our UK subcontractor and the possibility of 
reimbursement from the insurer .
Based on the discussions to date, management believe the risk of the full extent of LDs being levied has been mitigated and we 
continue to work with the client and the subcontractors to ensure the overall project master programme is not compromised due  
to the effect of our operational challenges in meeting certain key dates. The maximum potential exposure to the Group would amount 
to a reduction in contract revenue by USD 33.8 million.
4.2  Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the 
reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  
within the next financial year .
4.2.1 Revenue recognition
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its contract revenue. Use of the percentage-of-completion 
method requires the Group to estimate the stage of completion of the contract to date as a proportion of the total contract work to be 
performed in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2.2. As a result, the Group is required to estimate the total cost to 
completion of all outstanding projects at each period end. 
If the estimated total costs to completion of all outstanding projects were to decrease by 10%, this would result in amounts due from 
customers on contracts increasing by USD 6.4 million (2016: USD 3.8 million) or amounts due to customers on contract decreasing  
by USD 6.4 million (2016: USD 3.8 million). 
If the estimated total costs to completion of all outstanding projects were to increase by 10%, amounts due from customers on 
contracts would decrease by USD 19.7 million (2016: USD 6.9 million) or amounts due to customers on contracts would increase  
by USD 19.7 million (2016: USD 6.9 million).
4.2.2 Onerous contract provisions 
The Group provides for future losses on long-term contracts where it is considered probable that the contract costs are likely  
to exceed revenues in future years. Estimating these future losses involves a number of assumptions about the achievement  
of contract performance targets and the likely levels of future cost escalation over time. 
A provision of USD 41.7 million (2016: Nil) was held at 31 December 2017 relating to estimated losses to completion on the  
EA1 project. The estimated total losses at completion amount to USD 80.0 million (2016: USD Nil) and the additional costs on 
the project have been caused by a number of variable factors including investment in further unplanned staffing and equipment 
requirements, as well as significant additional shipping, subcontractor costs and an assessment by management on the full extent  
of LDs being levied. See Note 4.1.1 for key judgements on liquidated damages claims.
The application of a 10% sensitivity to management estimates of the total costs to completion on this project would result in  
provision for onerous contract included in other payables decreasing by USD 4.1 million (2016: Nil) if the total costs to complete  
are decreased by 10% and provision for onerous contract included in other payables increasing by USD 4.1 million (2016: USD Nil)  
if the total costs to completion increased by 10%.
4.2.3 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
The Group determines at the end of the reporting period whether there are indicators of impairment in the carrying amount of its 
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other financial assets. Where indicators exist, an impairment test is undertaken 
which requires management to estimate the recoverable amount of its assets which is initially based on its value in use. When 
necessary, fair value less costs of disposal is estimated. Management performs the review at the cash generating unit (“CGU”)  
relating to an operating segments’ assets located in a particular geography .
The market downturn has resulted in a decrease in bidding activities and a reduction in new project awards for the United Arab 
Emirates CGU. The estimate of future cash flows and terminal value growth rate for the CGU has been significantly affected by the 
current assumptions relating to market outlook, contract awards and margins.
Determining whether property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of value in use of 
the cash-generating unit and fair value of assets. The value in use calculation requires the estimation of future cash flows expected 
to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value of expected future cash flows. These 
calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period. 102

4.2  Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
4.2.3 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets continued
Revenue for the first three-year period and the revenue growth rate beyond the three-year period is determined based upon  
past performance and management expectations of future market development which includes various assumptions relating  
to market outlook, contract awards and contract margins. As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s pipeline amounts to USD 3.6 billion 
(2016: USD 2.5 billion) – see the strategic report page 5. 
The bid pipeline comprises a mixture of opportunities in the renewables and oil & gas market sectors and management have 
made various assumptions relating to the timing, expected values and the probable outcome of these prospective awards. These 
assumptions are based on medium-term forecasts for the global energy industry, macro-economic factors, opportunities and market 
insights obtained from bidding activities. A change in management assumptions relating to the bid pipeline and outlook could result 
in the property, plant and equipment and/or intangible assets being impaired. Refer to the strategic report on page 5 for a detailed 
discussion of the market pipeline and opportunities.
A discount rate of 10.00% (2016: 11.54%) is used to discount the pre-tax cash flow projections to the present value. In determining the 
appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the weighted average cost of capital employed, which takes into consideration the risk 
free rate of US treasury bonds with a long-term maturity period, the UAE inflation rate, the equity risk premium on the entities operating 
from the UAE, the Group’s beta and the cost of Group’s debt. The decrease in discount rate is attributable to a decrease in the risk 
free rate of US treasury bond and levered equity beta. The following are the key assumptions.
2017 2016
Revenue growth rate 0% 5%
Discount rate 10.00% 11.54%
Net profit rate 3% 3%
Terminal value growth rate 3% 2%
In determining the terminal value growth rate, the Group considers the long-term average CPI growth rate for the UAE which is 
estimated to be c.3% by the Economist Intelligence Unit (“EIU”). Although the forecast cash flows are USD based, the terminal value 
growth rate is within the UAE long-term forecasts and is considered to be more appropriate given the location of the business and 
factors driving revenue and long-term growth.
As a result of the above, no impairment has been recorded and the carrying amount of property , plant and equipment at 31 December 
2017 was USD 171.7 million (31 December 2016: USD 172.3 million). The carrying amount of intangible assets at 31 December 2017 
was USD 31.7 million (31 December 2016: USD 24.9 million). 
The headroom attributable to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as at 31 December 2017 is USD 131.1 million.
If the discount rate used were to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would be a reduction in the headroom 
of USD 24.2 million if the discount rate was to increase or an increase in the headroom by USD 27.8 million if the discount rate was to 
decrease. 
If the net profit as a percentage of revenue used were to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would  
be an increase of USD 48.1 million in the headroom if the net profit was to increase or there would be a reduction in the headroom  
of USD 48.1 million if the net profit was to decrease.
If the terminal value growth rate used were to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would be a reduction in 
the headroom of USD 18.6 million if the terminal value growth rate was lower or an increase in the headroom of USD 21.5 million if the 
terminal value growth rate was higher .
4.2.4 Provision for warranty
Warranty provisions are recognised in respect of assurance warranties provided in the normal course of business relating to contract 
performance. They are based on previous claims history and it is expected that most of the costs in respect of these provisions 
will be incurred over the next one to two years. For first-of-a-kind projects, management makes use of a number of assumptions in 
determining the provision for potential warranty claims based on the scope and nature of work, confidence gathered from inspections 
and quality control during project execution and previous claim history for projects that closely mirror the type of works involved.  
The application of a 10% sensitivity to management estimates of the provision for warranty claim would result in an increase in 
provision for warranty claims by USD 0.7 million or a decrease of USD 0.7 million. 
4.2.5 Carrying amount of inventory
Inventories comprise raw materials, finished goods, work-in-progress and consumables which are stated at the lower of cost and 
estimated net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated 
costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Determining these estimates involves use of assumptions 
pertaining to the expected realisable values of inventory in the current market. Based on the review performed at year end, no write 
down or reversal of previous write downs has been recognised (2016: write down of USD 2.0 million). The application of a 10% 
sensitivity to management estimates of the net realisable value of inventory would result in a reversal of the previous write down of 
USD 2.0 million if the net realisable value was higher or a decrease in inventory by USD 2.6 million if the net realisable value was lower .  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

5 Segment information 
The Group is organised into business units, which are the Group’s operating segments and are reported to the Board of Directors, the 
chief operating decision maker . These operating segments are aggregated into two reportable segments – ‘Fabrication & Engineering’ 
and ‘Services’ based on similar nature of the products and services, type of customer and economic characteristics. 
The Fabrication & Engineering segment contains business from New Build Jackup Rigs (“NBJR”), Modules, (“MOD”), Offshore 
Platforms (“OP”) and Oil and Gas Contracting Services (“OGCS”) excluding that from the Operations & Maintenance manpower 
business. The Services segment contains business from Operations & Maintenance, manpower supply and safety services.
NBJR derives its revenue from assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil & gas and renewables sectors; MOD derives 
its revenue from fabricating packaged, pre-assembled and modularised units and constructing accommodation and complex 
process modules for onshore downstream projects; OP derives its revenue from construction of complex living quarters, wellhead 
decks, topsides, jackets and other offshore fixed facilities; and OGCS derives its revenue from rig refurbishment, land rig services, 
engineering and construction. Operations and maintenance derives its revenue from manpower supply and ancillary services.

Retention share plan
The Company awarded shares to selected Directors, key management personnel and employees under the retention share plan that 
provides an entitlement to receive these shares at no cost. These retention shares are conditional on the Directors/key management 
personnel/employee completing a specified period of service (the vesting period). The awards do not entitle participants to dividend 
equivalents during the vesting period and some of the awards have a performance condition. The fair value of the share awards made 
under this plan is based on the share price at the date of the grant, less the value of the dividends foregone during the vesting period. 
The details of the shares granted under this scheme are as follows:

Executive share option plan
Share options are granted by the Company to certain employees under the executive share option plan. This option plan does not 
entitle the employees to dividends. These options have a vesting condition, are conditional on the employee completing three years 
of service (the vesting period) and hence the options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date and have a contracted 
option term of 10 years. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
The movement in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise price is as follows:

Performance share plan
The Company granted share awards to Directors, key management personnel and selected employees that give them an entitlement 
to receive a certain number of shares subject to the satisfaction of a performance target and continued employment. The performance 
target is assessed against financial metrics that may include relative or absolute total shareholder return, cumulative EBIDTA and end 
of period backlog. The fair value of the share awards made under this plan is based on the share price at the date of the grant less 
the value of the dividends foregone during the vesting period.

13 Earnings per share
(a) Basic
Basic earnings/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing the (loss)/profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and  
held as treasury shares (Note 24).
(b) Diluted
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. For the retention share awards, options under executive share option plan and 
performance share plan, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value 
(determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription 
rights attached to outstanding share awards/options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of 
shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share awards/options.

Trade name represents the expected future economic benefit to be derived from the continued use of the MIS trade name acquired 
through the acquisition of MIS. 
Leasehold rights represent a favourable operating right acquired upon the acquisition of MIS and existing leasehold rights in the books 
of MIS on acquisition of Rig Metals LLC in 2008. The value of the intangible assets has been determined by calculating the present 
value of the expected future economic benefits to arise from the favourable lease terms of 10 to 15 years. 
During the period, Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority completed the construction and installation of an electric mainline to the 
Group’s Hamriyah facility . The Group has right of use and the cost incurred by the Group of USD 8.7 million has been capitalised as 
an intangible asset and will be amortised over the remaining period of the leasehold rights of the facility . 
The Group amortises intangible assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods:

Leasehold rights 10 – 16

The Group carries out an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of intangible 
assets may not be recoverable. Management performs review at cash generating unit relating to fabrication and engineering segments 
assets located at United Arab Emirates.
Recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) has been determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations 
require the use of estimates. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by 
management covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth  
rate stated below. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates.  
The discount rate used is pre-tax and reflects the specific risks to the relevant cash generating unit.
The key assumptions, revenue growth rate, discount rate, net profit rate and terminal value growth rate used in the value-in-use 
calculations for the CGU is as follows:
2017 2016
Revenue growth rate¹ 0% 5%
Discount rate2 10% 11.54%
Net profit rate³ 3% 3%
Terminal value growth rate⁴ 3% 2%
1. Revenue growth rate for the first three-year period is based on the Group budget. Beyond this period, the growth rate is determined based upon past performance  
and management expectations of future market development which includes various assumptions relating to market outlook, contract awards and contract margins.
2. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the weighted average cost of capital employed, which takes into consideration the risk free rate  
of US treasury bonds with a long-term maturity period, the UAE inflation rate, an equity risk premium on the entities operating from the UAE, the Group’s beta and  
the cost of the Group’s debt.
3. Net profit rate for the first three-year period is based on the Group budget. Beyond this period, the net profit rate is determined based upon management expectations  
of future market development. 
4. Terminal value growth rate is based upon management expectations of future market development. See Note 4.2.3 for details.
As a result of the above, no impairment has been recorded during the year (2016: USD 180.5 million) and the carrying amount  
of intangible assets at 31 December 2017 was USD 31.7 million (31 December 2016: USD 24.9 million).  114

The recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiaries is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use 
pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period. 
Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated revenue growth rate of 0% (2016: 5%). A discount  
rate of 10.00% (2016: 11.54%) is used to discount the pre-tax cash flows projections to the present value. In determining the 
appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the weighted average cost of capital employed, which takes into consideration  
the risk free rate of US treasury bonds with a long-term maturity period, the UAE inflation rate, the equity risk premium on the  
entities operating from the UAE, the Group’s beta and the cost of Group’s debt. In determining the terminal value growth rate, the 
Group considers the long-term average CPI growth rate for the UAE which is estimated to be c.3% by the Economist Intelligence Unit 
(“EIU”). Although the forecast cash flows are USD based, the terminal value growth rate is within the UAE long-term forecasts and is 
considered to be more appropriate given the location of the business and factors driving revenue and long-term growth. Based on 
these calculations, an impairment charge of USD Nil (2016: USD 140.1 million) with respect to the investment in LEL was recognised 
during the year (Note 25).
The Company granted retention and performance shares to employees of its subsidiaries under various plans (Note 8). These  
shares have a vesting period that ranges five to thirty six months. Accordingly, the proportionate share-based charge for the year  
of USD 1.3 million (2016: USD 2.0 million) has been recorded as an increase in investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding  
credit to retained earnings.

26 Provision for employees’ end of service benefits 
In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19, management has carried out an exercise to assess the present value of its obligations at 
31 December 2017 and 2016, using the projected unit credit method, in respect of employees’ end of service benefits payable under 
the Labour Laws of the countries in which the Group operates. Under this method, an assessment has been made of an employee’s 
expected service life with the Group and the expected basic salary at the date of leaving the service. The obligation for end of service 
benefit is not funded. 
The movement in the employees’ end of service benefit liability over the periods is as follows:

The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows:

Discount rate 3.20% 3.50%
Future salary increase:
 Management and administrative employees 2.00% 2.00%
 Yard employees 2.00% 2.00%
The rate used for discounting the employees’ post-employment defined benefit obligation should be based on market yields  
on high quality corporate bonds. In countries where there is no deep market for such bonds, the market yields on government bonds 
should be used. In the UAE, there is no deep market for corporate bonds and no market for government bonds and therefore, the 
discount rate has been estimated using the US AA-rated corporate bond market as a proxy . On this basis, the discount rate applied 
was 3.2% (2016: 3.5%). Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
121
26 Provision for employees’ end of service benefits continued
The rates used for future salary increase are long-term assumptions which take into account inflation, relevant factors in the 
employment market and the Group’s own expectations. There are no changes in the future salary increase rate for Yard employees.  
It is retained at 2% (2016: 2%).
Due to the nature of the benefit, which is a lump sum payable on exit for any cause, a combined single decrement rate has been used 
as follows:

age exiting the plan per year

The Group has an interest rate swap to switch floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on the Group’s borrowings. This derivative 
did not qualify for hedge accounting and is carried at fair value through profit or loss. The notional principal amount at the date of 
inception of these contracts was USD 100 million. This contract matures in various instalments within fifty seven months from the date 
of inception. The fair value at 31 December 2017 of this derivative was USD 0.3 million (2016: USD 0.2 million).
During 2016, the Group designated foreign currency forward contracts as hedges of highly probable purchases of fixed assets 
and material in EUR, GBP and NOK. The forecast purchases are expected to occur during 2017 and 2018. The terms of the forward 
contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the forecast transactions. Consequently, the hedges were assessed to be highly 
effective and an unrealised gain of USD 1.3 million (2016: unrealised loss of USD 1.2 million) relating to the forward contracts  
is included in other comprehensive income. 122

39,491  59,484
At 31 December 2017, the Group has banking facilities of USD 924 million (2016: USD 1,362 million) with commercial banks.  
The facilities include bank overdrafts, letters of guarantees, letters of credit and short-term loans.
Bank facilities are secured by liens over term deposits of USD 54.5 million (2016: USD 91.2 million) (Note 22), the Group’s counter 
indemnities for guarantees issued on their behalf, the Group’s corporate guarantees, letter of undertakings, letter of credit payment 
guarantees, cash margin held against letters of guarantees, shares of certain subsidiaries, certain property, plant and equipment, 
movable assets, leasehold rights for land and certain contract related receivables.
The Group’s debt facilities are subjected to covenant clauses, whereby the Group is required to meet certain key financial ratios.  
The Group did not fulfil the tangible net worth financial covenant contained within its debt facilities due to the magnitude of the loss  
on the EA1 Project stated in Note 4.
Due to this breach of the covenant clause, the banks are contractually entitled to request for immediate repayment of the outstanding 
loan amount of USD 39.4 million. However , Management are in discussion with the banks to waive this requirement. The outstanding 
balance has been reclassified and presented as current liability as at 31 December 2017.
On 14 March 2018, subsequent to the year end, the Group obtained a waiver from its lenders which reduces the tangible net worth 
covenant (see Note 36).
The borrowings are stated net of the unamortised arrangement fees and other transaction costs of USD 0.5 million  
(2016: USD 0.8 million) and including accrued interest of USD 0.1 million (2016: USD 0.3 million).
The bank facilities relating to overdrafts, term loans and revolving facilities carry interest at LIBOR +3.5%. However , the Group has 
entered into an interest rate swap against the variable interest rate on its term loan facility to convert the LIBOR component into a fixed 
interest rate of 1.2375% (2016: 1.2375%). 
The carrying amounts of borrowings in the year approximated to their fair value and were denominated in US Dollars or UAE Dirhams, 
which are pegged to the US Dollar .  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Alternative performance measures
EBITDA
In addition to measuring financial performance of the Group based on operating profit, we also measure performance based on 
EBITDA and underlying EBITDA (also referred to as adjusted EBITDA). EBITDA is defined as the Group (loss)/profit for the year from 
continuing operation before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation. Underlying EBITDA is defined as EBITDA 
before non-recurring items or certain accounting adjustments that do not reflect changes in performance. 
We consider EBITDA and underlying EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the 
operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation. EBITDA and underlying EBITDA are not direct measures of our 
liquidity , which is shown by our cash flow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
A reconciliation from Group (loss)/profit for the year from continuing operation, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported 
and underlying EBITDA, is set out below:
