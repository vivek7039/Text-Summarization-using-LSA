Objective
To provide shareholders with long term 
returns through capital and income 
growth.
Policy
Phoenix Asset Management Partners 
Limited (Phoenix) was appointed 
Investment Manager on 28 January 2016. 
Phoenix currently seeks to achieve the 
Objective by investing in a portfolio of UK 
listed equities.
The portfolio will remain relatively 
concentrated. The exact number of 
individual holdings will vary over time but 
typically the portfolio will consist of 15 to 
20 holdings. 
The Board is seeking shareholder 
approval at the AGM to increase the 
flexibility of the Company to invest 
outside the UK and in unlisted securities.
Performance
Benchmark
Performance is benchmarked against 
the FTSE All-Share Index (total return), 
representing the overall London market. 
Dividend
The Directors recommend a final dividend 
of 2.75p per share, to be paid on 19 June 
2018 to shareholders on the register as at 
4 May 2018. 
No final dividend was paid in 2017 , 
but an interim dividend of 2.0p per share 
in respect of the financial period ended 
on 31 December 2016 was paid on 
10 April 2017 .
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the 
Company will be held at the offices of 
Grant Thornton, 30 Finsbury Square,

Performance Review
The performance for the year to end December 2017 was +18.5%, out-performing the 
benchmark FTSE All Share Index by 5.4%. 
One of the key features of the Investment Management Agreement with Phoenix 
is that they earn no management fees other than an annual performance fee, equal 
to one third of NAV per share total returns in excess of the total return of the FTSE 
All-Share Index. This fee is subject to claw back and a high water mark and is capped 
at 4% of NAV p.a. in the case of an absolute increase in NAV per share; and 2% in the 
case of a decrease but with outperformance compared with the FTSE All-Share.
Despite Aurora’s strong outperformance of the Index in 2017 , no performance 
fee was earned by Phoenix. The NAV had lagged the Index in 2016 and, as the 
performance fee is calculated on a cumulative basis, it can only be earned once the 
lag has been caught-up. At the year-end, the “lag” had reduced to just under 5%, after 
which a performance fee will be earned for subsequent outperformance.
The share price of Aurora traded at a premium to NAV for substantially all of the 
period in question. The average premium for the year was 1 .5%, which was helpful in 
attracting new investors and to increase the size of the Company through the issuance 
of new shares. Accordingly our aim is for the shares to continue to trade at a small 
premium to NAV and to grow the Company further, as discussed below. 
Two Years of Phoenix Management
2017 was the second full year of Phoenix management, which began with their being 
appointed Investment Manager in January 2016. Aurora is managed under the same 
investment strategy as Phoenix’s long standing, open-ended fund, the Phoenix UK 
Fund. Since its inception in 1998 that fund has delivered, net of fees, annualised 
returns of 10% compared with 5.5% for the FTSE All-Share Index.
I thought it might be useful to add some observations on our experience over the 
last few years of the investment management process and practices of Phoenix. Three 
key words stand out in my experience: patience, discipline and focus. There’s a lot of 
talk about patient capital but it seems to me that the root of long term outperformance 
is the willingness to accept some periods of underperformance followed by (hopefully 
more significant) periods of outperformance based on core investment principles. 
The key though are those investment principles that guide the stock selection. Get 
them right, wait to find the right business at the right price – as evidenced by the 
recent purchase of Dignity after many years of patient research and monitoring – and 
hopefully you’ll reap a long-term reward. 
Discipline I think goes with patience. It’s about waiting to buy the right stock but 
also it’s about using thorough processes, checklists and research gathering processes 
to find the right stock. Phoenix build up the required knowledge by studying the 
relevant industries and companies in detail – a learning process which can take several 
years. When it comes to price, Phoenix are disciplined in only paying up to half of what 
they believe the business is worth. 
The last word I mentioned was focus. In the case of Phoenix this involves knowing 
some sectors really very well. That requires that patience and discipline but it also 
requires a willingness to shut out other ideas and stay focused on what you know – 
your circle of competence. That means for instance some focus on consumer stocks 
such as Sports Direct, where Phoenix have been patient and successful – in terms of 
investment returns. Alternatively, it could mean a focus on housebuilding companies 
or, indeed, specialist hobby brands – a niche within the consumer space arguably – 
which involves outfits such as Hornby or latterly Stanley Gibbons. 
There is though one side effect of what we think as the three virtues of patience, 
discipline and focus – sometimes there aren’t many new portfolio additions. This 
means turnover can and has been low.

 Annual Report Strategic Report 7
The rarity of suitable investment candidates, combined with the time-consuming 
nature of the investment process, inevitably results in a concentrated portfolio, 
typically of a maximum of between 15 and 20 investments. 
I would add a final parting observation. Patience, discipline and focus can also 
be applied not only to the investment process but also the way the Company is 
developed over time and marketed to a wider audience. Phoenix are committed to 
growing the size of the Company and have over the last few years attracted what 
we would like to believe are high quality, patient investors from wealth managers, 
family offices and university endowments. Within the retail space this is echoed 
by the determination of the Company to reach a wider private investor audience, 
a development we hope will be accelerated with the appointment by Phoenix of 
Frostrow, as covered later, to assist in marketing Aurora to a national audience. Again, 
these all demonstrate a commitment to the long term, to building the Company and 
creating real value for our shareholders. 
Investment Policy 
At this year’s AGM, shareholders will be asked to vote on a resolution to amend 
Aurora’s Investment Policy. The Existing Investment Policy limits the scope of 
investment to UK listed equities and cash. The changes, which have been proposed 
by Phoenix and carefully considered by the Aurora Board, will broaden the scope 
to enable investment in companies listed outside the UK (limited to 20% of assets 
at cost price) and unlisted securities (limited to 10% of gross assets at cost price). 
From the Board’s discussions with Phoenix, it is clear that the proposed amendments 
do not represent a shift in Phoenix’s investment strategy and objectives. Rather, they 
will enable Phoenix to implement more effectively their well-established investment 
philosophy. The ability to hold 10% of gross assets at cost price, in unlisted securities 
is also necessary to participate in the Stanley Gibbons investment, which Phoenix 
have recently undertaken. Phoenix have assured the Board that they will be cautious 
in making use of the expanded remit and the Board recommends that shareholders 
approve the proposed changes. 
Growth of the Company 
Growing the Company remains a key objective of the Board. A new prospectus was 
published during the year to enable the continued issuance of new shares, both via 
small “tap-issues” and larger, more structured “Placings” . A total of 12,679,198 new 
shares were issued in 2017 , bringing the total number of shares issued during the era 
of Phoenix management to 28,080,114. Consequently, the market capitalisation of the 
Company, which had been £51 .69m in January 2017 , finished the year at £88.34m. 
After the year-end, in January 2018, Phoenix announced the appointment of 
Frostrow Capital to assist achieving an increase in the size of the Company by raising 
the profile of Aurora, with potential investors across the UK. This appointment will 
be paid for, at their suggestion, by Phoenix and therefore minimise the cost to 
shareholders. Frostrow has an excellent reputation built on the provision of similar 
services to a select number of other investment trusts.
In last year’s statement I mentioned our objective was to increase the size of 
Aurora to £100m. At the time of writing, the market cap has reached £92.63m and it 
seems appropriate to update the objective. Having spoken with Phoenix, who have 
considered the investment opportunities available to them, our new objective is now 
to increase the size of Aurora to £200m over the next two to three years. As well as 
finding sufficient opportunities to invest new money, it is essential that the Company 
attracts new shareholders with a long-term focus who understand and respect the 
Phoenix investment strategy. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

Investment 
policy and 
results
The Company adopted the Existing Investment Policy on 28 January 2016, with the 
appointment of Phoenix Asset Management Partners (“Phoenix”) as the Company’s 
new Investment Manager.
The Board has recently undertaken a review of its Existing Investment Policy and in 
particular the lack of flexibility that the Company has to make investments out with the 
UK and into unlisted securities. Accordingly the Board is seeking shareholder approval 
at the AGM to adopt the wording set out below under the heading Revised Investment 
Policy as the Company’s investment objective and policy following the AGM.
Existing Investment Policy
The Company’s existing objective is to provide shareholders with long-term returns 
through capital and income growth by investing in a concentrated portfolio of UK listed 
equities.
The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a portfolio 
of UK listed equities. The portfolio will be relatively concentrated. The exact number 
of individual holdings will very over time but typically the portfolio will consist of 15 
to 20 holdings. The Company may use derivatives and similar instruments for the 
purpose of capital preservation. There are no pre-defined maximum or minimum 
exposure levels for each individual holding or sector, but these exposures reported 
to, and monitored by, the Board in order to ensure that adequate diversification is 
achieved. The Company’s policy is not to invest more than 15% of its gross assets in 
any one investment.
While there is a comparable index for the purposes of measuring performance 
over material periods, no attention is paid to the composition of this index when 
constructing the portfolio and the composition of the portfolio is likely to vary 
substantially from that of the index. The Company may from time to time invest in 
other UK listed investment companies, but the Company will not invest more than 
10% in aggregate of the total assets of the Company in other listed closed-ended 
funds other than closed-ended investment funds which themselves have published 
investment policies to invest no more than 15% of their total assets in other listed 
closed-ended funds. The Company will not invest in any other fund managed by the 
Company’s investment manager. 
The Company does not currently intend to use gearing. However, if the Board 
did decide to utilise gearing the aggregate borrowings of the Company would be 
restricted to 30% of the aggregate of the paid up nominal capital plus the capital and 
revenue reserves. 
Any material change to the investment policy of the Company will only be made 
with the approval of the shareholders.
Revised Investment Policy
The Company’s objective is to provide Shareholders with long-term returns through 
capital and income growth.
The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing predominantly 
in a portfolio of UK listed companies. The Company may from time to time also invest 
in companies listed outside the UK and unlisted securities. The investment policy is 
subject to the following restrictions, all of which are at the time of investment:
•  The maximum permitted investment in companies listed outside the UK at cost 
price is 20% of the Company’s gross assets.
•  The maximum permitted investment in unlisted securities at cost price is 10%. of 
the Company’s gross assets.
•  There are no pre-defined maximum or minimum sector exposure levels but these 
sector exposures are reported to and monitored by, the Board in order to ensure 
that adequate diversification is achieved.  Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

10 Annual Report Strategic Report
•  The Company’s policy is not to invest more than 15% of its gross assets in any one 
underlying issuer.
•  The Company may from time to time invest in other UK listed investment 
companies, but the Company will not invest more than 10% in aggregate of the 
gross assets of the Company in other listed closed-ended investment funds.
•  The Company will not invest in any other fund managed by the Investment Manager.
While there is a comparable index for the purposes of measuring performance 
over material periods, no attention is paid to the composition of this index when 
constructing the portfolio and the composition of the portfolio is likely to vary 
substantially from that of the index. The portfolio will be relatively concentrated. The 
exact number of individual holdings will vary over time but typically the portfolio will 
consist of holdings in 15 to 20 companies. The Company may use derivatives and 
similar instruments for the purpose of capital preservation.
The Company does not currently intend to use gearing. However, if the Board 
did decide to utilise gearing the aggregate borrowings of the Company would be 
restricted to 30% of the aggregate of the paid up nominal capital plus the capital and 
revenue reserves.
Any material change to the investment policy of the Company will only be made 
with the approval of Shareholders at a general meeting. In the event of a breach of 
the Company’s investment policy, the Directors will announce through a Regulatory 
Information Service the actions which will be taken to rectify the breach.
Dividend Policy
The investment policy does not include any fixed dividend policy. However, the Board 
will distribute substantially all of the net revenue arising from the investment portfolio. 
Accordingly, the Company is expected to continue to pay an annual dividend, but this 
could be lower than the level of recent dividends and may vary each year. 
Objectives and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The Company’s principal investment objective is to achieve capital growth. The 
Company’s success in attaining its objectives is measured by reference to KPIs as 
follows:
a.  To make an absolute total return for shareholders on a long-term basis.
b.  The Company’s Benchmark is the FTSE All-Share Index (total return), against 
which the Net Asset Value (NAV) return is compared. After achieving the goal 
of making absolute returns for shareholders, the next aim is to provide a better 
return from the portfolio than from the market as measured by the Benchmark.
c.  The Company seeks to ensure that the operating expenses of running the 
Company as a proportion of NAV (the Ongoing Charges Ratio) are kept to the 
minimum possible.
Performance
The Investment Manager is Phoenix Asset Management Partners Limited, which 
is regulated by the FCA. The Chief Investment Officer of Phoenix is Gary Channon. 
Phoenix reports in detail upon the Company’s activities in the IMR. 
Under the Investment Management Agreement no regular management fees 
are payable. A performance fee is payable to the Investment Manager only if the 
benchmark is beaten.  Strategic Report

(Period 1 March 2016 to 31 December 2016: £636,037). 
The directors recommend a final dividend of 2.75p per Ordinary Share. If approved 
by the AGM this dividend will be paid on 19 June 2018 to shareholders on the register 
at 4 May 2018; the ordinary shares will be marked ex-dividend on 3 May 2018. In 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards this dividend is not 
reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 .
In 2017 an interim dividend of 2.00p per Ordinary Share was paid, absorbing 
£614,526.

Statement from 
the CIO of the 
Investment 
Manager
Gary Channon
April 2018
If 2016 was a year for sowing, as we did in a substantial way after the Brexit vote, 
then 2017 was a year of reaping. The alchemy that produced the strong performance 
for the year was an attractively priced portfolio of businesses delivering strong 
fundamental returns in their underlying businesses. Each of our 3 housebuilders 
was up around 50%, as was our new addition in 2016, easyJet. Most of the portfolio 
performed strongly.
Rising prices and good news make it harder to find bargains and so the year ended 
without us having made any new investments. The cash position increased to 5.2% 
at year-end.
Phoenix acting through all its accounts acquired a controlling position in Hornby 
plc during the year, that triggered a mandatory bid and we followed that up with a 
capital raise. At the end of those steps Phoenix, through all the accounts and funds 
it manages has an aggregate interest in 75% of the company. The Aurora Investment 
Trust for its part owns 14%.
We took this unusual move to enable the Company to adopt a strategy that we 
think will lead to a successful revival of the core business. What we have given up in 
terms of liquidity will be gained in the value we believe comes from having some say 
in the levers of value creation within a company. Some of these are protective; we can 
prevent things that in the past have subtracted value, like overpriced acquisitions, poor 
capital allocation and a lack of frugality. On the positive side, it allows us to choose 
who should manage the business and we did that. Lyndon Davies joined Hornby 
in October 2017 as CEO, with an agreement to buy the business he founded and 
built, Oxford Diecast. Lyndon has a great track record as a successful entrepreneur 
who competed with Hornby. He has a keen awareness of the Hornby’s strengths, 
weaknesses and potential; we couldn’t be happier to have him on board.
Hornby is an example of us using all the means at our disposal to make attractive 
investments for our clients whilst protecting the downside risk. In the past this has 
taken many forms, not just purchasing equity, and we expect to continue to approach 
investments that way in the future. Post the year-end and ahead of the publication 
of this report, Phoenix announced a deal to make an investment in Stanley Gibbons, 
which, if it completes, we will tell you about in next year’s report. In structuring 
that transaction we have sacrificed convention and appearances for downside risk 
protection and ultimate returns.
As the UK heads towards Brexit we may see more turbulence in markets and 
from our perspective, we welcome that because it is in those conditions that short-
term valuations on the stock market are most likely to get out of kilter with long-term 
intrinsic values (i.e. what they are likely to be really worth to a long-term investor). 
However, even in strong markets, individual businesses come unstuck and have big 
share price falls. Occasionally one of those will be in our candidate universe and we 
will get an opportunity to act. This has happened in early 2018 with Dignity plc.
A long-term focus on the future, an almost obsessional focus on the competitive 
dynamics of business, observed first hand in the field and a willingness to be patient 
for long periods of time, (acting only occasionally, when values merit it) will, we 
believe, continue to deliver attractive long-term returns for our investors. Over 20 years 
we have developed a disciplined approach to investment using a system and process 
that continues to learn from its shortcomings. This reduces our error rate, limits losses 
when errors are spotted and ultimately builds a portfolio that we understand the value 
of, with a good measure of confidence. Today’s portfolio is priced at almost half of the 
intrinsic value we estimate it contains and although that is not a guide over the short-
term, (which we characterise as less than 3 years), it has, historically, been the best 
guide for our long-term expectations. Strategic Report

Proposed change of investment policy
At this year’s AGM we will be asking shareholders to vote on proposed amendments 
to Aurora’s Existing Investment Policy. The major changes are mentioned in the 
Chairman’s Statement and outlined in more detail on page 9.
A few years ago, shortly before his death, I had the very good fortune to meet with 
Peter Cundill, a highly successful Canadian investor once named by Warren Buffett as 
a potential successor. Amongst many other things Peter told me that given the level 
of knowledge and expertise we had about our companies we were unnecessarily 
restricting ourselves by only investing in the listed equity. His view, which I have come 
to share, was that having gained a good understanding of a company’s value we 
should look for the best risk adjusted way of making our investment, anywhere in the 
capital structure. We have been approaching things in that way since.
We would have sought to alter the Existing Investment Policy at some point, the 
catalyst for doing so now is the recent investment by other Phoenix Funds in Stanley 
Gibbons, the world’s leading stamp and coin dealing business. The two substantial 
changes are to allow investment in unlisted companies and in companies listed in 
countries other than the UK (limited to 10% and 20% at cost prices, respectively). 
Our investment in Stanley Gibbons takes an unusual form, structured to protect 
our downside risk and making it a far superior investment to buying only the listed 
equity. Our overall investment in Stanley Gibbons comprised the purchase of four 
assets: 58% of the equity (listed shares), the bank loan, a portfolio of stamps and a 
receivable from the administration of a Guernsey entity. We hope to be able to allocate 
Aurora its share of the Stanley Gibbons investment and we need to change the 
Existing Investment Policy to do so.
We have invested in Stanley Gibbons and Hornby because they fit our profile of 
having great long term potential to make attractive returns for shareholders whilst 
being currently available at attractive prices.
These changes do not herald any change in our investment philosophy or principles 
which have served us well at Phoenix for the past 20 years.

Investment 
Manager’s 
Review and 
Outlook
Tristan Chapple
April 2018
In early March, a week or so before putting pen to paper for this review, the FT 
published a story entitled “Global investors shun UK Stock market” (FT : Chris Flood: 5 
March 2018) that suggested UK equities are currently the most unpopular asset class 
in the world among large institutional investors; not the most auspicious of backdrops 
for an investment trust with significant exposure to UK domestic businesses. 
Moreover, one of the questions we have been most frequently asked during recent 
meetings with potential investors is “how do you feel the portfolio is positioned, given 
Brexit?” . The question is perfectly reasonable and the answer has two parts; firstly, we 
make the general observation that the Brexit negotiation process, like the making of 
a sausage, is not attractive to behold. It is also a subject to which we bring no unique 
insight; whether we end-up with the political equivalent of a short-dated Iceland 
frozen banger or a mouth-watering, hand-made finocchiona, remains to be seen. The 
most important point on this topic, for shareholders of Aurora, is that the Phoenix 
investment approach does not involve so-called “top-down” investing. For readers 
not familiar with the jargon, “top-down” investing is when a fund manager begins 
with a belief that world events will unfold in a certain way (for example, concluding 
ahead of the event that Britain’s leaving the EU will mean such-and-such). Then, each 
stock in the portfolio is selected with this opinion in mind; if that opinion turns out 
to be accurate then the investment performance of the portfolio may be good; if the 
view turns out to be wrong, the investment performance is more likely to be poor. 
On the other hand, the Phoenix approach to building a portfolio of stocks is known as 
“bottom-up” . Less ribald than it sounds, this simply means we don’t pick stocks on the 
basis that they will benefit from specific macro-economic events but because we think 
each investment is a compelling proposition in its own right. And that brings us to 
the second part of the answer we give to potential investors who ask us about Brexit 
or our UK focus; that despite the prevailing downer on UK business, our portfolio 
comprises a number of high-quality companies that are generally prospering and that 
we think will continue to do well over the medium to long-term, whatever Brexit has 
in store. 
Turning last year’s precedent into a tradition, we will begin the activity review with 
the year’s laggard, GSK, whose share price fell 11%. GSK has a new, highly regarded 
CEO, Emma Walmsley, whose actions we have been watching closely and of which 
we so far approve. However, fears remain that the company doesn’t have sufficient 
new patented drugs to replace older products whose patents face expiry. Known as 
the “patent cliff” , this has been one of the “bear” arguments against GSK for a while. 
However, our counter is that this view doesn’t consider the long history of creative 
destruction in large pharma’ companies; a patented drug’s commercial life is almost 
never more than 15 years; drugs come-and-go all the time and yet today’s largest drug 
companies have been major forces in the pharmaceutical industry for generations. 
Why should the companies endure when the products they sell do not? We think the 
answer lies in the vast scale and expertise possessed by companies like GSK in areas 
such as R&D and distribution; their size and depth of talent means that significant 
discovery (and subsequent commercialisation) is likely, even when predicting the 
advent of specific new products is impossible. Another “bear” argument is that 
global pharma’ firms are unwieldy and staid; sitting-ducks to smaller, more nimble 
competitors. And yet, despite the profusion of start-up “bio-tech” businesses to have 
emerged over recent decades, almost none of them have threatened the dominance 
of “big pharma’” . Even when these smaller businesses (or university departments) 
discover something of potential commercial value, they often form alliances with, or 
are acquired by, much larger pharma’ groups. Why? Because the bigger firms, with 
their benefits of scale, are more likely to succeed in commercialising innovation. With 
the shares priced under £13 we increased our shareholding in GSK during the year. Strategic Report

We are ambivalent about short-term share price movements (and don’t think 
they can be predicted) although we did note that the wooden spoon last year in 
terms of share price went to Sports Direct amidst a perfect storm of bad PR and a 
minor profits warning. However, we said at the time that we rated the business and 
its management very highly and we were enthused about the investment. This year, 
the shares did better (up 35%) and, much more importantly, the underlying business 
continued to perform well. One of the many fascinating elements of the business is 
Mike Ashley’s approach to investing in freehold property. He built the business over 
several decades with a leasehold strategy, only deciding to acquire freeholds when 
there was a need to do so and when suitable locations could be acquired on very 
attractive terms. Now this is the case, Mike and his team are buying prime sites and 
developing them into flagship stores with a more up-market feel and product range, 
thus satisfying the consumer’s demand for more premium products. Owning rather 
than leasing stores means that Mike and his team have full control over the property 
and get to retain the benefits of expensive refurbishments. This isn’t the case in a 
leased store, where the landlord retains the benefits of a tenant’s improvements to 
the property. Initial reports suggest that these new, freehold flagship stores are doing 
very well, generating a high return on the capital invested in them. This is one example 
among many of how this nimble business continues to succeed. 
T esco and Morrisons (whose share price moves for the year were 2% and -3% 
respectively) continued along the path of “self-help” and we are generally pleased 
with what we are finding when we visit stores; pricing strategies are clearer and more 
competitive and they are not afraid to copy competitor’s good ideas; a useful attribute 
in a good retailer. For example, Lidl sells some of its meat under the “Birchwood 
Farm” brand; an invented name intended to graft a feel-good provenance onto an 
otherwise commodity product. Although ideas like this can be easily discounted 
as cynical marketing tricks, they do seem to appeal to customers and so we were 
pleased to see Tesco follow suit with some of its own “farm” brands. We are less 
enamoured with Tesco’s proposed acquisition of Booker. It has been a frequent topic 
of discussion in the Phoenix office and the current view is that although it is likely that 
the price to be paid for Booker is too high, the size of the deal means it doesn’t have 
sufficient negative impact to undermine our investment case for Tesco.
We reduced the weight in our housebuilding investments ahead of the UK 
general election because the Conservative manifesto wasn’t quite as tub-thumping 
for housebuilders as it might have been. In particular, there was no mention of the 
“help-to-buy” scheme, which has been tailwind for housebuilders in recent years. 
Subsequently, these fears abated when Theresa May and other Conservatives 
restated their desire to see more housebuilding, upon which we partly reversed the 
reduction and increased our investment in Redrow and Bellway (shares up 49% and 
58% respectively) which had tremendous years, with higher sales and profits and 
ongoing high returns on capital. We have previously written quite extensively about 
the positive trading conditions currently being experienced by house-builders in the UK 
and we won’t repeat everything here. Suffice to say that the housing market remains 
under-supplied with new-build houses, and that since the credit crunch ten years ago, 
the Government has been pulling policy levers to increase the number of houses built 
in this country. Against the positive general market backdrop, Bellway and Redrow 
are both benefiting from opening new subsidiaries in parts of the country where they 
didn’t previously operate, a strategy that is enabling them to increase their sales faster 
than the overall market. 
Our investment in Hornby (shares down 4%) may appear unusual as we own 75% 
of the business and a Phoenix Partner, James Wilson, sits on their Board. However, it 
is in other ways typical of our approach. The business owns a series of great brands 
including Hornby, Corgi, Airfix and Scalextrics. These nostalgic brands occupy a special 
place in the hearts and minds of Hornby’s customers, who are often long-standing 
and devoted hobbyists. However, the brands have not fulfilled their potential because  Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

18 Annual Report Strategic Report
of various operational set-backs. We increased our shareholding of Hornby during 
the year, believing that these set-backs will be overcome with better management. 
One of several promising examples of this already in action is the new approach to 
offering discounts to wholesale customers. In the past, Hornby used these discounts 
to tempt orders from these customers. However, the tactic was over-used, causing 
those customers to become too reliant on discounts. The new management of Hornby 
have announced that discounting will stop immediately, a decision that will most likely 
cost Hornby some sales in the short-term but be of long-term benefit to the value and 
perception of the brands.
easyJet (shares up 54%) is an investment of quite recent vintage, having first been 
purchased during autumn 2016, in the wake of the Brexit “leave” vote. Unfortunately, 
since then, the highly regarded CEO, Carolyn McCall has left the business. Her 
emphasis on return-on-capital meant that the business pursued a very disciplined 
growth strategy, creating much value for shareholders. We will watch carefully to see 
that the new CEO continues to operate the business along similar lines. Apart from 
the loss of McCall, the news for easyJet has been largely positive this year as some 
weaker European airlines such as Monarch and Air Berlin have gone bust and easyJet’s 
strategy of providing a convenient, low-cost alternative to more expensive national 
airlines continues to work. We are pleased with the progress the business is making and 
are excited about the investment. (An aside on easyJet: if you are ever at a dinner party 
dull enough to be enlivened by an injection of airline trivia, try this: Ryanair and easyJet 
combined, fly approximately 2,600 routes. On what percentage of those routes do they 
compete with each other, within a two-hour time slot? Is the answer A: 40%, B: 10% or 
C: less than 0.5%? The answer is C, less than 0.5%).
A combination of easy funding and hubris has left parts of the “casual dining” 
market with too much capacity, resulting in financial difficulties and site closures at 
businesses including Byron, Jamie’s Italian and Prezzo. Yet, despite this slew of bad 
news coming from the overall market, JD Wetherspoon (shares up 43%) where food 
makes up 40% of turnover, grew both sales and profits in 2017 . The focused, low-cost 
business model, combined with excellent, consistent customer service continues to 
endure in a market not currently awash with success stories. 
Another company bearing the fingerprints of its founders is niche insurer, 
Randall & Quilter, (R&Q) (shares up 9%) whose principals, Ken Randall and Alan 
Quilter, started the business in 1991 . For the last couple of years, R&Q has been 
selling non-core assets and re-focusing on their “run-off” and “fronting” specialisms. 
During the year, they issued £49m worth of new shares by way of an “open offer” 
and plan to use the money to expand the core business. We are excited about the 
prospects and added to our investment in the open offer.
The new CEO of Vesuvius (shares up 52%) has recently been reporting 
improvements in the company’s major markets (steel foundry and steel flow) as global 
steel production has been increasing. Sales and profits increased over the year and 
an internal restructuring programme is continuing to lower costs. Debt also fell and 
the 20% return-on-capital remains very impressive for any business, let alone one in 
an industry that is generally capital intensive. Vesuvius specialises in so-called “flat 
steel” , which is used in consumer products including cars and fridges, rather than 
construction. Medium and long-range forecasts suggest that flat steel production will 
increase significantly as consumer goods markets continue to grow in China, India and 
other parts of the developing world. 
During the period, Lloyds (shares up 14%) was returned to full private ownership, 
increased its dividend, increased underlying profit, strengthened its balance sheet, 
increased the “net interest margin” (the difference between interest income earned 
by Lloyds and the amount Lloyds pays its’ own lenders; a higher net interest margin 
is a good thing) and drew nearer to the end of the PPI or “conduct claims” saga. Core 
operating costs fell year-on-year, with the company reporting a market-leading “cost-
income ratio” (a measure of efficiency). The company reiterated the long-term targets  Strategic Report

set out by CEO Antonio Horta Osario and said that the recent acquisition of the MBNA 
credit card business is running ahead of schedule. Last year we said of the Lloyds 
investment that “the business fundamentals have been on the turn (i.e. improving) for 
some time and yet the shares remain cheap. It is a good example of why it pays not 
to stick ones neck out and talk about when and why a share price might start to rise” 
which is even more valid today! We added to the Lloyds holding during the year.
Outlook
A “top-down” investor might point to Brexit or any other “news” and try and pin-point 
how the portfolio outlook will be impacted by certain macro-economic outcomes. 
Our “bottom-up” approach means that our portfolio outlook is formed by focusing on 
business fundamentals instead. Although a huge amount of work goes into making 
and monitoring each of our investments, the case for owning each one boils down 
to a pretty simple investment thesis (in fact, an inability to articulate an investment 
case in simple terms is a good warning sign). We spend most of our time questioning 
and testing the theses using our primary research. Every piece of research used at 
Phoenix is produced in-house; in twenty years we have never made an investment 
using broker research. What is the relevance of this? It means that our investment 
outlook is a moving feast, informed by what we observe by putting boots on the 
ground and watching our investee businesses in action. 
A significant part of this involves mystery shopping; we regularly “buy” a sample 
basket of sports items to test whether Sports Direct remains the lowest cost 
producer. We spend time inspecting the toilets in Weatherspoons’ because they are 
a good litmus test of pub management and are important when customers form 
impressions. Each month, we use housebuilders’ websites to track the sales of new-
build houses at over 100 locations around the UK (tip: housing developments often 
have their own individual websites that show exactly the housing plots available for 
sale. Identified by a unique number, these plots are removed from the websites once 
sold; by building a regular data series it is relatively easy, albeit time consuming, to 
figure out how many houses are being sold each month.) We visit numerous branches 
of Tesco and Morrisons and in each one we ask shop assistants “where is the soy 
sauce?” We grade them for the quality of their response, record the data and use the 
trend as one of many indicators of customer service standards.
We think that the most relevant outlook statement we can make is that currently, 
the research that we do gives us confidence that the companies in our portfolio are 
performing well, in line with our investment theses. And, very importantly, the shares 
are cheap. These two elements augur well for future investment returns. 
The chart following this Review and Outlook shows the performance of the 
Phoenix UK Fund over 20 years since its inception in 1998, compared to the FTSE 
All-Share Index (total return). The chart has been included here to illustrate the 
long-term investment track record of Phoenix, where we apply the same investment 
strategy to all client accounts, including Aurora.
The NAV shown in the chart is the “net return”; in other words the actual return 
that investors in the Phoenix UK Fund received after all expenses and fees (including 
the management and performance fees earned by Phoenix) had been paid. The 
starting value of the NAV per share of the Phoenix UK Fund in May 1998 was £1,000. 
At 31 December 2017 the NAV per share was £6,518.69. This is an annualised 20 year 
return of 10%. The annualised total return for the FTSE All-Share over the same period 
was 5.5%.

Risk Analysis
The Board considers that the principal risks faced by the shareholders of the Company 
fall into two categories:
External Risks
Poor performance in the UK and/or world economies; poor corporate profits and dividends. 
Poor stock market performance caused by market-specific factors, such as 
rising interest rates, the unwinding of “bubbles” or disinvestment by institutions, 
superimposed on general economic factors, or caused by shocks, wars, disease etc. The 
Board does not consider, however, that short-term volatility represents a risk for the long-
term shareholder, since it regards long-term performance to be of primary importance. 
Internal Risks
Poor asset management, which may include poor stock selection, excessive concentration 
of the portfolio, mistakes regarding currency movements, speculation in shares of 
companies without sound or established businesses and speculation in derivatives. 
Poor governance, compliance or administration, including particularly the risk of 
loss of investment trust status.
All these and other risks can result in shareholders not making acceptable returns 
from their investment in the Company.
Risk Controls
External risks
As described in the Investment Policy section above, external risks are mitigated by 
diversification of the portfolio and by not utilising gearing. 
Risk diversification
An element of risk is inherent in investment undertaken on a selective basis. The 
Company seeks to mitigate the degree of risk by investing in securities in substantial 
organisations, normally listed and traded on the London Stock Exchange, and by 
spreading its investments across a range of such securities. At 31 December 2017 the 
Company held 16 stocks, spread across 8 main sectors.
Gearing
The Company has discontinued the use of gearing as an element of its Existing 
Investment Policy and will continue to do so under the Revised Investment Policy. 
Under the articles, borrowings are permitted up to a maximum of 30% of NAV. The 
Company’s agreement with BNP also permits borrowing of up to 30% of NAV, but 
there is currently no intention to make use of this allowance. 
The Board will keep under review whether any provision should be made for 
the use of short-term borrowing for the sole purpose of meeting working capital 
requirements from time-to-time. 
Further details concerning currency risks, liquidity risks and interest rate risks are 
given in note 17 .
Internal risks
The control of risks related to governance, compliance and administration is dealt with 
in the report on Corporate Governance. 
Viability Statement
The Company is subject to continuation votes every three years. As a consequence of 
the appointment of Phoenix the Directors proposed the replacement of the pre-existing 
continuation vote schedule by a new three-year schedule, with the next vote falling due in 
2019. This was approved by the AGM held in July 2016.

 Annual Report Strategic Report 23
Although there will be a continuation vote in 2019, the Directors consider that a 
longer time frame is appropriate for the purpose of assessing the Company’s viability. 
At the present time, the Board’s expectation is that it will recommend continuation 
of the Company beyond 2019. Accordingly, they have concluded that they should 
continue to utilise a five year period to evaluate performance.
After making inquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due for at least five years from the date of approval of this 
document. 
In reaching this conclusion, the directors have considered each of the principal 
risks and uncertainties set out above. They have considered the liquidity and solvency 
of the Company, the level of discount at which its shares trade, its income and 
expenditure profile including the absence of monthly management fees and the 
discontinuation of the use of gearing as an instrument of normal investment policy. 
The Company’s investments comprise readily realisable securities which could, if 
necessary, be sold to meet the Company’s funding requirements. The Company’s 
plan to expand by the issue of new share capital and the sale of shares from treasury 
is kept under close, ongoing review by the Board. Portfolio changes and market 
developments are also discussed at quarterly Board meetings. The internal control 
framework of the Company is subject to formal review on at least an annual basis.
The directors do not expect there to be any material increase in the annual ongoing 
charges of the Company over the period of their assessment. The Company’s income 
from investments and cash realisable from the sale of investments provide substantial 
cover to the Company’s operating expenses and any other costs likely to be faced by 
the Company during the period under review. 
Social, Ethical, Human Rights and Environmental Matters 
Being an investment company, with no staff, premises, manufacturing or other 
operations of its own, the Company does not have any direct influence on social, 
ethical, human rights and environmental matters. The Company has no greenhouse 
gas emissions to report from its operations, nor any responsibility for emission 
producing sources. 
Boardroom Diversity
The Company has no employees. At 31 December 2017 the Company had five 
directors, all of whom were male. The Company’s policy is that the Board should 
have a broad range of skills; while keeping this in mind, consideration is given to the 
recommendations of the AIC Code and other guidance on boardroom diversity.
Outlook
The outlook for Aurora is discussed in the Chairman’s Statement and the Manager’s 
Review and Outlook.

Directors’ Report
By Order of the Board 
John Luetchford 
PraxisIFM Fund Services (UK) Limited 
Company Secretary
20 April 2018
Legal and Taxation Status
The Company has sought and obtained approval from HM Revenue and Customs of 
its status as an investment trust under Sections 1158 and 1159 of the Corporation Tax 
Act 2010. In the opinion of the Directors, the Company has conducted its affairs so as 
to be able to maintain such status in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 . 
Under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is an investment 
company and operates as such. 
The Board and Re-Election of Directors
The Directors of the Company at any time during the year are stated below. Except 
where indicated they held office throughout the year.
Lord Flight (Chairman) 
The Honourable James Nelson 
Richard Martin
Tristan Chapple 
David Stevenson 
All Directors are non-executive, in as much as Mr Chapple is an employee of the 
Investment Manager and not of the Company. 
Directors are required by the Company’s Articles to retire by rotation at the Annual 
General Meeting so that each director is subject to re-election at a maximum interval 
of three years. Mr Chapple, being a representative of the Manager, is subject to 
annual re-election. The Board has determined as a matter of policy, however, that all 
directors should in any case submit to annual re-election. 
Accordingly, resolutions will be put to re-appoint Lord Flight, The Honourable 
James Nelson, Mr Martin, Mr Chapple and Mr Stevenson. 
The report on Corporate Governance below contains a description of the Board’s 
composition, of its method of operation, of its work during the year and that of its 
Committees and of how its performance has been evaluated. The Board recommends 
that all directors should be re-elected.
Under the Articles, the Directors are indemnified by the Company against losses 
and liabilities incurred in the performance of their duties. The Articles permit insurance 
cover against directors’ and officers’ liabilities to be arranged by the Company and 
such a policy is maintained.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution proposing 
that Grant Thornton UK LLP be re-appointed as auditors of the Company will be put to 
the AGM. This is item 7 in the Notice of Meeting.
Disclosure of information to auditor
The directors confirm that:
•  so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
•  the directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
auditors are aware of that information. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

 Annual Report Governance 27
Governance
Share Capital
The Company has one class of capital, Ordinary Shares. There are no special 
restrictions or obligations. Shareholders have equal rights with regard to distributions 
of all kinds in proportion to their shareholdings. Final dividends are payable subject to 
approval by the AGM; interim dividends can be declared by the Directors. 
Purchases of the Company’s own shares may be carried out if the relevant 
sanction is given by shareholders. Resolutions at general meetings may be carried by 
show of hands, when each shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote, 
or by poll, when each shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote for 
every share.
During 2016 and 2017 the Company has expanded the number of shares in issue 
by means of both placings and issues under block listing facilities. An ongoing placing 
programme had been set in place on 29 March 2016 and a further placing under 
the terms of this facility was accomplished on 15 March 2017 . That programme then 
expired on 21 March 2017 . A new prospectus was issued on 5 September 2017 and 
fresh authority to issue shares was approved by a General Meeting on 28 September 
2017 . The prospectus provided for an initial placing and offer for subscription, which 
were completed on 6 October 2017 , and a new placing programme. 
A block listing facility had also been put in place during the period ended 
31 December 2016. Additional issues of new shares were made from this facility 
during January to August 2017 . A new block listing facility came into effect on 
16 October 2017 and issues were made from this facility during October to 
December 2017 .
At 31 December 2017 , there were 42,471,503 shares in issue. The number of 
shares with voting rights was also 42,471,503. Further details of the share issues 
through the Placings and under the terms of the block listings are given in note 10 to 
the financial statements.
Additional issues of new shares have been made since 1 January 2018; further 
details of these are given in note 20 to the financial statements.
Power to Issue Shares
At a General Meeting held on 28 September 2017 the directors were granted authority 
to issue new Ordinary Shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £37 ,500,000 on 
a non pre-emptive basis. This authority will expire on 4 September 2018. Rather than 
awaiting the expiry before acting to provide ongoing authority, the Directors have 
concluded that the approval of shareholders should be sought at the AGM to put in 
place a new authority to cover the demand for Ordinary Shares following the expiry of 
the placing programme.
The directors recommend that the new authority should be for up to an aggregate 
nominal amount representing 20% of the share capital in issue as at the date of 
passing the resolution. The directors believe that it is in the interests of the Company 
that they can continue to issue new shares under the placing programme when there 
is substantial demand and under the block listing facility to meet ordinary market 
demand from time-to-time. 
Resolution 11 in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting will, if passed, give the 
directors the general power to allot securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
20% of the share capital in issue as at the date of passing the resolution. 
Resolution 12 which is a special resolution, will, if passed, empower the Directors 
to make allotments of shares other than according to the statutory pre-emption rights 
which otherwise require all new shares to be offered first to all existing shareholders.  Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

28 Annual Report Governance
Holding Shares in Treasury
The Board monitors on an ongoing basis whether Ordinary Shares should be 
repurchased and, if so whether they should be held in Treasury, or whether they can 
and should be sold from treasury. Any sales of Ordinary Shares from Treasury are 
made at prices not less than the latest available NAV per share at the time of sale. 
There were no sales of Ordinary Shares from treasury during the year ended 
31 December 2017 , all Ordinary Shares formerly held in treasury having been sold 
as at 31 December 2016. No further Ordinary Shares were purchased into treasury 
during the year ended 31 December 2017 and at 31 December 2017 none were held 
in treasury.
Purchase of Own Shares
A resolution is to be proposed at the AGM to renew the Company's powers to 
purchase its own shares. This is Resolution 10 in the Notice of Meeting, which is a 
special resolution. 
Although the current position of the Company is directed towards active 
expansion, the Directors nevertheless recommend that the general power to purchase 
shares continues to be held in reserve in case of need. The renewed authority sought 
by the Company is to purchase up to 14.99% of the voting shares that are in issue as 
at the date of the AGM. 
Revised Investment Policy
As described in more detail on page 9, the Board is proposing to amend the Existing 
Investment Policy and is seeking shareholder approval at the AGM to permit it to do 
so. Resolution 13 in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting will, if passed, permit 
the Company to adopt the Revised Investment Policy set out on page 9 with effect 
from the closing of the AGM.
Investment Management Contract
The Company entered into a new investment management contract with Phoenix on 
28 January 2016. 
Phoenix does not earn an ongoing annual management fee. It will be paid an 
annual performance fee equal to one third of the outperformance of the Company's 
net asset value total return (including dividends and adjusted for the impact of share 
buybacks and the issue of new shares) over the FTSE All-Share Total Return for 
each financial year. The first performance fee period ended on 31 December 2016 to 
coincide with the new financial year end. The Company's net asset value return is 
based on the weighted number, and net asset value, of the shares in issue over the 
relevant period. 
The total annual performance fee is capped at 4% per annum of the net asset 
value of the Company at the end of the relevant financial year, in the event that the 
net asset value per share has increased in absolute terms over the period, and 2% in 
the event that the net asset value per share has decreased in absolute terms over the 
period. Any outperformance that exceeds these caps will be carried forward and only 
paid if the Company outperforms, and the annual cap is not exceeded, in subsequent 
years.
The performance fee is subject to a high water mark so that no performance fee 
will be payable in any year until all underperformance of the Company's net asset 
value since the last performance fee was payable has been made up. The performance 
fee will also be subject to a clawback if over a rolling period of three years following 
the end of the last financial year for which a performance fee was payable the 
Company underperforms. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

Governance
The performance fee will be paid to Phoenix in Ordinary Shares (issued at the 
net asset value per share on the date of issue) and such shares must be retained by 
Phoenix for a minimum period of three years from the date of issue. 
No performance fee was earned in the year ended 31 December 2017 (period 
ended 31 December 2016: £Nil ).
Investment Management Engagement
The Remuneration and Management Engagement Committee has reviewed the 
position of the Investment Manager and recommended to the Board that the Phoenix 
investment management agreement should be continued. The process of evaluation 
is described in the report on Corporate Governance. Having taken into account 
the long-term performance of Phoenix, the prospects for the Company and the 
recommendations of the Remuneration Committee, the Board has concluded that 
continuing with the Phoenix investment management agreement is in the interests 
of shareholders. 
Recommendation Regarding Resolutions
The Directors consider that all the resolutions to be considered at the AGM are in 
the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and are likely to 
promote the success of the Company. The Directors unanimously recommend that 
shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions as they intend to do in respect of their 
own beneficial holdings.
Alternative Investment Fund Managers’ Directive (AIFMD)
The Company is classified as an alternative investment fund under AIFMD and is 
therefore required to have an alternative investment fund manager (AIFM). 
Because of the scale of its overall funds under management, Phoenix is classed 
as a full-scope AIFM. This brings the Company into the full scope of AIFMD, requiring 
inter alia the appointment of a Depository. 
The AIFM is required to make certain disclosures on its remuneration in respect 
of the AIFM’s relevant reporting period, which is the year ended 31 December 2017 . 
These disclosures are available on the AIFM’s website or are available on request from 
the AIFM. 
LEVERAGE (under AIFMD)
The AIFM is required to set a limit as a percentage of net assets for the Company 
utilising methods prescribed under AIFMD. These methods are known as the gross 
method and the commitment method. Under both methods the AIFM has set a 
maximum limit of leverage for the Company of 100%. This equates to nil leverage. 
As described in the Strategic Report the Phoenix policy is not to use leverage. The 
Company’s leverage under each of these methods at its year end is shown below:
Gross method Commitment method
Maximum leverage limit 100% 100%
Actual leverage at 31 December 2017 100% 100%
Depository and Custodian 
Since 28 January 2016 the positions of Depository and Custodian to the Company

Retail Distribution of Investment Company Shares
The Company has concluded that the distribution of its Ordinary Shares, being 
ordinary shares in an investment trust, is not restricted as a result of the FCA rules 
determining which investment products can be promoted to ordinary retail investors. 
The Company conducts its affairs so that there is no bar to a financial adviser 
recommending the Company’s shares to ordinary retail investors when the adviser 
deems it appropriate.
Company Secretary and Administrator
PraxisIFM Fund Services (UK) Limited is responsible for all administrative matters. It is 
appointed under a contract subject to 180 days’ notice. It receives a fee of one-twelfth 
of £40,000 plus one-twelfth of 0.075% of the Company’s net assets at the end of 
each calendar month on net assets up to £100 million and one-twelfth of 0.025% of 
net assets thereafter, subject to a minimum fee of £6,500 per month, plus VAT . 
Banking
The Company’s banker during the period ended 31 December 2016 was Coutts & 
Co. (Coutts). During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Company closed this 
account. A new account has been set up with Metro Bank, which became effective on 
1 January 2018. The Company held no cash balances with Metro Bank at 31 December 
2017 (2016: £10,078 held with Coutts). 
At 31 December 2017 the gross external borrowings of the Company were £Nil 
(2016: £Nil).

Settlement of Ordinary Share Transactions
Ordinary shares in the Company are settled by the CREST share settlement system.
Donations
The Company did not make any donations during the year under review.
Going Concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The 
directors have a reasonable expectation, after making enquiries, that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in existence for at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of this document. In reaching this conclusion, the directors have 
considered the liquidity of the Company’s portfolio of investments as well as its cash 
position, income and expense flows. As at 31 December 2017 , the Company held 
£4,506,798 in cash and £82,587 ,301 in quoted investments. It is estimated that the 
majority of the portfolio could be realised in seven days under normal conditions. 
The total operating expenses for the year ended 31 December 2017 were £376,255. 
At 31 March 2018, the Company has in excess of 250 years’ cover of operating and

Statement
The Corporate Governance 
Statement forms part of the 
Directors’ Report
20 April 2018
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance. The 
Board has put in place a framework for corporate governance which it believes is 
appropriate for the Company. In doing so, the Board has considered the principles and 
recommendations of the AIC Code of Corporate Governance (AIC Code) by reference 
to the AIC Corporate Governance Guide for Investment Companies (AIC Guide). 
The AIC Code, as explained by the AIC Guide, addresses all the principles set out in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, as well as setting out additional principles and 
recommendations on issues that are of specific relevance to the Company.
The Board considers that reporting in line with the principles and recommendations 
of the AIC Code, and by reference to the AIC Guide (which incorporates the UK 
Corporate Governance Code), will provide better information to shareholders.
The Company has complied with the recommendations of the AIC Code and the 
relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, except as set out below.
The UK Corporate Governance Code includes provisions relating to:
•  The role of the chief executive
•  Executive directors’ remuneration
•  The need for an internal audit function
For the reasons set out in the AIC Guide, and as explained in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board considers these provisions are not relevant to the 
position of the Company, being an externally managed investment company. In 
particular, all of the Company’s day-to-day management and administrative functions 
are outsourced to third parties. As a result, the Company has no executive directors, 
employees or internal operations. The Company has therefore not reported further in 
respect of these provisions.
There is no schedule of matters specified as being reserved for the Board, 
since the Board effectively reviews all aspects of the Company’s governance on an 
ongoing basis. 
The size and structure of the Board is such that it is considered unnecessary to 
identify a senior independent director other than the Chairman, who is de facto the 
senior independent director. 
The Board has considered the issue of boardroom diversity and in principle 
supports a policy of greater diversity. With only a small number of independent 
positions to fill, it has not to date proved possible to give practical effect to such a 
policy.
The Board
Board composition
The Board currently consists of a Chairman, Lord Flight, three independent directors, 
Mr Martin, The Honourable James Nelson and Mr Stevenson, and Mr Chapple, who is 
an employee of Phoenix. 
Mr Chapple joined the Board on 28 January 2016. Mr Stevenson joined the Board 
on 1 February 2016. Mr Martin has served on the Board since 8 September 2010. Lord 
Flight and The Honourable James Nelson joined the Board on 18 July 2011 and the 
Board appointed Lord Flight as Chairman from that date.
With the exception of Mr Chapple, all Board members are independent of the 
Investment Manager, Phoenix. Phoenix supplied fund management services to the 
Company throughout the year under a contract described under the “Management” 
section in the Directors’ Report. With this exception, there were no contracts 
subsisting during or at the end of the year in which a director was or is materially 
interested. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

in addition to the skills and commitment of the Investment Manager. The Chairman 
has wide and deep experience of the management and governance of investment 
trusts through the other relevant directorships that he holds and has held. The 
Honourable James Nelson and Mr Martin have a long track record of success in the 
fields of investment and asset management. The attributes that Mr Chapple and 
Mr Stevenson are able to bring to the Board were carefully considered at the time 
of their appointments. Mr Chapple is a member of a highly successful investment 
management team, while Mr Stevenson has a strong record of independent scrutiny 
of the markets and commentary upon them.  Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

34 Annual Report Governance
The Board confirms that its members are highly experienced, both generally 
and in respect of the direction of an investment trust, and that the backgrounds and 
seniority of the independent directors provide the Board with a high overall level of 
independence.
Evaluation of Board performance
The Board arranged for an objective evaluation of its performance during the year 
ended 31 December 2017 to be carried out by means of a written questionnaire 
circulated by the Secretary. This evaluation was carried out mainly during October-
November 2017 . The Board has given careful consideration to the detailed results of 
the survey and concluded that no major changes were required to the composition 
and operation of the Board. An independent evaluation is scheduled to be carried out 
in 2018.
Policy with regard to tenure and reappointment
The Board considers the benefits of experience and seniority to be particularly 
important and generally help promote independent performance by directors in 
carrying out their duties. Therefore the Board’s policy will not be to follow rigid 
procedures in the matter of requiring directors to cease to act either at the end of nine 
years’ service or on reaching the age of 70. 
The Directors have appointment letters which do not state any specific term. The 
Company’s Articles state that a third of the directors, or the nearest whole number not 
exceeding one-third, retire by rotation at each Annual General Meeting. The Company’s 
Articles require that directors are subject to re-election at a maximum interval of 
three years. Also, the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority require a director 
representing the Manager, in the Company’s case Mr Chapple, to stand for re-election 
at the AGM each year. 
Further to the above requirements, the Board recognises that different 
shareholders may have different views on issues of tenure and reappointment. 
Bearing this in mind, the Board has decided as a matter of Company policy that each 
Director will be subject to annual re-election by shareholders, although this is not a 
requirement of the Articles. 
How the Board operates
The Board has contractually delegated to external agencies, including the Investment 
Manager, the management of the investment portfolio, the custodial services (which 
include the safeguarding of the assets), the registration services and the accounting 
and company secretarial requirements. Each of these contracts was entered into after 
full and proper consideration of the quality and cost of services offered, including 
the financial control systems in operation in so far as they relate to the affairs of 
the Company. The Board undertakes no executive functions, but is responsible to 
shareholders for the overall strategy and performance of the Company. It reviews and 
evaluates all aspects of the Company’s performance and all functions performed by 
the service providers. 
There is no formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board. Such a schedule 
would be inappropriate since the Board decides on all aspects of the activities of the 
Company and is of sufficiently small size to decide upon most such matters as a full 
Board. 
A procedure has been adopted for directors, in the furtherance of their duties, to 
take independent professional advice at the expense of the Company.  Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

Governance
Attendance at Board meetings
The Board holds at least four meetings a year. 
During the year ended 31 December 2017 there were six meetings of the Board 
with a wide agenda. Lord Flight, The Hon James Nelson, Mr Martin and Mr Chapple 
attended all of these meetings. Mr Stevenson attended five meetings.
There were also five ad-hoc meetings to deal with placings, block listings and 
other matters; Mr Chapple attended all of these meetings, Lord Flight four meetings, 
Mr Martin three and The Honourable James Nelson and Mr Stevenson one meeting 
each. 
There were also two meetings of the Board’s committees, as detailed below. 
Board Committees
Since all Directors are non-executive and the Chairman is both non-executive and 
independent, the Board considers that all directors may normally be present at 
Committee meetings even if not formally part of the quorum. On certain occasions, as 
described below, it is inappropriate for the representative of the Investment Manager 
to be involved. The main purpose of the Committees in the context of the Company’s 
structure is that their existence ensures that time is set aside on a formal basis to 
cover certain important issues of governance, without those issues obscuring the 
flow of general Board business. Each committee has a separate chairman, as detailed 
under the separate headings below. The Committees have formal terms of reference, 
which are available to shareholders upon request from the Company’s registered office. 
Remuneration and Management Engagement Committee
The Board has formed a Remuneration and Management Engagement Committee, 
which considers the level of fees paid to directors and also considers issues related 
to the engagement of the Investment Manager and other service providers, making 
recommendations as appropriate to the Board. Since all the executive functions of 
the Company are delegated to service providers, issues concerning the remuneration 
of those functions relate to the payment of service providers rather than of directors 
or employees. The Committee therefore considers whether amounts paid to service 
providers are appropriate, with particular reference to those contracted to the Company 
on a continuing basis, including the Investment Manager, and whether those contracts 
should be maintained. The Honourable James Nelson is chairman of the Committee.
The criteria which are taken into consideration when reviewing the performance of 
the Investment Manager are as follows:
•  The performance of the Company 
•  Quality of team – the skills and particularly the experience of the team involved
•  Commitment to the investment trust business generally and to the Company in 
particular
•  Investment management skills – experience, track record, use of gearing, 
knowledge of currency issues and other investment related considerations
•  General management skills – understanding of administrative and financial issues 
and working relationship with the Administrator/Company Secretary
•  Shareholder relations – consciousness of and commitment to shareholders’ needs 
and objectives, share price awareness and discount management
•  Reasonableness of Management Agreement – fees, notice period and duties
When considering issues related to directors’ fees and the remuneration of service 
providers other than the Investment Manager, the Committee comprises all the 
directors. Mr Chapple stands down from the Committee when the management 
contract is under discussion.  Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

36 Annual Report Governance
The work of the Committee is further described, including the number of meetings 
and attendance at those meetings, in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Audit Committee
It is considered appropriate that issues related to the review of the annual financial 
statements, the appointment of the auditor and internal control procedures, including 
those of the Investment Manager and the Secretary, should be considered by those 
directors who are independent. Therefore the Board has formed an Audit Committee 
comprised of those directors who are independent of the investment manager. 
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Committee comprised Lord Flight, 
The Honourable James Nelson, Mr Martin and Mr Stevenson. Mr Martin is chairman 
of the Committee. 
The Audit Committee also reviews any non-audit services provided by the auditor. 
Under the Revised Ethical Code it is necessary for the tax compliance function to be 
separated from the audit role. The Company accordingly appointed Ernst & Young to 
provide tax compliance services in place of the auditor Grant Thornton UK LLP . The 
auditor performed no non-audit services during the year ended 31 December 2107 .
All members of the Committee are active in the investment markets and/or the 
investment trust sector and the Committee considers that all have recent and relevant 
financial experience.
The work of the Audit Committee during the year ended 31 December 2017 , and 
in relation to this annual report, is described in more detail in the Audit Committee 
Report.
Nominations Committee 
A Nominations Committee has been established by the Board, to identify and 
interview candidates for vacancies on the Board. It is established as a principle that 
this process should be led by the independent directors and the Committee comprises 
all independent directors of the Company. The Honourable James Nelson is chairman 
of the Committee, which will meet as and when required. 
The Nominations Committee met once during the year ended 31 December 2017 . 
There were no nominations to consider, but the Committee reviewed the Company’s 
overall policy on the size and make-up of the Board and considered the Board’s 
performance. 
Relations with Shareholders and with Investee Companies 
Relations with shareholders
The Investment Manager has meetings with the largest shareholders and reports back 
to the Board on these meetings. The Company encourages all shareholders to attend 
the Annual General Meeting and seeks to provide twenty working days’ notice of that 
meeting. The Notice of Meeting sets out the business of the AGM and any item not 
of an entirely routine nature is explained in the Directors’ Report. Separate resolutions 
are proposed for each substantive issue.
Exercise of voting powers
Since the Company’s investments are usually in large companies and form only a 
small proportion of their issued capital, the Company does not have a fixed policy 
always to vote its holdings, but treats each case on its merits. The Board is opposed 
to “mindless” voting carried out merely as a box-ticking exercise and prefers that all  Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

 Annual Report Governance 37
Governance
voting should be carefully considered. The Board delegates voting of a routine nature 
to the Investment Manager, but retains ultimate control and the Investment Manager 
consults the Board with regard to any voting on controversial issues. 
Internal Controls and Risk Management
Review of internal controls
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires the Board to review the effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management and system of internal controls. The Board 
recognises its ultimate responsibility for the Company’s system of internal controls 
and for monitoring its effectiveness. The system of internal controls is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It can 
provide only reasonable assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board 
has undertaken a review of risk management and internal control and has identified 
risk management controls in the key areas of business objectives, accounting, 
compliance, operations and secretarial as being matters of particular importance upon 
which it requires reports. The Board believes that the existing arrangements, set out 
below, represent an appropriate framework to meet the internal control requirements. 
By these procedures the directors have kept under review the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control system throughout the year and up to the date of 
this report.
Assessment by the Board of service providers
The Investment Manager and the Administrator are normally invited to attend each full 
meeting of the Board and have in practice done so. Between these meetings there 
is further, regular contact with the Investment Manager and the Administrator. The 
Investment Manager reports in writing to the Board on operational and compliance 
issues prior to each meeting, and otherwise as necessary. Directors receive and 
consider regular monthly reports from the Administrator, giving full details of all 
holdings in the portfolio and of all transactions and of all aspects of the financial 
position of the Company. The Administrator reports separately in writing to the Board 
concerning risks and internal control matters within its purview, including internal 
financial control procedures, compliance with investment trust rules and secretarial 
matters, highlighting any changes which have occurred. Additional ad hoc reports are 
received as required and Directors have access at all times to the advice and services 
of the Corporate Company Secretary, which is responsible to the Board for ensuring 
that Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are 
complied with. 
This contact with the Investment Manager and the Administrator enables the 
Board to monitor the Company's progress towards its objectives and encompasses 
an analysis of the risks involved. These matters are assessed on an ongoing basis 
through the year and again, formally, at year end and this process of assessment has 
continued up to the date of this report. 
Financial Aspects of Internal Control
The directors are responsible for the internal financial control systems of the Company 
and for reviewing their effectiveness. These aim to ensure the maintenance of 
proper accounting records, the reliability of the financial information upon which 
business decisions are made and which is used for publication and that the assets 
of the Company are safeguarded. In accordance with item C.2.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the directors are responsible for making a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Company and they have done so. As stated above, the 
Board has contractually delegated to external agencies the services the Company 
requires, but they are fully informed of the internal control framework established by  Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

the Investment Manager and the administrator to provide reasonable assurance on the 
effectiveness of internal financial controls. 
The key procedures include monthly production of management accounts and daily 
NAV calculations, monitoring of performance at regular board meetings, supervision 
by directors of the valuation of securities, segregation of the administrative function 
from that of securities and cash custody and of both from investment management, 
maintenance of appropriate insurance and adherence to physical and computer 
security procedures. In addition, the Board keeps under its own direct control all 
material payments out of the company other than for investment purposes.

of going concern and the report of the auditors are set out elsewhere in this

April 2018
The reports below on Remuneration Policy and Remuneration Policy Implementation 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. 
An ordinary resolution for the approval of the Remuneration Policy Implementation 
Report will be put forward at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The 
Remuneration Policy is required to be put before shareholders for approval once 
every three years (unless changed, in which case the changes must be approved) and 
shareholder approval is mandatory. At the AGM in 2017 the resolution to approve the 
Remuneration Policy was passed unanimously by show of hands; the proxy voting was 
5,034,384 in favour, 8,500 discretionary on the part of the chairman and 2,952 against. 
The Remuneration Policy Implementation Report is required to be put before 
shareholders each year. The shareholders’ vote on the Implementation Report is not 
binding upon the Company, but the Board and the Committee take account of any 
concerns that are expressed by shareholders. At the AGM in 2017 , the resolution 
to approve the Remuneration Implementation Report was passed unanimously by 
show of hands; the proxy voting on this resolution was 5,034,384 in favour, 8,500 
discretionary on the part of the Chairman and 2,952 against.

Remuneration Policy
Remuneration Committee
The Company has four wholly independent non-executive directors and a fifth director, 
Mr Chapple, who is employed by the Investment Manager. The Remuneration 
Committee comprises the whole Board when considering directors’ fees and the 
remuneration of contracted service suppliers other than the Investment Manager. 
Mr Chapple stands down when issues related to the Investment Manager’s fees are 
discussed. 
Policy on directors’ fees
It is the policy of the Board and the Committee that the remuneration of non-
executive directors should be fair and should reflect the experience, work involved, 
responsibilities and potential liabilities of the Board as a whole. The non-executive 
directors’ fees are determined within the maximum limit set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association, which currently stands at £150,000 per year. They are not 
eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share benefits, share options, long-term 
incentive schemes or other benefits. There are no arrangements in place with respect 
to compensation for loss of office or recruitment incentive remuneration and directors 
have no entitlement to any such payments. 
The Committee will keep the position under review and will consider an increase 
in the levels of remuneration if general market rates of remuneration for non-executive 
directors increase and if the Company’s performance and size warrants it.
Directors’ service contracts
The directors do not have service contracts. The directors have appointment letters 
which do not state any specific term. However, the Company’s Articles require that 
directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at a maximum interval of three 
years. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

Directors’ 
Responsibilities 
for the Annual 
Report
Lord Flight 
Chairman
April 2018
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report, 
the Remuneration Reports and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law in the United Kingdom requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Company for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates which are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with

Committee 
Report
Richard Martin 
Chairman of the Audit Committee
April 2018
Work of the Audit Committee
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Audit Committee met once. Mr Martin, 
Lord Flight, the Honourable James Nelson and Mr Stevenson attended the meeting. 
Since 31 December 2017 the Committee has again met, on two occasions. The 
auditor attended both meetings, first to discuss the audit plan with the Committee and 
then to discuss with them in detail the results of the audit of the financial statements. 
Financial statements and significant accounting matters
In its meetings since 31 December 2017 , the Audit Committee considered the 
following significant accounting issues in relation to the Company’s financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2017:
Valuation of investments
The Company holds virtually all of its assets in quoted investments. The valuation 
of these investments is the most material matter in the production of the financial 
statements. The Audit Committee reviewed the procedures in place for ensuring 
accurate valuation of investments and discussed the valuation of the Company’s 
investments at the year end with the Investment Manager and the Secretary. The 
results of the audit in this area were discussed with the external auditor and there 
were no significant issues arising from this.
Financial statement presentation
The Audit Committee obtained assurances from the Investment Manager and 
the Secretary that the financial statements had been prepared appropriately and 
questioned the external auditor on this area. There were no unresolved issues.
Going concern
The Audit Committee reviewed the Company’s financial resources and concluded that 
it is appropriate for the Company’s financial statements to be prepared on a going 
concern basis as described in the Directors’ Report.
Conclusion with respect to the annual report and financial 
statements
The Audit Committee has concluded that the annual report for the year ended 
31 December 2017 , taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
business model, strategy and performance. The Audit Committee has reported its 
conclusions to the Board of directors. The Audit Committee reached this conclusion 
through a process of review of the document and enquiries to the various parties 
involved in the production of the annual report.
Provision of non-audit services
During the year the Audit Committee approved a non-audit service policy to ensure 
that the auditor’s independence and objectivity are not impaired. From 1 January 
2017 the auditor has been unable to continue to provide tax compliance services in 
accordance with the revised Ethical Code. The Company appointed Ernst & Young to 
provide tax compliance services in place of the auditor. 
The tax compliance services had been the only non-audit work performed by the 
auditor. No non-audit work was performed for the Company by the auditor during the 
year ended 31 December 2017 and the Committee has no current plans to seek any 
non-audit services from the auditor. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

Effectiveness of external audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the external 
audit process. The Audit Committee received a presentation of the audit plan from the 
external auditor prior to the commencement of the audit and a presentation of the 
results of the audit following completion of the main audit testing. 
In accordance with the EU Directive that a review of the auditor be carried out 
after 10 years’ service, a full review of the audit service on a competitive basis was 
conducted during 2016. The Committee gave careful consideration to proposals put 
forward by Grant Thornton and by a competitor firm. After discussion, it concluded that 
the appointment of Grant Thornton should be continued, subject to approval by the 
Board and the shareholders of the Company. 
In accordance with professional guidelines, the senior statutory auditor, currently 
Christopher Smith, is rotated after at most five years. The current senior statutory 
auditor started working on the audit of the Company in 2014.
The renewed appointment of Grant Thornton is potentially for a further period 
up to 31 December 2023, the maximum permitted by the EU Directive, but always 
subject to annual confirmation. The Audit Committee performed a further review of the 
external auditor following the presentation of the results of the latest audit. The review 
included a discussion of the audit process and the ability of the external auditor to 
fulfil its role. Having reviewed the position, the Committee recommended to the Board 
that a resolution be put to shareholders at the AGM in 2018 for the re-appointment of 
Grant Thornton.

Opinion
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Aurora Investment Trust plc (the 
‘Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 , which comprise the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Cash Flow Statement and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
In our opinion, the financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of its profit for the year then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) 
(ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the ‘ Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ 
section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the 
UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or 
for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability 
statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual 
report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you whether we have 
anything material to add or draw attention to:
•  the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 22 and 23 that describe the 
principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
•  the directors’ confirmation, set out on page 37 of the annual report that they 
have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
•  the directors’ statement, set out on page 31 of the financial statements, about 
whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification

will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
Overview of our audit approach
•  Overall materiality: £874,000 which represents 1% of the Company’s net assets;
•  Key audit matters were identified as completeness and occurrence of investment 
income and existence, ownership and valuation of investments; and
•  Our audit approach was a risk based substantive audit focused on investments 
at the year end and investment income recognised during the year. There was no 
significant change in our approach from the prior period.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the 
overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in the audit
Completeness and occurrence of investment 
income
The Company’s investment objective is 
to provide shareholders with long term 
returns through capital and income growth. 
Investment income is the Company’s major 
source of revenue and a material balance in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Accordingly, we identified the completeness 
and occurrence of investment income from the 
investment portfolio as a significant risk, which 
was one of the most significant assessed risks 
of material misstatement. 
Our audit work included, but was not 
restricted to:
•  assessing whether the Company’s 
accounting policy for revenue recognition 
is in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and the Statement 
of Recommended Practice (the ‘SORP’) 
issued by the Association of Investment 
Companies (‘ AIC’);
•  substantively testing income transactions 
to assess if they were recognised in 
accordance with the accounting policy; and
•  for investments held during the year, 
obtaining the ex-dividend dates and rates 
for dividends declared during the year 
from an independent source and agreeing 
the expected dividend entitlements to 
those recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and agreeing 
dividend income recognised by the 
Company to an independent source. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in the audit
The Company’s accounting policy on income 
from investments is shown in note 1(c) to the 
financial statements and related disclosures are 
included in note 2.
Key observations
Our testing did not identify any material 
misstatements in the completeness and 
occurrence of investment income recognised 
during the year.
Existence, ownership and valuation of 
investments 
The Company’s principal investment objective 
is to provide shareholders with long term 
returns through capital and income growth 
by investing in a concentrated portfolio of UK 
equities. The investment portfolio at £83m is 
a significant material balance in the statement 
of financial position at year end and the main 
driver of the Company’s performance. We 
therefore identified the existence, ownership 
and valuation of investments as a significant 
risk, which was one of the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not 
restricted to:
•  assessing whether the Company’s 
accounting policy for investments is in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and the SORP and testing 
whether management have accounted for 
valuation in accordance with that policy;
•  confirming the existence and ownership of 
investments through agreeing the holdings 
listed in the portfolio at year end to an 
independent confirmation we received 
directly from the Company’s custodian; and
•  independently pricing 100% of the listed 
equity portfolio by obtaining the bid prices 
from independent market sources and 
calculating the total valuation based on 
Company investment holdings, which was 
agreed to the financial statements.
The Company’s accounting policy on 
investments is shown in note 1(b) to the 
financial statements and related disclosures 
are included in note 9. The Audit Committee 
identified valuation of investments as a 
significant accounting issue in its report on 
page 46, where the Committee also described 
the action that it has taken to address this 
issue. 
Key observations
Our testing did not identify any material 
misstatements in the valuation of the 
Company’s investment portfolio as at the year 
end or in the existence or the Company’s 
ownership of the underlying investments at the 
year end.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements 
that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, 
timing and extent of our work and in evaluating the results of that work.
We determined materiality for the audit of the financial statements as a whole to 
be £874,000, which is 1% of the Company’s net assets. This benchmark is considered  Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

 Annual Report Governance 51
Governance
the most appropriate because net assets, which is primarily composed of the 
Company’s investment portfolio, is considered to be the key driver of the Company’s 
total return performance.
Materiality for the current year is higher than the level we determined for the 
period ended 31 December 2016 reflecting the increase in the Company’s net assets 
at the current year end. 
We use a different level of materiality, performance materiality, to drive the extent 
of our testing and this was set at 75% of financial statement materiality. 
We also determine a lower level of specific materiality for certain areas such as 
investment income, directors’ remuneration and related party transactions. 
We determined the threshold at which we will communicate misstatements to 
the audit committee to be £43,700. In addition we will communicate misstatements 
below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding 
of the Company’s business, its environment and risk profile. The day-to-day 
management of the Company’s investment portfolio, the custody of its investments 
and the maintenance of the Company’s accounting records is outsourced to third party 
service providers. Therefore our audit work was focused on: 
•  Obtaining an understanding of, and evaluating, relevant internal controls at the 
Company’s third-party service providers. This included an evaluation of the internal 
control reports detailing the description, design and operating effectiveness of 
internal controls at the relevant third-party service providers; and 
•  Performing substantive testing by obtaining direct confirmations on existence, 
ownership and valuation of the investments; and agreeing the investment income 
to an independent source for completeness and occurence.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to 
read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material 
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to 
specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as 
uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that 
those items meet the following conditions:
•  Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 45 – the statement given by the 
directors that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a

•  Audit committee reporting set out on pages 46 and 47 – the section describing 
the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit committee; or
•  Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
set out on page 32 – the parts of the statement required under the Listing Rules 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Our opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006 are unmodified
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
•  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements; and
•  the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report under the Companies 
Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in 
the strategic report or the directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
•  the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on 
page 44, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal 
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
We are responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements taken as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable 
risk that material misstatements of the financial statements may not be detected, 
even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with the ISAs 
(UK). Our audit approach is a risk-based approach and is explained more fully in the ‘ An 
overview of the scope of our audit’ section of our audit report.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters which we are required to address
We were appointed by the members on 1 January 2000. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the 
firm is 19 years.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Company and we remain independent of the Company in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.

60 Annual Report Finance
1. Accounting Policies
Basis of Accounting
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which comprise standards and 
interpretations approved by the IASB and International Accounting Standards and 
Standing Interpretations Committee interpretations approved by the IASC that remain 
in effect, and to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union. 
Under IFRS, the AIC Statement of Recommended Practice “Financial Statements 
of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts” issued in November 2014 
and updated in January 2017 has no formal status, but the Company adheres to the 
guidance of the SORP . 
The accounting policies are unchanged from those used in the last annual financial 
statements except where otherwise stated. The particular accounting policies adopted 
are described below:
a. Accounting Convention
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the 
measurement of fair value of investments. 
b.  Investments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the Financial Instrument and are measured 
initially of fair value. Subsequent measurement of financial assets and financial 
liabilities is described below.
As the Company’s business is investing in financial assets with a view to 
profiting from their total return in the form of increases in fair value, investments 
are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition in accordance 
with IAS 39. At this time, fair value is the consideration given, excluding material 
transaction or other dealing costs associated with the investment. 
After initial recognition such investments are valued at fair value. For quoted 
investments this is established by reference to bid, or last, market prices depending 
on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted. Gains or losses 
are recognised in the capital column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income. All 
purchases and sales of investments are accounted for on a trade date basis. 
c. Income from Investments
Investment income from ordinary shares is accounted for on the basis of ex-dividend 
dates. Income from fixed interest shares and securities is accounted for on an 
accruals basis using the effective interest method. Special Dividends are assessed 
on their individual merits and are credited to the capital column of the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income if the substance of the payment is a return of capital; with this 
exception all investment income is taken to the revenue column of the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. Income from gilts and bank interest receivable is accounted 
for on an accruals basis using the effective yield.
d. Capital Reserves
The Company is not precluded by its Articles from making any distribution of capital 
profits by way of dividend, but the Directors have no current plans to do so. Profits and 
losses on disposals of investments are taken to the other capital (gains on disposal) 
reserve. Revaluation movements are taken to the investment holding reserve via the 
capital column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

 Annual Report Finance 61
Finance
e. Investment Management Fees, Finance Costs and Other Costs
Performance-related fees are charged to other capital reserves (gains on disposal) 
via the capital column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Other costs are 
normally charged to revenue, unless there is a compelling reason to charge to capital. 
Tax relief in respect of costs allocated to capital is credited to capital via the capital 
column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income on the marginal basis. 
f. Taxation
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims 
from, fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting period, that are unpaid 
at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary 
differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. In addition, tax losses available to 
be carried forward as well as other income tax credits are assessed for recognition as 
deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates 
that are expected to apply at their respective period of realisation, provided they are 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax liabilities are 
always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that they will be able to be offset against future taxable income.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax 
expense in the income statement, except where they relate to items that are charged 
or credited directly to equity. 
g. Foreign currency
The currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company 
operates (the functional currency) is pounds sterling (“Sterling”), which is also the 
presentational currency of the Company. Transactions involving currencies other than 
Sterling are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the transaction date. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary items and non-monetary assets and liabilities, which are 
fair valued and which are denominated in foreign currencies, are retranslated at the 
closing rates of exchange. Such exchange differences are included in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income and allocated to capital if of a capital nature or to revenue 
if of a revenue nature. Exchange differences allocated to capital are taken to gains on 
disposal or investment holding losses, as appropriate. 
h. Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and Cash Equivalents in the Cash Flow Statement comprise cash held at bank.
i. Dividends payable to equity shareholders
Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised in the Statement of Changes 
in Equity when they are paid, or have been approved by shareholders in the case of a 
final dividend.
j. Judgements and estimations
The directors have reviewed matters requiring estimation and/or judgement. The 
preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, 
estimations and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities 
as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenue and expenses 
during the year. However, the nature of the estimation means that actual outcomes 
could differ from those estimates. There are no judgements or estimates that have had 
a significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

6. Taxation continued
Deferred Tax
The Company has tax losses of £9,182,061 (2016: £8,805,985) in respect of 
management expenses, equivalent to a potential tax saving of £1,560,950 at the 
prospective tax rate of 17% (2016: £1,673,137 at the then prospective rate of 
19%) and tax losses of £1,490,706 (2016: £1,490,706) in respect of loan interest, 
equivalent to a potential tax saving of £253,420 at the prospective tax rate of 17% 
(2016: £283,234 at the then prospective tax rate of 19%). 
These amounts are available to offset future taxable revenue. A deferred tax asset 
has not been recognised in respect of those expenses and will be recoverable only to 
the extent that the Company has sufficient future taxable revenue.

of 2,352,913 new shares. Under the 2016 prospectus up to 55 million shares could be 
issued from time to time during the period from 30 March 2016 to 21 March 2017 . The 
price at which shares could be issued under that programme was the NAV per share

10. Share Capital continued
On 5 September 2017 the Company issued a new prospectus. This provided for an 
initial placing and offer for subscription and for a new placing programme. Authority 
to issue shares pursuant to these proposals was granted by a General Meeting on 
28 September 2017 . The price at which shares can be issued under this prospectus 
is the NAV per share at the time of issue plus a premium of 1 .25%. The initial placing 
and offer for subscription was carried out on 6 October 2017 , raising £9,125,586, net 
of commission but before professional and other fees, for the issue of 4,565,650 
new shares.
Block listings
The Company had also put in place during 2016 a block listing facility for up to 
5,043,177 new shares, to meet market demand arising from time to time. Under this 
facility a total of 4,092,635 new shares were issued in the period January-August 2017 , 
raising £7 ,858,271, net of commission.
On 16 October 2017 the Company established a new block listing facility for up 
to 8,160,700 new shares, also to meet market demand arising from time to time. 
Under this facility a total of 1,668,000 new shares were issued during the period 
October-December 2017 , raising £3,441,881, net of commission.
At 31 December 2017 , the Company had 42,471,503 (2016: 29,792,305) shares 
in issue. The number of voting shares at 31 December was 42,471,503 (2016: 
29,792,305).
11. Total Equity
Total Equity includes, in addition to Share Capital, the following reserves:
Capital Redemption Reserve. When any shares are redeemed or cancelled, a 
transfer of realised profit must be made to this reserve in order to maintain the level of 
capital that is not distributable. 
Share Premium Account. When shares are issued at a premium to their nominal 
value, the “capital profit” arising on their allotment must be held in a Share Premium 
Account, which is not distributable in the ordinary course and may be utilised only in 
certain limited circumstances.
Capital profits arising from the Company’s investment transactions are held as 
Capital Reserves, subdivided between Gains on Disposal for profits arising upon sales 
of investments and Investment Holding gains/losses for portfolio revaluations. The 
movements on this account are analysed in note 12 below. 
The Company’s Revenue Reserves are the net profits that have arisen from the 
Company’s revenue income in the form of dividends and interest, less operating 
expenses and dividends paid out to the Company’s shareholders. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

17. Financial Instruments – Risk Analysis
The general risk analysis undertaken by the Board and its overall policy approach to 
risk management are set out in the Strategic Report. Issues associated with portfolio 
distribution and concentration risk are discussed in the Investment Policy section of 
the Strategic Report. This note, which is incorporated in accordance with accounting 
standard IFRS7 , examines in greater detail the identification, measurement and 
management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments and how 
those risks potentially affect the performance and financial position of the Company. 
The risks concerned are categorised as follows:
a. Potential Market Risks, which are principally 
 i. Currency Risk 
 ii. Interest Rate Risk and 
 iii. Other Price Risk. 
b. Liquidity Risk
c. Credit Risk
Each is considered in turn below:
A (i) Currency Risk
The portfolio as at 31 December 2017 was invested entirely in sterling securities and 
there was no currency risk arising from the possibility of a fall in the value of sterling 
impacting upon the value of investments or income. 
The Company had no foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 2017 or 
31 December 2016 and no sensitivity analysis is presented for this risk.
A (ii) Interest Rate Risk
The Company did not hold fixed interest securities at 31 December 2017 or 
31 December 2016. 
With the exception of cash, no interest rate risks arise in respect of any current 
asset. All cash held as a current asset is sterling denominated, earning interest at the 
bank’s or custodian’s variable interest rates. 
The Company had no borrowings at 31 December 2017 or 31 December 2016. 
A (iii) Other Price Risk
The principal price risk for the Company is the price volatility of shares that are owned 
by the Company. As described in the Investment Manager’s Review, the Company 
spreads its investments across different sectors and geographies, but, as shown by 
the Portfolio Analysis in the Business Review, the Company may maintain relatively 
strong concentrations in particular sectors selected by the Investment Manager. 
B Liquidity Risk
Liquidity Risk is considered to be small, because the portfolio is invested in readily 
realisable securities. As a consequence, cash flow risks are also considered to be 
small. The Manager estimates that, under normal market conditions and without 
causing excessive disturbance to the prices of the securities concerned, the majority 
of the portfolio could be realised within 7 days. 
C Credit Risk
The Company invests in quoted equities and fixed interest securities. The Company’s 
investments are held by BNP (“the Depository”), which is a large international bank 
with a high reputation. The Company’s normal practice is to remain fully invested 
at most times and not to hold very large quantities of cash. At 31 December 2017 , 
cash at bank comprised £4,506,798 (2016: £1,393,316) held by the Depository. 
At 31 December 2017 no cash was held at Coutts & Co (2016: £10,078) the account 
with Coutts & Co having been closed. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA

17. Financial Instruments – Risk Analysis continued
Credit Risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting 
settlement. This risk is considered to be very low because transactions are almost 
always undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis with member firms of the 
London Stock Exchange. 
D Capital management policies and procedures
The Company’s capital management objectives are:
•  to ensure the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and
•  to provide an adequate return to shareholders
by pursuing investment policies commensurately with the level of risk.
The Company monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity, less 
cash and cash equivalents as presented on the face of the statement of financial 
position.
The Company sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing 
structure, i.e. equity and financial liabilities. The Company manages the capital 
structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions 
and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust 
the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders (within the statutory limits applying to investment trusts), return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets.
18. Fair Value Hierarchy
Under IFRS13 investment companies are required to disclose the fair value hierarchy 
that classifies financial instruments measured at fair value at one of three levels 
according to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values.
Classification Input
Level 1 Valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
Level 2 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs 
other than quoted prices included within Level 1
Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are 
not based on observable market data
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.

significant impact on the Company.
20. Post Balance Sheet Date Events

Leverage An alternative word for “Gearing” .
Under AIFMD, leverage is any method by which the 
exposure of an AIF is increased through borrowing of cash 
or securities or leverage embedded in derivative positions.
Under AIFMD, leverage is broadly similar to gearing, 
but is expressed as a ratio between the assets (excluding 
borrowings) and the net assets (after taking account of 
borrowing). Under the gross method, exposure represents 
the sum of the Company’s positions after deduction of 
cash balances, without taking account of any hedging or 
netting arrangements. Under the commitment method, 
exposure is calculated without the deduction of cash 
balances and after certain hedging and netting positions 
are offset against each other.

average net assets of £70.282m (2016: £35.443m).
Ordinary Shares The Company’s ordinary shares in issue.

deliver returns to shareholders and to spread risk.
