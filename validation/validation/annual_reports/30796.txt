Chairman’s Statement 
A year of opportunity
Key points in this section:
 › £998.7m sales and £235.5m 
operating profit; 6% organic 
increase in both* 
 › Acquisitions add 20% to sales 
and 14% to profit
 › T otal Ordinary dividend increased

Introduction
My last full year as Chairman was a 
successful and eventful one. In May we 
were delighted to welcome Gestra to the 
Group. Gestra’ s market-leading automated 
boiler controls and strong market position in 
Germany increases the market share of our 
Steam Specialties division, improves access 
to the German market and provides potential 
to grow Gestra’ s presence outside its core 
German market. T wo months later, in July, 
electrical process heating and temperature 
management solutions provider, Chromalox, 
joined the Group. Industrial electrical heating 
solutions are complementary to our steam 
business and Chromalox’ s direct sales 
business model, based around application 
selling, diverse customer base and broad 
market diversity, make it an ideal fit. 
Three other important milestones have also 
been reached. In 2017, Group sales reached 
£1 billion, the Group’ s underlying trading 
margin, excluding acquisitions, exceeded 
24% and the proposed dividend marks the 
50th consecutive year of progress. 
The events of 2017 demonstrate that we 
are not content to let external circumstances 
dictate Group performance and outcomes, 
but are actively engaged in engineering 
opportunities for sustainable growth. I am 
deeply proud to have been the Chairman of 
this great Company for over nine years and 
in my last full year I am pleased to be able 
to report that, despite a very busy year, we 
maintained our rigorous focus on organic 
growth and delivered another strong set of 
results, outperforming our markets. 
Financial highlights
Sales for the year were £998.7 million, an 
organic increase of 6%; exceeding global 
industrial production growth of 3.4%. 
Favourable currency movements increased 
sales on translation by 5% and acquisitions 
added 20%. As a result, reported sales 
were 32% higher than 2016. Our Watson-
Marlow Fluid T echnology business had 
another strong year, which saw organic 
sales up 10%. The Spirax Sarco business 
also performed well with organic sales up 
5% and gains in all segments. Gestra, which 
is reported within the Spirax Sarco Steam 
Specialties division, performed in line with 
our expectations as did Chromalox, which 
is reported as a separate division within the 
Spirax Sarco business.
Group adjusted operating profit increased 
by 6% on an organic basis to a reported 
£235.5 million. Watson-Marlow delivered 
organic profit growth of 6%, with the Steam 
Specialties division up 6% organically . 
Favourable translation and transaction 
currency movements increased adjusted 
operating profit by 9% while acquisitions 
added 14%, resulting in adjusted operating 
profit being up 30%. The adjusted operating 
margin fell by 20 bps, to 23.6% as a result 
of the dilutionary effect of the two large 
acquisitions made in the year . Excluding the 
effects of acquisitions the underlying margin 
increased 90 bps to 24.7%.
The Group adjusted pre-tax profit was 
£229.1 million, 29% ahead at reported 
currency . Adjusted basic earnings per 
share was 29% ahead at 220.5 pence 
(2016: 171.5 pence).
The pre-tax profit on a statutory basis was 
£192.5 million (2016: £171.4 million) and 
includes certain items, explained in Note 2. 
The statutory basic earnings per share was 
214.4 pence (2016: 165.0 pence). 
Cash and dividends
During the year, we had a cash outflow 
of £484 million to fund the acquisitions of 
Gestra and Chromalox. As a result, at 31st 
December 2017 we had a net debt balance 
of £373.6 million, compared with net cash of 
£27.4 million at 31st December 2016; a net 
debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times. 
The interim dividend for 2017, paid on 10th 
November 2017, was raised by 13% to 
25.5 pence per share (2016: 22.5 pence 
per share). The Board is recommending 
an increase in the final dividend of 16% to 
62.0 pence per share (2016: 53.5 pence). 
Subject to approval of the final dividend by 
shareholders at the AGM on 15th May 2018, 
the total Ordinary dividend for the year is 
therefore 87.5 pence per share, an increase 
of 15% over the 76.0 pence per share for 
the prior year.
Corporate governance
As we announced on 14th February, I 
have indicated my intention to retire from 
the Board after this year’ s Annual General 
Meeting on 15th May 2018 (AGM), having 
served as a Director for 16 years and as 
Chairman for the past nine years. 
It is proposed that Jamie Pike, the current 
Senior Independent Director who joined the 
Board in 2014, will take over as Chairman 
with effect from the close of the AGM. As a 
consequence of Jamie’ s appointment, it 
“ The events of 2017 demonstrate that we are not 
content to let external circumstances dictate 
Group performance and outcomes, but are 
actively engaged in engineering opportunities for 
sustainable growth.”
Bill Whiteley  
Chairman
*  Unless otherwise stated, all profit measures exclude certain 
items, as set out and explained in the Financial Review and 
in Note 2 on page 129. Organic measures are at constant

 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 05
is also proposed that Clive Watson be 
appointed as the Senior Independent Director . 
Clive will continue as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. All appointments are subject to 
the re-election of Directors at the AGM.
Jamie Pike will, on appointment as 
Chairman, resign as a member of the 
Audit Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee in compliance with the 
Code. He will Chair the Board and the 
Nomination Committee.
In anticipation of these changes we initiated 
a search for an additional Independent Non-
Executive Director and on 6th March we 
announced that Peter France will join the Board 
with immediate effect. Peter will be a member 
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees. From 2008 to July 2017, Peter 
was Chief Executive at Rotork plc.
Employees
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
welcome our new Gestra and Chromalox 
colleagues to the Group and to thank all our 
employees throughout the world for their 
individual and collective contributions that 
have enabled us to deliver another excellent 
set of results in 2017.
Summary and outlook
Global industrial production growth rates, 
which are a good indicator of our market 
conditions, strengthened throughout the year 
resulting in growth of 3.4% in 2017 compared 
with 0.9% in 2016 and 0.3% in 2015. 
Current indications for the industrial 
production growth rate in 2018 suggest 
that it will be at a similar level to that seen in 
2017. We will remain focused on engineering 
opportunities for self-generated growth, 
through the rigorous implementation of our 
strategy. As we integrate and develop the 
recent acquisitions, we are also laying the 
foundations for their future organic growth.
Following two years of foreign exchange 
tailwinds, sterling has strengthened against 
most of the currencies that we trade in and 
therefore we expect a currency headwind 
in 2018. If current exchange rates were to 
prevail for the remainder of the year, 2017’ s 
revenues would have been 2% lower and 
trading profit would have been 4% lower. 
Movements in exchange rates are often 
volatile and unpredictable, therefore the 
actual impact could be significantly different.
For 2018, given the recent changes to the 
composition of the Group and the volatility 
of the main currencies we trade in, we have 
chosen to provide additional information 
in this outlook. Considering the current 
industrial production growth rates, we would 
expect a similar organic growth performance 
in the Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties 
division as seen in 2017. As we continue 
the integration of the Gestra and Chromalox 
acquisitions, we expect these companies 
to grow at rates similar to global industrial 
production growth, over their full year 2017 
sales of £223 million. Watson-Marlow’ s 
revenue growth was higher than expected in 
2017 as a number of larger orders booked in 
late 2016 were shipped in 2017. Therefore, 
we maintain our expectations of mid-to-high 
single-digit organic sales growth for the 
Watson-Marlow Fluid T echnology business 
in 2018. 
Excluding acquisitions, the 2017 trading 
margin improved by 90 bps to 24.7%, 
due to the effects of positive exchange 
movements. As anticipated, the underlying 
margins remained constant as we reinvested 
operational gearing gains in the business. 
Looking forward, we will continue investing 
in the business for growth while also taking 
actions to mitigate the adverse transactional 
currency effects on margins that could occur 
if current exchange rates prevail throughout 
this year. Therefore, for Chromalox and the 
We confirm that to the best  
of our knowledge:
 − The Financial Statements, prepared 
in accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation, taken as 
a whole. 
 − The Annual Report for 2017, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides 
the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’ s 
performance, business model 
and strategy.
 − The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will 
be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the three-year period to 31st 
December 2020. For the full Viability 
Statement, see page 80.
 − The Annual Report contains the 
information required for compliance 
with the Companies, Partnerships 
and Groups (and Non-Financial 
Reporting) Regulations 2016. 
The Non-Financial Information 
Statement comprises information 
found on pages 12 to 15 (business 
model), pages 30 to 33 (risks), and 
pages 52 to 61 (environmental 
matters, the Company’ s employees, 
social matters, respect for human 
rights, and anti-corruption and anti-
bribery matters).

by the Board on 14th March 2018.

Steam Specialties division, excluding Gestra,

higher investments for growth in Watson-
Marlow and Gestra, we anticipate a small 
margin decline for these businesses in 2018, 
similar to Watson-Marlow’ s organic decline 
in 2017.
Assuming no significant deterioration in 
trading conditions, the Board expects to 
make further progress in 2018.

Group Chief Executive’s Statement 
Implementing our strategy for growth
Key points in this section:
 ›  Successfully implementing our 
strategy for organic growth
 › Acquisition of two outstanding 
businesses: Gestra 
and Chromalox
 › Delivering long-term 
sustainable value 
for stakeholders
less likely to be cut in times of recession. 
This “self-generated” element of our 
business, combined with the high proportion 
of sales that derive from end users’ 
maintenance and operating budgets, and 
the wide diversity of the markets we serve, 
both geographically and by industry sector, 
makes our business highly resilient, although 
not immune, to the vagaries of the markets.
Strategy implementation
Four years ago we undertook an extensive 
strategic review and developed our strategy 
for growth, the aim of which is to deliver 
self-generated growth that outperforms our 
markets. We identified six Group strategic 
themes, which help us to do better what we 
already do well:
 − increase direct sales effectiveness through 
sector focus;
 − develop the knowledge and skills of our 
expert sales and service teams;
 − broaden our global presence;
 − leverage R&D investments;
 − optimise supply chain effectiveness; and
 − operate sustainably and help improve our 
customers’ sustainability.
During 2017, notable progress was made in 
the implementation of our strategic priorities, 
which was a significant contributing factor to 
the good financial results and strong organic 
growth achieved during the year:
 − We continued increasing the alignment 
between our direct sales force and our 
target industries of Food & Beverage; 
Healthcare; Pharmaceutical; Oil, Gas 
& Chemical; and OEM customers, 
supported by developments in our R&D 
processes, manufacturing capabilities, 
marketing and training materials. In the 
Spirax-Sarco Steam Specialties division, 
the organic growth rate of these priority 
sectors strongly outpaced the growth 
rate of the other sectors. These priority 
sectors now represent almost 50% of 
the division’ s sales, compared to 40% in 
2014. Also noteworthy, the strategically 
prioritised Controls and Thermal Energy 
Management (TEM) products, which 
represent around 40% of sales and 
are the main constituents of our self-
generated solution sales, are growing at 
a much faster pace than the traditional 
Condensate Management products. 
 − We continued to strengthen the 
knowledge and skills of our sales and 
service teams and to develop our pipeline 
of talent. By the end of the year the 
training materials of the Spirax Sarco 
Academy, which was established in 2016 
to oversee the learning and development 
of the Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties 
division, were available in 16 languages 
and we had rolled out the Academy’ s 
initial programmes to almost 1,100 
customer-facing employees. Building on 
the success of our UK Steam Specialties 
award winning graduate programme, we 
established a Global Group Graduate 
Programme to attract and develop 
talented young engineers.
 − We again expanded our geographical 
reach, with four new operating units 
commencing trading at the start of the 
year: Spirax Sarco East Africa (Kenya), 
Watson-Marlow Indonesia, Watson-
Marlow Thailand and Watson-Marlow 
Vietnam, and established a Spirax 
Sarco direct sales presence in Greece, 
Sri Lanka and Morocco, and in UAE to 
support Watson-Marlow sales expansion 
in the Middle East. In recognition of 
our successful international growth, in 
2017 Watson-Marlow Ltd and BioPure 
T echnology Ltd won a combined Queen’ s 
Award for Enterprise, in the International 
Trade category.
“ Notable progress was made in the implementation 
of our strategic priorities, which was a significant 
contributing factor to the good financial results and 
strong organic growth achieved during the year.”

Introduction
Our Company purpose is to help our 
customers and end users implement 
environmentally-friendly engineered solutions 
for energy savings, process efficiency, 
product quality and improvements in plant 
health, safety and regulatory compliance, 
and to engineer sustainable value for 
stakeholders. We do this through having 
the right products, in the right place, at the 
right time, and an extensive global network 
of over 1,600 expert sales and service 
engineers with the knowledge and skills 
required to understand customers’ difficult 
operational challenges and design bespoke 
engineered solutions to resolve them.
Our direct sales business model is highly 
effective at uncovering opportunities to 
improve customers’ steam systems, 
electrical heating and temperature 
management systems, or fluid path 
processes. As they walk our customers’ 
facilities, our specialist engineers are 
able to identify unrecognised needs. 
The engineered solutions required to meet 
these needs generally have a relatively short 
payback period of around 24 months or 
less and, crucially, are typically paid for out 
of our customers’ operational budgets. 
Purchasing decisions are therefore made at 
operational level from budgets, which are  Strategic Report

 − T o further develop the capacity and 
efficiency of our supply chain, we 
accelerated the capital investment 
programmes designed to modernise and 
renew our manufacturing equipment and 
completed the expansion of our state-
of-the-art manufacturing facility in China. 
We also established a new distribution 
hub for the Steam Specialties division in 
Singapore, which is designed to improve 
the efficient distribution of products 
and increase customer service levels 
throughout the Asia Pacific region.
 − The implementation of the Group 
Sustainability Strategy remained a key 
priority and good progress was made 
in a number of areas. During the year 
we increased the number of Health and 
Safety professionals within the business, 
rolled out our Supplier Sustainability Code 
to direct suppliers of our sales companies, 
established a network of community 
engagement champions across the Group 
and launched a Community Engagement 
Award to recognise and raise awareness 
of the activities that are taking place 
across the Group. We also reduced our 
global carbon emissions intensity by 4%.
Acquisitions
Our Group acquisitions strategy outlines our 
key acquisition criteria. Acquisitions should:
 − have the potential to create significant 
shareholder value and either increase 
our addressable market into related 
sectors or expand the capabilities of our 
niche businesses through new skills, 
technologies or geographic coverage;
 − serve customers through a direct sales 
business model;
 − increase sales in our core markets;
 − provide products or services where there 
is a high cost of non-performance to 
the customer;
 − have the potential for geographical or 
technology expansion;
 − have strong maintenance, repair and 
overhaul demand and recurring revenues; 
and
 − be capable of achieving Group margins.
During 2017, a unique opportunity arose to 
acquire two outstanding businesses, Gestra 
and Chromalox. Both companies have long 
and successful histories. Industrial boiler 
controls and steam specialist Gestra 
was founded in Germany in 1902 and 
electrical process heating and temperature 
management solutions provider Chromalox 
was founded in the USA in 1917, with both 
companies bringing distinct opportunities for 
growth and expansion to the Group. 
Gestra’ s strength in a number of product 
areas, such as industrial boiler control 
systems, and end applications, such as the 
German chemical industry, complement the 
Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties division’ s 
product offering and industry reach. With the 
help of the Spirax Sarco global footprint, 
we believe that the combination of the 
two entities will enhance organic growth 
opportunities going forward. 
Chromalox represents an excellent 
opportunity to expand our addressable 
markets through the acquisition of a clearly 
related business that is also dedicated 
to transferring heat energy into industrial 
processes and shares our strong direct 
sales business model. As we invest in 
strengthening Chromalox’ s direct sales 
channels and leverage our global footprint 
and expertise, this acquisition will enhance 
our growth and sustainable value creation for 
customers and shareholders.
Both acquisitions were accretive to Group 
earnings in 2017 and were positively 
received by customers and employees. 
The integration of both businesses into 
the Group has proceeded very positively 
and remains in line with the integration 
plans reported at the time of their 
respective acquisitions.
Engineering opportunities for 
sustainable value creation
As a socially responsible business, we 
recognise the importance of operating in a 
way that delivers long-term sustainable value 
for all stakeholders. This year we engineered 
opportunities to strengthen the Group’ s basis 
for organic growth; served over 100,000 
direct buying customers, enabling them 
to improve process efficiency and reduce 
their environmental impacts; invested 
extensively in developing the skills and 
capabilities of our employees; developed 
new products; expanded our geographical 
reach; engaged with our local communities 
to help meet their needs; reduced our own 
CO 2 emissions intensity; maintained the 
Group operating margin and delivered the 
50th year of dividend progress, all of which 
has been achieved whilst delivering strong 
organic growth.

Our business model
We combine our specialist 
knowledge with our 
industry-leading products 
and services to deliver 
value-adding engineered 
solutions to customers.
With a direct sales presence in 62 countries 
and a further network of distributors, our 
business has a global reach. By having 
the right products, in the right place, at 
the right time and an extensive global 
network of specialist engineers, we help 
users of industrial and commercial steam 
systems, electrical heating and temperature 
management systems, and process fluid 
paths and pumping systems to increase 
efficiency, reduce their environmental 
impacts, improve product quality and 
achieve regulatory compliance.
Through innovative R&D we develop 
and enhance our already broad range of 
products, pre-fabricated packages and 
site services. Our technically-expert direct 
sales force allows us to leverage these new 
products and develop new applications 
for existing products, which increases the 
amount of plant spend that we can capture 
in the small-scale capital projects and 
maintenance activities that lie at the heart of 
our business. 
We have 26 strategically located 
manufacturing plants across Europe, North 
America, Latin America and Asia, in which 
we manufacture most of the products 
we sell. By manufacturing regionally we 
optimise customer service and enhance the 
efficiency of our supply chains. We generally 
employ demand flow processes at our 
manufacturing sites; this lean manufacturing 
system enables us to respond quickly to 
customer needs and provides maximum 
flexibility of daily manufacture.
T o maintain operational efficiency, 
production output and product quality, 
regular maintenance spending is required 
by our customers. In the Group as a whole, 
approximately 50% of our revenue is derived 
from our customers’ maintenance, repair 
and overhaul activities. T o support this, we 
offer a comprehensive range of site audits 
and maintenance services to keep our 
customers’ industrial systems operating 
efficiently. We also deliver customer training, 
to help meet their skill gaps, in 53 training

Our business model continued
Our direct sales approach makes us different
Our direct sales approach 
is our most important 
differentiator. It is this 
that builds long-lasting 
relationships with our 
customers, enables us 
to add value and drives 
our sales.
Direct sales
Our sales and service engineers are 
singularly focused on assisting steam, 
electrical heating and pump users to 
overcome their process challenges and meet 
their operational needs. 
Our territories are covered segmentally 
where possible, with sector specialists 
allocated to our core industries, and 
geographically where sectorisation is not 
practical or appropriate. Our sales engineers 
build deep, long-term relationships with 
their customers, who trust them as valued 
engineering partners or expert advisers in 
their plants. 
Routes to market
In 2017, 71% of Group revenue was 
generated through direct sales channels; 
the remaining 29%, which generally arises 
from end users’ maintenance, repair 
and overhaul activities, was indirect, via 
distributors. Our direct sales model plays an 
important role in all our routes to market as 
our engineers call on end users and highlight 
the benefits of our products, solutions and 
services. End users may then purchase from 
us directly, specify our products in OEM 
equipment, request that contractors specify 
our products in their plans, or purchase from 
a distributor.
The benefits of our direct sales approach
Bridge the 
knowledge gap
Many end users no longer have 
the knowledge or engineering 
resources that they once had, 
so they do not understand the 
problems they have or how 
to fix them. We bridge that 
knowledge gap.
Focus on value-
creating solutions
We are increasingly acting as 
a trusted engineering adviser 
to our customers; solving their 
problems, identifying efficiency 
improvement opportunities 
and providing value-
creating solutions.
Self-generated growth 
opportunities
As our sales engineers walk 
our end users' plants they 
use their wide experience 
and industry knowledge 
to identify unrecognised 
needs. Providing solutions 
to meet these needs 
creates opportunities  
for self-generated growth.
Encourage innovative 
product and solution 
development
A deep understanding of our 
end users' processes drives 
product innovation. We have 
led the way in developing ready 
to install packaged solutions 
that provide convenient, 
effective and reliable solutions 
to customers’ problems.
Leverage information 
from our unique 
databases
We have large and unique 
databases of contact 
information for our customers 
and potential customers. 
Leveraging this information 
gives us a formidable 
advantage for sales growth.

Our business model in action
Globally, there is a growing demand 
for Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries, which 
are used in electric vehicles, consumer 
products and energy storage systems.  
We are engineering opportunities for 
growth as we expand our addressable 
market and develop new product 
applications to meet the needs of this 
and other growing industries. 
Steam is increasingly being recognised as a highly-
efficient heating medium in the production of Li-ion 
batteries. Steam has safety and environmental 
benefits over alternative heating solutions. It is also 
highly energy efficient, providing estimated energy 
cost savings of around £140,000 per year, per drying 
oven. By developing steam system heating solutions 
to support this growing industry, Spirax Sarco China 
has seen more than a 700% increase in sales to Li-ion 
battery manufacturers over the last two years. 
Opportunities for growth are not limited to heating 
applications. In South Korea, when using locally 
manufactured hose to transfer chemicals a Li-ion battery 
manufacturer was experiencing frequent problems of 
hose breakage and chemical leakage. Aflex, which 
joined the Group in 2016, recommended the use 
of Corroline+ PTFE lined hose, which is uniquely 
designed by Aflex to provide flexibility, kink and chemical 
resistance. An initial trial proved so successful that the 
customer is now installing Corroline+ hose across all 149 
assemblies on site. 
In another application, at a Li-ion battery plant in China, 
pumps remove slurry generated during the milling of 
lithium iron phosphate. This viscous and abrasive fluid 
was causing wear, damage, reduced capacity and 
leakage of the installed air-operated double diaphragm 
pumps, leading to frequent downtime and costly repairs. 
Watson-Marlow recommended the installation of Bredel 
65 hose pumps, which have no seals, ball-checks, 
diaphragms, glands, immersed rotors, stators or pistons 
to leak, clog, corrode or replace. Once installed the 
Bredel pumps increased flow stability and reduced 
maintenance down-time, enabling the battery 
manufacturer to meet planned output schedules.

Atlantic Engineering, an OEM based in Belgium, 
specialises in dispensing technology for the food 
industry. The company has created an innovative 
packaging machine, called Innofill, which enables 
food manufacturers to take liquid food straight from 
cooking vessels, fill and seal it into flexible packets. 
Innofill’ s unique packaging system extends product 
shelf life, keeping it fresh for up to 40 days, and 
increases manufacturing efficiency. 
The new Certa Sine™ (Certa) pump, launched by 
Watson-Marlow Fluid T echnology Group in 2016, is 
the only pump on the market that can meet all of the 
OEM’ s exacting pumping requirements. The pump 
must gently handle viscous fluids, with low pulsation; 
provide consistent and accurate flows; and be 
hygienic and easy to clean, while also having a high 
heat resistance. Certa’ s unique design makes it easy 
to clean; in just 60 seconds the pump can be cleaned 
in-situ and be ready to pump again. 
Mr De Bleye of Atlantic Engineering commented, 
“We do use Watson-Marlow as a selling point.

Our business model in action continued
At a railway terminal in Northern Canada, crude 
oil is off-loaded and reloaded onto railway cars 
for transportation to oil refineries. In winter, when 
temperatures can drop as low as -40°C, the oil 
must be safely warmed throughout the process to 
reduce its viscosity and improve flow rates. When the 
railway terminal needed to significantly expand its 
operations, while tightly controlling costs, Chromalox 
was asked to design and supply an engineered heat 
trace solution.
As the customer required low set-up costs, electric 
heat tracing proved the most efficient solution. 
Working closely with the customer’ s project team, 
Chromalox designed a solution that utilised SLL 
Series Long Line Cable, Digital Thermostats and 
IntelliTrace Supervisory Controls, to deliver a fully 
monitored heat trace system at half the cost of 
a standard electric heat trace system, saving 
approximately US$250,000 (£193,000).* 
Our direct sales approach, combined with our 
deep knowledge and understanding of customers’ 
applications and process requirements, enables us 
to engineer opportunities for improved efficiency and 
cost savings for customers.
Cassandra Marcum
Senior Application Engineer, Chromalox
*  The long line cable solution required less than half the number of circuits 
to trace the piping than a standard cable system, reducing the number of

Acquisitions in 2017
The perfect fit
What do these acquisitions bring 
to the Group?
During 2017, a very rare opportunity arose to 
acquire two outstanding businesses: Gestra 
and Chromalox. 
Gestra is highly complementary to the 
Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties division and 
will enhance the implementation of Spirax 
Sarco’ s strategy for growth, as a result of its 
well-developed capabilities in a wide range 
of industries and applications. Gestra brings 
market-leading boiler controls to our 
product portfolio. 
Chromalox is closely related to the Spirax 
Sarco Steam Specialties division in 
delivering thermal energy management 
solutions to customers, with the decision 
between using steam or electricity as a 
heating medium being driven by application 
needs or customer circumstances. 
Chromalox expands our total addressable 
market by over £2 billion.
What do you see as the main 
opportunities for growth?
Due to its strong brand, Gestra will operate 
alongside the Spirax Sarco steam business, 
targeting global growth in its key market 
sectors. We will invest in Gestra’ s product 
and market development to extend its 
addressable market, delivering enhanced 
value to both customers and shareholders. 
We will leverage our worldwide footprint 
to grow Chromalox’ s presence outside its 
core markets in the USA and will support 
the company’ s research and development 
programme to ensure that it continues to 
deliver innovative new products to customers 
and drives sustainable value creation.
How do you plan to ensure that 
management won’t be distracted 
by the integration process?
The Board and Group Executive Committee 
invested considerable time to ensuring 
that Gestra’ s and Chromalox’ s acquisition 
objectives are supported by detailed 
implementation plans. Prior to the acquisition 
of Gestra, we engaged an external, 
independent operations and integration team 
to undertake due diligence in relation to our 
synergy and integration plans and we have 
appointed a highly experienced manager 
from the Spirax Sarco steam business to 
lead the company. 
Chromalox is being run as a stand-alone 
global business unit, led by a strong, long-
serving executive team that has remained 
with the business, minimising the need for 
significant integration activities.
Elsewhere in the Group we maintain our 
rigorous focus on implementing our strategy 
for organic growth. 
Are more large-scale acquisitions 
in the pipeline?
As we focus on embedding both the 
Gestra and Chromalox acquisitions, we do 
not anticipate any large-scale acquisitions 
in 2018.
Has the Group strategy changed?
Our strategy, which allows for targeted 
acquisitions, has not changed and we 
continue to focus on actions to help us self-
generate sales and achieve organic growth. 
Acquisitions will continue to supplement 
organic growth, rather than supplant it.

Our strategy in action
Increase direct sales effectiveness  
through sector focus
As we sectorise our sales force around key industries, and align our 
products and services in support of this, we increase our ability to  
self-generate growth and provide value to customers. 
During 2016 and 2017, Spirax Sarco Korea 
undertook a programme to increase the 
sectorisation of its direct sales force. Until recently, 
the company’ s sales force was divided into two 
teams: Project Sales and End-User Sales, with 
some sector specialists in each team. Four new 
sales departments have now been created to 
align sales engineers with key industries: 
T eam 1 – Food & Beverage, Healthcare and 
General Industries; 
T eam 2 – Electric and Electronics; 
T eam 3 – Oil & Gas and Chemicals; and 
T eam 4 – Buildings and OEMs. 
By the end of the year, 40% of sales and service 
engineers were aligned to an industry sector.
Maintaining customer service throughout the 
period of change was essential and the process 
required detailed planning prior to implementation. 
T o ensure a smooth transition, industry sales and 
market size were analysed, industrial distribution 
was mapped, individual and collective industry 
knowledge and application expertise were 
reviewed, as were relationships with key accounts 
and customers. Extensive training has been 
delivered to ensure maximum efficacy of the new 
sales teams. 
Spirax Sarco Korea is already seeing the benefits 
of these changes with increased sales efficiency 
and revenue generated from key industries.

Recruiting talented young engineers and 
developing their knowledge, skills and expertise is 
essential for the on-going success of the Group. 
In 2013 we developed an award winning graduate 
programme in our UK Spirax Sarco Steam 
Specialties company, which has attracted many 
highly talented engineers. Building on the success 
of that programme, in 2017 we launched a Group 
Global Graduate Development Programme, to 
increase the number of placements that we can 
offer, facilitate inter-company movement and 
widen the range of opportunities and experiences 
available to programme participants.
We are recruiting high-calibre graduates, primarily 
with a STEM (Science, T echnology , Engineering 
and Mathematics) background, to join a two 
year rotational programme. Each graduate will 
experience four six-month placements, tailored 
to their individual interests and designed to 
provide a broad range of business experience 
across functions such as Product Development, 
Manufacturing, Sales, Business Development, 
Marketing, or Health, Safety & the Environment. 
One of the four placements will be held in an 
overseas operating company , ensuring first-
hand experience of the multi-national nature of 
the Group. 16 graduates joined the programme 
in 2017, in the USA, Mexico, Argentina, Italy , 
Germany , China and the UK.
Through investing in a Global Graduate 
Programme, we are adopting a co-ordinated 
approach to replenishing our pipeline of talent.

Broaden our global presence 
Our strong global infrastructure enables us to rapidly branch into 
neighbouring markets or leverage our existing infrastructure to pioneer 
the introduction of our businesses and technologies into new markets. 
In January 2017, Watson-Marlow Fluid T echnology 
Group began trading via a newly established sales 
company in Indonesia, having previously served 
the country through distributors. The move to 
direct selling brings a better focus to this growing 
market, increases the number of customers 
that can be served and conveys the company’ s 
expertise and advanced technologies into a 
previously untapped market. 
Prior to commencing trading, during 2016 
Watson-Marlow intensively trained a local 
sales force. Training took place within the 
region, supported by Watson-Marlow’ s global 
training programme. Having sector specialist, 
expert engineers who understand customers’ 
applications is central to Watson-Marlow’ s 
customer value proposition and is crucial for 
the successful transition from distributor to 
direct sales. 
During 2017, the new company primarily focused 
on two core markets: the Pharmaceutical & 
Biotechnology and Food & Beverage industries, 
and sales have exceeded expectations. The new 
operation is led by General Manager  
Rahmi Hidayati who, prior to joining Watson-
Marlow, had over 14 years of experience working 
in the Biopharmaceutical industry. Rahmi’ s 
in-depth understanding of the Biopharmaceutical 
market has had a significant impact on the 
company’ s ability to quickly establish a foothold in 
this important industry.

Chromalox is a highly innovative company with an 
active product pipeline and a vitality index of 15%. 
Amongst several new products launched in 2017 
was the CCX Cast Block Heater, which allows 
Chromalox to be more competitive in the Power 
Generation and Oil & Gas markets, particularly in 
Europe and Russia. 
The unique construction of the Chromalox CCX 
heater – which utilises an immersion heater 
and coiled tubing set in an aluminium casting – 
allows for the indirect heating of fluids or gases 
up to pressures of 3,500 psi (241bar), with an 
option for up to 7,500 psi (517 bar), at a process 
temperature of 200°C. Chromalox CCX heaters 
are suited to a variety of industrial process 
applications, including seal gas heating and 
condensation prevention for turbines, fuel oil  
pre-heating, water pre-heating, steam 
superheating, and air, CO 2 and nitrogen heating. 
The CCX heater, part of the XtremeDuty™ 
platform due to its ability to handle high 
pressures, has ASME (American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers) and PED (EU Pressure 
Equipment Directive) pressure certification; 
marine grade casting, making it suitable for 
salt-laden environments such as offshore 
platforms; an explosion-proof terminal enclosure 
(junction box); and is IECEx (International Trade 
of Electrical Equipment used in Explosive 
Atmospheres) and ATEX (EU equipment directive) 
rated, meaning that it can be safely used in 
hazardous environments.

Optimise supply chain effectiveness 
We operate a regional manufacturing strategy and focus on increasing 
supply chain agility and compressing lead times to enable greater 
responsiveness, reduce costs and improve customer service. 
During 2017, we invested £1.4 million to develop 
a new 1,500m² distribution centre in Singapore 
to serve our Steam Specialties division’ s sales 
companies throughout the Asia Pacific region and 
an accompanying 1,800m² office space to house 
our Singapore sales company, South East Asia 
headquarters, Asia Pacific divisional headquarters 
and training facilities.
Historically, sales companies across Asia Pacific 
have sourced core stock directly from our regional 
manufacturing centre in China and supplementary 
stock from our manufacturing sites in Europe or 
the Americas, leading to a complex supply chain 
and limited visibility of regional product availability. 
The new facility in Singapore, which opened 
in September 2017, will significantly increase 
supply chain efficiency. The consolidation of 
demand will increase the range of products 
offered in the region, without the need for sales 
companies to increase stock, and is expected 
to reduce air freight in the region by around 
10%. The installation of a regional inventory 
management system will improve regional stock 
visibility, shorten lead times and reduce stock 
replenishment time by an average of 13 days. 
Cumulatively, these benefits will significantly 
improve customer service throughout the region.

As part of our goal to improve the sustainability 
of our operations and reduce our environmental 
impacts, in June 2017 we were pleased to attain 
“zero waste to landfill” at our Cheltenham-based 
manufacturing site and Group headquarters, which 
we intend to maintain from this point forward. 
T o achieve this milestone we worked with our 
waste management providers to ensure that they 
proactively segregate, re-use and recycle waste. 
For example, all food waste is sent to an anaerobic 
digestion facility and is used to generate electricity, 
while a wide range of plastics, metals, papers and 
cardboard are recycled. Any general waste that 
cannot be recycled, which would historically have 
been sent to landfill, is now used to generate energy.
In addition, we have worked to improve waste 
management internally, increasing on-site 
segregation of waste streams to facilitate ease of 
off-site processing. We have developed an internal 
educational campaign for 2018 to raise awareness 
amongst our employees of the importance of 
waste segregation, describe what happens to the 
waste we produce, and highlight the business and 
environmental benefits of good waste management.
As a result of the actions undertaken in 2017, we 
will prevent approximately 35 tonnes of waste being 
sent to landfill annually.

Operate sustainably and help improve our 
customers’ sustainability
In a resource constrained and competitive world, sustainability makes 
good business sense. As we focus on improving our own operational

Risk management
Our approach and appetite 
for risk
We recognise risk as an inherent part of 
our business operations and we approach 
risk with the same deliberate, strategic 
consideration as other aspects of the 
business. The Committee monitors our risks, 
in particular those identified as principal 
risks, on an on-going basis, while the Board 
is responsible for the overall stewardship 
of risk management and internal control. 
Using the information and evaluations 
obtained from our regular top-down 
and bottom-up reviews, alongside the 
Committee-led principal risk appetite ratings, 
the Committee creates an effective system 
for monitoring, planning and developing a 
Group-wide approach and culture regarding 
risk. General Managers are directly involved 
in the risk assessment process and the 
evaluations of the Committee, including the 
appropriate levels of risk, are communicated 
to all Group companies.
The on-going monitoring and engagement 
contributes to the Group’ s risk register and 
the management of risks. Both the risk 
register and the principal risks are dynamic 
and fluid. They provide a reflection of current 
conditions across the Group and guidance 
for on-going monitoring and preparation.
What important developments 
occurred in 2017?
The Committee regularly reviews the 
principal risks, potential impacts, mitigation 
and prevention planning. It also assesses 
developing issues that have the potential to 
become principal risks. The following actions 
have been undertaken during the year:
Principal risks
The Committee performed a bottom-up 
review of the principal risks, assessing 
responses from Group companies. In light 
of these responses and the Committee’ s 
internal considerations, we updated our 
principal risks to reflect changes to the risks 
affecting the Group. The changes are set out 
on pages 32 to 33.
Risk appetite
The Committee confirmed the current Risk 
Appetite Statement, which is set out on 
page 83.
Modern Slavery Act
A statement has been approved by the 
Board and is available on our website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com.
Group suppliers are required to abide by the 
principles contained within the statement. 
Compliance is monitored through our Global 
Excellence in Supply Chain Initiative.
Regular updates
The Group Executive Committee regularly 
reviews the risk register, to determine if 
the risks are still current, and the Board is 
provided with updates.
How is the Group preparing for 
the impacts of Brexit?
The Group is continuing to plan and assess 
its approach to the impacts of Brexit as 
negotiations progress. The Group has 
already conducted scenario planning 
exercises to prepare contingency plans 
and lay the groundwork for future actions, 
including risk-mitigation and identifying 
and capitalising on potential opportunities. 
Our Brexit plan has 11 areas of focus, 
each with an individual sponsor, to ensure 
adequate attention is given to the various 
challenges and opportunities stemming 
from the Brexit process. Whilst activities 
to date have primarily involved monitoring 
developments, the Group will begin to step-
up the implementation of the plan in 2018, 
beginning with specific impact assessments 
regarding tariffs and exchange rate impacts, 
which will be conducted in the first quarter.
What are the key areas of focus 
for 2018?
In 2018 we will be developing, testing and 
implementing a Crisis Management Plan 
across the Group.
2018 will also be a significant year with 
regard to Brexit. We will continue to monitor 
on-going Brexit negotiations and apply or 
adjust our planned response accordingly, as 
explained more fully above.
“ In 2017, the Committee conducted a bottom-
up review of risks, incorporating views from 
across the Group to update our approach to 
risk assessment. In 2018, we will be developing 
a crisis management plan and will continue to 
monitor and plan for Brexit-related issues.”

What due diligence processes 
does the Group employ to pursue 
Group objectives? What has been 
the impact of these activities?
The Group is continuing its work in the 
Global Excellence in Supply Chain Initiative, 
which puts in place a monitoring mechanism 
to oversee our own operations and help 
ensure our suppliers operate in compliance 
with our Supplier Sustainability Code (Code). 
This direct engagement with suppliers is 
critically important to guard against violations 
of standards with respect to the protection 
of individuals, communities and the 
environment. The Code further addresses 
one of our principal risks – Health, Safety and 
Environmental (HSE) Risks – and has had a 
significant impact by not only setting supplier 
standards, but also engaging operating 
companies across the Group to bring these 
issues to the forefront of the business.
Due diligence, undertaken prior to each 
Group acquisition, is a key process to 
ensure that acquisition objectives – another 
principal risk – and non-financial objectives 
are achieved. In addition to financial and 
legal considerations our acquisition due 
diligence approach thoroughly investigates 
anti-bribery and corruption issues, potential 
business ethics concerns and HSE matters 
to ensure that any business that becomes 
part of the Group is upholding our values 
and governance standards.
Page 80 contains our Viability Statement and 
page 111 our Going Concern Statement.
Pages 81-83 of the Governance Report 
provide further information on the Group’s 
approach to risk, including risk appetite, along 
with the roles, responsibilities, and actions of 
the Risk Management Committee.

1 Economic and political instability
The Group operates worldwide and 
maintains operations in territories that 
have historically experienced economic or 
political instability. This type of instability, 
which includes the uncertainties of regime 
change, creates risks for our locally based 
direct operations and broader risks to credit, 
liquidity and currency.
 − Operations in accordance with Group Treasury Policy 
 − Externally-facilitated scenario planning
 − Strong internal controls, including internal audit and 
appropriate insurance
 − Resilient business model
 − Well spread business by geography and sector

successfully manage 
the unique challenges 
in economically and

territories. We are 
willing to accept these 
challenges where 
opportunities for growth 
are substantial.

2 Significant exchange rate movements
The Group reports its results and pays 
dividends in sterling. Operating and 
manufacturing companies trade in local 
currency. With sales companies in nearly 
50 countries and manufacturing spread 
across the globe, the nature of the Group’s 
business necessarily results in exposure to 
exchange rate volatility.
 − Maintain spread of manufacturing across currency areas
 − Consideration of exchange rate exposures in 
manufacturing strategy
 − Forward cover where appropriate and in line with Group 
Treasury Policy
 − Focus on reducing manufacturing cost 
Executive sponsor: Kevin Boyd

We take a balanced 
view of this risk: the risk 
arises as a direct result

spread means we are 
not wholly dependent 
on any one currency.

3 Loss of manufacturing output at any Group factory
The risk includes loss of output as a result 
of natural disasters, industrial action and 
accidents. Loss of manufacturing output at 
any important plant risks serious disruption to 
sales operations.
 − Investment in modern flexible machining
 − Capacity planning and holding stock in sales companies
 − Conducting audits/inspections
 − Annual Risk Assessments and business continuity planning
 − Review and maintain appropriate insurance cover
 − Continued commitment to employee policies, ensuring 
satisfactory benefits and regular communication with 
all employees

customers warrants a 
low appetite for this risk.

4 Failure to realise acquisition objectives
Whilst the Group mitigates this risk in various 
ways, including through comprehensive 
due diligence, professional advisers 
and contractual protections, amongst 
others, there are some variables that are 
uncontrollable or difficult to control, such 
as economic conditions, culture clashes 
and employee movement. Therefore, these 
could impact acquisition objectives. The 
Group also has comprehensive integration 
implementation plans, developed with 
independent consultants, which are being 
successfully rolled out. 
 − Regular review of acquisition criteria in line with 
strategic plan
 − Board approval of post-acquisition plans for 
major acquisitions
 − Full scrutiny of targets involving local lawyers, accountants, 
and key internal players/operating units
 − Use of retainer/escrow to provide protection against 
warranty claims
 − Use of insurance as protection against seller breach and 
non-disclosure
 − Ensuring valuation models show healthy return 
on investment
 − Regular monitoring of performance by the Board against 
the approved investment case
Executive sponsor: Kevin Boyd

5 Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity risks include risks from 
malware, accident, statutory and legislative 
requirements, malicious actions and other 
unauthorised access by third parties.
 − Global assessment of IT environment against UK 
cyber essentials framework and prioritising actions 
for improvement
 − Deploying security tools to limit impact and spread 
of ransomware
 − Initiating new centrally managed Firewall environment
 − Further strengthening of security for centrally managed 
systems for heightened protection and consistency

6 Solution specification failure
Total solutions demand understanding of 
customers’ complex technical requirements 
and there is risk involved in pursuing new 
opportunities in engineering systems design, 
installation and servicing. Failure could 
result in disruption and loss to a customer’s 
production line.
 − Extensive internal and field testing of new products prior 
to launch
 − Continuing capital investment in the latest 
manufacturing technology
 − Centres of responsibility established to maintain 
product control
 − Established testing policy and procedures at Group 
manufacturing sites
 − Quality procedures ensure that manufactured quality meets 
these standards
Executive sponsors: Jay Whalen and Ian Farnworth
Change: With the newly acquired businesses, the Group will 
be handling larger, more complex, orders thereby increasing 
this risk.

7 Breach of legal and regulatory requirements (including ABC laws)
We operate globally and must ensure 
compliance with laws and regulations 
wherever we do business. As we grow 
into new markets and territories, we 
must continually review and update our 
operations and procedures, and ensure our 
employees are fully informed and educated 
in all applicable legal requirements. This is 
particularly important with respect to anti-
bribery and corruption (ABC) legislation. 
Breaching any of these laws or regulations 
could have serious consequences for 
the Group.
The General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR), which protects personal sensitive 
data, will take effect in May 2018 and we are 
undertaking a gap analysis to assist with 
a remediation plan to ensure that we are 
compliant with this new law as applicable 
across the Group.
 − On-going global monitoring of commercial arrangements 
and agreements, with appropriate professional advice
 − Established procedures to maintain accreditations
 − Group-wide ABC training and whistle-blowing hotline
 − Group Litigation Report and on-going monitoring of cases
 − Regular updates on Corporate Governance and Stock 
Exchange rules
 − Continued roll out of Supplier Sustainability Code
 − GDPR gap analysis and remediation plan

8 Health, safety and environmental risks
A major health, safety or environmental 
incident could cause total or partial closure 
of a manufacturing facility. As a premium 
provider of safety critical products, a breach 
of these requirements would also have 
reputational consequences for the Group.
 − All manufacturing locations report monthly on health and 
safety issues
 − Board review of HSE items at every Board Meeting
 − Role of Group EHS Executive and appointment of EHS 
Officers in all major Supply and Sales sites
 − Enhanced training programmes, keeping the focus on 
health, safety and the environment
 − Site visits conducted by Group Supply Chain Director and 
Group EHS Executive where practices are reviewed and 
improvement opportunities identified
Executive sponsor: Ian Farnworth
Change: This risk has reduced due to increased investment 
in HSE programmes, including newly-appointed EHS Officers.

Following the bottom-up review, the following changes were made to the principal risks:
 − Risk 1: economic and political instability – amended to ensure that we 
captured all our mitigation activities relating to Brexit.
 − Risk 4: failure to realise acquisition objectives and Risk 5: cybersecurity 
– added. Risk appetite determined for these two risks.
 − Risk 7: breach of legal and regulatory requirements amalgamated with 
breach or potential breach of ABC laws and renamed breach of legal 
and regulatory requirements (including ABC laws).
 − Following a recent triennial valuation which saw a material reduction 
in the deficit, defined pension benefit deficit (previously Risk 4) was 
removed from the principal risks but remains on the risk register.
 − The year-on-year change for each principal risk was assessed.

Introduction
During 2017, the Group delivered record 
revenue and operating profit, achieved 
through a combination of good organic 
growth, accretive acquisitions and favourable 
exchange rate movements. We saw progress 
in all geographical segments of the Steam 
Specialties division, strong progress in the 
Watson-Marlow Fluid T echnology business 
and a good performance, in line with 
expectations, in the Gestra and Chromalox 
acquisitions. In the year we saw a 35% 
growth in headcount to more than 7,250.
Market environment
Steam continues to be the most efficient 
medium for transferring energy (in the 
form of heat) within industrial processes, 
with applications including heating, curing, 
cooking, drying, cleaning, sterilising, space 
heating, humidification and on-demand 
hot water production. Electrical heating 
technologies are widely utilised for freeze 
protection, high temperature industrial 
applications and temperature management 
in mission critical industrial processes. 
Peristaltic and niche pumps and associated 
fluid path components are also used across 
an extensive range of industries to address 
mission critical or difficult pumping problems. 
Our wide geographic spread, diversity of 
industrial sectors and a large proportion 
of revenues that derive from end users’ 
maintenance and operating budgets, mean 
that our market conditions closely correlate 
with industrial production growth. Following a 
sustained period of very low growth, global 
industrial production growth began to pick 
up in the latter half of 2016. This growth 
continued into 2017 giving a global industrial 
production growth rate of 3.4% for the year. 
Emerging markets achieved a higher level 
of growth, at 4.2%, than OECD markets, 
which averaged 2.9% for the year, with 
strong growth in China accounting for 
much of the difference. The improvement 
in industrial production is reflected in the 
good organic growth achieved in both the 
Steam Specialties division and Watson-
Marlow, although we outperformed industrial 
production in both businesses as we 
successfully self-generated sales through 
the effective utilisation of our direct sales 
business model. 
In EMEA, industrial production growth 
reached its highest level for several years 
at 3.3%, despite on-going political and 
economic uncertainty in the region, 
particularly in the Eurozone. Asia Pacific saw 
4.6% industrial production growth, buoyed 
by a strong year in China. Elsewhere in 
the region growth was lower and more 
mixed, with Korea seeing growth of 1.2%. 
In the Americas, North America’ s industrial 
production returned to positive growth after 
two years of contraction, with a 2.0% growth

rate seen in the USA. After three years of 
negative growth, Latin America returned to 
positive territory, with slight signs of recovery 
in some of the larger markets, although 
growth in Mexico remained negative. 
Industrial production is currently expected to 
remain positive in 2018, at broadly the same 
levels of 2017.
Progress in 2017
Overall the Group achieved organic sales 
growth of 6%, with 5% organic growth 
in the Steam Specialties division and 
10% organic growth in Watson-Marlow, 
continuing the strong growth seen in 2016. 
Both businesses saw organic growth across 
all three geographic regions. 
At £998.7 million, Group sales were 
up 32% at reported exchange rates 
(2016: £757.4 million). Weaker sterling 
increased sales on translation by 5%, with 
most of the impact being seen in the first half 
of the year. Sterling strengthened towards 
the end of the year and this strength has 
continued into 2018. Currency movements 
are notoriously difficult to predict and sterling 
is likely to be affected by the progress of 
Brexit negotiations during 2018. 
The acquisitions made in the year, Gestra 
and Chromalox, combined with the full year 
effects of the two acquisitions made in 2016, 
Hiter and Aflex, contributed £154.8 million, 
or 20%, to sales. 
The Spirax Sarco business accounted for 
75% of Group revenue in 2017. The Steam 
Specialties division saw organic sales growth 
of 5%, with sales increased by 10% due 
to the acquisition of Gestra in May and the 
full year effect of Hiter Controls that was 
acquired in July 2016. Gestra’ s sales during 
their eight months in the Group totalled 
£51.5 million. For reference this represents 
67% of their £77 million full year 2017 sales. 
Favourable currency movements added a 
further 5% taking reported growth to 20%. 
Chromalox, which joined the Group on 3rd 
July, contributed £75.1 million in sales to the 
Spirax Sarco business in 2017. For reference 
this represented 52% of their £146 million full 
year 2017 sales. 
Geographically, the Steam Specialties 
division saw solid organic growth in EMEA. 
Some progress was made in the Americas 
and Asia Pacific was boosted by a strong 
performance in China.
In Watson-Marlow, which accounted for 
25% of Group revenues, organic growth was 
10% and was supplemented by 5% due 
to favourable currency movements. The full 
year effect of the acquisition of Aflex at the 
end of November 2016 added a further 
12% to sales bringing reported growth 
to 28%. Growth was achieved across all 
geographic regions. 
Group adjusted operating profit was 6% 
ahead of the prior year on an organic basis 
and, at £235.5 million, was up 30% at 
reported exchange rates, helped by a 9% 
benefit from translational and transactional 
exchange gains, and 14% from acquisitions. 
Within the Steam Specialties division, EMEA 
and Asia Pacific both delivered organic 
operating profit growth, while the Americas 
was flat due in part to the £1.5 million one-off 
contribution in 2016 from the devaluation 
of the Argentine currency in the prior 
year. Watson-Marlow also saw organic 
operating profit growth but, as expected, at 
a lower rate than in recent years due to our 
increased revenue investments to sustain 
future organic growth. 
Gestra’ s trading profit during their eight 
months with the Group was £7.6 million. 
For reference, this represented 70% of their 
£11 million full year 2017 profit. Chromalox’ s 
trading profit during their six months with the 
Group was £13.8 million. For reference this 
represented 53% of their £26 million full year 
2017 profit. 
Group adjusted operating profit margin of 
23.6% was 20 bps lower than the prior 
year, as currency exchange benefits were 
more than offset by the dilutionary impacts 
of recent acquisitions. Excluding the impact 
of acquisitions, the adjusted operating 
margin expanded by 90 bps to 24.7%, 
despite increased investments for growth 
and an increase in material prices. Within the 
Steam Specialties division, EMEA and 
Asia Pacific were able to leverage margin 
expansion from their increased sales volume 
and transactional currency benefits. In the 
Americas, currency movements were 
dilutive although the underlying margin was 
maintained. As expected, Watson-Marlow’ s 
operating margin fell due to the full year 
dilutionary impact of Aflex. Excluding Aflex, 
the margin expanded by 40 bps.

“ Organic sales increased 5% to a reported £305.3

Market overview
EMEA saw a steady increase in industrial 
production growth rates during 2017, 
with an annual rate of 3.3%. This figure 
somewhat masks the disruption in the region 
caused by political elections in a number of 
key markets and uncertainties surrounding 
Brexit negotiations in the UK, which have 
tended to suppress investments in the 
affected countries, causing project delays. 
The relatively low oil price throughout the first 
half of the year continued to stifle upstream 
investments in the Oil & Gas industry, but 
as demand increased in the second half of 
the year the barrel price increased putting 
the industry in a better position going into 
2018. The German Power industry, a 
key market for Gestra, saw a large drop 
in investment in 2017, with a number of 
project postponements. 
Progress in 2017
In EMEA, sales increased by 5% on an 
organic basis to a reported £305.3 million, 
with favourable currency movements 
increasing sales on translation by 5% 
and Gestra contributing a further 19%. 
Organic sales growth in the region was 
mixed. Central and Eastern Europe saw 
organic growth, despite Germany being 
broadly flat and slowing in the second half, 
as the German general election affected 
business confidence. The UK and Nordics 
fell back while France saw solid growth and 
in Southern Europe Italy, Spain and Portugal 
experienced excellent growth. While Oil & 
Gas markets were subdued, the Middle

Strategic Report
 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 39
East performed strongly due to a renewed 
focus on Oil & Gas maintenance and repair 
business. Investments in our direct sales 
presence in the Netherlands, East Africa 
and Egypt paid off with sales up strongly in 
these countries. We achieved above market 
growth in the Food & Beverage, Healthcare, 
Oil & Gas and Chemical industries, and OEM 
markets were considerably stronger than the 
prior year.
Sales in Gestra, which joined the Group 
in May, were impacted by the acquisition 
process during the second quarter, but 
recovered well during the second half of the 
year with German OEM boiler makers, in 
particular, providing opportunities for growth. 
At £66.1 million, reported operating profit 
was ahead 32%, consisting of 7% organic 
growth, an 11% exchange benefit and 
13% from acquisitions. Organic growth 
was primarily driven by leveraging good 
operating profit from sales growth, price 
management initiatives and tight control 
of overheads, enabling investments to 
be made to strengthen our direct sales 
presence in the region while maintaining the 
margin. Continued efficiency improvements 
in our UK manufacturing unit in Cheltenham 
also contributed to the improved organic 
trading margin.
The strong profit growth delivered an 
operating profit margin of 21.7%, 40 bps 
higher than in the prior year and 140 bps 
higher excluding the dilutionary effects of the 
Gestra acquisition. 
Strategy update
We have made good progress with the 
implementation of our strategy for growth. 
We further strengthened our market 
presence in our newer operating companies 
in the Netherlands, Egypt and the Middle 
East. A new company began trading in 
Kenya (East Africa) during January 2017 
and customers have responded positively 
to the increased investment we have made, 
resulting in a good first year. We completed 
the groundwork to begin trading through 
newly established companies in Hungary, 
Romania and in the Maghreb, which 
will serve Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. 
These businesses began trading in 
January 2018. 
An increased sector focus in the Food 
& Beverage, Healthcare, Oil & Gas and 
Chemical industries, and OEMs is enabling 
us to achieve above average market 
growth as we uncover new solutions to 
deliver excellent return on investment to 
customers. Through improving our strategic 
account management processes we 
are forming and strengthening mutually-
beneficial, long-lasting relationships with key 
customers. The initial programmes of the 
Spirax Sarco Academy have been rolled out 
to customer-facing staff, accelerating the 
sharing of knowledge and protecting this 
important asset. 
Gestra’ s strategy and implementation plan 
were defined during the acquisition process, 
with safe delivery being the most important 
priority for 2017, along with the successful 
carve out of Gestra’ s businesses in Italy, 
the UK, the USA and Singapore from their 
previous parent. Going forward we will 
further develop Gestra, maintaining its own 
brand, visual identity, product range and 
sales force, while also looking for product 
and supply synergies to increase the 
efficiency of the Steam Specialties division as 
a whole.
T ogether, these strategic actions are 
enhancing our ability to deliver self-generated 
growth that outperforms our markets.
Segment outlook
We anticipate a slight softening in market 
conditions during 2018, with industrial 
production staying positive but at lower 
levels than seen in 2017. Brexit negotiations 
and uncertainty are likely to remain a key 
factor affecting market conditions in the 
region during 2018, while political elections 
in Italy and on-going political uncertainties 
in Germany could cause some turbulence. 
We continue to monitor the situation in 
Europe carefully and during 2018 will 
step-up the implementation of our Brexit 
contingency planning. Whilst remaining 
cautious on market conditions, we remain 
confident in our ability to deliver above 
market growth rates as we implement our 
strategy for growth, develop Gestra, and 
deepen our reach to customers. If exchange 
rates continue at their current levels we do 
not anticipate a significant impact on the 
margin due to transaction effects although 
we would expect to see some dilution from 
having a full year of Gestra.

Market overview
Industrial Production growth rates improved 
significantly in the region, with a yearly 
average of 4.6%. Much of this growth 
occurred in China, which saw 6.2% growth 
in the year, although weaker in the second 
half. Elsewhere in Asia Pacific, growth 
was more mixed with 1.2% in Korea and 
conditions varied in our smaller markets. 
Most markets in the region experienced 
lower growth rates in the second half of 
the year. 
Progress in 2017
Sales in Asia Pacific were £218.0 million, up 
6% on an organic basis and ahead 13% at 
reported exchange rates. Weaker sterling 
delivered exchange benefits of 5%, with a 
further 1% contributed by Gestra, which has 
a small presence in the region. Organic sales 
were ahead in most countries, as improved 
macro-economic conditions increased 
demand. Self-generated and MRO sales 
grew faster than large project orders 
throughout the region as a result of our 
strategic focus on developing the knowledge 
and skills of our sales engineers, increasing 
their ability to identify and deliver smaller-
scale operational efficiency improvement 
projects for our customers. While not 
buoyant, project work recovered slightly and 
we saw solid growth during the year. 
China, our largest market in the region, 
started the year very strongly, boosted 
by good growth in the economy, and 
continued to perform well throughout the 
year, despite slowing industrial production

growth, benefiting from our focus on self-
generated sales. In Korea, we were able 
to outperform the low industrial production 
growth rate to deliver solid organic growth, 
with a particularly large Oil & Gas project. 
Elsewhere in the region Japan, T aiwan and 
Vietnam achieved excellent results in 2017.
Our new wholly-owned direct sales 
and manufacturing operation in India 
is progressing well and in line with our 
expectations, more than doubling the sales 
it made in 2016, its first year of operation. 
Local manufacturing volumes increased 
significantly in 2017, improving the under-
utilisation of this long-term strategic 
investment. As anticipated, the company 
remains loss making as we invest in top line 
growth and increase manufacturing output. 
Operating profit increased strongly on an 
organic basis, up 7%. On a reported basis, 
operating profit was ahead 14% with a 
7% exchange benefit and a very small 
contribution from Gestra in the region. 
Operating margin was ahead 30 bps to 
26.1%, benefiting from product mix – 
notably the growth of typically smaller, higher 
margin, self-generated projects and MRO 
orders. Excluding the effects of the Gestra 
acquisition, the margin expanded by 60 bps.
Strategy update
We completed the £13 million plant 
expansion project in China, which will further 
increase efficiency and improve customer 
delivery performance in the region. We also 
invested £1.4 million to establish a regional 
Distribution Centre and office facilities to 
house our Singapore sales company, South 
East Asia headquarters and Asia Pacific 
headquarters. The new facility , which opened 
in September, will increase supply chain 
efficiency, improve inventory management 
in the region and shorten lead times, 
significantly improving customer service.
We continued to focus on strengthening our 
direct selling capabilities, with the roll-out 
of the programmes of the Spirax Sarco 
Academy to customer facing employees 
in the region and increased sales force 
alignment with our target industries. 
As a result of this increased alignment, 
we have seen above market growth in 
the key industries of Pharmaceuticals 
and Chemicals.
Segment outlook
Slowing growth in China is likely to affect 
business confidence in the region. This, 
combined with very strong growth in 2017, 
may lead to slightly lower organic growth 
rates in the current year. If current exchange 
rates persist, we would expect a dilutionary 
effect on margin due to transaction affects 
and a full year of Gestra. However, our 
strategic investments to improve supply 
chain agility and customer service, and 
strengthen our direct sales capabilities in 
the region position us well to continue to 
make progress as we self-generate our own 
growth opportunities.

Market overview
Industrial production growth rates returned 
to positive territory in the region following a 
number of years of contraction with the USA, 
Canada, Argentina and Brazil all showing 
growth, although Mexico and some of the 
smaller countries in the region remained 
negative. The USA has seen signs of some 
small, but uneven, recovery in industrial 
production, impacted by Hurricanes Harvey 
and, to a lesser extent, Irma. In Argentina, 
President Macri’ s business-friendly policies 
began to attract inward investment and 
stimulate growth. Continuing political 
instability in Brazil suppressed inward 
investment in the economy and held back 
industrial production growth, although 
there were some signs of the beginning of 
a recovery in the second half of the year. 
The Food & Beverage and Pharmaceutical 
sectors were strong during 2017.
Progress in 2017
On an organic basis, sales increased by 2% 
in the Americas to a reported £152.1 million, 
with a 4% impact from exchange and a 6% 
impact from the acquisition of Gestra, which 
has a small local presence in the USA, and 
a full year contribution from Hiter in Brazil, 
which was acquired in July 2016. 
Organic sales in North America were 
marginally behind the prior year. Sales in 
Canada grew strongly, despite continuing 
softness in the Oil & Gas sector, with good 
growth in MRO business and self-generated 
sales as oil and gas producers sought to 
optimise efficiency in their existing systems.

Within the USA, improved economic 
conditions helped to strengthen distributor 
sales, primarily of our core product range. 
End user sales remained challenging with 
the non-repeat of larger end-user projects 
of 2016. In July 2017, we relocated a highly 
experienced senior leader from a Spirax 
Sarco operating company in Latin America 
to the role of President of our USA operation. 
We believe that the experience that he has in 
growing end user sales in his home market 
will be highly beneficial as we continue to 
strengthen our direct sales model in the 
USA, to increase the value that we can add 
to customers, while retaining distributor sales 
as an important route to market. In October 
2017, we also recruited a new Senior Vice 
President of Sales and Marketing with almost 
thirty years’ experience driving organic sales 
growth in the USA, through direct sales 
channels and distribution. Despite a marginal 
decline in sales, operating profit grew on an 
organic basis in North America. 
Latin America saw 6% organic growth 
despite some economic headwinds, with 
good growth in Mexico, Colombia and 
Argentina. Brazil ended the year with 
a marginal decline, despite achieving 
2% organic growth in the second half. 
Hiter Controls, the Brazilian control valve 
manufacturer, acquired in July 2016, made 
excellent progress during the year, focusing 
on the Mining, Oil & Gas and Bioethanol 
markets, and delivered a small profit in the 
second half of the year, ahead of schedule. 
Operating profit grew 8% to £31.6 million. 
Organic growth was 1%, impacted by the 
non-repeat of the one-off profit made in 
Argentina in the first half of 2016 as a result 
of the country’ s currency devaluation in 
late 2015. Exchange movements added 
3% and there was a 4% contribution from 
acquisitions. The adjusted operating profit 
margin fell 70 bps to 20.8% impacted by 
the dilutionary effects of both currency 
and the Hiter and Gestra acquisitions. 
Excluding acquisitions, the margin was 30 
bps lower.
Strategy update
Overall good progress has been made 
in implementing our strategy across the 
Americas. We continued to develop the 
structure of our sales force to increase 
alignment with key sectors, enabling our 
engineers to better understand the needs 
of decision makers in our customers’ 
businesses and align our value proposition 
in a more customer specific way. The Food 
& Beverage and Pharmaceutical sectors, 
in particular, have benefited from our focus 
in 2017. Enhanced strategic account 
management has been further embedded in 
the region with progress seen amongst large 
multi-national customers and large national 
Food & Beverage customers. 
The skills and sales approach in the whole 
region have been strengthened by the 
launch of the Spirax Sarco Academy’ s 
programmes in 2017. Available in the 
region’ s key languages, this significant 
investment in knowledge transfer will benefit 
our customers as they receive the class-
leading knowledge of our sales and service 
teams both now and in the future. 
We have focused on improving customer 
service in the region, with a drive to improve 
on-time delivery performance, through 
improving manufacturing efficiencies 
and managing inventory more effectively, 
ensuring that the right products are available 
locally to our customers and distributors, 
to ensure that we maintain our position as 
market leader. 
Segment outlook
In North America, the return to industrial 
production growth seen in 2017 is forecast 
to continue, driven by the administration’ s 
attempts in the USA to stimulate the 
economy. In Latin America, Argentine and 
Brazilian economic fortunes could turn more 
positive during 2018, albeit from a low base. 
Our strong market-leading position in these 
countries will enable us to capitalise on any 
improvements in our operating environment. 
However, during 2018, Mexico, Brazil, 
Colombia and Chile will all have Presidential 
elections and the associated political 
uncertainty could affect business confidence 
in these countries during the year.
Should the recent relative strength of sterling 
against the US dollar continue, we will see 
a headwind to sales in the Americas as well 
as a dilutionary impact on margins, which 
we are working hard to counteract through 
increased efficiencies.

Acquired July 2017
Market overview
Electrical process heating and temperature 
management solutions specialist, 
Chromalox, joined the Group in July 
2017. The company’ s products are widely 
used across a diverse range of industrial 
processes and, as a result, industrial 
production growth rates provide a good 
measure of conditions in the company’ s 
markets. Geographically, Chromalox 
generated 73% of revenue in North America, 
15% in EMEA, 9% in Asia Pacific and 3% 
in Latin America. Due to its strong position 
in the USA, the company has a high level 
of exposure to industrial production growth 
rates in that market and, to a lesser extent, 
elsewhere in the Americas, Europe, the 
Middle East and Asia, where it has a small 
direct sales presence. While the USA’ s 
economy returned to growth in 2017, 
industrial production remained lacklustre 
and patchy, providing a subdued operating 
environment for most of the year, but with 
some signs of improvement towards the end 
of 2017. Elsewhere, conditions were similar 
to those in the Steam Specialties markets, 
with moderate levels of growth in EMEA and 
slightly higher growth rates in Asia Pacific. 
With 16% of sales being generated in the 
Oil & Gas industry, the depressed oil prices 
throughout most of 2017 suppressed inward 
investment and limited opportunities for 
growth. As the oil price increased towards 
the end of the year, conditions began to 
moderate, offering hope for improved trading 
conditions in 2018.

Progress in 2017
Chromalox contributed £75.1 million 
to Group revenue post-acquisition. 
For reference purposes, full year revenues 
in 2017 were £146 million, in line with our 
expectations at the time of the acquisition. 
On a comparable basis, sales were 2% 
down on 2016 at constant currency, 
following a difficult start to the year prior 
to acquisition. However, from the second 
quarter on, order intake was higher than the 
same period in the prior year, with full year 
order intake 3% ahead of 2016 at constant 
currency. Demand during the fourth quarter 
reached the highest level of the past two 
years, translating into good sales and profit 
growth over Q4 2016 at constant currency. 
This was driven in part by a renewed focus 
on OEM customers, particularly for highly-
specialised, niche applications that are 
addressable by Chromalox technologies 
and increased investment in direct selling 
resources, positioning us well for 2018.
Post-acquisition, Chromalox contributed 
£13.8 million in adjusted operating profit. 
For reference, the full year 2017 adjusted 
operating profit was £26 million, slightly 
ahead of our expectations at the time of the 
acquisition. On a comparable basis, full year 
profit was 3% ahead of 2016. Under Spirax 
ownership, adjusted operating margin 
was 18.4%. On a comparable basis the 
margin for the full year 2017 increased 80 
bps to 17.8% due to an improved product 
mix and a rigorous focus on continuous 
improvement, an important element of the 
Chromalox Management System.
Integration and strategy update
Post-acquisition, Chromalox has continued 
to operate as a stand-alone global division, 
maintaining its brand within the Spirax Sarco 
business group. The company has a strong, 
long-serving executive team, all of whom 
remained with the business post-acquisition, 
delivering continuity in a time of change 
and bringing their experience to bear at this 
exciting new stage of the company’ s history. 
While there will be many opportunities 
for Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc to 
support Chromalox’ s growth and margin 
improvement over the coming years, this 
stand-alone structure and the continuation of 
the management team minimises the need 
for significant integration activities.
During 2017 Chromalox celebrated its 
centenary. This was an important time to 
reflect on those factors that have contributed 
to the company’ s success during the last 
100 years and to identify those things 
that we must do going forward to deliver 
enhanced growth and customer value. 
Throughout the second half of 2017 we 
conducted an extensive strategic review 
and refreshed the Chromalox strategic 
growth plan, with implementation starting in 
January 2018. 
New product development is a key 
strategic priority for Chromalox. A number 
of innovative new products were launched 
during the year including: the CCX 
Cast Block Heater; CXHXD Corrosion-
Resistant Explosion Proof Unit Heater; 
RSP Remote Sensor Panel; TEH Tubular 
Enclosure Heater; and Wireless Monitoring 
enhancement for heat trace and heater 
control panels. We will continue to invest in 
research and development to ensure that 
Chromalox continues to deliver innovative 
new products to customers.
Currently sales outside of North America are 
relatively limited and over the coming years 
we will look to internationalise our business 
further, leveraging Spirax Sarco’ s global 
footprint to grow our direct sales presence 
outside the USA. The Chromalox direct sales 
force will remain separate from the Steam 
Specialties division, but will utilise Spirax 
Sarco’ s facilities, systems and experience 
to gain a foothold in new markets, 
while constantly pursuing commercial 
synergy opportunities. 
Outlook
While market conditions were challenging 
throughout much of 2017, the year ended 
with conditions improving and a good order 
book going into 2018. The higher oil prices, if 
sustained, should provide greater buoyancy 
in the Oil & Gas industry during the coming 
year, providing opportunities for growth. 
It is too early to determine whether the more 
positive industrial production levels seen 
in the latter part of 2017 in the USA will 
continue to improve in 2018. Nevertheless, 
our direct sales business model, class-
beating products, renewed strategic focus 
and the opportunities for geographical 
expansion that come from being part of 
the Group, position Chromalox very well for 
growth in the medium to long-term.
Despite the increased revenue investments 
for growth and potentially unfavourable 
currency headwinds, we anticipate 
maintaining the trading margin in 2018 at 
2017’ s full year level.

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Corporate Information Watson-Marlow
Market overview
With its broad customer base and geographic 
spread, the Watson-Marlow niche pumps and 
associated fluid path technologies business 
is subject to similar economic conditions and 
industrial production growth rates as those 
experienced by the Steam Specialties division. 
However , Watson-Marlow’ s greater exposure 
(c.40% of sales) to the Pharmaceutical & 
Biotechnology industry means that it is 
heavily affected by conditions in that market. 
During the early months of the year demand 
from the Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology 
industry weakened as rhetoric during the US 
Presidential election in 2016 affected business 
confidence and stalled inward investment. 
However , conditions started improving during 
the second quarter of 2017, with historic 
demand levels resuming in the second half of 
the year . The upturn in industrial production 
growth gave a boost to OEM manufacturers. 
Food & Beverage was solidly up, driven by 
the recent Certa pump launch. Conditions in 
the Mining industry were mixed; lacklustre in 
traditional regions but with growth elsewhere. 
Water & Wastewater continued to be variable, 
with reduced project size in the USA but strong 
base business driven by market gains across 
North America and Europe from our Qdos 
range of pumps. 
Progress in 2017
Sales increased by 10% on an organic 
basis, boosted by a number of large orders 
placed in 2016. A 5% benefit from exchange 
and 12% coming from the full year effect 
of the acquisition of Aflex, combined to 
give reported sales of £248.2 million; a 
28% increase over the prior year on a 
reported basis.

Key market performance 
 − After a sustained period of decline, the 
global industrial production growth rate 
strengthened in 2017 to 3.4%
 − Emerging markets had a higher level of 
growth, at 4.2% than OECD markets, at 
2.9%
 − Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology industry 
started slowly, historic demand levels 
resumed in the second half
 − Mining and Water & Wastewater 
markets variable 
 − OEM manufacturers boosted by industrial 
production growth
 − Food & Beverage solidly up
Strong organic sales growth was achieved 
in all geographic regions. Europe saw good 
growth, with notable performances in the 
UK, Germany , Italy and the Netherlands. 
There was excellent growth in Asia Pacific, 
with Japan and T aiwan achieving outstanding 
growth and a strong performance in China. 
The Americas saw good growth in North 
America, by far the largest market, and 
excellent progress in Latin America. 
Sales into the Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology 
industry were up despite a very tough compare 
and a slow start to the year . General industry 
was ahead of the prior year , due in large 
part to the expanded Qdos pump range. 
OEM achieved good growth. The MasoSine 
Certa pump, which was launched in 2016, 
underpinned excellent growth in the Food & 
Beverage industry , with both end user and 
OEM sales significantly benefiting from this 
innovative, world-leading pump. The Mining 
industry achieved modest growth with flat sales 
in traditional geographies supplemented by 
good growth in Russia and Mexico. Growth in 
the Water & Wastewater industry primarily 
came from EMEA. 
Aflex, which was acquired at the end of 
November 2016, has integrated well and 
delivered good, above-plan performance in 
sales and an improvement in operating profit 
by leveraging higher volume sales against 
controlled overheads. New companies in 
Canada and Ireland made excellent progress 
in their first full year of trading, while new 
operating units in Indonesia, Thailand and 
Vietnam, which began direct selling in March 
2017, and a newly established sales office in 
the UAE, also performed well. Our customers 
are benefiting from our investment in direct 
sales personnel and the attendant knowledge 
and expertise they bring to these markets. 
Watson-Marlow’ s operating profit of 
£80.3 million was up 6% on an organic basis 
and 25% on a reported basis benefiting from 
currency and a full year of Aflex. At 32.4%, 
the reported operating profit margin was 
down 70 bps on the prior year due to the 
dilutionary impact of Aflex’ s lower margin. 
Excluding Aflex, margins expanded by 40 
bps as operational gearing and transactional 
currency benefits more than offset increased 
revenue investment for growth.
Strategy update
During 2017 we continued to rigorously 
implement our five-point strategic plan. 
We expanded our geographic direct sales 
footprint and began trading through three 
new operating units in Indonesia, Thailand 
and Vietnam in March 2017, with a sales 
office in the UAE. In the UK, our commitment 
to international trade was recognised as 
Watson-Marlow Ltd and BioPure Ltd won 
a combined Queen’ s Award for Enterprise: 
International T rade.
Improving the effectiveness of our direct 
sales teams through market sector 
focus and enhanced training, continued 
apace. We established a US East Coast 
Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology direct sales 
team and invested in increasing headcount 
specifically to address this important market. 
This investment was supported by an 
international Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology 
sales training conference and three regional 
training conferences, in Europe, Asia and 
Latin America.
We had an excellent year for product 
launches, with several important new 
products released to market. These included 
the Quantum purification pump, designed 
for specific, low pulsation applications in the 
Biotechnology industry; BioPure Q-Clamp; 
a new gasket and braided hose range from 
BioPure; the 730 Watson-Marlow process 
pumps; Puresu® single use tube assemblies; 
Qdos 20; and the Flexicon PF7 peristaltic 
filling machine. The Quantum pump has been 
very well received, winning the “Best T echnical 
Innovation” award at the International 
Pharmaceutical Expo, in New Y ork City .
We established a new business intelligence 
system that links directly to our ERP system, 
enhancing business visibility and automating 
many previously manual reporting functions, 
expanded into new premises in Switzerland, 
Austria, Singapore, China and India and 
invested in a new manufacturing building at 
BioPure in the UK.
In January 2018, we acquired a small 
pre-revenue company and we envisage 
expensing R&D investments of approximately 
£1.5 million a year , over the next two years, to 
bring an innovative product to market.
Outlook
Globally , industrial production looks likely to 
remain positive during 2018, at similar levels 
to those seen in 2017, with our markets also 
being influenced by levels of investment in 
our core focus areas and macro-economic 
conditions in the countries in which we 
operate. Following the rebound in 2017, we 
expect the Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology 
market to be robust in 2018 and are well 
placed to achieve growth as we benefit from 
our increased investment and focus on this 
important sector . New products are making 
good inroads, displacing other pump types, 
delivering enhanced customer value and 
providing opportunities for growth. We remain 
confident in our ability to deliver above-
market organic sales growth, although the 
lower order intake rate in 2017 would point 
to a mid-to-high single digit level of sales 
growth in the current year . Should current 
exchange rates persist for the rest of the 
year , transactional foreign exchange effects 
would negatively impact the reported margin. 
Combined with the proportionally higher 
revenue investments for growth, we anticipate 
a small margin decline in 2018, similar to the 
organic margin decline of 2017.

Financial Review
Financial Review
The Group reports under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
also uses adjusted and organic figures 
where the Board believes that they help 
to effectively monitor the performance of 
the Group and help users of the Financial 
Statements to draw comparisons with 
our peers. Certain alternative performance 
measures also form a meaningful element 
of Executive Directors’ annual bonuses. 
Unless otherwise stated, adjusted figures are 
used throughout this section. A reconciliation 
of adjusted operating profit to statutory 
operating profit is given below and more 
detail can be found in Note 2 to the 
Financial Statements. As we are a multi-
national Group of companies that trade in 
a large number of foreign currencies and 
regularly acquire and sometimes dispose 
of companies, we also refer to organic 
performance measures. Organic measures 
strip out the effects of the movement of 
foreign currency exchange rates and of 
acquisitions. The percentage organic growth 
or decline is defined as the movement, 
excluding acquisitions or disposals, on the 
prior year’ s result translated at the current 
year’ s exchange rates. The Board believes 
that this allows users of the Financial 
Statements to gain a further understanding 
of how the Group has performed.
A good financial result was achieved in 
2017 against the positive background 
of better industrial production growth. 
Reported sales grew 32% to £998.7 million 
(2016: £757.4 million). Organic sales grew 
by 6%. Watson-Marlow had another 
excellent year, again delivering 10% organic 
growth, with all regions performing well. 
Organic sales grew by 5% in the Steam 
Specialties division, with a 5% advance 
in EMEA, 6% gain in Asia Pacific and 2% 
growth in the Americas. The net effect of 
the acquisition of Hiter in July 2016, Aflex in 
November 2016, Gestra in May 2017 and 
Chromalox in July 2017 added 20% to sales.
The weakening of sterling following the 
UK referendum on EU membership had a 
dramatic effect on revenue in the second 
half of 2016 that continued into the first half 
of 2017, giving a gain of 5% for the full year . 
T owards the end of the year , sterling began to 
strengthen. If recent exchange rates were to 
prevail for the whole of 2018 we would expect 
to see a 2% exchange headwind to sales on 
translation when compared to 2017.
Adjusted operating profit of £235.5 million 
(2016: £180.6 million) was 30% ahead at 
reported exchange rates and 6% ahead 
on an organic basis (constant currency, 
excluding acquisitions). On an organic basis 
the Steam Specialties division saw profits 
increase by 6% with 7% growth in EMEA, 
7% in Asia Pacific and 1% in the Americas. 
Watson-Marlow’ s profits grew 6% on an 
organic basis.
Currency movements boosted operating 
profit by 9%, a mixture of translational and 
transactional gains. The net transactional 
gain was £6.6 million. The main transactional 
exposure flow affecting the Group is the 
export of products from our factories in the 
UK, invoiced in sterling, less the import of 
goods from overseas Group factories and 
third parties priced predominately in euros 
and US dollars. The net exposure is in the 
range £60-65 million. If recent exchange 
rates prevail for the whole of 2018 we would 
expect to see a 4% reduction to profit due 
to transactional and translation foreign 
exchange movements.
The net effect of the acquisitions made in 
2016 and 2017 was to add 14% to profit on 
a constant currency basis.
Adjusted operating profit margin in the 
Steam Specialties division was flat at 
22.9% despite the dilutionary impact of the 
Gestra and Hiter acquisitions. Excluding the 
acquisitions, the margin would have been 
70 bps higher at 23.6%. As expected, 
Watson-Marlow’ s margin fell due to the 
inclusion of Aflex, ending the year down 
70 bps at 32.4%. Excluding Aflex they 
increased 40 bps to an outstanding 33.5%. 
Chromalox performed a little ahead of 
our expectations with a margin of 18.4%. 
Overall the Group’ s reported margin fell 
by 20 bps to 23.6% due to acquisitions. 
The underlying margin, excluding 
acquisitions, improved 90 bps to 24.7%. 
Statutory operating profit was £198.9 million 
(2016: £174.1 million). 
Interest
Net interest rose from £2.6 million to 
£6.4 million. Net bank interest increased 
from zero in 2016 to £3.9 million reflecting 
the debt taken on during the year to fund 
the Gestra and Chromalox acquisitions. 
We anticipate net bank interest charges in 
the region of £6 million in 2018.
Net finance costs under IAS19 in respect 
of the Group’ s defined benefit pension 
schemes reduced slightly to £2.5 million 
(2016: £2.6 million). We anticipate a similar 
cost in 2018.
“ A good financial result was achieved in 2017 
against the positive background of better 
industrial production growth.”

Associates
The Group has only one Associate holding, 
a 38.9% interest in Econotherm, a heat 
pipe technology business. Econotherm’ s 
performance in 2017 was similar to 2016, 
with our share, net of tax, reflecting a break-
even position (2016: £0.1 million loss).
Pre-tax profit
The adjusted profit before tax of 
£229.1 million (2016: £177.9 million) was 
29% ahead at reported exchange rates. 
As outlined earlier , currency movements were 
favourable in the year . At constant currency , 
adjusted profit before tax increased by 18%.
The statutory profit before tax was 
£192.5 million (2016: £171.4 million) and 
includes the items listed below that have 
been excluded from the adjusted profit:
 − a charge of £21.6 million 
(2016: £6.0 million) for the amortisation 
and impairment of acquisition-related 
intangible assets;
 − acquisition related items of £7.8 million 
(2016: £0.5 million); and
 − reversal of acquisition related fair value 
adjustments to inventory, £7.2 million 
(2016: £nil million).
Taxation
The tax charge on the adjusted profit before 
tax, excluding the results of the Associate 
(which is presented on an after-tax basis), 
remained constant at 29.1% (2016: 29.1%). 
The Group’ s overall tax rate reflects the 
blended average of the tax rates in over 40 
tax jurisdictions around the world in which 
our operations trade and generate profit. 
The Group comprises over 110, mainly 
small, operating units reflecting our local 
direct sales business model. 
The Group expects the recently enacted US 
T ax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) to positively 
impact its future US after-tax adjusted 
earnings, primarily due to the reduction 
in the US federal corporate income tax 
rate from 35% to 21% applicable from 1st 
January 2018.
In 2017 there was no impact from the Act 
on the Group effective tax rate on adjusted 
profit although there was a one-off non-
cash tax credit relating to the revaluation 
of US deferred tax assets and liabilities of 
£24 million which has been excluded from 
adjusted earnings. For the year to 31st 
December 2018 we currently anticipate 
(based on the forecast mix of adjusted 
profit) that the changes will reduce the 
Group effective tax rate on adjusted profits 
to approximately 27%. We will continue to 
review and update our guidance in the light 
of future clarifications from the US authorities 
on the complex provisions in the legislation. 
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share increased 
by 29% to 220.5 pence (2016: 171.5 
pence). Statutory earnings per share was 
214.4 pence (2016: 165.0 pence). The fully 
diluted earnings per share was not materially 
different in either year.
Dividends
The Group has a progressive dividend policy 
where dividend payments follow underlying 
earnings per share growth while maintaining 
prudent levels of dividend cover. The aim is 
to provide sustainable, affordable dividend 
growth, building on our 50 year record of 
dividend progress, with a compound annual 
increase of 11.0% over that period; in line 
with the 11.3% per annum increase over the 
last 10 years. The Board is proposing a final 
dividend of 62.0 pence per share for 2017 
(2016: 53.5 pence) payable on 25th May 
2018 to shareholders on the register at 27th 
April 2018. T ogether with the interim dividend 
of 25.5 pence per share (2016: 22.5 pence), 
the total Ordinary dividend is therefore 87.5 
pence per share, which is an increase of 
15.1% on the Ordinary dividend of 76.0 
pence per share in 2016. 
The total amount paid in dividends during 
the year was £58.1 million, 12% above the 
£51.9 million paid in 2016.
Acquisitions 
Acquisitions are an important complement 
to our strategy for organic growth. 
Dedicated resource is focused on identifying 
opportunities to add attractive businesses 
that closely match our strategic, industrial 
and commercial requirements. During 2017 
we made two acquisitions at a total cost of 
£484 million (including fees). Both fulfil our 
three broad acquisition criteria:
 − geographic expansion, typically through 
the acquisition of a distributor in a 
developing market;
 − products that can be integrated into our 
existing businesses; and
 − related acquisitions that fit alongside our 
existing Steam Specialties and Watson-
Marlow businesses.
On 3rd May the Group announced the 
successful completion of the acquisition of 
Gestra AG and its overseas subsidiaries 
for a cash-free, debt-free consideration of 
€186 million. 
Gestra, headquartered in Bremen, Germany, 
is a technology leader in advanced industrial 
boiler control systems and specialises in the 
design and production of valves and control 
systems for steam and fluid process control. 
The business is highly complementary 
to the Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties 
division and will enhance and accelerate the 
implementation of Spirax Sarco’ s strategy 
for growth, as a result of its well-developed 
capabilities in a wide range of industries and 
applications. Gestra’ s results are reported 
within the three geographic segments of the 
Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties division. 
In the eight months of ownership, Gestra 
has performed in line with the business case 
at the time of acquisition. For reference, 
considering Gestra’ s full year 2017 
performance at constant currency, orders 
were in line with the previous year but

sales and profits were down as expected. 
However, in the second half of the year, order 
intake was above the same period of 2016 
and in the last quarter of 2017 sales and 
profits also returned to growth.
On 3rd July the Group completed the 
acquisition of Chromalox Inc. for a cash-free, 
debt-free consideration of US$415 million. 
Chromalox is a USA based provider of 
electrical products, systems and solutions for 
industrial process heating and temperature 
management. It is closely related to the 
Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties business 
in delivering thermal energy solutions to 
its customers through a primarily direct 
sales channel and has expanded our total 
addressable market. It forms part of the 
Spirax Sarco business group and is reported 
as a separate division within that business.
In the six months of ownership, Chromalox 
has performed in line with the business case 
at the time of acquisition. For reference, 
considering Chromalox’ s full year 2017 
performance at constant currency, orders 
and profits were 3% ahead of the previous 
year, while sales were 2% down. In the 
second half of the year, order intake was 
above the same period of 2016 and in the 
last quarter of 2017 sales and profits also 
returned to growth.
Following an especially active period for 
the Group in 2017, we do not anticipate 
making any significant acquisitions in 2018 
as we focus on the integration of Gestra 
and Chromalox. However, we continue 
to look at small bolt-on acquisitions and 
technology buys. In January 2018, we 
acquired a small pre-revenue company 
for the Watson-Marlow business group. 
We envisage expensing R&D investments 
of approximately £1.5 million a year, over 
the next two years, to bring an innovative 
product to market. Consideration on a 
cash-free, debt-free basis was €3.0 million 
with a further €6.5 million potentially paid in 
the coming years on completion of certain 
technical development hurdles.
The two acquisitions that were made in 
2016, Aflex in Watson-Marlow and Hiter in 
the Steam Specialties division, have been 
integrated successfully into the Group and 
are performing ahead of expectations in their 
first full year in our Group.
Research and development
The development of innovative new 
products, and getting those products to 
market faster and sold more effectively, is an 
important element of our strategy for growth.
Overall the Group’ s total spend in research 
and development in 2017 was £14.4 million 
(2016: £13.6 million) of which £2.9 million 
was capitalised (2016: £3.0 million).
Capital employed
T otal capital employed has increased 17% 
at reported exchange rates. If the effects 
of currency and acquisitions are excluded, 
growth was 3%. This compares with organic 
sales growth of 6%.
T angible fixed assets increased by 
£25.7 million to £227.5 million. Changes in 
exchange rates reduced fixed assets by 
£3.7 million and £26.6 million came from 
acquisitions, giving an organic increase of 
£2.8 million, around 1%. Unlike previous 
years, there were no significant plant 
expansion projects in 2017 with spend 
being spread over a number of investment 
categories including the “Future Factory” 
programme at our Steam facility in 
Cheltenham to upgrade machine tools and 
an upgrade of IT equipment at Gestra’ s 
Bremen facility . Looking forward, we would 
expect capital expenditure to increase in 2018 
to approximately £45 million as we continue 
to invest in the Group and, in particular , in the 
recent acquisitions. We generate significant 
cash and our first priority is to reinvest in the 
business, taking opportunities to generate 
good returns from increased efficiency , 
reduced costs and flexibility .
T otal working capital increased by 
£44.1 million. The ratio of working capital 
to sales reduced by 220 bps to 25.3% 
(2016: 27.5%) mostly due to foreign 
exchange effects and the acquisitions made 
during the year. Including a full 12 months 
of sales for Gestra and Chromalox, the ratio 
would be 23.0%. On a constant currency 
basis, excluding acquisitions, working capital 
as a percentage of sales reduced by 60 bps. 
Going forward, we would expect working 
capital as a percentage of sales to increase 
slowly as Gestra and Chromalox expand the 
proportion of their revenue that go through 
direct sales channels. 
Return on capital employed 
(ROCE)
ROCE measures effective management 
of fixed assets and working capital 
relative to the profitability of the business. 
ROCE increased to 52.9% (2016: 47.9%), 
an increase of 500 bps due to the high 
growth in profit and our close control of the 
various components of capital employed. 
At constant currency, excluding acquisitions 
ROCE increased by 360 bps.
Post-retirement benefits
The net post-retirement benefit liability under 
IAS19 fell to £85.6 million (2016: £94.2 million) 
primarily as a result of the return on assets 
being greater than the increase in liabilities 
despite further small reductions in the AA 
corporate bond rates used to discount 
future cash flows. In total, assets rose by 
£31.3 million (7%) which outweighed the 
increase in liabilities of £22.7 million (4%). 
The main UK schemes, which constitute 
88% of assets, were closed to new members 
in 2001 but have remained open to future 
service accrual. These schemes continue 
to be managed under a dynamic de-risking 
strategy whereby asset and liability values 
are monitored on a daily basis by the asset 
manager and appropriate asset allocation 
decisions taken as the funding level improves 
against pre-agreed trigger points.

 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 51
During 2017 we had the results of the 
actuarial valuation of two of the three UK 
schemes as at 31st December 2016. On a 
technical provisions basis, the smaller of 
the two had a surplus of £3.5 million while 
the larger had a deficit of £11.2 million. 
As a result we agreed a deficit reduction 
programme with the Trustees whereby 
the Company will make contributions of 
£2.8 million per annum until 2021.
Cash flow and treasury
Cash generation in 2017 was dominated by 
the two large acquisitions and the growth in 
revenue which impacted working capital.
Cash from operations increased to 
£202.6 million (2016: £182.7 million) 
representing 86% cash conversion. 
There was an outflow of working capital in 
the year of £34.2 million. However, excluding 
acquisitions and on a constant currency 
basis, working capital as a percentage of 
sales fell 60 bps from 25.3% to 24.7%.
Capital expenditure grew to £35.0 million 
(2016: £31.3 million), in part reflecting 
investment in the acquisitions. We would 
expect capital expenditure in 2018 to 
increase to around £45 million as we 
continue to invest across the Group. 
In particular, we expect to begin the 
construction of a new facility for Aflex that will 
combine the four existing UK sites into one. 
In total, we estimate that this will cost a net 
£18 million spread over the next three years, 
with approximately £4 million in the current 
year and the bulk of the balance in 2019. 
We also expect work to commence on the 
construction of new facilities in Australia, 
which was postponed in 2017, and to 
continue the accelerated equipment upgrade 
programme for some of our manufacturing 
facilities to maintain the efficiency gains seen 
in 2016 and 2017.
T ax paid in the year was £61.0 million 
(2016: £56.5 million). T ax paid was broadly 
in line with the tax charge in the Income 
Statement and included tax paid in virtually 
every one of the 44 countries in which 
the Group had operating units in 2017. 
Free cash flow rose to £135.2 million 
(2016: £126.2 million).
Dividend payments were £58.4 million,  
including payments to minorities, (2016:  
£52.1 million) and represent the final dividend 
for 2016 and the interim dividend for 2017.
There was a cash outflow, including fees, 
of £484.3 million for acquisitions in the year 
compared with £66.5 million in the prior year. 
Shares issued under the Group’ s various 
employee share schemes gave a cash inflow 
of £2.4 million (2016: £1.3 million).
Net cash at the start of the year reduced 
from £27.4 million to a net debt figure of 
£373.6 million at 31st December 2017, a 
reduction of £401.0 million due to the two 
large acquisitions. This equates to a net debt 
to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 and in the current 
year we would expect this to fall further to 
approximately 1.0.
The Group’ s Income Statement and Balance 
Sheet are exposed to movements in a wide 
range of different currencies. This stems 
from our direct sales business model, 
with a large number of local operating 
units. These currency exposures and 
risks are managed through a rigorously 
applied Treasury Policy, typically using 
centrally managed and approved simple 
forward contracts to mitigate exposures to 
known cash flows and avoiding the use of 
complex derivative transactions. The largest 
exposures are to the euro, US dollar , Chinese 
renminbi and Korean won. Whilst currency 
effects can be significant, the structure of 
the Group provides some mitigation through 
our regional manufacturing strategy, diverse 
spread of geographic locations and through 
the natural hedge of having a high proportion 
of our overhead costs in the local currencies 
of our direct sales operating units.
Capital structure
The Board keeps the capital requirements of 
the Group under regular review, maintaining 
a strong Balance Sheet to protect the 
business and provide flexibility of funding 
for growth. The Group earns a high return 
on capital, which is reflected in strong cash 
generation over time. Our capital allocation 
policy remains unchanged. Our first priority 
is to maximise investment in the business 
to generate further good returns in the 
future, aligned with our strategy for growth 
and targeting improvement in our key 
performance indicators. Next, we prioritise 
finding suitable acquisitions that can expand 
our addressable market through increasing 
our geographic reach, deepening our market 
penetration or broadening our product range. 
Acquisition targets need to exhibit good 
strategic fit and meet strict commercial, 
economic and return on investment criteria. 
When cash resources significantly exceed 
expected future requirements, we sought to 
return capital to shareholders, as evidenced 
by special dividends declared in respect of 
2010, 2012 and 2014. However , in the near 
term, we will look to reduce our financial 
leverage prior to considering new returns of 
capital to shareholders.

Sustainability Report
Sustainability is a key strategic priority for the Group; as we focus on improving the 
sustainability of our operations, and help our customers to do the same, we drive growth, 
increase efficiency and play our part in engineering a more sustainable future.
Our sustainability vision: 
T o engineer a more sustainable future. 
Our sustainability mission: 
We will operate sustainably through responsibly managing our 
business for on-going financial success; operations in accordance 
with laws and regulations; social and environmental impacts; ethical 
and social responsibilities; and customer and supplier relationships, 
to improve the sustainability of their operations. 
We commit to engineering a sustainable future by focusing on five 
core areas: our workplaces, our supply chain, our environment, our 
customers and our communities, setting objectives and targets in 
each area.
Our sustainability strategy: 2017 update
Throughout the year our focus has been on the implementation of 
our five year plans within each of our material sustainability topics. 
(Further information can be found in the reports for each topic on 
pages 54 to 61.) 
A key priority during 2017 was to raise awareness of the sustainability 
strategy across the Group. During the year we launched a 
sustainability e-learning module, which is available in 15 languages; 
2,732 employees completed the training during 2017. Increasing the 
number of employees who have completed the training will be a 
focus for 2018. We were pleased to welcome Gestra and Chromalox 
into the Group during 2017 and have begun to raise awareness of 
the sustainability strategy within these businesses and to involve 
them in its strategic implementation. 
The Sustainability Committee met quarterly throughout the year, with 
presentations by the project leaders of each topic. The Committee 
oversees progress and performance and supports the 
implementation of the strategy. Progress was reported to the Group 
Chief Executive, Executive Committee and Board of Directors.

Overview
Health and Safety (H&S) excellence is the cornerstone of our business. 
Reducing accidents and maintaining a safe working environment for our 
employees, contractors, visitors and customers are our primary aims. 
We are actively promoting a H&S culture, encouraging our employees to 
adopt safe working practices at all times. The Group Chief Executive and 
Board of Directors oversee our H&S programmes and performance, with 
H&S a standing agenda item at every Board meeting. All Group companies 
are required to adhere to the Group H&S Policy, operate within Group 
programmes and have detailed H&S management systems in place locally.
Performance in 2017
During 2017 , our over seven day lost-time accident rate fell to 3.0 accidents 
per 1,000 employees (2016: 3.4). We benchmarked our performance 
against RIDDOR’s “Over 7-Day Rate of Reported Non-Fatal Injury Per 
100,000 Employees, 2012/13-2016/17” in the UK manufacturing sector, 
which was 365 (3.65 per 1,000 employees). Our H&S performance in 2017 
was therefore better than the industry average. Excluding businesses 
acquired in 2017 , the number of accidents resulting in over three days of lost 
time, which includes over seven day accidents, fell to 20 in 2017 . Four over 
three day accidents occurred post-acquisition in businesses that joined 
the Group in 2017 , taking the total number of over three day accidents 
to 24. During the year, 14 of our 26 manufacturing sites did not have any 
over three day accidents and Watson-Marlow MasoSine maintained their 
world-class safety performance, this year achieving 18 years without a lost-
time accident.
We significantly increased the number of H&S training units delivered to 
24,7 47 (2016: 14,958). As part of our Behavioural Based Safety programme 
we have focused on reporting of employee concerns and near misses. 
5,485 employee concerns were raised during 2017 (2016: 7 ,845). 
Each concern was reviewed and corrective actions taken. A total of 562 
near misses were reported during the year (2016: 250). Each near miss 
was thoroughly investigated, corrective action taken, and learning shared 
across the Group. The high number of concerns raised and near misses 
reported demonstrates the success of our awareness campaigns and 
the embedding of a H&S culture across the Group, which empowers 
employees to raise concerns and take action to report near misses. 
We employ 39 full-time, qualified H&S professionals and additional part-time 
EHS employees (2016: 32). As part of our due diligence process to ensure 
compliance with Group policies and procedures, during 2017 we completed 
787 internal continuous improvement EHS inspections across our supply 
sites (2016: 489). 
At the end of the year, 15 of our 26 manufacturing sites held  
OHSAS 18001 certification and a number of companies were working 
towards achieving it (2016: 11 of 19). All Watson-Marlow manufacturing 
sites established Behavioural Based Safety programmes during 2017 . 
During 2017 , we opened a new Distribution Centre in Singapore. 
During the extensive refurbishment of the building we followed our internal 
Management of Change procedure to ensure the highest standards of 
H&S were met. The Centre was opened without any lost-time accidents.
Actions taken in 2017
We concentrated on two key themes throughout 2017: first, the training of 
managers and second, investment in engineering controls to reduce risk. 
The first session of our Worldwide Leadership Conference was focused 
on workplace safety. The 107 senior managers present were instructed 
in the steps required to develop a strong safety culture. The training 
also focused on the importance of engaging employees and monitoring 
H&S performance using leading indicators. An external guest speaker 
delivered a powerful presentation about a serious industrial accident that 
he encountered while working for a global industrial company and the 
long-lasting impact this had on individuals and the business. During 2017 , 
we also delivered Institution of Occupational Safety and Health “Safety for 
Executives and Directors” training to 30 executives and senior managers 
within the business.
To further strengthen the safety culture, programmes and performance 
within our Spirax Sarco sales companies, we created regional EHS 
leadership roles and have appointed nine new EHS professionals whose 
remit will be to provide advice, training and H&S solutions to our companies, 
while implementing the Group’s roadmap to EHS excellence.
During 2017 , we removed 59 machines from the business after a H&S risk 
was identified.
We have also started to align recent acquisitions, Gestra and Chromalox, 
to our H&S programmes and are investing in increasing the number of H&S 
professionals employed in these businesses. 
Next steps for 2018
 − Roll out cross-business H&S audits across the Steam 
Specialties division
 − Create and deliver a bespoke Safety Leadership training programme for 
senior managers
 − Roll out and adoption of the Group Lock-Out Tag-Out Policy across 
supply sites
 − Embed regional EHS leaders within the Steam Specialties division
“ As we focus on leading indicators we 
increase risk awareness and establish a 
culture that drives safe behaviours.”

Overview
We have policies and commitments around the way that we treat people 
and we base our employment practices on our Core Values, in particular 
the value of respect. Along with the Group Whistle-Blowing Policy, our HR 
policies and systems provide a strong framework to protect the rights of 
employees and ensure their fair and equitable treatment.
A diverse workforce brings vitality and creativity to our workplaces and 
increases our ability to sustainably create value for our stakeholders. 
We seek to increase diversity at all levels of the organisation, with a 
particular focus on gender diversity. Our remuneration practices are 
designed to reward and recognise skills, experience and achievement, and 
to be free of gender bias. Employees are remunerated fairly for the work that 
they do and we do not promote or require excessive working hours.
Applicants and employees are treated equally during recruitment, transfer, 
promotion, training or salary assessment, and we do not discriminate on 
the basis of an individual’s gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, beliefs, 
maternity, or any other protected characteristic, as prescribed by law. 
We are a member of the Business Disability Forum (UK) and the 
Employers Network for Equality & Inclusion (UK), give full and fair 
consideration to applications for employment made by disabled 
persons, having regard to their abilities and aptitudes, and support the 
continuing employment of individuals who become disabled during their 
employment with the Company. Disabled persons are entitled to the 
same professional development and opportunities for promotion as other 
Company employees.
Our Group Human Rights Policy recognises the right of all individuals to 
lead a dignified life, free from fear and want and free to express independent 
beliefs, as well as the right of employees to equal opportunities, non-
discriminatory treatment, a safe working environment and a fair wage. 
We do not use forced, compulsory or child labour either directly or within 
our supply chain; we respect the rights of children; maintain workplaces free 
of victimisation, harassment or bullying; and accept the rights of employees 
to association and collective bargaining.
We communicate with employees through a variety of channels, to ensure 
that they have an understanding of the operations and performance of 
the Group. We undertake confidential employee surveys to assess our 
performance as an employer and have well-established grievance and 
whistle-blowing procedures to enable employees to raise concerns.
Performance in 2017
During 2017 , two sizable acquisitions increased our global headcount by 
nearly 30%. These two businesses have a similar gender profile to the 
rest of the Group, meaning that our gender balance remains relatively 
unchanged with 5,628 males (2016: 4,243) and 1,630 females (2016: 1, 141) 
across the workforce as a whole and 490 male (2016: 392) and 103 female 
(2016: 77) senior managers. However, on a like-for-like basis, excluding 
acquisitions, we made good progress in improving our senior management 
gender diversity, with the percentage of female senior managers increasing 
from 16% in 2016 to 20% in 2017 . Board gender diversity remained 
unchanged with seven males and two females. During 2017 , we participated 
in the FTSE Women Leaders (Hampton-Alexander) Review. With 22.2% 
female representation on our Board and 19.5% of Executive Committee 
and their Direct Reports combined being female, we were ranked 124th in 
the FTSE 250 for senior management gender diversity. We recognise that 
further actions need to be taken to increase the representation of women.
Actions taken in 2017
During 2017 , we formalised our commitment to the promotion of diversity 
within our business as we established a Group Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy. We also increased our target for women on the Board to 33%, 
as opportunities allow. In accordance with Gender Pay Gap Reporting 
requirements in the UK, we implemented Gender Pay Gap reporting. 
Our 2017 Gender Pay Gap Report can be found on our website.
During 2017 , we worked hard to address our gender imbalance through 
fair and transparent recruitment practices and compensation packages; 
talent management and succession planning; and by seeking to recruit 
and appoint females into senior management positions within the Group. 
In addition, we sought to redress gender stereotypes through educational 
outreach programmes in schools and universities, we continued to sponsor 
the Cheltenham Science Festival and partnered with the Cheltenham 
Science Group, a community interest company that is seeking to inspire 
children to love science, engineering, technology and maths.
As part of an on-going assessment of our employment practices and 
our due diligence processes to ensure that our policies are upheld and 
implemented across our businesses, we initiated a Group-wide HR survey 
and, for the first time, implemented a Global Employee Survey. Following the 
Employee Survey we established employee focus groups to enable more 
detailed feedback on areas identified for improvement and to ensure open 
and honest dialogue between our employees and senior management. 
Next steps for 2018
 − We will apply a Group-wide focus to identify opportunities to increase 
female representation in senior management roles and will define an 
action plan to help us to achieve this
Objective:  To promote diversity and equality through employment 
practices that are free from discrimination and in 
accordance with international human rights principles
Target: 33% of women on our Board, as opportunities arise

Engineering for excellence
Overview
The policies, practices and employee training put in place across the Group 
are developed specifically to provide a foundation for ethical business 
operations and to foster the Core Values of Respect, Accountability, 
Passion, Integrity and Delivery. Our Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) 
Policy, along with our ABC employee training, is a fundamental part of 
our programme to establish guidelines and promote a culture of ethical 
behaviour in our operations across the globe. This training is provided 
in 15 languages in order to ensure that it is effective and to also convey 
the significance of compliance with these standards across the business 
worldwide. We are committed to bringing our Core Values and culture to our 
newly acquired businesses, Gestra and Chromalox, and to ensuring that we 
are a business free from bribery and corruption at all levels.
Performance and actions taken in 2017
We continue to provide a third-party, confidential whistle-blowing helpline, 
Safecall, to allow employees to raise concerns about any wrongdoing in 
the workplace. Safecall received several calls in 2017 , an indication that the 
service is being successfully presented and made available to employees 
across the Group. All reports received by Safecall were thoroughly 
investigated by a relevant management team member and, as appropriate, 
follow-up measures were implemented. The Audit Committee reviewed 
post-action reports to ensure the management response was satisfactory.
With the addition of approximately 450 new employees following the Gestra 
acquisition, the Safecall whistle-blowing helpline was rolled out to the 
Gestra operating companies. Chromalox, with its 1, 150 employees, has 
continued to use Convercent, a similar third-party whistle-blowing hotline 
provider. Both Gestra and Chromalox have procedures in line with Group 
policy to investigate and address any concerns raised through the whistle-
blowing hotlines.
Our online ABC training module was completed by 317 employees in 2017 , 
taking the total number of employees who have completed the training 
since its introduction in 2012 to 4,777 . A further 659 employees completed 
an ABC refresher course during 2017 . Chromalox continued to implement 
its existing ABC training course for its employees, but will adopt the Group’s 
ABC training in 2018. 
Compliance with both the ABC training and the whistle-blowing procedures 
are validated by our internal and external auditing functions.
Next steps for 2018
 − Refresh our ABC training by creating and rolling out a new ABC training 
course to all Group companies
 − Continue to promote the use of the whistle-blowing hotline and online 
Global Gifts and Hospitality register across the Group
Ethical business practices
Overview
Developing the knowledge and skills of our people is central to our 
strategy for growth and for the long-term sustainability of our business. 
All employees are actively encouraged to pursue development 
opportunities. As they enhance their knowledge and skills we are better able 
to deliver value to our customers and provide shareholder value.
We have 53 training centres located worldwide, through which we deliver 
technical training to our employees, and have developed an extensive 
e-learning library. Our sales and service engineers undergo rigorous on-the-

participate in professional development opportunities.
Performance and actions taken in 2017
During 2017 , we continued to strengthen the knowledge and skills of our 
sales and service teams and to develop our pipeline of talent. In 2016 
we established the Spirax Sarco Academy to oversee the learning and 
development of the Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties division. By the end of 
2017 we had translated the training materials and made them available in 16 
languages and rolled out the Academy’s compliance programmes to almost 
1, 100 of our customer facing employees. 
Watson-Marlow also invested in strengthening and expanding its training 
programmes, adding 50 new e-learning units to the company’s online 
training library during 2017 , taking the total number of courses to 70. 
Comprehensive online product training was delivered to support new 
product releases. In addition, four three-day sales conferences were held, 
attended by nearly 400 employees, which focused on product and market 
training to support and strengthen the effectiveness of the company’s direct 
sales teams.
13 senior managers attended a two-week Advanced Management 
Programme, run by the Ashridge Business School, during the year, taking 
the total number who have attended to 85. The programme covers such 
topics as effective people management; driving growth and innovation; 
and delivering results. By investing in the professional development of our 
managers we better equip them to support the long-term success of the 
business. In addition, 31 managers participated in our Advancing High 
Performance leadership programme. 
Next steps for 2018
 − Continue to roll-out the training materials of the Spirax Sarco Academy 
across the customer facing employees of the Steam Specialties division
 − Enhance our leadership development offering to managers and 
senior leaders

Engineering the responsible way
Overview
Improving the sustainability of our end-to-end supply chain, which 
encompasses all the activities that transport and transform materials and 
components into finished products and delivers them to customers, is a key 
strategic objective for the Group. 
We operate a regional manufacturing strategy, with 26 manufacturing sites 
globally. By manufacturing close to the point of sale we improve customer 
service by reducing lead times, ensure that our products meet local 
specifications, reduce transportation requirements for finished products and 
provide local employment in the regions in which we operate.
A central component of our supply chain sustainability programme is our 
Supplier Sustainability Code (Code), which outlines the expectations that we 
have for suppliers, particularly in relation to the fair treatment of employees 
and their environmental impacts, and enables us to embed sustainability 
criteria into our purchasing processes. 
The Code specifies that our suppliers must not use forced, bonded or non-
voluntary labour; should establish recognised employment relationships in 
accordance with national laws, including non-discriminatory employment 
practices, maximum working hours and the freedom of association; and 
exercise clarity in relation to wages.
Suppliers’ facilities must be constructed and maintained to an acceptable 
standard and their activities must be safe for the health of their employees, 
their contractors, the local community and the users of their products. 
Suppliers must have an appropriate H&S policy, H&S operating and 
management systems and seek to prevent work-related injuries and 
illnesses, through effective risk mitigation.
Suppliers must avoid the use of substances dangerous to their employees’ 
health and safety; including, but not limited to, carcinogenic, mutagenic 
and toxic to reproduction substances. All products and services delivered 
by suppliers must meet the quality and safety standards required by 
applicable laws.
We expect our suppliers to operate within the laws of their country, 
conduct business ethically and free from bribery or corruption, and adhere 
to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the 
Core Conventions of the International Labour Organisation. We do not 
countenance the use of child labour. 
Lastly, our suppliers are expected to take steps to mitigate 
their environmental impacts, deliver a high product quality and 
source responsibly.
Performance in 2017
Having exceeded our phase 1 target of 90% of direct material suppliers, by 
spend, to have signed the Code in 2016, our phase 2 target was for 90% 
of sales company direct suppliers, by spend, to have signed our Code by 
the end of 2017 .* 86% of suppliers signed the Code in 2017 taking the total 
number of suppliers who have signed the Code, excluding new businesses, 
to 94%. We will continue to focus on reaching our phase 2 target in the early 
part of 2018. During 2017 , we exited 12 suppliers who were not prepared 
to sign the Code and we are working with the remaining suppliers on a 
continuous improvement basis to further develop their capabilities.
In accordance with our Group policies, no breaches of Human Rights or 
incidents of modern slavery were identified in our supply chain during 2017 .
* Excluding suppliers of businesses acquired in 2016 or 2017 .
Actions taken in 2017
During 2017 , we continued to roll out the Code to all new direct material 
suppliers and extended the scope to include suppliers of our sales 
companies. We also commenced a limited roll out of the Code into recently 
acquired businesses, in those areas deemed to be of greatest risk. 
We enhanced our monitoring of the environmental and sustainability 
performance of suppliers as we formalised a broader set of criteria into 
our supplier audits and began to audit suppliers against these more 
rigorous criteria. This due diligence process enables us to monitor supplier 
performance and conformity with Group policies. 
We have undertaken training of key personnel in supply chain risk 
management and reinforced and standardised our approach to supply 
chain risk management. 
Next steps for 2018
 − Phase 3 roll out of the Code to direct material suppliers of recently 
acquired businesses Hiter, Aflex, Gestra and Chromalox
 − Expand supplier audits incorporating sustainability criteria and enhance 
the training of key audit personnel 
 − Apply audit results in the supplier selection process to preferentially 
select suppliers
 − Continue to mitigate supply chain risks

Sustainability Report continued
Engineering the responsible way/Engineering for our planet
Overview
We apply robust product development processes and incorporate best 
practice in the areas of design-for-manufacture and compliance with safety 
and environmental standards, to ensure that our products are safe for 
our customers to use, are manufactured using ethically sourced materials 
and are environmentally sound. We apply eco-design principles; avoid 
the use of hazardous materials; consider the availability of raw materials; 
and place strong emphasis on in-service performance, product life and 
continuous improvement. 
All products and product developments undergo assessment and validation 
by analysis or physical testing, in line with legislation and national standards 
relevant to the location of sale or release. Structured internal compliance 
processes enable the identification of regulatory requirements and 
compilation of supporting evidence. Where applicable, third-party validation 
testing is employed. Central policies exist to ensure responsibilities for 
product safety and compliance are clear and understood.
Our products are sold with Installation and Maintenance Instructions, 
ensuring that they can be safely installed and maintained.
Performance and actions taken in 2017
During 2017 , we established an auditable process to link supply chain 
sustainability to our eco-design and new product development processes 
within the Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties business and Watson-Marlow 
Ltd. This means that we will only design new products that contain materials 
available from suppliers that have signed the Supplier Sustainability Code, 
preventing us from specifying materials or substances that do not comply 
with eco-design standards or from using suppliers that cannot meet our 
required standards. 
We also completed a best practice review of eco-design practices across 
the Group (excluding the 2017 acquisitions).
Next steps for 2018
 − Complete a best practice review of new product development 
processes in recently acquired businesses Gestra and Chromalox
 − Standardise Group eco-design principles across the new businesses
 − Improve the use of quality and warranty returns data as an indicator of 
the success of our eco-design processes
 − Identify a feedback mechanism that uses production quality metrics to 
assess the manufacturing effectiveness of our eco-design principles
Product responsibility
Overview
We view water as an important resource that requires careful management 
and take steps across our business to use it efficiently. We select specialist 
contractors to manage waste, focusing on technical recycling capabilities 
and safe Duty of Care practices.
Performance and actions taken in 2017
During 2017 , we appointed a third-party adviser to review our water and 
waste data collection processes, prior to seeking external verification of the 
data. The review identified some potential verification challenges for waste 
data from sites outside of Europe. We have decided not to report global 
Group waste data until assurance processes are fully implemented and 
demonstrate improved levels of material confidence.
All of our European sites operate under the EU Waste Framework Directive. 
Therefore, we are confident in the accuracy of their data. During 2017 , our 
European sites (excluding acquisitions) generated 1,81 1 tonnes of waste, of 
which 1,543 tonnes (85%) was recycled and 268 tonnes (15%) was sent to 
landfill. There were no incidents relating to breaches of legislation or harm to 
the environment.
During 2017 , our manufacturing facility and Group headquarters in 
Cheltenham became the first of our businesses to achieve zero waste to 
landfill and, in a drive to minimise waste and highlight the importance of 
waste management, we ran our 2017 Worldwide Leadership Conference 
as a “paperless” event. This was achieved by providing all delegates with 
electronic devices for viewing presentations and conference materials, and 
making notes. By going paperless, we saved over 41,000 sheets of paper.
Our water use varies considerably due to changing demands for steam 
generation during new product development, quality and safety assurance 
testing. During 2017 , our global operations (excluding acquisitions) had a 
total water consumption of 167 ,000m³.
To reduce water consumption, an increasing number of our sites, 
particularly in water stressed regions, are harvesting grey water for 
site irrigation and flushing toilets; this is a design requirement for new 
manufacturing plants.
Throughout the year we completed EHS site audits and “treasure hunts” 
across our Spirax Sarco and Watson-Marlow facilities, to review compliance 
with the Group EHS Policy and to identify opportunities to improve our 
environmental sustainability.
Next steps for 2018
 − Sustain our commitment to waste minimisation and zero waste to 
landfill through the example of our Cheltenham operations
 − Improve waste data quality and reporting from all global operations
 − Raise awareness of water as a key resource and reduce consumption
 − Roll out environmental audits in Gestra and Chromalox

Overview
Anthropogenic climate change is a global challenge that can only be 
addressed through the concerted effort of individuals, businesses and 
governments. In accordance with national and international directives, we 
endeavour to reduce the carbon intensity of our business and minimise our 
carbon footprint. 
We employ an “operational control” definition to outline our carbon footprint 
boundary. Included within that boundary are manufacturing facilities, 
administrative and sales offices where we have authority to implement 
our operating policies. For each of these entities we have measured and 
reported on our relevant Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. (Scope 1 refers 
to direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the Company; 
Scope 2 refers to indirect emissions resulting from the purchase of energy 
generated off site, including electricity.) Excluded from our footprint 
boundary are entities where we do not have operational control. In 2017 
this included Econotherm. Also excluded from the footprint boundary 
are emission sources from operating companies established or acquired 
during 2017 . We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) and emission factors from the UK 
Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2017 to 
calculate our total CO 2e emissions figures.
Performance in 2017
Our CO 2e 2017 emissions data have been audited by TÜV UK Ltd, part of 
TÜV NORD Group, which has provided limited assurance as follows:
“TÜV UK Ltd is acting as the independent verifier of the carbon footprint of 
Spirax Sarco. Based on our checks and reviews, taking into consideration 
a materiality level of 10% and a limited level of assurance we have found 
no evidence suggesting that the calculated greenhouse gas emissions are 
materially misstated and, hence, they are not an unreasonable assertion of 
the greenhouse gas-related data and information. 
Further, no facts became evident, which led us to the assumption that the 
calculation was not carried out in accordance with the applied international 
norm for the quantification, monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions 
(GHG-Protocol).
The emissions for the reporting period 1st January 2017 to 31st December 
2017 (inclusive) are: 17 ,230 tCO 2e for Scope 1 and 14,828 tCO 2e for 
Scope 2.
TÜV UK Ltd, London, February 2018”
The increase in total emissions reflects the expansion of our business, 
including the new operations that were acquired or established during 2016 
or that began trading on 1st January 2017 , whose emissions were included 
for the first time in 2017 , set against emissions reductions made elsewhere 
across the Group as a result of our energy saving activities. Excluding new 
businesses we reduced our emissions by 2%. Despite the total increase, 
we are pleased to report that we made further progress in reducing the 
emissions intensity of our business. During 2017 , our emissions intensity 
reduced by 4%, giving a 20% reduction since 2013, our benchmark year. 
Actions taken in 2017
In addition to the environmental site audits and “treasure hunts” that were 
carried out during the year, the Group Energy and Environment Manager 
conducted several site reviews to assess conformity with Group policy and 
to identify possible opportunities for improvements. 
To facilitate ease of reporting, during 2017 we undertook a review of global 
carbon accounting software, with the intention of procuring our selected 
software in 2018.
Spirax Sarco Ltd (UK), Spirax Sarco China and Watson-Marlow Ltd (UK) 
achieved certification to energy management standard ISO50001, taking 
the total number of our manufacturing sites with the standard to six. 
All remaining Spirax Sarco steam business manufacturing sites are actively 
working towards certification to the standard.
An efficiency review of the Combined Heat and Power plant in Spirax 
Sarco UK led to a 6% increase in productivity, with further improvements, 
including grid export, identified for 2018. Compressed air efficiency was 
significantly improved in Spirax Sarco USA, through investment and 
management techniques, improving energy efficiency. Spirax Sarco France 
also undertook a detailed review of compressed air systems within their 
manufacturing facility. 
Next steps for 2018
 − Implement carbon accounting software
 − Further extend factory lighting conversion to LED technology across the 
Spirax Sarco steam business and Watson-Marlow
 − Implement compressed air system enhancements in Spirax Sarco 
France, USA and UK, utilising waste heat recovery and through 
optimising hardware and controls

Overview
Our direct sales business model is founded on our ability to provide 
solutions to customers that improve their operational sustainability 
through increasing efficiency, reducing energy, water or chemical use, or 
reducing waste.
Reducing energy use and lowering CO 2e emissions are key sustainability 
drivers for our customers who are seeking to lower costs and increase their 
environmental sustainability. We provide products and services that help 
steam users to reduce their energy consumption, increase the efficiency of 
their steam systems and recover and reuse thermal energy. Our electrical 
process heating and temperature management solutions can deliver 
energy savings and efficiencies, and the unique action of our pumps can 
provide significant energy savings over other pump types. For example, 
MasoSine pumps, from Watson-Marlow, are particularly adept at handling 
viscous fluids, which other pumps require large electrical motors to operate. 
Switching to a MasoSine pump for high viscosity pumping applications can 
deliver up to 50% power savings in comparison to lobe or circumferential 
piston pumps.
The products and services of our Steam Specialties division can deliver 
efficiencies in water use, reducing total site consumption. For example, 
by improving the efficiency of condensate return, our products prevent 
condensate from being discharged to the drain, enabling its reuse. We also 
supply solutions to capture and utilise flash steam, which would otherwise 
be lost to atmosphere, and improve the quality of boiler feedwater, 
reducing the frequency of boiler “blow-down”, thus reducing water use. 
The application of Watson-Marlow pumps can also significantly reduce 
water use. Within the mining industry, the installation of a Bredel pump, from 
Watson-Marlow, can reduce water consumption by over 70%, equating 
to savings of 900,000m³ of water per year compared with a common 
centrifugal pump. 
Performance in 2017
We estimate that a select range of energy management products sold 
during 2017 will reduce our end users’ CO 2 emissions by 5.8 million tonnes 
annually. The methodology used to determine this external impact has 
been independently assessed with the assistance of Ricardo Energy & 
Environment. The methodology used was updated during 2017 to include 
an expanded range of Spirax Sarco steam business products (see Actions 
in 2017) and to ensure that the underlying principles are consistent with 
current data on steam system operations as well as taking revised emission 
factors into account. The calculation is based on a selected range of 
energy saving products for which we can quantify savings with reasonable 
accuracy. Many other of our products, such as blow-down heat recovery, 
FREME, Heat Pipe Heat Exchangers, Thermocompressors and Vapour 
Condensers, will also provide CO 2e savings but as these are not easily 
quantifiable they are excluded from our methodology. 
Actions taken in 2017
Following a review of the products included in our customer CO 2 emissions 
saving metric, we identified a small selection of additional steam system 
products for which it is possible to quantify CO 2 savings with sufficient 
accuracy to enable their inclusion in the calculation. Additional products 
included within the metric in 2017 are: Smart Electro-Pneumatic Positioners, 
which have industry-leading low levels of air consumption and reduce 
compressed air usage, having a direct impact on energy consumption and 
CO 2 emissions; BSA Bellows Sealed Stop Valves, which eliminate stem 
seal leakage; and Spirax EasiHeat packages, which generate hot water 
using steam, avoiding the energy losses associated with the storage of hot 
water. The assumptions and methodology used to include these additional 
products were reviewed by Ricardo Energy & Environment, who also 
reviewed the assumptions for all other products included in the calculation 
(Flash Vessels, Steam Traps, Condensate Pumps and Flow Meters) and 
updated the model. 
During the year we undertook two test projects to demonstrate the 
sustainability of the Qdos pump, from Watson-Marlow. In the first, we 
completed a benchmark test comparing the accuracy of the Qdos pump 
against two key competitor pumps, to demonstrate the chemical savings, 
in litres, of the existing installed base of Qdos pumps. The test has been 
completed and a White Paper is in development. In the second test, the 
Qdos pump was monitored in a paper industry application, to demonstrate 
the positive environmental impacts of the pump as expressed in fossil fuel 
energy consumption savings and subsequent reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions. The test has been completed and data is being analysed.
Next steps for 2018
 − Conduct a customer trial to analyse the impact of de-scaling 
management on heat exchanger efficiency
 − Assess the impact of single use systems on energy and water savings 
in the Biotechnology industry
 − Complete a customer trial to examine the energy saving benefits of 
using Qdos pumps in a moulded fibre application
 − Explore the feasibility of using Watson-Marlow technology to pump 
solid butter in a dairy application and assess the energy saving benefits

Engineering sustainable solutions
Case study: Spirax Sarco Australia helps 
customer reduce gas use by 23%
In a drive to increase energy efficiency and reduce gas consumption 
at their meat processing plant in Dubbo, New South Wales, Fletcher 
International Exports identified steam system efficiency improvements 
as an effective way to rapidly reduce gas consumption. Working with 
Fletcher’ s on-site engineering team, Spirax Sarco identified four key 
areas for improvement 1) recover flash steam and reuse it in other 
processes, 2) increase condensate return, 3) increase boiler house 
efficiency and 4) improve steam distribution. The engineered solution 
designed by the project team had significant benefits, which were 
measured and verified by independent, third-party engineers.
As a result of the installed solution, gas consumption reduced by 
23%, saving an estimated 27,000 gigajoules of gas per year, equating 
to monthly savings of approximately AUS$45,000 (over £26,500), or 
AUS$540,000 (£319,000) per year. In addition to energy savings, boiler 
water consumption is expected to reduce by eight million litres a year 
and chemical use has also been reduced, saving a further AUS$10,000-
15,000 (£6,000-£9,000) a year. Including installation, the project is 
expected to have a payback period of 12 months or less.

Overview
As a global business, we can be a force for good in our local communities 
around the world. We seek to have a positive impact in the communities 
in which we operate by making charitable donations to worthwhile causes 
and contributing time, resources and expertise where there is a local need. 
Our Group Charitable Donations Policy guides our community engagement 
activities. Our primary focus is education (particularly in the sciences and 
engineering), but we seek to identify and respond to local needs and will 
also offer support for the underprivileged young, disadvantaged, disabled 
and elderly, and contribute to natural disaster relief. 
Performance in 2017
During 2017 , we again increased funding to the Spirax Sarco Group 
Charitable Trust, which made 56 donations ranging in size from £150 to 
£20,000 with a total value of £231, 150 (2016: £180, 150). For example, 
we donated £20,000 to the National Star College in Cheltenham, which 
provides specialist further education and training to young people aged 16 
to 25 with complex physical, educational and emotional needs, taking total 
donations from the Trust to the College to £159,000 in the last 10 years. 
We also donated £20,000 each to the American Red Cross’ Hurricane 
Irma and Hurricane Harvey relief funds. A further £150,000 was donated to 
charitable causes by our operating companies during 2017 (2016: £87 ,000). 
In addition to financial donations, our operating companies donated the 
equivalent of £33,000 in in-kind donations such as products and office 
equipment, incurred management costs and contributed over 1,900 hours 
of working time to community engagement activities. Using an average 
hourly salary to estimate the cost to the company of employee volunteering, 
we estimate that the total value of our operating companies’ community 
engagement activities in 2017 was in excess of £230,000. In addition, our 
employees donated £96,000 of their own money and 344 hours of their 
own time in workplace organised fundraising and community engagement 
activities. We also achieved our 2017 target of establishing community 
engagement champions across the Group.
Actions taken in 2017
During 2017 , each of our operating companies appointed a community 
engagement champion, either individually or in conjunction with another 
Group company. This network of community engagement champions 
are responsible for identifying opportunities for participation in community 
engagement activities, organising activities, sharing success stories and 
data collection. While integrating into the Group, Gestra and Chromalox 
have each appointed a central community engagement champion. 
Once fully integrated, these companies will expand their network 
of champions.

Engineering better futures
Spirax Sarco New Zealand
Designed and donated a bespoke, modular Heat Exchange system to 
the Engineering facility of the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. 
The purpose of the donation is to enable hands-on training for young 
engineers, allowing students to manipulate process conditions in a 
safe and controlled fashion. The donation promotes steam engineering 
knowledge, helping to meet a skills gap, and raises awareness of Spirax 
Sarco amongst young engineers.
Spirax Sarco China
In ZunYi (a city in the poorest province of China) many talented students 
drop out of school because their families cannot afford the daily living 
costs needed to keep them in education. Working with a local charitable 
organisation, in 2017 Spirax Sarco China donated RMB 1,000 each to 
50 Grade 1 1 students and RMB 2,000 each to 35 Grade 10 students, to 
help with their living costs. Students were selected based on academic 
performance and family circumstances (poverty). The students will be 
supported through the full three years of high school. A team of eight 
volunteers from Spirax Sarco also delivered a 1.5 hour class each week, 
for 12 weeks, to 55 pupils at a local school for the children of low income 
migrant workers.
Spirax Sarco Argentina
Formed a cross-functional Community Engagement Committee and 
developed a community engagement roadmap. Throughout the year, 
a wide range of activities were undertaken such as the donation of 
products, furniture and hardware that are no longer in use to schools, 
universities and technical colleges; interview training for young people; 
lectures to university and college students; the donation of waste paper 
to raise money for a children’s hospital; and sponsorship of a charity for 
children with cancer.
Spirax Sarco Brazil
In partnership with Hiter, acquired in 2016, Spirax Sarco provided five 
hours of training to 27 students (14-19 years old) to help them prepare for 
finding their first job. In another activity, Spirax Sarco, Hiter and Watson-
Marlow joined several other local companies to revitalise a poorly funded 
local school. The companies donated the paint and the volunteers each 
gave a day’s labour. 
Group Charitable Trust donations £’000
Objective:  To engage positively with the communities in which we 
operate and to offer financial support to approved charities
Target:  All Group manufacturing companies to participate in at least 
one community engagement activity in 2018
Community engagement
The community engagement data collection framework, which was 
established and rolled out at the end of 2016, was utilised in 2017 , enabling 
more detailed performance data to be reported this year. 
During the year we launched the Group’s first “Community Engagement 
Awards”, with all Group companies having the opportunity to enter. 
Twelve outstanding entries were received from across the business, 
including entries from Gestra, Watson-Marlow and Spirax Sarco. 
Congratulations to the winners: Spirax Sarco New Zealand (small company), 
Spirax Sarco China (large company, joint winner) and Spirax Sarco 
Argentina (large company, joint winner), which were selected by the Group 
Sustainability Committee and approved by the Group Chief Executive. 
The winning companies each received £5,000 to be spent on community 
engagement activities locally. The Sustainability Committee also awarded a 
Highly Commended prize to Spirax Sarco Brazil; £1,000 to be spent on the 
company’s community engagement activities.
Next steps for 2018
 − Strengthen the community engagement data collection process
 − Promote employee volunteering across the Group

Chairman’s introduction
Business ethics are our foundation
“ Managing risk and robust governance structures 
enable our shareholders to be confident that the 
Group is well positioned for the future.”
Bill Whiteley
Chairman
Key points in this section:
 › Board changes
 › Gender and diversity
 › Preparation for Brexit
 › Enhancing our risk 
management and 
compliance programmes
and, over this time, to see it make significant 
progress. The Group has my best wishes for 
the future. 
As a Board it is our responsibility to provide 
strategic oversight of management’ s 
direction of travel for the Group, in order to 
encourage improvement whilst providing 
stability and steady growth for shareholders 
and stakeholders. The Board is fully 
committed to ethical business practices and 
to ensuring the business operates to the 
highest standards of corporate governance.
In this section of the Annual Report we set 
out our approach to governance, using 
the five main principles of the Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (Code), and explain 
how the Board and its Committees are 
structured and their areas of focus during 
the year.
Regulatory disclosures required under the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules 7.2.6 
can be found on pages 109 to 111.
You will find the Remuneration Report on 
pages 85 to 108. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration 2017 sets out the details of 
Executive compensation throughout 2017, 
which will be subject to the normal advisory 
vote at the AGM in May 2018.
Brexit
The EU 27 and the UK have given broad 
indications of how they plan to approach 
the Brexit negotiations, via the publication of 
three documents: the UK’ s Article 50 notice, 
a draft of the European Parliament’ s motion 
for a resolution on the negotiations and a 
draft of the European Council’ s negotiation 
guidelines. Whilst it is still far from clear what 
the final destination will be, the direction of 
travel is becoming clearer as the negotiations 
progress. Transitional arrangements for a 
limited duration not exceeding two years are 
also likely.
As a global organisation, with over 90% of 
our revenues and profits generated outside 
of the UK, we are well positioned for a UK 
exit from the EU. Our Brexit plan has 11 
areas of focus, ranging from UK and EU 
customer targeting to a review of IT systems 
and acquisition opportunities. We have 
navigated periods of political and economic 
uncertainty in the past and have a long and 
successful history of growth. We are well 
prepared for significant work in the period 
late 2018 to early 2019 as actual Brexit and 
post-Brexit trading relationships crystalise.
Key actions during the year
During 2017, we paid particular attention 
to succession planning for the Board, as 
part of our on-going response to the key 
recommendations from the last external 
Board effectiveness review conducted 
by Dr Tracy Long CBE (the findings 
of the review are set out on page 73). 
The appointment of Jamie Pike as the 
new Chairman, Clive Watson as the Senior 
Independent Director and Peter France as a 
Non-Executive Director were all part of the 
implementation of our long-term succession 
plan to ensure key Board positions 
transition smoothly. 
As a Group we are committed to gender 
diversity and to achieving a minimum 
target of 33% female representation 
on the Board, the Group Executive 
and their direct reports. We ensure that 
this target is taken into account in our 
succession planning and recruitment. 
Our Group Diversity and Inclusion Policy 
has been published on the Group’ s website, 
Sustainable governance
Subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 15th May 
2018, I am pleased that Jamie Pike will 
take over as Chairman following my 
retirement at the AGM and Clive Watson will 
become our Senior Independent Director 
in addition to continuing as Chairman of 
the Audit Committee. Peter France was 
appointed in March 2018 as an independent 
Non-Executive Director. Peter’ s proven 
track record of delivering results and his 
appointment reflects the Company’ s 
commitment to bringing broader sector 
experience to the Board. 
It has been a pleasure to serve the 
shareholders and the Company for 16 years 
Our approach to governance
Governance helps us to:
 − Ensure our shareholders receive a 
good return on their investment
 − Behave with integrity
 − Treat our customers, employees, 
suppliers and local 
communities properly
 − Respect the environment Governance Report
 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 65
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, under 
the Governance section. Further information 
is set out on page 76 in the Nomination 
Committee Report.
We reviewed the tenure of the 
Non-Executive Directors in order to 
ensure independence.
Another key activity this year was the internal 
Board effectiveness review. I am pleased 
that this anonymised, internal evaluation of 
the Board and our Committees supported 
the independent evaluation carried out 
during 2015 and the internal evaluation in 
2016; confirming that the Board is collegiate, 
transparent and effective. A summary of 
the findings and recommendations are 
set out on pages 72 to 73 of this Report. 
The next external review is set for 2018, in 
accordance with the Code.
The Risk Management Committee carried 
out a thorough review of all the risks on 
the risk register, which encompasses all 
Group businesses, including Gestra and 
Chromalox, which were recently acquired. 
Following “bottom-up” reports from our 
Group companies, cybersecurity, loss of 
indirect channels to market and loss of 
critical suppliers were introduced onto 
the register. Finally, the Risk Management 
Committee focused on crisis management 
to ensure that the Group can respond 
properly to a catastrophic event such 
as a terror attack, cyberattack or global 
pandemic that causes loss of life and/or life-
changing injuries, threatens to de-stabilise 
the Company or significantly damage the 
Company’ s reputation. Further details are 
contained in the Strategic Risk and Risk 
Management Report beginning on page 
30 and the Risk Management Committee 
Report starting on page 81.
During 2017, the Remuneration Committee 
focused on rewarding strong business 
performance. Our Remuneration Policy 2017 
is unchanged. In addition to Jane Kingston’ s 
summary of key activities in her Statement 
on page 87, full details can be found in the 
Remuneration Report beginning on page 88.
The Board is updated on a regular basis on 
progress with our General Data Protection 
Regulation project. Ernst & Young LLP 
has been appointed as consultant. 
A gap analysis was recently conducted by 
Ernst & Young LLP and a remediation plan 
will follow, to be rolled out to all affected 
Group companies.
Perhaps the most engaging activity for the 
Board in 2017 was our close involvement 
in approving the acquisitions of Gestra 
and Chromalox, which have both started 
well and are already making a healthy 
contribution to the Group.
We continue to make good progress as a 
Group and are outperforming our markets, 
as detailed in the Strategic Report beginning 
on page 1.
Core values
The Board takes seriously its responsibilities 
for promoting the Group’ s Core Values 
and, in particular, for ensuring that all 
employees and everyone associated with 
the Group are aware of their responsibility 
to act lawfully and conduct themselves in 
accordance with high standards of business 
integrity. These values are embedded in our 
Group Management Code and driven by 
tone-from-the-top. The Audit Committee 
supervised the revision and updating of the 
Group Management Code, which sets out 
our adherence to ethical business behaviour 
and is found on the Group’ s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, under the 
Governance section.
A strong anti-bribery and corruption culture 
is central to the Group’ s values and all 
employees are required to undertake 
anti-bribery training. A biennial refresher 
examination programme ensures that we 
maintain this position. Our anti-bribery 
training is extended to all new businesses 
that join the Group: Gestra employees are on 
track to complete the training shortly. We are 
introducing a new anti-bribery programme 
in the first half of 2018 and the employees at 
Chromalox will be the first participants.
Turning to sustainability, in 2017 we focused 
on the implementation of our five year 
plans and the Sustainability Committee 
concentrated on raising awareness of our 
strategy throughout our new enlarged 
Group. Our progress and achievements can 
be found on pages 52 to 61.
As a Group the primary focus of our 
community engagement activities is 
education, particularly in the sciences and 
engineering, because we recognise the 
transformative impact that education can 
have on the lives of individuals and the 
well-being of communities.
I am pleased to report that good corporate 
governance is integrated into our culture at 
Spirax Sarco. I look forward to welcoming 
you at our AGM on T uesday , 15th May 2018.
ICSA award
In November 2017 we were delighted to 
win the ICSA award for Annual Report 
of the Year (FTSE 250) for our 2016 
Annual Report and to be nominated 
for an award in the category of “Best 
Board Disclosure”.
Compliance statement
Our Governance Report over the 
following pages explains how the Group 
has applied the principles and complied 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (Code).
We are fully compliant with the 
requirements of the Code, as set 
out in detail on the Group’ s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com,  
under the Governance section.
Fair, balanced 
and understandable
In accordance with the Code, the 
Directors confirm that they consider the 
Annual Report, taken as a whole, to 
be fair, balanced and understandable 
and that it provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’ s performance, business 
model and strategy.

Leadership
The Board
The Board
The Board relies on executive management 
to run the business and monitor 
management activities, and holds them 
accountable against targets and standards. 
The Board also approves long-term 
corporate and strategic plans after a full 
review and assessment of market and 
technology trends, business drivers and 
risks. Having a senior management team 
that is capable of executing the strategic 
plans is a key focus for the Board.
The formal schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board’ s decision is 
available on the Group’ s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, under 
the Governance section. In addition, during 
2017 the Board approved and issued a 
revised Authority Limits Policy that sets out 
clearly the primary responsibilities, controls 
and authorisation limits on matters affecting 
the Group’ s business.
The Non-Executive Directors provide 
independent challenge and review, bringing 
wide experience, specific expertise and a 
fresh objective perspective.
The Board meets as often as is necessary to 
discharge its duties. In 2017 the Board met 
seven times. All Directors are expected to 
attend all Board meetings and
relevant Committee meetings unless 
prevented by prior commitments, illness 
or a conflict of interest. Directors unable 
to attend specific Board or Committee 
meetings are sent the relevant papers and 
asked to provide comments in advance of 
the meeting to the Chairman of the Board 
or Committee. In addition, all Board and 
Committee members receive the minutes of 
meetings as a matter of course.
The Directors’ attendance record at 
Board meetings is set out on page 70. 
The Non-Executive Directors meet without 
the Executive Directors present to discuss 
the Executive Directors’ performance and 
other matters.
The Senior Independent Director is available 
to discuss concerns with shareholders, 
in addition to the normal channels of the 
Chairman, Group Chief Executive or the 
Group Finance Director.
The Board has a Conflicts of Interest Policy 
and has put in place procedures for the 
disclosure and review of any potential or 
actual conflicts.
Committee composition
The Non-Executive Directors play an 
important governance role in the detailed 
work they carry out on our Committees on 
behalf of the Board. All the Non-Executive 
Directors are determined by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement, in 
compliance with the Code. The Chairman 
was independent on appointment.
The General Counsel and Company 
Secretary supports the Committee Chairmen 
in making sure members are equipped for 
informed decision-making and that they 
appropriately allocate their time to subjects.
The Board has satisfied itself that at least 
one member of the Audit Committee, 
namely Clive Watson, has recent and 
relevant financial experience and is 
confident that the collective experience 
of its members enables it to be effective. 
The Audit Committee also has access to 
the financial expertise of the Group, the 
external and internal auditors and can seek 
further professional advice at the Company’ s 
expense, if required. There is also one 
Non-Executive Director, Jane Kingston, with 
relevant sector experience across a range 
of different industries, including a strong 
services background, to add additional 
support to the implementation of the Group’ s 
strategy for growth.

time during 2017. The Board agendas 
are carefully planned to ensure focus on 
the Group’ s strategic priorities and key 
monitoring activities, as well as reviews of 
significant issues. During 2017, the Board 
devoted 20% of its time to the Spirax Sarco 
steam and Watson-Marlow Fluid T echnology 
Group (WMFTG) strategies, the Group 
2020 plan and reviewing implementation 
progress of the Group corporate strategy. 
The acquisitions of Gestra and Chromalox 
rightly demanded considerable focus 
both in terms of ensuring the transaction 
was well managed and that post-closing 
implementation plans were robust.
Health & Safety is of fundamental 
importance to the business and is 
considered at each Board meeting. It is also 
considered in detail at each Group Executive 
Committee meeting.
In June 2017, the Board’ s annual strategy 
meeting was held at the Group’ s steam 
manufacturing and sales office in Argentina, 
where we undertook a review of our 
Spirax Sarco and WMFTG businesses in 
the Americas.
During 2017 , the Board regularly reviewed 
the Group’ s performance and satisfied itself 
that management was on track in delivering 
the strategic business plan. The Board also 
concentrated its attention on formulating a 
proactive Brexit strategy, looking at both the 
challenges and opportunities for the Group 
posed by a UK exit from the EU. The Board 
continued to engage with shareholders 
on governance, remuneration and trading 
during the period.

Board evaluation
Board evaluation
During 2017, the Board carried out an 
internal evaluation of the performance of 
the Board and the Board Committees, 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
Code. The General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, on behalf of the Chairman, 
circulated a comprehensive questionnaire 
to members of the Board covering all issues 
related to the effective running of the Board 
and the functioning of the Committees. 
The responses were consolidated and 
anonymised and common themes identified 
in order for the Board to determine key 
actions and next steps for improving 
Board and Committee effectiveness 
and performance.
The internal effectiveness review supported 
the overall conclusion of the 2015 external 
evaluation that the Board is collegiate, 
transparent and effective. In particular, it was 
noted that the Board is well-balanced across 
skill sets and backgrounds and has a good 
dynamic, with open discussion and the 
ability to table challenging points of view.
The main recommendations, following the 
review, are:
 − Board review of long-term risks linked to 
the Strategic Plan;
 − Non-Executive Director knowledge update 
via the Deloitte Academy; and
 − succession planning - continue with 
current plans and focus.
In accordance with the Code an annual 
review of the effectiveness of the Board is 
undertaken with input from an independent 
external adviser every three years. 
The process used for the external evaluation 
is set out below.

Training and development
Training and development
The Board is regularly notified of changes to 
relevant laws and regulations, with a report 
at each Board meeting from the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary.
All the Directors are members of the 
Deloitte Academy, giving them access to 
a comprehensive programme of training 
and technical support on a wide range of 
corporate governance matters to enable 
the Directors to update their knowledge 
and keep them informed of their duties. 
Non-Executive Directors are invited to 
attend Group conferences, which provide 
information on business strategy, new 
product development and sales and 
marketing initiatives. Business presentations 
are given at Board meetings to ensure the 
Directors are kept informed of new product 
development, regional operations, business 
strategies and employee development.
The Board visits Group operating companies 
where possible and other relevant industry 
events (such as major trade exhibitions). 
In June, the Board visited Spirax Sarco 
Argentina with presentations covering 
the Americas from members of the 
management team.
In addition, Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
attended a Board meeting to give an investor 
perspective of the Group.
Board induction
On joining the Board, all new Directors 
receive a tailored and comprehensive 
induction programme, comprising a 
combination of briefings and meetings 
with the Directors, General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, corporate advisers and 
senior management. This covers Directors’ 
duties and the UK listing regime, an overview 
of the business, its operations, risks and 
regulatory matters, governance, finance and 
investor relations.
In the case of an Executive Director, this 
will include visits to our principal operating 
companies in the Group in order to 
understand the international nature of our 
business and, where appropriate, meetings 
with key shareholders and analysts. It is 
essential that our Directors have a solid 
grasp of our products and services and, in 
addition to product technical information and 
marketing brochures, inductees are given 
an in-depth tour of our manufacturing and 
R&D site in Cheltenham and are encouraged 
to take engineering courses at our UK 
Steam T echnology Centre located at our 
Headquarters. Directors also visit WMFTG 
in Falmouth to gain an understanding of the 
fluid technology business.
Reflections on my first year
Jane Kingston
It has been a great pleasure to work with the Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 
Board and other colleagues during the past year. I have been impressed 
by the strong governance, transparency and team working culture that is 
clearly present across the Group.
As a new Board member, I have had interactions with many parts of 
the business at Board meetings. I have also had the opportunity to visit 
a number of Group companies, from Watson-Marlow’ s operations in 
Falmouth, UK, to Spirax Sarco Argentina, and visited customers with field 
based colleagues (engineers). All this has enabled me to observe first-
hand the implementation of the Group’ s strategic priorities. After each 
visit or meeting I come away reflecting on how deeply passionate all of 
my colleagues are about the business and how focused they are on our 
customers. Indeed, I am indebted to colleagues for their support and 
engagement in my first year.
This year, as a Board, we have focused extensively on both organic growth 
opportunities and also the significant acquisitions of Gestra and Chromalox. 
As a member of the Nomination Committee I am pleased with the 
thoughtful and thorough succession planning we are undertaking to ensure 
long-term business continuity both for the Board and senior management.
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I have been impressed 
by the importance that Spirax Sarco attaches to its relationship with its 
shareholders and the quality of the engagement process. 
Finally, I would like to extend a thank you to Bill Whiteley and all my fellow 
Directors who have made me extremely welcome in my first year and 
encouraged me to bring my experience to bear and to learn from their 
experience in equal measure.

Review of 2017
At the 2018 AGM, Bill Whiteley will retire, 
Jamie Pike will be appointed as Chairman 
and Clive Watson will be appointed as Senior 
Independent Director . 
Jamie Pike’ s appointment follows a rigorous 
and independent selection process 
conducted in accordance with the Code. 
The process was led by a Nomination 
Sub-Committee made up entirely of 
independent Non-Executive Directors 
and chaired by Clive Watson, the most 
senior independent Non-Executive Director 
who was not conflicted. The current 
Chairman, Bill Whiteley , and Jamie Pike, 
as a candidate, were excluded from the 
process in accordance with Code provision 
B.2.1. The Sub-Committee developed a job 
specification and appointed Korn Ferry as an 
independent search and recruitment agency . 
Korn Ferry assisted the Sub-Committee with 
the evaluation of Jamie Pike against the job 
specification and determined that he was 
well qualified to perform the role. Jamie’ s 
appointment was approved by the full Board 
following interviews with all Directors. 
Jamie will step down as Chairman and 
Director of Ibstock plc on 24th May 
2018. He will continue as Chairman of 
RPC Group plc. This will bring his total FTSE 
Board chairmanships to two and, therefore, 
the Board is satisfied that Jamie will have 
the time and capacity to fulfil his duties 
as Chairman of the Company . T wo FTSE 
chairmanships is also compliant with the 2017 
proxy adviser voting guidelines including those 
issued by Institutional Shareholder Services 
and Glass Lewis. Jamie will, on appointment 
as Chairman, resign from the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees, in compliance 
with the Code. He will chair the Board and the 
Nomination Committee.
Peter France was appointed as an 
independent Non-Executive Director 
with effect from March 2018, and 
has joined the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees.
The Board changes set out above are the 
implementation of our succession plan to 
ensure that appointments for Board roles 
are phased with the benefit of adequate 
handover periods, ensuring a smooth 
transition. They follow the recommendations 
on succession planning made by Dr Long of 
Boardroom Review Ltd in 2015. The most 
recent review of succession planning by 
the full Board and the executive and senior 
management team was undertaken as part 
of the strategic review meeting held in June 
2017. In respect of all positions Korn Ferry 
was instructed to advise on the suitability 
of candidates against a job description 
approved by the Sub-Committee/Committee. 
Korn Ferry provides no other services to 
the Group.
A review of the tenure of the Non-Executive 
Directors was undertaken as part of the 
succession planning and we shall ensure that, 
at all times, the number of independent Non-
Executive Directors is the same or more than 
the number of Executive Directors so that we 
remain compliant with the Code.
The appointment of Peter France is part of 
the succession planning being undertaken to 
recruit Directors with the skills and experience 
to support the implementation of the Group’ s 
strategy for growth. Peter brings with him a 
broad range of relevant sector experience, 
particularly his extensive services experience 
from his time at Rotork plc.
We cultivate a culture of achievement 
and career progression. High-potential 
individuals are supported in their professional 
development through our Leadership 
Academy , in conjunction with Ashridge 
Business School, and our “Advancing 
High Performance” programme for senior 
managers. We also encourage leadership 
development through robust succession 
planning and an individualised performance 
management culture.
During 2017, we formalised our commitment 
to the promotion of diversity as we 
established a Group Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy . The Group recognises the importance 
of diversity at all levels of the Company as well 
as on the Board.
We believe that the Board’ s perspective and 
approach is greatly enhanced by gender , age 
and cultural diversity and it is our policy to 
consider overall Board balance and diversity 
when appointing new Directors. As shown 
on page 62, the range of nationalities and 
experience of our Board is particularly 
relevant given the broad international reach 
of the Group and we will seek to increase 
the diversity of our international footprint with 
future appointments to the Board. 
Normalised for succession changes, we 
currently exceed 20% gender diversity on the 
Board and we are committed to a target of a 
minimum of 33% women on our Board, the 
Group Executive and their reports. We ensure 
that this target is taken into account in our 
succession planning and recruitment. 
We support the promotion of women to 
senior positions throughout the Group and, 
during the last 12 months, women were 
appointed as: Financial Controller , EMEA 
Business Partner , Recruitment Manager , 
Senior Human Resources Business Partner , 
Group Human Resources Projects Manager , 
Head of Human Resources (Watson-Marlow 
UK), Head of Human Resources (Asia Pacific), 
Head of Human Resources (Americas), Group 
T alent Partner (Spirax Sarco, Inc., USA), 
General Manager Asia Pacific (Gestra) and 
Global Director Environmental, Health and 
Safety (Chromalox, USA), with a number of 
these being internal promotions.
We continue to offer practical support for 
the Department for Business Innovation 
and Skills’ “Women on Boards – FTSE 
250” initiative by encouraging two women 
from our senior management team to 
serve as Non-Executive Directors on other 
company Boards.
We participated in the FTSE Women Leaders 
(Hamilton-Alexander) Review in June 2017.

Review of 2017
The Committee met three times in 2017. 
Kevin Boyd, Group Finance Director, 
John Senior, Group Financial Controller, 
and the external auditor attended the 
meetings and had direct access to the 
Committee Chairman. The Group Chief 
Executive attended one Audit Committee 
meeting (March), in accordance with the 
recommendations made during the 2015 
external Board evaluation (which were 
implemented during 2016).
During the year the Committee received 
reports from external and internal auditors 
on the major findings of their work and the 
progress of management follow-up by way 
of management reports.
As a safeguard, the Committee holds 
separate meetings with the external and 
internal auditors without management 
present to discuss their respective areas and 
any issues arising from their audits.
The Committee received assurance on 
going concern, viability, pension valuation, 
material litigation and risk management. 
The Committee considered this assurance 
and concluded it was reliable.
This year the Committee approved 
the Group T ax Policy and T ax Strategy 
(which had been amended to reference 
the Group’ s new policy on prevention 
of criminal facilitation of tax evasion). 
This is available on the Group’ s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, in 
compliance with the Finance Act 2016.
The Group has complied with the 
provisions of the Competition and Market 
Authority (CMA) Order, issued by the CMA 
in September 2014, for “The Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive T ender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities)”. 
Auditor
This is the fourth financial year in which the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 
have been audited by Deloitte LLP following 
their appointment as the Company’ s 
external auditor as of 20th May 2014. 
This appointment is subject to on-going 
monitoring and will run for a maximum of 10 
years before being tendered.
One of the primary responsibilities of the 
Committee is to assess the robustness 
of the external audit process and make 
recommendations to the Board in relation to 
the appointment, re-appointment or removal 
of the external auditor. The Committee took 
a number of factors into account when 
evaluating the effectiveness of the external 
audit including:
 − the quality and scope of the planning of 
the audit (in October 2017, Deloitte LLP 
presented their plan for the 2017 audit to 
the Committee); and
 − feedback from all audited operating 
units, the Group Finance team, senior 
management and Directors on the audit 
process and the quality and experience of 
the audit partners engaged in the audit.
During the year, the Committee reviewed 
and approved the proposed audit fees and 
terms of engagement for the 2017 audit 
and recommended to the Board that it 
proposes to shareholders that Deloitte LLP 
be re-appointed as the Group’ s external 
auditor for 2018 at the AGM to be held on 
15th May 2018.
The Committee recognises that the 
independence of the external auditor is 
an essential part of the audit framework 
and has adopted a policy which sets out 
a framework for determining whether it is 
appropriate to engage the Group’ s auditor 
for non-audit services. This policy states that 
any expenditure with the Group’ s auditor on 
non-audit fees should not exceed 70% of 
the average audit fees charged in the last 
three-year period. During the year, the Group 
spent £0.3 million on non-audit services 
provided by Deloitte LLP (being 25% of the 
average of Group audit fees charged over 
the past three years). Further details can be 
found in Note 7 on page 135.
Internal audit
The Committee reviewed the schedule of 
planned internal audits undertaken in 2017 
and assessed the robustness of the control 
framework that is in place to track and 
monitor progress in remedying any identified 
deficiencies. This review ensures that the 
Committee is able to give assurances that 
the Group has an effective and integrated 
risk management framework, in addition 
to the oversight provided by the Risk 
Management Committee. The internal audit 
process is explained on page 83. In 2016 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was 
commissioned to undertake a review of 
the internal audit function. This review 
validated the Committee’ s view of the 
strengths and weaknesses of the current 
approach and suggested other potential 
development areas in light of best practice. 
The PwC report concluded that peer review 
works well and should continue, but also 
made a number of recommendations for 
improvement. A key recommendation 
was the creation of a new role of Head 
of Internal Audit to oversee the internal 
audit processes and procedures and be 
responsible for implementing the other PwC 
recommendations. This recommendation 
was adopted by the Committee and the new 
Head of Internal Audit joined the Group in 
November 2017. Governance Report
 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 79
Significant issues in relation to 
the Financial Statements
During the year the Committee considered 
significant issues in relation to the Group’ s 
Financial Statements and disclosures 
relating to:
(i) Revenue recognition
In view of the profile of revenue and profit 
recognition in the final quarter of the year, 
the need to focus on any new contracts 
and revenue cut-off for certain businesses 
was highlighted to ensure the appropriate 
recognition of revenue for the year ended 
31st December 2017. The Committee 
received regular updates on the assessment 
of the impact of IFRS 15 (Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers) during the year.
(ii) Pensions
There are judgements and estimates made 
in selecting appropriate assumptions in 
valuing the Group’ s defined benefit pension 
obligations, including discount ratios, 
mortality, inflation and salary increases. 
The Committee considered reports by the 
Company, including those from independent 
external advisers, and is comfortable that the 
key assumptions are reasonable.
(iii) Acquisitions
Acquisition accounting, in particular in 
respect of the Gestra and Chromalox 
acquisitions, was also considered. 
After reviewing the presentations and reports 
from management and consulting with the 
auditor, the Committee is satisfied that the 
Financial Statements appropriately address 
the amounts reported and the disclosures. 
The Committee is also satisfied that the 
significant assumptions used for determining 
the value of assets and liabilities have been 
appropriately scrutinised, challenged and are 
sufficiently robust.
(iv) Ensuring the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable
The Committee carried out a full assessment 
and review to ensure the standard 
was satisfied.
(v) Other judgements in the Financial 
Statements
Viability and going concern have been 
assessed successfully.
Review of the 
Financial Statements
During 2017, the Committee considered 
many components of business performance 
in order to ensure it has a full understanding 
of the operations of the Group. Key matters 
considered by the Committee include:
 − determining the position adopted 
in judgement and estimate areas 
for pensions;
 − risk areas set out in the Risk Management 
Committee Report;
 − receipt of regular strategy reports from the 
Group Chief Executive and operational 
reports from the Divisional Directors;
 − requesting members of management 
to attend Committee meetings to 
provide updates on operational and 
strategic matters;
 − reviews of the budget and operational 
plan; and
 − consideration of judgements 
and estimates.
Through these processes and its monitoring 
of the effectiveness of controls, internal 
audit and risk management, the Committee 
is able to maintain a good understanding 
of business performance, key areas of 
judgement and decision-making processes 
within the Group.
Fair, balanced 
and understandable
One of the key governance requirements 
of the Committee is for the Annual Report 
to be fair, balanced and understandable. 
The co-ordination and review of the 
Group-wide input into the Annual Report is 
a significant exercise performed within an 
exacting time frame, which runs alongside 
the formal audit process undertaken by the 
external auditor.
T o ensure the Annual Report is fair, balanced 
and understandable, the Committee 
assessed the consistency of the risks and 
judgements, reviewed the Board minutes 
to ensure issues of significance were given 
prominence and arrived at a position where 
initially the Committee, and then the Board, 
were satisfied with the overall fairness, 
balance and clarity of the document, which 
is underpinned by the following:
 − comprehensive guidance for contributors 
at operational level;
 − a verification process dealing with the 
factual content of the reports;
 − a consideration of the appropriateness of 
alternative performance measures;
 − comprehensive reviews undertaken at 
different levels in the Group that aim to 
ensure consistency and overall balance; 
and
 − comprehensive review by the senior 
management team.
Whistle-blowing
The Group is committed to promoting a 
safe and effective culture for employees 
to raise genuine concerns without fear of 
reprisals. T o this end, and as a matter of 
best practice, in 2014 the Group adopted 
a Whistle-blowing Policy. Linked to this 
was the implementation of a multi-lingual 
whistle-blowing helpline, facilitated by 
Safecall, to ensure that employees can 
freely access an independent third party. 
The whistle-blowing helpline continues to be 
made available throughout the Group and 
in 2017 multiple calls were received from 
individuals across the globe. Management’ s 
response and handling of reported cases 
continues to be considered appropriate and 
satisfactory by the Committee.
Finance team appointments
The Committee noted that, during the 
year, the Group had appointed a new T ax 
Manager and new Head of Internal Audit. 
The Committee sees these appointments 
as positive steps to further strengthen the 
Finance team and the control environment of 
the Group.
GDPR preparedness
On 25th May 2018, the GDPR will come 
into effect. The GDPR is an EU Regulation 
that has direct legal effect in all European 
countries without the need for the UK to 
pass implementing legislation. The GDPR 
will apply to all of the Group’ s companies 
that operate in, or sell into, Europe. 
GDPR represents a major development 
in data protection and privacy laws, 
with greatly increased penalties for 
non-compliance. Accordingly, it will be a risk 
that the Committee will continue to review 
throughout 2018. T o date, a gap analysis 
has been carried out by Ernst & Young LLP , 
all remedial actions have been identified and 
a schedule to ensure compliance has been 
prepared. In addition, a new Group-wide 
GDPR policy has been prepared and will be 
implemented across the Group.
Preventing the criminal 
facilitation of tax evasion
In 2017, the Criminal Finances Act 
introduced two new strict liability offences of 
corporate failure to prevent the facilitation of 
tax evasion. The Group’ s culture has always 
been one where the facilitation of tax evasion 
is never acceptable. 
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Corporate Information Governance Report
80 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017
We, therefore, welcomed the new corporate 
offences and formalised our stance on 
this topic through the publication of a new 
Group-wide policy (“Preventing the Criminal 
Facilitation of T ax Evasion”). The policy sets 
out the Group’ s position on this matter and 
details the steps each Group company is 
to take to ensure that it does not facilitate, 
and is not at risk of facilitating, tax evasion 
by any associated persons. The Committee 
notes that a requirement of the new policy 
is for each Group company to complete a 
risk assessment questionnaire which will 
be reviewed by the Group Finance team on 
completion and during internal audit.
Cybersecurity 
The focus on cybersecurity increased 
during 2017. The Group has identified the 
information assets that are potentially at risk 
from a cyberattack and is taking steps to 
ensure the relevant protections are in place. 
The Committee will continue to monitor and 
review this significant risk during 2018.
Specifically, during 2017, significant 
investments were made to drive stronger 
defences. These investments include a 
“next generation” global firewall deployment, 
with 24/7 monitoring services. Furthermore, 
we are rolling out new tools to all desktops 
to increase our resilience to ransomware 
through improved malware protection and 
web filtering, accompanied by an education 
campaign. Security policies have been 
improved with an extensive compliance 
programme on core activities such as the 
updating of Microsoft patches.
Group Management Code
During 2017, the Committee 
oversaw and approved revisions 
to the Group Management Code. 
The revised Group Management Code 
can be found on the Group’ s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, on the 
Policies and procedures page, within the 
Governance section.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, 
the Directors have assessed the viability of 
the Group over a three-year period, taking 
into account the Group’ s current financial 
position, business strategy, the Board’ s 
risk appetite and the potential impacts of 
the principal risks, outlined on pages 32 to 
33 of the Strategic Report, and the Risk 
Appetite Statement on page 83. Based on 
this assessment, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the three-year period to 
31st December 2020.
The Board believes that a three-year 
viability assessment period is appropriate 
as the timeframe is covered by the Group’ s 
strategic plan; takes into account the nature 
of the Group’ s principal risks, a number of 
which are external and have the potential to 
impact over short time periods. While the 
Board has no reason to believe that the 
Group will not be viable over a longer period, 
given the inherent uncertainty involved, the 
Board believes that a three-year period 
presents readers of the Annual Report with 
a reasonable degree of confidence while still 
providing a longer-term perspective.
In making their assessment, the Directors 
completed a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, as set 
out on pages 32 to 33, including those 
that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity, 
and undertook sensitivity and stress 
testing to determine the potential impacts 
of the occurrence of one or more of the 
principal risks on sales, profit, margin 
and cash. In addition to completing an 
impact assessment of the principal risks, 
the Directors considered the probability 
of occurrence of the principal risks, the 
Company’ s ability to control them and the 
effectiveness of mitigating actions.
The Group’ s resilient business model has 
proven strong and defensive in the long term 
and has enabled the business to prosper, 
even in challenging market conditions. 
The diversity of our end user markets and 
customers, broad product range, wide 
geographic spread, high replacement 
revenue streams and large base of installed 
equipment worldwide, together with our 
effective direct sales business model, 
enhances the viability of the Group in the 
face of adverse economic conditions and/
or political uncertainty, as does our ability to 
self-generate business through identifying 
solutions to our customers’ difficult process 
challenges and our ability to adjust our 
cost base.
Whilst no Board can ever fully foresee all 
possible risks facing the business in the 
future, the Directors are of the view that a 
robust assessment was undertaken of the 
severe but plausible scenarios that may 
feasibly impact upon the business over the 
next three years. We have also assumed that 
our various finance facilities will continue to 
be available. Furthermore, the Board remains 
confident in the Group’ s risk management 
process and the risk mitigation actions taken 
to address identified risks.
A number of scenarios were developed 
from the Group’ s principal risks, and the 
impact on future viability of the two worst 
case scenarios happening simultaneously, 
was assessed. Both scenarios were 
associated with economic and political 
disasters occurring in two of the Group’ s 
largest territories with subsequent contagion 
throughout the rest of the world. Despite the 
adverse impacts, no viability issues resulted. 
In addition to this impact assessment, the 
Directors also considered the probability 
of occurrence of the principal risks, the 
Company’ s ability to control them and 
the effectiveness of mitigating actions. 
No viability issues resulted.
Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) conclusion 
of review on Company’s 
disclosures in respect of the 
significant judgements
The Committee was pleased that following 
the FRC’ s thematic review of the disclosure 
in the Group’ s 2016 Accounts in relation 
to significant accounting judgements and 
sources of estimation uncertainty: (i) the 
FRC had no substantive issues to raise with 
the Group and (ii) they included the Group’ s 
disclosure as an example of better practice 
when they published the results of their 
thematic review.

Responsibilities
The risk review process
The Committee has accountability for 
overseeing risk management processes 
and procedures. This is accomplished with 
support from the Audit Committee. The Risk 
Management Committee reports to the 
Board on the risks facing the Group. Further, 
the Committee is charged with the on-going 
monitoring of sufficient and effective 
mitigation plans for relevant risks at each 
Group operating company and division.
The Committee employs internal controls on 
the risk management process, including via 
the external and internal audits, to ensure 
the Group’ s actions and activities are in line 
with Group objectives and policies. At least 
once a year at a local level, each operating 
company is required to undertake a formal 
review of the risks which impact, or have the 
potential to impact, its business.
The reviews are consolidated into 
Group-wide risk reports which are 
maintained and reviewed by the Committee 
on a regular basis.
We have a robust risk management process 
in place through which we identify, evaluate 
and manage the principal risks that could 
impact the Group’ s performance.
During 2017, we reviewed the Group’ s 
exposure to risk using a bottom-up 
approach, collecting information and 
evaluations for each Group operating 
company. The Committee analysed this 
information and updated our risk register to 
reflect the relevant changes, which included 
expanding the risks addressed in the register, 
as well as the assessment of and action 
plans for each risk. Our principal risks and 
the product of the 2017 review are set out 
on pages 32 to 33.
The Group’ s governance structure is set up 
so that there are three lines of defence within 
the risk management framework:
 − first line of defence – the business is 
responsible for the identification, control 
and management of its own risks;
 − second line of defence – the Risk 
Management Committee, with the 
Audit Committee, ensures that the risk 
and compliance framework is effective 
so as to facilitate the monitoring of risk 
management with on-going challenge and 
review of the risk profile in the business; 
and
 − third line of defence – internal audits 
provide independent testing and 
verification of compliance with policies and 
procedures and monitoring of follow up 
actions where required.
This approach ensures that senior managers 
have full accountability for the management 
of risks in their specific areas.
Internal controls
An on-going review process for identifying 
and managing risks faced by the Group 
has been in place since 2013. The review 
covers and assesses the effectiveness of 
all material controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk 
management systems. It ensures that proper 
accounting records have been maintained, 
that financial information used within the 
business is reliable and that the preparation 
of the Consolidated and Company Financial 
Statements and the financial reporting 
process comply with all relevant regulatory 
reporting requirements. The system of 
internal controls is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve the business objectives.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for 
the effective management of risk across the 
Group and determining risk appetite.
The Board also has overall responsibility 
for the system of internal controls and for 
reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role of 
management is to implement Board policies 
on risk and control.
All operating companies are required 
annually to complete self-certification 
questionnaires regarding compliance with 
the policies, procedures and minimum 
requirements for an effective system of 
internal controls. Self-certification is given by 
both the General Manager and the Finance 
Manager of each operation.
This system of analysing and incorporating 
information directly from the Group 
companies allows the Committee to 
continually assess new and changing risks in 
the Group’ s business.
Further, while internal controls are not 
an absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss, the Board believes the 
regular cycle of review paired with internal 
monitoring provides a commercially sound 
approach to protect the Group from the risks 
that are a necessary part of its operations.
As required by the UK Listing Authority, 
throughout the year and up to the date of the 
publication of the Annual Report, the Group 
has complied with the Code provisions on 
internal controls.
With respect to Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
(ABC) concerns, the Group has continued 
to reinforce the message of zero tolerance 
for bribery and corruption within its 
business through the online ABC training. 
Further, representatives of the Group Legal 
function provided presentations to the 
senior management of the Group’ s newly 
acquired businesses to emphasise the 
significance of the ABC policies and training, 
as well as the whistle-blowing hotline, in 
developing and maintaining a commitment 
to ethical business practices. T o ensure the 
ABC training remains relevant, engaging 
and up-to-date, we will be developing 
and rolling-out a new online ABC training 
programme in 2018.
The Group’ s statement regarding the 
Modern Slavery Act has been confirmed 
once again, and is set out on page 57.

 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 83
Internal audit
Each of the Group operating companies 
undergoes an internal audit at least once 
every three years. Operating companies 
located in higher risk territories are audited 
more frequently. 
All businesses acquired by the Group are 
subject to internal audit within one year 
from the date of acquisition. Internal audits 
are conducted by experienced, qualified 
accounting staff from principal Group 
operating companies and a professional 
auditing firm, BDO International. Reports are 
made to the Audit Committee and the Board 
as a whole.
The Committee has ensured compliance 
with centrally documented control 
procedures on such matters as capital 
expenditure, information and technology 
security and legal and regulatory compliance.
During 2017, the Audit Committee and 
Board determined that the size of the 
Group and the growing function of the 
internal audit warranted the appointment 
of a Head of Internal Audit. In November 
2017, Dan Harvey was appointed to this 
role. Dan has nearly 20 years of international 
internal audit experience across a range 
of businesses in the engineering and 
technology sectors. A qualified chartered 
accountant and internal auditor, he has 
recently held senior audit roles at Experian 
and BAE Systems, and spent four years 
leading the internal audit and risk function 
at Dyson.

Risk Appetite Statement
We recognise that risk is an inherent part of business and, in order to achieve our business aims, we must accept 
certain risks. We seek to implement a balanced approach to risk, ensuring that our resources are protected while still 
pursuing opportunities to accelerate and deliver growth.
The decision to take opportunity-based risks should, to the greatest extent possible, be deliberate and calculated. 
We aim to confirm that the level of risk is commensurate with the strategic and economic benefits the risk might 
bring; we evaluate our ability to control the risk or mitigate its effects, should that risk materialise; and we always 
assess the potential ethical considerations arising from knowingly accepting some level of risk.
An informed and well considered process is crucial to any decision to accept risk. The Risk Management 
Committee has undertaken a thorough evaluation process to determine an appropriate risk appetite rating for each 
principal risk.
During 2017, we updated our risk register and amended the risks identified as the Group’ s principal risks. The eight 
principal risks and the risk appetite ratings are set out on pages 32 to 33. In summary, the Group has a very low 
appetite for risks that could lead to violations of health, safety and environmental legislation, or to breaches of legal 
and regulatory requirements. In contrast, the Group has a high risk appetite in relation to economic and political 
instability; with decades of experience in successfully managing operations in volatile markets, we have the control 
procedures in place to handle the challenges that come with those risks and we appreciate that without taking risks 
in new, albeit sometimes unstable, territories we would miss out on valuable opportunities for growth. As a whole, 
we consider that the risk appetite ratings for the eight principal risks demonstrate that the Group has an appropriate 
and balanced risk appetite.
As an organisation we are risk aware, but not risk averse. We continually monitor and assess the risks facing the Group 
and evaluate our ability to control them and mitigate their effects. Focusing on our strategic objectives, we evaluate our 
risk appetite and decisions to accept risk in a way that will ensure the on-going financial health of the Group.
“ Internal audit provides 
valuable assurance to the 
Board that the Group’ s key 
risks are being managed 
effectively.”

Remuneration
Statement by the Chairman of the Committee
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Remuneration 
Report for 2017. I am happy to confirm that the implementation 
of Executive Director remuneration complied fully with our 
Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the AGM in 
May 2017.
The Remuneration Report has been split into two sections:
 − the 2017 remuneration implementation report (Annual Report on 
Remuneration 2017) as set out on pages 88 to 98; and
 − Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Remuneration Policy Report 2017) 
as set out on pages 99 to 108.
We would like to thank shareholders for the support they showed 
for the Annual Report on Remuneration 2016 and the Remuneration 
Policy 2017. At the AGM in May 2017, the advisory resolution on 
the Annual Report on Remuneration 2016 received 99.7% votes in 
favour. At the same time our new Remuneration Policy was approved 
with 95.1% votes in favour. This new Policy was implemented 
immediately following the AGM. The Committee is satisfied that 
the Remuneration Policy continues to reflect the interests of 
shareholders and aligns Executive remuneration with Company 
strategy, while allowing the Group to attract and retain motivated and 
talented individuals.
Executive Director salary review
Salaries were reviewed in accordance with the Remuneration Policy, 
taking into account the Company and individual performance in 
conjunction with the wider workforce comparisons. For 2018, all 
Executive Directors were awarded base salary increases strictly in line 
with the wider workforce. This equated to 2.7% for the UK-based 
Executive Directors and 3.0% for Jay Whalen, who is based in 
the USA.
Rewarding strong business performance
As noted in the Chairman’ s Statement on pages 4 to 5, the 
Company made impressive progress in 2017 with Group revenue up 
6% and adjusted operating profit up 6%, both on an organic basis 
(contributing to adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth of 29% 
and a return on capital employed (ROCE) of 51.8% (as determined 
under Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) rules)). The Company delivered 
a total shareholder return (TSR) of 111.7% which is in the upper 
quartile of our comparator group. An increase in the total dividend for 
the year extends our dividend progress to 50 years.
2017 was a landmark year with the two largest acquisitions in the 
Group’ s history; Gestra and Chromalox. During this transformative 
year, the Company continued to demonstrate strong underlying 
organic growth of 5% in the Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties business 
and 10% in Watson-Marlow.
Our Remuneration Policy is designed to ensure that a significant 
percentage of Executive Director pay is based on the achievement 
of demanding performance targets and is, therefore, “at risk”. 
Maximum payout in the AIP and Performance Share Plan (PSP) is 
only possible as a result of significant strong performance by the 
business. The Committee considers that the remuneration paid to 
Executive Directors in 2017 (given as a single figure for each Director 
on page 88) reflects the progress made by the Company during 
2017 as well as over the last three years.
Annual bonus
Annual bonuses are based on adjusted operating profit, ROCE 
targets and personal strategic objectives. The Group profit 
achievement of £214.1 million (as determined under the AIP rules) 
was 6.2% above the £201.7 million plan target and the ROCE 
achieved of 51.8% was 2.7 percentage points above the 49.1% 
plan target. These achievements resulted in a 125% of salary bonus 
award for the Group Chief Executive and 100% of salary for the 
Group Finance Director. Other Executive Directors’ targets have an 
additional divisional profit element and details of their bonus targets 
and level of achievement can be found on pages 89 to 90.
Performance Share Plan
In spite of difficult macro-economic conditions over the performance 
period, I am delighted to confirm that the Group has performed 
well against the demanding performance targets set for the 2015 
PSP . Shares awarded in the 2015 PSP vest based on the growth 
of two measures, EPS (60%) and TSR (40%), over the three year 
performance period. EPS resulted in 100% vesting. A 111.7% 
increase in TSR in the three year performance period triggered a 
100% award for this element. The total number of shares vesting 
under both elements was therefore 100% of the total shares 
awarded. Details of the PSP awards can be found on pages 91 
to 92.
In light of the significant acquisition activity in 2017, we have 
increased the target of the EPS element of the Executive Director 
PSP to reflect both planned organic growth from the underlying 
business and the incremental contribution expected from Gestra and 
Chromalox in accordance with our acquisition business case. 
Looking ahead to 2018 
In respect of 2017 we reported record levels of profit, a further 
material increase in our share price and a dividend increase 
of 15%. The acquisitions of both Gestra and Chromalox have 
created a larger and more complex organisation that is providing 
additional challenges for the leadership team. Our Remuneration 
Policy 2017 was designed to provide flexibility for the future, if so 
required, to meet the needs of the changing shape of the Group, 
its management structure and to retain Executives. We are not 
proposing any changes to the existing Policy in 2018, or to the way 
in which we implement it beyond the modest salary increases and 
increased PSP targets described above. However, during 2018 we 
will review our remuneration arrangements to ensure they continue 
to drive incremental performance while appropriately reflecting the 
changes in the size, scope, operations and complexity of the Group. 
In addition to this we have published our Gender Pay Gap data and 
we will also be monitoring the outcome of the FRC review of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and any resulting legislation.
I hope that this provides a useful overview of the decisions the 
Committee has taken during the year.

Strategic alignment
The Committee ensures that the remuneration paid to the Executive Directors is closely aligned to the Group strategy. In June 2017 the Board 
reviewed the Strategic Plan approved in 2014.
The Strategic Plan is used to set individual strategic objectives for the Executive Directors and, from this, bonus targets are agreed and 
approved by the Committee. This process forms part of the annual Board calendar, with the bonus targets approved in the early part of the 
financial year. The Group’ s strategic themes are set out on page 21.

Annual bonus
Executive Directors participate in the annual bonus plan, which rewards them for financial performance both at Group level and, where 
relevant, the business segment for which they are responsible. T argets are reviewed annually to ensure continuing alignment with strategy 
and are agreed at the start of the year. Resulting awards are determined following the end of the financial year by the Committee, based on 
performance against these targets.
For the Group Chief Executive, achievement of target performance results in a bonus of 75% of salary, increasing to 125% of salary for 
maximum performance. For the other Executive Directors, achievement of target performance results in a bonus of 60% of salary, increasing 
to 100% of salary for maximum performance.
Bonus payments are subject to clawback or malus for up to three years following payment. Circumstances that may result in a clawback or 
malus include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
The payment of up to 10% of an Executive Director’ s bonus opportunity, 12.5% for the Group Chief Executive, is based on individual strategic 
objectives, alongside the current financial measures. These strategic objectives are tailored to an individual’ s areas of responsibility and agreed 
at the start of the year. Each measure is subject to three possible achievement levels: fully achieved, partially achieved and not achieved. 
A comprehensive review of the personal objectives which applied in 2017 to each Executive Director can be found on page 90.

The performance measures are adjusted to reflect certain non-operating items including the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible 
assets and exceptional reorganisational costs and to exclude any profit contribution and other impacts such as major acquisitions during 
the period. 
2017 was a good year for the Group which delivered earnings growth, maintained operating profit margin and increased dividend to 
shareholders. The annual bonus payments to Executive Directors ranged between 98% and 125% of salary. The bonus is payable in cash 
where the relevant Executive Director has met the share ownership requirement, otherwise that part of the bonus over 60% of base salary, 
75% for the Group Chief Executive, net of tax, must be used to buy shares until the shareholding requirement has been met.
The table below summarises the achieved performance in 2017 in respect of each of the measures used in the determination of annual 
bonus, together with an indication of actual performance relative to target.

Spirax-Sarco Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Committee makes an annual conditional award of shares to each Executive Director under the PSP . Prior to award, the Committee 
reviews the performance targets for each measure to ensure they remain sufficiently stretching. For financial measures this includes a review 
of analysts’ forecasts. PSP awards are subject to malus (reduction in the amount of deferred and as yet unpaid compensation) and clawback 
(reimbursement of compensation that has already been paid) for up to three years following the award, and can be applied during a holding 
period. Circumstances that may result in a clawback or malus adjustment include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining 
bonus payments or gross misconduct.
In relation to PSP awards made prior to 2017, the maximum award under the PSP was 100% of base salary. From 2017 the maximum 
award was increased to 150% for the Group Chief Executive and 125% for the other Executive Directors, in accordance with the 
Remuneration Policy approved at the AGM in 2017. Vesting is based on two performance conditions measured over a three-year period, 
which have been chosen as they are aligned with our strategy:
 − TSR relative to a comparator group; and
 − EPS growth.
In addition, a two-year post-vesting holding period applies to PSP awards made from 2017.
PSP awards vesting over 2015-2017
In 2015 the Executive Directors received share awards under the PSP , with vesting subject to EPS growth and relative TSR performance.

1.2 Pension (audited)
In lieu of pension benefits, Nicholas Anderson and Kevin Boyd received 25% of their basic salary in cash, which in the year ended 
31st December 2017 amounted to £132,000 and £86,000 respectively.
Neil Daws became a deferred member of an HMRC registered, contributory defined benefit scheme, the Spirax-Sarco Executives’ Retirement 
Benefits Scheme, with effect from 31st December 2012, and is, therefore, no longer accruing any pension benefits within the defined benefit 
scheme. His defined benefit rights in the Scheme at 31st December 2017 were £4,765,000 and his normal retirement date is 1st January 
2025 (age 62½). In lieu of pension benefits, he received 25% of his basic salary in cash, which in the year ended 31st December 2017 
amounted to £78,000.
Jay Whalen is a member of the Spirax Sarco Inc. defined benefit plan. The benefit paid under normal retirement from the US defined benefit 
plan is a single life annuity equal to the number of years of service multiplied by the sum of 1.0% of pensionable salary up to social security 
covered compensation, plus 1.45% of pensionable salary in excess of social security covered compensation. Final average salary is the 
average of the highest pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement up to a ceiling. Jay Whalen’ s final average salary is 
higher than the salary ceiling as at 31st December 2017.

 This is a non-contributory plan so J.L. Whalen paid zero contributions into the defined benefit plan over the year.
The following additional information is provided:
 − Upon death in service: a spouse’ s pension equal to one-half of the member’ s pension, based on pensionable service to the date of death, 
is payable. After payment of the pension commences the accrued pension shown has no attaching spouse’ s pension. However, at 
retirement there is an option to reduce the member’ s pension to provide for a spouse’ s pension after death.
 − Early retirement rights: after leaving the service of the Company, Jay Whalen has the right to draw his accrued pension at any time after his 
65th birthday with no reduction. In addition, he has the right to commence his pension earlier if he meets the age and service requirements, 
with the pension being reduced. The annual reductions for early retirement are 3% for each year from age 65 to age 60.
 − Pension increases: the pension has no guaranteed increases. Spirax Sarco Inc. has the discretion to provide increases.

In respect of the PSP awards made to Executive Directors in 2017, vesting is dependent on the following TSR and EPS performance 
measures. In addition to the three-year vesting period, a two-year holding period applies.
Relative TSR performance (40% of PSP award) Performance Payout
Threshold TSR equal to median 25%
Maximum TSR equal to or higher than the upper quartile 100%
For awards made in 2017 the comparator group is the constituents of the FTSE 350 Industrial Goods and Services Supersector at the start of 
the performance period.
Point-to-point EPS growth (60% of PSP award) Performance Payout
Threshold Global Industrial Production +2% per annum 25%
Maximum Global Industrial Production +8% per annum 100%
With effect from 2016, the EPS element of the PSP is based on growth in excess of global industrial production growth rates, often referred 
to in our industry as “Global IP”, rather than UK RPI. Global IP* is a measure that the Board and management have used for some time as 
there is well documented evidence that it is the best predictor of the global and industrial markets within which the Group operates. For these 
reasons, Global IP was used in the formulation of the long-term strategic plan and targets for EPS growth approved by the Board. As a 
result, the Committee was of the view it made sense to incorporate Global IP into our PSP , as a means of better aligning the assessment 
of performance against our long-term strategic plan and market dynamics within our industry. The Committee reviewed the historical and 
projected data (2007-2020), including the Group’ s performance, market benchmarks and analysts’ consensus to determine a performance 
range associated with this benchmark growth rate that remains sufficiently challenging across various market environments. Accordingly, 
threshold vesting will occur for exceeding Global IP by 2% per annum, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for exceeding Global IP 
by 8% per annum.
* The Global IP data source is the CHR Metals Global IP Index, providing data, that incorporates over 90% of global industrial output.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
Executive Directors (excluding Jay Whalen who is a US citizen) are eligible to participate in an HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan known as 
the ESOP . Nicholas Anderson and Neil Daws are participants. Kevin Boyd was not eligible to participate in the 2016 ESOP because the date 
on which he joined the Group was too late. He is a participant in the 2017 ESOP which has a share purchase date of October 2018. 
During the year ended 31st December 2017 Nicholas Anderson and Neil Daws each purchased 33 partnership shares, were each awarded 
33 matching shares and received seven and 30 dividend shares respectively. Further information is set out in the table on page 95.
The maximum annual investment in shares was increased (along with eligible UK employees) to the HMRC limit of £1,800 per Executive 
Director which can be matched by the Company on a one-for-one basis for each share that is purchased by an Executive Director and 
dividend shares can be reinvested.
No shares acquired under the ESOP are subject to performance measures as the aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased shareholding in 
the Company by all eligible UK employees.
1.4 Payments to past Directors (audited)
There were no payments to former Directors during the year ended 31st December 2017.
1.5 Payments for loss of office (audited)

Progress towards share ownership guideline
The following chart sets out the Executive Directors’ progress towards the Company’ s share ownership guidelines.
In 2016 the guidelines were 125% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 100% for the other Executive Directors, over a maximum 
period of five years from date of appointment to the Board. Following the approval of the Remuneration Policy at the AGM in May 2017, the 
share ownership guidelines were increased to 200% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 125% for the other Executive Directors. 
This increase applies to the period from 2017. Executive Directors are expected to achieve the increased maximums within five years.
Progress against the 2016 guidelines and the reset 2017 guidelines is illustrated below. The value of the shareholding is taken at 
29th December 2017 as a percentage of 2017 base salary.

 Appointed to the Board 11th May 2016. Target increased from 100% to 125% with effect from May 2017*.

In accordance with Policy, Executive Directors must use the part of bonus over 60% of base salary, 75% of base salary for the Group Chief 
Executive, net of tax, to buy shares until their shareholding guideline has been met. This is, in effect, a bonus deferral mechanism.
The share ownership guidelines have been met by all Executive Directors excepting Kevin Boyd. Kevin Boyd has made significant progress 
since he joined in May 2016 and will use that part of his bonus over 60% of base salary to buy more shares to reach the 2021 and 
2022 targets.

  The mid-market price of the shares on 14th March 2014 was 2873.0p. 40% of the PSP award vested on 6th March 2017 as the performance measures applicable were partly met. During the 
performance period 1st January 2014 to 31st December 2016, the TSR performance of the Company resulted in 100% vesting of this element. The EPS performance of the Company resulted in zero 
vesting of this element. The mid-market price of the shares on 29th February 2016 was 4568.0p. The 2014 awards vested in the form of whole shares.

performance measures are measured is 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2018. There are two performance measures governing vesting of this PSP award: 40% of the PSP award is subject to a 
TSR performance measure which requires the Company to rank at median relative to a comparator group of the constituents of the FTSE 350 Industrial Goods and Services Supersector for 25% of this 
portion of the PSP award to vest, increasing to full vesting for ranking at the upper quartile; 60% of the PSP award is subject to an EPS performance measure which requires growth of Global IP +2% per 
annum for 25% of this portion of the PSP award to vest, increasing to full vesting for growth of Global IP +8% per annum.

Dividends payable £64m £56m 14.3%
1.12 Changes for 2018
With effect from 1st January 2018, the Executive Directors’ salaries have been increased by an average of 2.8%. Increases for the broader 
employee population were on average 2.7% for the UK and 3.0% for the US, increasing in accordance with internal guidelines for top 
performers. The increases for Executive Directors, like those for the broader UK employee population, took account of both individual 
performance and market data, to ensure that salaries remain competitively positioned in the market.
Base salaries:
– N.J. Anderson  £543,000  2.7%
– K.J. Boyd  £353,300  2.7%
– N.H. Daws  £320,400  2.7%
– J.L. Whalen  $484,100  3.0%
Bonus targets for 2018 are not disclosed because they are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive. The targets will be 
retrospectively reported in the Annual Report on Remuneration next year.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees
Effective from 1st January 2018, the Non-Executive Director basic fee was increased by 2.7%, which is in line with the average UK employee 
salary increase of 2.7%. The fee for Committee chairmanship was unchanged. The Senior Independent Director’ s fee was increased from 
£8,000 to £10,000 to match the market median. The Chairman’ s fee was increased by 5.7% to continue addressing the asymmetries to our 
Group policy and the below-market competitiveness of the Chairman’ s fee.

Annual bonus plan
From 2018, and consistent with the Remuneration Policy 2017, the Group ROCE element of the annual bonus plan will be replaced with a 
Group cash generation metric in order to reinforce cash discipline.
Other aspects of remuneration
There are no other planned or implemented changes of note for remuneration in 2018.
1.13 Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
Operation of the Remuneration Committee in 2017
Membership and attendance
Each Committee member is an independent Non-Executive Director and thus brings independence to all aspects of Board remuneration and 
the application of professional advice to matters relating to remuneration.
During 2017, the Committee was chaired by Jane Kingston and the members comprised: Jamie Pike, Trudy Schoolenberg and Clive Watson. 
In 2017, the Committee met three times and, with the exception of Jamie Pike, all members attended each meeting. Jamie Pike was unable 
to attend one meeting due to unavoidable absence because of a bereavement, but reviewed all the papers and provided his views in advance 
to the Committee Chairman.
Advisers to the Committee
During 2017, the Committee sought advice and information from Bill Whiteley, the Chairman; Nicholas Anderson, the Group Chief Executive; 
and Jim Devine, the Group Human Resources Director. None of the invitees participated in any discussions regarding their own remuneration 
or fees. The General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
In addition, the Committee received external advice from Willis T owers Watson, who was appointed by the Committee and provided material 
advice to the Committee on various matters such as Executive remuneration levels and structure, performance updates in respect of the PSP , 
the Remuneration Report and attendance at Committee meetings. Willis T owers Watson’ s fees in respect of these services totalled £32,000 in 
2017. In addition, Willis T owers Watson work with management on other matters relating to remuneration with the approval of the Committee. 
A separate advisory team within Willis T owers Watson provides support and advice to management on pensions and other employee benefit-
related matters. The Committee is of the opinion that the advice received is objective and independent, given that Willis T owers Watson are 
a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, the manner in which advice is delivered and the separate teams that 
advise management more generally.
In 2017, Baker & McKenzie LLP provided legal advice to the Company (which was available to the Committee). Legal fees relate to advice 
provided to the Company and not the Committee, and are charged on a time-cost basis.

Committee, taking into account:
 − scale, scope and complexity of 
the role;
 − skills and experience of 
the individual;
 − wider workforce comparisons; 
and
 − market benchmarking, within 
a defined external comparator 
group. The Committee 
uses this information with 
caution, given the limited 
number of direct comparators 
and to avoid remuneration 
inflation as a result of 
benchmarking exercises with 
no corresponding improvement 
in performance.
The Committee considers 
the impact of any base 
salary increase on the total 
remuneration package.
Reviews take into 
account Company  
and individual  
performance.
Ordinarily, salary increases 
will not exceed the average 
increase awarded to other Group 
employees. The maximum 
value of any annual increase in 
Executive Director salaries will be 
capped at country of residence 
inflation plus 5%. 
The Committee may award 
increases above this level, subject 
to a maximum of country of 
residence inflation plus 10%, in 
circumstances such as (i) where a 
new recruit or promoted Executive 
Director’ s salary has been set 
lower than the market level for 
such a role, or (ii) where there is a 
significant increase in the size and 
responsibilities of the Executive 
Director’ s role.
Pension T o offer market 
competitive levels of 
pension and benefit.
T o attract and retain 
individuals with the 
personal attributes, skills 
and experience required 
to deliver Group strategy.
For eligible Executive Directors 
who joined the UK Company 
before 2001 the Company 
provides a UK defined benefits 
pension scheme (DB scheme) or 
cash alternative allowance.
For UK nationals who joined 
the UK Company after 2001 
the Company provides a 
defined contribution pension 
arrangement (DC plan) and/or 
contributions to a private pension 
and/or a cash allowance.
Executive Directors who have 
transferred internally from 
overseas may continue to 
participate in home country 
pension arrangements and/or 
receive a cash allowance.
N/A For DB scheme as per 
actuarial value.
For all other arrangements the 
total contribution to all pension 
arrangements will comprise no 
more than 25% of base salary.
No element other than base salary 
is pensionable.

2.2 Notes to the Policy table
Changes to the Remuneration Policy
The proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy are as follows:
 − AIP award: increase potential maximum award from 125% to 150% of salary;
 − PSP award: increase potential maximum award from 100%-150% of salary to 200% of salary;
 − PSP holding period: introduce a two-year post-vesting holding period (currently there is no holding period);
 − share ownership requirements: increase share ownership requirements from at least 125% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and at 
least 100% of salary for the other Executive Directors to 200% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 125% of salary for the other 
Executive Directors; 
 − remove the Committee’ s discretion to grant one-off awards for recruitment or retention in exceptional circumstances; and
 − reserve the Committee’ s right to adjust for the effects of divestments or major acquisitions from the EPS results, to ensure those results are 
in line with the primarily organic growth principles that support the EPS targets.
Additional details and an explanation of the changes can be found in the Statement by the Chairman of the Committee on pages 85 and 86.
Outstanding incentive awards
Details of outstanding incentive awards granted to Executive Directors prior to the Policy coming into force, including awards granted in 2016, 
and details of the performance targets are set out on pages 89 to 92 of the Annual Report on Remuneration 2016.
All incentive awards granted prior to this Policy coming into force will continue on their existing terms including the exercise of discretion to 
amend such awards.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The Company’ s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level of 
experience, responsibility, individual performance and market pay levels. The most senior managers in the business (approximately 80 people 
globally) participate in bonus arrangements with similar targets, measures and relative weightings to the Executive Directors. T arget and 
maximum potential values are lower and determined by the grade of the manager’ s role. Performance targets are based on an appropriate 
combination of Group, divisional and local operating company financial measures. Contractual terms and benefits for the wider workforce are 
subject to local employment legislation and best practice.
Measure selection and the target setting process
Measures are selected taking into account the key strategic priorities of the Company, shareholder expectations and factors that sit within an 
individual’ s span of control. 
T argets are set with reference to internal and external forecasts to ensure that they are realistic, yet sufficiently stretching. An appropriate mix of 
long and short-term targets will be used, informed by the nature of the measure.
2.3 External directorships
Directors are permitted to hold external directorships in order to broaden their experience, to the benefit of the Company. Such appointments 
are subject to approval by the Board and the Director may retain any fees paid in respect of such directorships. The Board ensures 
compliance by Directors with Code provision B.3.
2.4 Approach to recruitment and promotion remuneration
When appointing external hires, promoting executives, or an Executive Director internally, the Committee will continue to act in the best 
interests of shareholders when determining remuneration, in line with the stated policy. The main elements of the Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Director appointments are:
 − Base salary will be set on appointment taking into account the factors set out in the Policy table, but also the individual’ s experience. 
Depending on an individual’ s prior experience, the Committee may set salary below market norms, with the intention that it is realigned over 
time, typically two to three years, subject to performance in the role. In this situation, the Committee is permitted to exceed the “normal” rate 
of annual salary increase set out in the Policy table.
 − On-going annual incentive pay opportunity will not exceed 350% of salary, in line with the maximums stated in the Policy table (up to 150% 
of salary for annual bonus and an award of up to 200% of salary under the PSP). In the year of appointment an off-cycle award under the 
PSP may be made by the Committee to ensure an immediate alignment of individual interests.
 − In addition to the standard elements of remuneration, on the appointment of an external candidate, the Committee reserves the right to 
buy-out incentive awards that the individual has foregone by accepting the appointment, if appropriate. The terms of such awards would 
be informed by the amounts being forfeited and the associated terms (for example the extent to which the outstanding awards were 
subject to performance, the vehicles and the associated time horizons). Awards would be made either through the existing share plans or in 
accordance with the relevant provisions contained within the Listing Rules.
 − When an internal appointment to the Board is made, any pre-existing obligations may be honoured by the Committee and payment will be 
permitted under this Remuneration Policy.

2.5 Service agreements and termination policy
The Company’ s policy on service agreements and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below. Service agreements are 
designed to reflect the interests of the Company, as well as the individual concerned. Executive Directors’ service agreements are kept at the 
Company’ s headquarters in Cheltenham.
In accordance with the Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors, Executive Directors have service agreements that are terminable 
by either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months’ notice. In the event of termination or resignation, and subject to business 
reasons, the Company would not necessarily hold the Executive Director to his or her full notice period. All Directors are subject to election (if 
newly appointed in the year) or re-election at the AGM.
Service agreements set out restrictions on the ability of the Executive Director to participate in businesses competing with those of the Group 
or to entice or solicit away from the Group any senior employees or to solicit/deal with clients of the Group or interfere with supply, in the 
12 months following the cessation of employment. 
Salary, pension and benefits are included in the agreements and are treated as described in the policy table on pages 100 to 103. There is 
no contractual entitlement to payment of an annual bonus or granting of an award under the PSP , until individual participation, level of award, 
measures and targets have been set for a particular year.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but serve the Company under letters of appointment, for an 
initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election at the AGM. Appointments may be terminated by the Company or individual with one 
month’ s notice. 
Group Chief Executive and new appointments from 1st January 2013
The details of the service agreements of the Group Chief Executive and for new appointments to the Board are outlined below and comply 
with best practice. In the event of a material change in role, function or responsibilities, Executive Directors’ agreements will be reviewed and 
will be expected to be updated to meet the requirements outlined below.
Notice period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company
Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in 
certain circumstances.
No additional termination payment if notice worked.
If notice only part worked/part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice, otherwise 12 
months’ base salary only.
Company discretion to pay in lieu of notice in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control, 
when a lump sum will be paid.
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits, excluding long-term incentives, 
earned in new paid employment in that period.
No automatic entitlement to payments under the annual bonus or PSP . See page 106.
Garden leave clause.
Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with 
customers or suppliers.
Service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of 
certain events, such as gross misconduct or financial misstatement.
Clawback or 
malus
Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback or malus for up to three years following award.
Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross 
misconduct.
Executive Directors’ legacy agreements
Within the legacy agreements of Executive Directors, termination of agreements is subject to a 12 month notice period. Where payment 
is made in lieu of notice on termination, the payment of a sum in respect of lost future bonus opportunity (based on an average of the 
preceding three years’ bonus payments) is subject to the Committee’ s discretion. The Committee has the power to reduce the amount to reflect 
performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be unsatisfactory . On termination of such an Executive 
Director’ s service agreement, the Committee will take into account the departing Executive Director’ s need to mitigate his or her loss when 
determining the amount of bonus. Payment will only be made at the discretion of the Committee after taking into account individual performance 
in order to ensure that there will be no “payments for failure”. In any event, payments will be subject to clawback or malus provisions.
Executive Directors’ service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of 
certain events, such as termination for gross misconduct or financial misstatement.

While the Executive Directors’ service agreements include a provision to deal with termination on a change of control, in the event of an 
offer being made, shareholders have discretion to accept the offer or not. The decision to recommend acceptance, or not, is a matter for 
the Board, and the Committee is of the clear view that the change of control provision within the Executive Directors’ service agreements 
would have no influence on the voting pattern of those Executive Directors. Executive Directors’ legacy agreements are summarised in the 
table below.
Notice period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company
Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in 
certain circumstances.
No additional termination payment if notice worked.
If notice only part worked/part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice.
Otherwise 12 months’ base salary, the value of other benefits, plus the cost of pension credits or contributions for the 
period plus the average of the prior three years’ annual bonus payments, with Committee discretion to reduce the 
amount of the bonus that would otherwise be calculated, to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director 
that is considered by the Committee to be below the required standards, provided that termination by the Company 
does not occur within 12 months of a change of control.
Committee discretion to pay in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control when a lump 
sum will be paid.
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits excluding long-term incentives, 
earned in new paid employment in that period.
No automatic entitlement to payments under the current annual bonus or PSP . See page 106.
Garden leave clause.
Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with 
customers or suppliers.
Clawback or 
malus
Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback or malus for up to three years following award.
Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross 
misconduct.
Treatment of leavers under the incentive plans
Whilst it is not an entitlement, it is expected that where an Executive Director is a “good leaver” (ie where the cessation of employment is 
due to death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company business in which he/she works being disposed of or where the ending of 
employment is instigated by the Company and is not for cause), payments will be made under the annual bonus plan if performance targets 
are met subject to, and in accordance with, the plan rules. If the Executive Director is not a “good leaver” it is expected that no bonus will 
be paid.
The treatment of leavers under the PSP is determined in accordance with the shareholder approved PSP rules. Any awards granted within 
six months prior to termination (or the giving or receiving of notice) will lapse. Any awards granted six months or longer prior to termination of 
employment (but prior to the end of the performance period) will lapse unless the Executive Director is considered to be a “good leaver”.
In the case of a “good leaver” the award will vest on the termination date, or the normal vesting date, at the Committee’ s discretion. This is 
subject to the satisfaction of the performance targets at that date and a pro-rata reduction in the number of shares to take account of the 
shortening of the performance period. 
For awards granted on or after 1st March 2012, if the Executive Director is a “good leaver” where the ending of employment is not for cause, 
the number of shares vested may be reduced (including to zero) by the Committee in its absolute discretion. 
If an Executive Director ceases employment (or notice is given) on or after the end of the performance period but prior to the date on which 
the Committee has determined the extent to which the award has vested, if the Executive Director is a “good leaver”, his/her award will be 
preserved and will be treated in the same way as if his/her employment had continued, whereas if the Executive Director is not a “good 
leaver”, his/her award will lapse on the earlier of his/her cessation of employment and the giving of notice.
In relation to the ESOP , as an HMRC approved plan, where an Executive Director leaves the treatment will be in line with the approved plan 
rules and HMRC guidance.
Change of control
Bonus: if termination occurs within 12 months of a change of control, the Executive Director is entitled to (i) a lump sum payment in lieu of 
notice and (ii) receive a full bonus payment calculated by reference to the average of the preceding three years’ bonus payments (without any 
reduction for performance).
PSP: the rules provide that in the event of a change of control, outstanding share-based awards will vest to the extent that performance 
targets are met at the date of the event. Any such vesting would generally be on a time pro-rated basis. The Committee may, at its discretion, 
increase the level of vesting if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant such treatment.

2.6 Illustrations of application of the Remuneration Policy
Under the Remuneration Policy, a significant portion of remuneration is variable and depends on the Company’ s performance. Below and 
overleaf we illustrate how the total pay opportunity for the Executive Directors varies under three performance scenarios: maximum, on target, 
and below threshold. 
The scenarios for 2017, informed by the current application of our pay policy, are as follows:
Element
Fixed pay, 
benefits and 
ESOP
Fixed pay and ESOP does not vary with performance and comprises:
 − base salary effective 1st January 2017;
 − benefits value based on 2016 disclosure;
 − pension value (DB 2016: as reported; cash allowance: rate applied to 2017 salary); and
 − ESOP participation of up to £1,500 1:1 matching shares for eligible Executive Directors.

PSP
1
  
(% of salary 
at award)
0% 37.5% CEO / 31.25% ED 150% CEO / 125% ED

  A level of 25% vesting for “on target” performance is equivalent to threshold performance under the PSP , which the Committee believes to be a fair assumption for on target performance given the 
approach taken to setting performance targets.

2.7 Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
When determining the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the pay of employees across the Group. 
When conducting the annual salary review, the average base salary increase awarded to the UK workforce and senior managers across the 
Group provides a key reference point when determining levels of increase for Executive Director remuneration. The Remuneration Policy was 
drawn up by the Committee without the need for any consultation with employees.
The Committee also determines the principles and policy of remuneration which shall apply to the Group’ s senior managers. The responsibility 
for determining precise compensation packages that meet local practice and performance targets lies with the Group Chief Executive and the 
responsible Executive Director. 
T o ensure consistency in Remuneration Policy across the Group and to encourage a performance culture, senior managers participate in the 
PSP . The Board believes that share ownership is an effective way of aligning the interests of managers and shareholders and to strengthen the 
development of the business.
The Remuneration Policy Report 2017 is reproduced exactly as published in the Annual Report 2016 and as approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.

2.8 Statement of consideration of shareholder views
In developing and reviewing the Company’ s Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and other senior executives, the Committee seeks 
and takes into account the range of views of shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers. The Committee Chairman actively engages 
with major shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers when appropriate and takes into account their views when reviewing and 
implementing the Company’ s Remuneration Policy.
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from institutional shareholder 
advisers more generally. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during the year at meetings with shareholders, is considered 
as part of the Company’ s annual Remuneration Policy review. At the AGM in 2016, the advisory vote on the 2015 Annual Report on 
Remuneration received 97.2% in favour. At the AGM in 2014 the Remuneration Policy received 98.5% in favour. 
In finalising the 2017 Remuneration Policy the views of shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers have shaped the:
 − introduction of an additional two-year post-vesting holding period for PSP grants;
 − rebalance of long-term and short-term compensation opportunities by way of the Director’ s PSP opportunity now being more substantive 
than the AIP; 
 − agreement to disclose AIP targets retrospectively; 
 − increase in share ownership requirements; 
 − removal of the Committee’ s discretion to grant one-off awards for recruitment or retention in exceptional circumstances; 
 − keeping of the PSP performance metrics under review, including the consideration of organic growth measures; and
 − reserving of the Committee’ s right to adjust for the effects of divestments or major acquisitions from the EPS results, to ensure those results 
are in line with the primarily organic growth principles that support the EPS targets.
The Remuneration Policy Report 2017 is reproduced exactly as published in the Annual Report 2016 and as approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.

Research and development
The Group continues to devote significant 
resources to the research and development 
and the updating and expansion of its range 
of products in order to remain at the forefront 
of its world markets. The R&D functions 
in Cheltenham (Spirax Sarco Steam 
Specialties), Falmouth (WMFTG), Bremen 
(Gestra) and the Product Development 
function in Pittsburgh and Utah (Chromalox) 
are tasked with improving the Group’ s 
pipeline of new products, decreasing the 
time to launch, expanding the Group’ s 
addressable market and realising additional 
sales. Further information on the expenditure 
on R&D is contained in Note 1 on page 127. 
The amount of R&D expenditure capitalised, 
and the amount amortised, in the year, are 
given in Note 14 on page 139.
Treasury and foreign exchange
The Group has in place appropriate treasury 
policies and procedures, which are approved 
by the Board. The treasury function 
manages interest rates for both borrowings 
and cash deposits for the Group and is also 
responsible for ensuring there is sufficient 
headroom against any banking covenants 
contained within its credit facilities, and 
for ensuring there are appropriate facilities 
available to meet the Group’ s strategic plans.
In order to mitigate and manage exchange 
rate risk, the Group routinely enters into 
forward contracts and continues to monitor 
exchange rate risk in respect of foreign 
currency exposures.
All these treasury policies and procedures 
are regularly monitored and reviewed. 
It is the Group’ s policy not to undertake 
speculative transactions which create 
additional exposures over and above those 
arising from normal trading activity.
Political donations
The Group has a policy of not making 
political donations and no political donations 
were made during the year (2016: nil).
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of our greenhouse gas emissions can 
be found on page 59.
Going concern
The Group’ s business activities, together 
with the main trends and factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance 
and position, and the financial position 
of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities, are set 
out in the Financial Review on pages 48 
to 51. In addition, Note 28 on page 154 
includes the Group’ s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital, its 
financial risk management objectives, its 
financial instruments and hedging activities, 
its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources together with contracts with a 
diverse range of customers and suppliers 
across different geographic areas and 
industries. No one customer accounts for 
more than 1% of Group turnover. 
As a consequence, the Directors believe 
that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully.
The Directors, having made appropriate 
enquiries, consider that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence and that 
the Directors intend to do so, for at least one 
year from the date the Financial Statements 
were signed, and that it is appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Annual Report.
Scope of the reporting in this 
Annual Report
The Board has prepared a Strategic Report 
(including the Chairman’ s Statement, 
the Group Chief Executive’ s Report and 
the Group Chief Executive’ s Review of 
Operations) which provides an overview

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Board of Directors 
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare consolidated Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements for each 
financial year in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law.
In addition, by law the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of their profit or loss 
for that period. In preparing these Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to:
 − properly select and apply 
accounting policies;
 − present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 − provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRS are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’ s financial position and 
financial performance; and
 − make an assessment of the Company’ s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’ s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that its Financial Statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Group’ s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial 
Statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Cautionary statement

historical fact included in this document, 
including those regarding the financial 
condition, results, operations and businesses 
of Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc (its strategy, 
plans and objectives), are forward-looking 
statements. These forward-looking 
statements reflect management’ s 
assumptions made on the basis of 
information available to it at this time. 
They involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties and other important factors 
which could cause the actual results, 
performance or achievements of  
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc to be materially 
different from future results, performance  
or achievements expressed or implied by 
such forward-looking statements.  
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc and its 
Directors accept no liability to third parties in 
respect of this Report save as would arise 
under English law.
Any liability to a person who has 
demonstrated reliance on any untrue or 
misleading statement or omission shall be 
determined in accordance with schedule 
10A of the Financial Services and Markets 
Act 2000. Schedule 10A contains limits on 
the liability of the Directors of Spirax-Sarco 
Engineering plc and their liability is solely to 
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of 
our knowledge:
 − the Financial Statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole;
 − the Strategic Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 − the Annual Report 2017 taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’ s 
performance, business model 
and strategy.

Group Chief Executive Report on the audit of the Financial Statements 
Opinion
In our opinion:
 – the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31st December 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 – the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union;
 – the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
 – the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the Financial Statements of Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group) which comprise:
 – the Consolidated Income Statement;
 – the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
 – the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position;
 – the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows;
 – the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity; and
 – the related Notes 1 to 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and 1 to 11 for the Parent Company Financial Statements. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements is applicable law and IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company Financial 
Statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
Financial Statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: 
 – Acquisition accounting; focused on the valuation of intangible assets
 – Revenue recognition 
 – Defined benefit pension liability valuation
Materiality We determined materiality for the Group to be £9.8m (2016: £7 .8m), which is based upon 5% (2016: 5%) of statutory 
profit before tax.
Scoping We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 28 components. These components represent the 
principal business units and account for 86% of the Group’s total assets, 70% of the Group’s revenue and 78% of the 
Group’s profit before tax.
Significant changes in 
our approach
Last year our report included an inventory obsolescence key audit matter in respect of inventory in niche markets and 
industries where local demand fluctuates over periods. Whilst still an area of audit focus, this matter is not included in 
our report this year. There has been no history of material error over previous years and we have considered the ratio 
of provision to inventory and the stable nature of the underlying balance and concluded inventory obsolescence is not 
considered to be a key audit matter for the Group Financial Statements.
Financial Statements
114 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc only Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
 – We have reviewed the Directors’ statement in Note 1 to the Financial Statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and to Parent Company’s ability to continue to do so 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements.
 – We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that 
statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have 
nothing material to report, 
add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the Directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the 
knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the 
Directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are 
required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 – the disclosures on pages 32 to 33 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
 – the Directors' confirmation on page 80 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity; or
 – the Directors’ explanation on page 80 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have 
nothing material to report, 
add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
We are also required to report whether the Directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Acquisition accounting; focused on the valuation of intangible assets
Key audit matter 
description
The Group completed the acquisition of Gestra AG on 2nd May 2017 and Chromalox Inc on 3rd July 2017 with a total 
initial consideration of £484.3m on a debt-free cash-free basis. 
Given the two acquisitions in the current year, we have identified that there is a risk of material misstatement that 
acquisitions are not accounted correctly in line with IFRS 3, Business Combinations. We have pinpointed the key 
audit matter to the assumptions and assertions used by management to identify and value the separately identifiable 
intangible assets. 
Intangible assets of £218.7m were identified as arising on these two acquisitions. The valuation methodology applied 
is based on a number of assumptions and judgements such as identification of the primary intangibles, EBIT margin 
assumptions, discount and short term growth rates.  
Refer to Note 1 for the Group’s acquisition accounting policies including the key estimates and assumptions used 
in the intangibles valuation, Note 27 for the Group’s disclosures on acquisitions in the year and the significant issues 
section of the Audit Committee Report.

 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 115 How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We have evaluated management’s determination of the fair value of the net assets acquired, focusing on the valuation 
of intangible assets recognised at the acquisition date. 
We challenged management’s methodology and assumptions underlying the valuation of intangible assets by:
 – Performing walkthroughs to understand the adequacy of the design and implementation of controls relating to 
acquisition accounting.
 – Involving our internal valuation specialists to evaluate the valuation methodologies, including judgements around 
identification of primary intangibles, used by management and the Group’s external valuation expert.
 – In consultation with our internal valuation specialists we audited key assumptions based on external market data 
including the EBIT margin, discount and short term growth rate. We compared these rates to the rates used by 
management and the Group’s external valuation expert.
 – Reperforming the calculations of the valuation of intangible assets.
 – Performing sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions used in the valuation model of acquired intangibles.
 – Assessing whether any evidence exists which contradicts the assumptions used in the valuation.
Key observations From the work performed above we are satisfied that management’s key estimates, methodology and assumptions 
used in the valuations of acquired intangibles at the acquisition date fall within an acceptable range.
Revenue recognition 
Key audit matter 
description
The Group generates revenue primarily from the sale of goods with revenue being recognised on delivery or dispatch. 
There is a significant risk due to the potential for fraud through possible manipulation of this balance.
We have identified two key areas of focus in relation to revenue recognition.
 – There is a significant volume of trade in the final quarter of the year in certain components leading to the potential 
overstatement of revenue. The key audit matter for these components focuses on the recognition of revenue by 
reference to contracted shipping terms and the transfer of ownership for product despatch and delivery spanning 
the year end. 
 – There is a focus on any significant new and one-off contracts spanning the year end to determine whether any 
specific alternative revenue recognition policies are required.
Refer to Note 1 for the Group’s revenue recognition policy and the significant issues section of the Audit 
Committee Report.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We performed walkthroughs to understand the adequacy of the design and implementation of the controls relating to 
the revenue cycle. At significant components, we map the end to end controls and processes in place.
We reviewed the product despatch cycle and revenue recognition profile across the year end period and sampled 
a selection of items confirming the date of transfer of ownership was in line with the revenue recognition date in 
accordance with the terms of trade with customers. We focused our procedures on those components with a 
significant volume of trade in the final quarter.  
We audited a sample of contracts spanning the year end to assess the terms of sale and the associated 
revenue recognition. 
Key observations From the work performed above we are satisfied that there are no material cut-off errors and revenue recognition for 
significant new contracts is appropriate.
Defined benefit pension liability valuation
Key audit matter 
description
At 31st December 2017 the gross retirement benefit liability recognised in the Statement of Financial Position was 
£543.0m (31st December 2016: £520.3m). There is a risk of material misstatement relating to the judgements made 
by management in valuing the defined benefit pension liabilities including the use of key model input assumptions 
specifically the discount rate, mortality assumption and inflation level. These variables can have a material impact in 
calculating the quantum of the retirement benefit liability.
Refer to Note 1 for the Group’s policy on defined benefit plans, Note 24 for the financial disclosure including the key 
estimates and assumptions used in the defined benefit pension plan valuation and the significant issues section of the 
Audit Committee Report.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We used our internal actuarial experts to assess the key assumptions applied in determining the pension obligations 
for the five main pension schemes (three in the UK, one in Germany and one in the US), and determined whether 
the key assumptions are reasonable. Testing covered 97 . 1% of defined benefit pension liabilities. For each of the five 
schemes, we challenged management’s key assumptions by reference to illustrative benchmark rates, sensitising any 
difference between management’s rates and the illustrative benchmark rates. Additionally we benchmarked the key 
assumptions against other listed companies to check for any outliers in the data used.
Key observations From the work performed above we are satisfied that the key assumptions applied in respect of the valuation of the 
schemes’ assets and liabilities are appropriate.
Financial Statements
116 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report continued Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the Financial Statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:
Group Financial Statements Parent Company Financial Statements
Materiality £9.8m (2016: £7 .8m) £3.4m (2016: £3.5m)
Basis for determining materiality 5% of statutory profit before tax (PBT) for both 
2017 and 2016.
Capped at component materiality being 40% 
(2016: 45%) of Group materiality 
Rationale for the benchmark 
applied
Statutory profit before tax was used as the 
benchmark for determining materiality as this 
is considered to be a key benchmark used 
by investors.  
In determining our final materiality based on our 
professional judgement we have considered net 
assets as the appropriate measure given the Parent 
Company is primarily a holding company for the 
Group. We then capped materiality at component 
materiality for the Group.
Group materiality
£9.8m
PBT £192.5m
Component 
materiality range
£2.9m to £3.9m
Audit Committee 
reporting threshold
£0.49m
Proﬁt before tax (PBT)
Group materiality
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £490,000 (2016: £390,000) for 
the Group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 28 
(2016: 21) components. 25 (2016: 20) of these were subject to a full audit, whilst the remaining 3 components (2016: 1 component) were subject to 
specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality 
of the Group’s operations at those components. These components represent the principal business units and account for 86% (2016: 90%) of 
the Group’s total assets, 70% (2016: 69%) of the Group’s revenue and 78% (2016: 71%) of the Group’s profit before tax. They were also selected 
to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the 
components was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from 
£2.9m to 3.9m (2016: £2.7m to £3.9m).
At the Parent Company level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit 
of specified account balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group audit team 
visits each of the key components where the Group audit scope was focused at least once every three years and the most significant of them at 
least once a year. In the current year and prior year we visited the UK, USA, China and Korean components. In the current year we also visited the 
Chromalox US and Gestra Germany businesses and in the prior year we visited Italy and France. As part of these visits, meetings were held with 
both component management and the component audit team. For all components, we held close calls after they reported into us and as deemed 
necessary, conducted share screen reviews.

Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in 
the Annual Report including the Strategic Report and the Governance Report, but does not include the Financial 
Statements and our Auditor’s Report thereon.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the Financial Statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of 
the other information include where we conclude that:
 – Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 – Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
 – Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.

Financial Statements

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
for the year ended 31st December 2017 1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that have been 
adopted by the European Union (EU).
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the Directors to apply IAS 1 and make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
that are not apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experiences and other factors 
that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an  
on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised  
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s  
accounting policies 
The critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which 
are dealt with separately below) that the Directors have made in the 
process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial 
Statements are outlined below:
(i) Post-retirement benefits
  The Group's defined benefit obligation is discounted at a rate set 
by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgement is required 
when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population 
from which the yield curve is derived. The most significant criteria 
considered for the selection of bonds include the issue size of 
the corporate bonds, quality of the bonds and the identification 
of outliers which are excluded. The assumptions selected and 
associated sensitivity analysis are disclosed in Note 24 on pages 
146 to 149.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year, are outlined below.
( i )  P o s t -re t i re m e n t b e n e f i t s
  The Group's defined benefit obligation is assessed by selecting 
key assumptions. The selection of mortality rates, inflation and pay 
increases are key sources of estimation uncertainty which could lead 
to material adjustment in the defined benefit obligation within the 
next financial year. These assumptions are set with close reference 
to market conditions. The assumptions selected and associated 
sensitivity analysis are disclosed in Note 24 on pages 146 to 149.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a diverse 
range of products and customers across wide geographic areas and 
industries. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is 
well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Further information on the Group’s business activities, performance 
and position, together with the financial position of the Group, its capital 
structure and cash flow are included in the Strategic Report from 
the inside front cover to page 61. In addition, Note 28 to the Financial 
Statements discloses details of the Group’s financial risk management 
and credit facilities.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency, rounded to the 
nearest one hundred thousand.
The Group's Income Statement includes an adjustment column where 
certain items are included. These items include the amortisation 
and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition 
and disposal-related costs, reversal of acquisition-related fair value 
adjustments to inventory, foreign exchange gains and losses on 
borrowings, and significant restructuring costs. An analysis of these 
items is detailed in Note 2. 
New, revised and amendments to IFRS
In the current year the Group has applied a number of amendments to 
IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
Their adoption has not had a material impact on the disclosures or 
on the amounts reported in these Financial Statements. The following 
amendments were applied:
 − IAS 7: Statement of Cash Flows - Disclosure Initiative
 − IAS 12: Income Taxes - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for 
Unrealised Losses
 − Annual improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 Cycle including IFRS 12 
Relating to Interests in Subsidiaries and Associates Held for Sale 
Otherwise the accounting policies set out below have been 
applied consistently to both years presented in these Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
The following IFRS standards, whilst not adopted in these financial 
statements are effective from 1st January 2018 and will be adopted by 
the Group from that date:
 − IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 establishes a single model for recognising revenue arising from 
contracts with customers and supersedes IAS 18: Revenue and IAS 1 1: 
Construction Contracts. IFRS 15 introduces principles to allocate the 
transaction price to performance obligations and recognise revenue 
as those performance obligations are satisfied. It applies to accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018. 
An on-going assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 on the Group is 
being performed. Based on the current results of the assessment, the 
adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to have a material impact on the 
profits of the Group in future periods. 
 − IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1st 
January 2018. IFRS 9 applies to financial assets and financial liabilities 
and replaces the multiple classification and measurement models in IAS 
39 with a single model for financial assets and liabilities.
An assessment has been completed of the impact IFRS 9 will have on 
the Group. Based on the results of the assessment the adoption of IFRS 
9 is not expected to have a material impact on the Financial Statements 
of the Group in future periods. This includes an assessment of the 
Group's hedging relationships where it has been determined that the 
relationships will qualify as continuing hedging relationships under IFRS 9. 
The Group expects to apply the simplified approach to recognise 
lifetime expected credit losses for its trade receivables and contract 
assets as required or permitted by IFRS 9. 
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the Group 
has not applied the following new and revised IFRS that have been 
issued but are not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU): 
 − IFRS 16: Leases
 − IFRS 2: (amendments) Classification and Measurement of Share-
based Payment Transactions
 − IFRS 17: Insurance Contacts

The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed 
above will have a material impact on the Financial Statements of the 
Group in future periods, except as noted below in relation to IFRS 16.
An assessment of the impact of IFRS 16 (effective from 1st January 
2019) has not yet been performed but it may have a material impact on 
the reported assets and liabilities of the Group but we do not expect 
it to have a material impact on the net assets, Income Statement and 
cash flows of the Group. Furthermore, extensive disclosures will be 
required by IFRS 16.
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases 
or finance leases and, instead, introduces a single model of accounting 
for leases. Under IFRS 16 a lessee is required to recognise assets 
and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless 
the underlying asset is of a low value. The new standard also requires 
depreciation of the asset to be recognised separately from the interest 
expense on the lease liability. At 31st December 2017 the Group had 
total operating lease obligations of £30.8m and an operating lease 
charge of £1 1.0m for the year ended 31st December 2017 . Beyond the 
information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable 
estimate of the effect of this standard until a detailed assessment has 
been completed.
Basis of accounting
(i) Subsidiaries 
  The Group Financial Statements include the results of the Company 
and all its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiaries are entities 
controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the 
power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are 
exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The Financial 
Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements from the date that control commences until 
the date that control ceases.
(ii) Associates 
  Associates are those entities for which the Group has significant 
influence, but not control, over the financial and operating 
policies. The Financial Statements include the Group’s share of 
the total recognised income and expense of Associates on an 
equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence 
commenced until the date that significant influence ceases. 
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
  Intra Group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or 
income and expenses arising from intra Group transactions, 
are eliminated in preparing the Group Financial Statements. 
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with Associates are 
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. 
Foreign currency
(i) On consolidation 
  The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into 
sterling at exchange rates ruling at the date of the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position (closing rate). The revenues, 
expenses and cash flows of foreign operations are translated 
into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the year. 
Where the Notes to the Group Financial Statements include tables 
reconciling movements between opening and closing balances, 
opening and closing assets and liabilities are translated at closing 
rates and revenue, expenses and all other movements translated 
at average rates, with the exchange differences arising being 
disclosed separately. 
  Exchange differences arising from the translation of the assets and 
liabilities of foreign operations are taken to a separate translation 
reserve within equity. They are recycled and recognised in the 
Income Statement upon disposal of the operation. In respect 
of all foreign operations, any differences that have arisen before 
1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are not presented 
as a separate component of equity.
(ii) Foreign currency transactions 
  Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective 
currencies of the Group entities at the foreign exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities at the date 
of the Statement of Financial Position denominated in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at 
the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income 
Statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at 
fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates 
fair value was determined. 
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the 
variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecasted transaction, the 
effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument 
is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the 
cash flow hedges reserve. The associated gain or loss is removed from 
equity and recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which 
the transaction to which it relates occurs.
Net investment hedge accounting
The Group uses foreign currency denominated borrowings as a hedge 
against translation exposure on the Group's net investment in overseas 
companies. Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging, the variability 
in the net assets of such companies caused by changes in exchange 
rates and the changes in value of the borrowings are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated 
in the translation reserve. The ineffective part of any changes in value 
caused by changes in exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured 
at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised 
cost of the financial liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of 
the financial lability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net 
carrying amount on initial recognition.
Financial Statements
126 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed 
cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued 
to fair value prior to 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are 
measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at 
the date of that revaluation.
Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line 
basis at rates which write down the value of assets to their residual 
values over their estimated useful lives. Land is not depreciated. 
The principal rates are as follows:
Freehold buildings 1.5-3.3%
Plant and machinery 10-12.5%
Office furniture and fittings 10%
Office equipment 12.5-33.3%
Motor vehicles 20%
Tooling and patterns 10%
The depreciation rates are reassessed annually.
Business Combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using 
the acquisition method of accounting. Identified assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed are measured at their respective acquisition date fair 
values. The excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the 
fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. The operating 
results of the acquired business are reflected in the Group's Financial 
Statements after the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill 
  Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the 
acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised 
but is tested annually for impairment (see Note 14 for more detail). 
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1st January 2004, goodwill 
is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents 
the amount recorded under previous UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (GAAP). 
(ii) R&D 
  Expenditure on R&D is charged to the Income Statement in the 
period in which it is incurred except that development expenditure 
is capitalised where the development costs relate to new or 
substantially improved products that are subsequently to be 
released for sale and will generate future economic benefits. 
The expenditure capitalised includes staff costs and related 
expenses. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation (see below) and any impairment losses. 
(iii) Other intangible assets 
  Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and 
any impairment losses. Annual impairment tests are performed on 
acquired intangible assets by comparing the carrying value with the 
recoverable amount, being the higher of the fair value less cost to 
sell and value in use, discounted at an appropriate discount rate, 
of future cash flows in respect of intangible assets for the relevant 
cash generating unit. More detail is given in Note 14.
(iv) Amortisation 
  Amortisation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other 
than goodwill, from the date they are available for use. Goodwill is 
tested for impairment annually. The principal amortisation rates are 
as follows: 
Capitalised development costs 20%
ERP systems and software 12-20%
Brand names and trademarks 5-33%
Manufacturing designs and core technology 6-50%
Non-compete undertakings 20-50%
Customer relationships 6-33%
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring 
the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in 
bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of 
manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an 
appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating 
capacity. Cost also includes transfers from equity of any gain or 
loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases 
of inventories.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits 
with an original maturity usually of three months or less. Bank overdrafts 
that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows.
Going concern
The statement on the going concern assumption is included within the 
Governance Report on page 1 1 1.
Alternative performance measures
The Group reports under International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and also uses alternative performance measures where the 
Board believe that they help to effectively monitor the performance 
of the Group, users of the Financial Statements might find them 
informative and an aid to comparison with our peers. One example 
is adjusted operating profit which excludes certain items such as 
the amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related intangible 
assets, impairment of goodwill, acquisition and disposal-related costs, 
reversal of acquisition related fair value adjustments to inventory, 
significant restructuring costs, and foreign exchange gains or losses 
on borrowings. Certain alternative performance measures also form a 
meaningful element of Executive Directors' annual bonuses. A definition 
of the alternative performance measures included in the Annual Report 
and a reconciliation to the closest IFRS equivalent are disclosed in 
Note 2. 
Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans 
  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans 
are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.
(ii) Defined benefit plans 
  The costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes 
are calculated in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries 
and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be 
derived from the employees’ services. The Group’s net obligation 
or surplus in respect of defined benefit pensions is calculated 
separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit 
that employees have earned in return for their service in the current 
and prior periods. Past service costs are recognised straight away. 
Financial Statements
 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 127
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Corporate Information 1 Accounting policies continued
  That benefit is discounted at rates reflecting the yields on AA credit 
rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the 
terms of the Group’s obligations to determine its present value. 
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the Statement 
of Financial Position date. Actuarial gains and losses, differences 
between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of 
changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income in the year they arise. Any scheme 
surplus (to the extent it is considered recoverable under the 
provisions of IFRIC 14) or deficit is recognised in full in the Statement 
of Financial Position. 
  The cost of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in 
a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread 
over the period which benefit is expected to be derived from 
the employees’ services, in accordance with the advice of 
qualified actuaries. 
(iii) Employee share plans 
  Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under 
share option and share award schemes. The fair value of these 
options and awards at their date of grant is charged to the Income 
Statement over the relevant vesting periods with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect 
expected and actual levels of options and share awards vesting. 
(iv) Long-term share incentive plans 
  The fair value of awards is measured at the date of grant 
and the cost spread over the vesting period. The amount 
recognised as an expense is not adjusted to reflect market based 
performance conditions, but is adjusted for non-market based 
performance conditions. 
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business by subsidiary companies to 
external customers, net of discounts, Value Added Tax (VAT) and other 
sales-related taxes. Revenue is reduced for customer returns, rebates 
and other similar allowances.
Revenue from the sale of goods, which represent the significant majority 
of Group revenue, is recognised in the Income Statement when:
 − the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the buyer in accordance with the contracted terms of sale;
 − the amount of revenue and costs can be measured reliably;
 − the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement nor 
effective control over the goods; and
 − it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group.
This is typically on delivery or dispatch of the products.
Revenue from projects and service contracts is recognised by 
reference to the stage of completion of the contract based on the fair 
value of goods and services provided at the date of the Statement of 
Financial Position. Judgements can be required to assess the stage 
of completion, although in the vast majority of projects the position is 
relatively easy to identify. The stage of completion of the contract is 
determined as follows:
 − installation fees are recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of the installation, determined as the proportion of the 
total time expected to install that has elapsed at the date of the 
Statement of Financial Position;
 − service fees included in the price of products sold are valued by 
taking a proportion of the sales price (based on the cost of providing 
the servicing) and only recognised in revenue when the service is 
provided; and
 − revenue from time and material contracts is recognised at 
the contractual rates as labour hours are delivered and direct 
expenses incurred.
As soon as the outcome of a project or service contract can be 
estimated reliably, revenue and expenses are recognised in the Income 
Statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the project or 
service contract. Where it is probable that total contract costs exceed 
total contract revenue, the expected loss on a project or service is 
recognised immediately.
Leases
(i) Operating leases 
  Payments made under operating leases are charged to the Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
(ii) Finance leases 
  Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset 
had been purchased outright. Assets acquired under finance leases 
are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital and interest 
elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in 
creditors. Depreciation is charged on a consistent basis with similar 
owned assets or over the lease term if shorter. The interest element 
of the lease payment is charged to the Income Statement on a 
basis which produces a consistent rate of charge over the period of 
the liability.
Taxation
The tax charge comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax 
expense is recognised in the Income Statement unless it relates to 
items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, 
when it is also recognised in equity or other comprehensive income 
respectively. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the profit 
for the year and any adjustments in respect of previous years using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising between 
the tax base of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the 
Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax is provided using rates 
of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the date 
of the Statement of Financial Position or the date that the temporary 
differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Share capital and repurchased shares
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount 
of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is 
recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are 
classified as treasury shares or placed in an Employee Benefit Trust and 
are presented as a deduction from total equity.
Share-based benefits granted to subsidiary employees
The Company grants share-based benefits over its own 
Ordinary shares directly to employees of subsidiary companies. 
These employees provide services to the subsidiary companies. 
The cost of these shares is not recharged and therefore the fair value 
of the share options granted is recognised as a capital contribution 
to the subsidiary companies. This is accounted for as an increase 
in investments with a corresponding increase in a non-distributable 
component of equity.

Organic measures
As we are a multi-national group of companies, which trade in a large number of foreign currencies and regularly acquire and sometimes dispose 
of companies, we also refer to organic performance measures throughout the Annual Report. These strip out the effects of the movement of 
foreign currency exchange rates and of acquisitions and disposals. The Board believes that this allows users of the accounts to gain a further 
understanding of how the Group has performed.
Exchange translation movements are assessed by re-translating prior period reported values to current period exchange rates. 
Exchange transaction impacts on operating profit are assessed on the basis of transactions being at constant currency between years. 
Any acquisitions and disposals that occurred in either the current period or prior period are excluded from the results of both the prior and current 
period at current period exchange rates.
A reconciliation of the movement in revenue and adjusted operating profit compared to the prior period is given below.

The Group’s tax charge in future years is likely to be affected by the proportion of profits arising and the effective tax rates in the various territories in 
which the Group operates.
The blended tax rate is calculated using each subsidiary company's headline tax rate as a proportion of its respective profit.
The Group's tax charge includes a credit of £32. 1m in relation to certain items as detailed in Notes 2 and 3. Excluding these adjustments the tax on 
profit and the effective tax rate are £66.7m and 29. 1% respectively. 
A reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective from 1st January 2018, was enacted as part of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
on 22nd December 2017 . As a result the US deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2017 have been calculated based on the future 
blended federal and state tax rate, with a federal tax element of 21%. This results in a deferred tax credit to the Consolidated Income Statement of 
£24.4m; this is included within the overall credit of £32. 1m.
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% on 1st April 2017 . A further reduction to 17% (effective from 1st April 2020) was substantially 
enacted on 15th September 2016. This will reduce the Group's future current tax charge accordingly.
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2017 have been calculated based upon rates of 19% and 17% in respect of deferred 
tax expected to reverse before 1st April 2020 and after this date respectively.
The Group is aware of the on-going review by the European Commission into the UK Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules that exempts certain 
transactions by multinational groups from a full CFC apportionment. Due to the uncertainty of the outcome of this review no provision for any UK 
corporation tax has been recognised at the date of the Statement of Financial Position, however the potential contingent liability is estimated at 
approximately £4.5m.
No UK tax (after double tax relief for underlying tax) is expected to be payable on the future remittance of the retained earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries. 
The effective tax rate is calculated as a percentage of profit before tax and share of profit of Associate.

Impairment
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36: Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units, or groups of 
cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill as analysed in the 
table below.

Aflex 27.1 27.1
Other cash-generating units 58.2 61.4
Total goodwill 351.3 88.5
The goodwill balance has been tested for annual impairment on the following basis:
 − the carrying values of goodwill have been assessed by reference to value in use. These have been estimated using cash flows based on forecast 
information for the next financial year and in the case of recent acquisitions on detailed five-year forecasts. This information has been approved 
by the Board; 
 − the key assumptions on which the impairment tests are based are the discount and growth rates and the forecast cash flows;
 − pre-tax discount rates range from 10-16% (2016: 1 1-17%);
 − short-term growth rates vary between 2-8% depending on detailed forecasts (2016: 2-26%). The short-term is defined as not more than five 
years; and
 − long-term growth rates are set using IMF forecasts and vary between 0.8–5.0% (2016: 0.8-5.0%).
As a result of this exercise an impairment of £3.2m was recognised in respect of Spirax Sarco Colombia. No other impairments were identified. 
The principal value in use assumptions for the three largest goodwill balances were as follows:
Cash-generating unit
Pre-tax 
discount rate
Short-term 
growth rate
Long-term 
growth rate
Chromalox 10.8% 3.1-6.2% 2.5%
Gestra 11.4% 0.6-5.6% 2.5%
Aflex 10.3% 8.0% 2.5%
Where applicable sensitivity analysis shows that if pre-tax discount rates are raised by 1% and short and long term growth rates are lowered by 1% 
no impairment would arise. The 1% sensitivity threshold is considered a reasonable estimate of possible change.

At the date of the Statement of Financial Position, the Group has deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits 
of £8.4m (2016: £2.7m) available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £2.7m (2016: £1.5m). 
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £5.7m (2016: £1.2m) as it is not considered probable that there will be future 
taxable profits available against which the relevant deduction can be offset. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £nil (2016: £0. 1m) that 
will expire by 2023. Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax of £5.6m recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (page 122) comprises £5. 1m associated with the 
remeasurement of defined benefit obligations and £0.5m relating to exchange movements. 
A reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective from 1st January 2018, was enacted as part of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
on 22nd December 2017 . As a result, the US deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2017 have been calculated based on the future 
blended federal and state tax rate, with a federal tax element of 21%. This results in a reduction in the net deferred tax liability of £21.9m of which 
£24.4m has been recognised as a credit in the income statement and £2.5m recognised as a debit in OCI.

 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 145
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Corporate Information 24 Employee benefits
Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements, which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices 
within the countries concerned. These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements
The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the Group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer contribution 
and resulting Income Statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employee’s pay. Contributions made to defined contribution 
schemes and charged to the Income Statement totalled £10.9m (2016: £9.3m). In the UK, following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to 
new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit arrangements
The Group operates several funded defined benefit retirement schemes where the benefits are based on employees’ length of service. Whilst the 
Group’s primary schemes are in the UK, it also operates other material benefit schemes in the USA as well as less material schemes elsewhere. 
In funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar structures in the 
countries concerned.
UK defined benefit arrangements
The defined benefit schemes in the UK account for approximately half of the Group’s net liability for defined retirement benefit schemes.  
Spirax-Sarco operates three UK schemes: the Spirax-Sarco Employees Pension Fund, the Spirax-Sarco Executives' Retirement Benefits Scheme 
and the Watson-Marlow Pension Fund. These are all final salary pension schemes. The UK schemes are closed to new members but are open to 
future accrual. There is a mix of different inflation-dependent pension increases (in payment and deferment) which vary from member to member 
according to their membership history and which scheme they are a member of. All three schemes have been set up under UK law and are 
governed by a Trustee committee, which is responsible for the scheme’s investments, administration and management. A funding valuation is 
carried out for the Trustees of each scheme every three years by an independent firm of actuaries. Depending on the outcome of that valuation 
a schedule of future contributions is negotiated with Spirax Sarco. Further information on the contribution commitments is shown in the Financial 
Review on pages 50 to 51.
US defined benefit schemes
The Group operates a pension scheme in the USA which is closed to new entrants but open to future accrual and defines the pension in terms 
of the highest average pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement. No pension increases (in payment and deferment) are 
offered by this scheme. It also operates a post-retirement medical plan in the USA, which is unfunded, as is typical for these plans.
Principal risks
The pension schemes create a number of risk exposures. Annual increase in benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, dependent 
on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels (including the impact of inflation on future salary 
increases) and the actual longevity of the membership. Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other factors including member 
decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms. A key risk is that additional contributions are 
required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension schemes. All pension schemes are 
regulated by the relevant jurisdictions. These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject to change and may impact 
on the Group’s pension schemes. The IAS 19 liability measurement known as Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) and the Service Cost are sensitive 
to the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the expected benefit payments, 
the most important of these assumptions being the future inflation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life expectation. 
The DBO and Service Cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefit 
payments. The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. Investment strategies are set with funding rather than IAS 
19 considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specific hedge against the IAS 19 measurement of DBO. As a result the difference between 
the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 DBO may be volatile.
Sensitivity analysis to changes in discount rate and inflation are included on page 149.

Share option scheme
The Group operates equity settled share option schemes for employees, although no grants have been made since 201 1 because awards have been 
made using the Group's Performance Share Plan instead. Awards were determined by the Remuneration Committee whose objective was to align 
the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value. Options are subject to performance 
conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant. For options granted before 2007 
the performance condition is an increase in earnings per share (EPS) of more than 9% greater than the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over a 
consecutive three-year period between grant and ten years from date of grant. From 2007 the performance condition needs to be met over the three-
year period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant. If the condition is not met at the end of the three-year period the option will lapse.
The share options granted have been measured using the Present Economic Value (PEV) valuation methodology. The relevant disclosures in 
respect of the share option scheme grants are set out on the following page.

Performance Share Plan
Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to Executive Directors and other senior managers and take the form of contingent rights to 
acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target. To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an 
option over shares. The performance criteria is split into two separate parts. For awards granted from 2014 40% of the award is based on a TSR 
measure where the performance target is based on the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of other companies included 
in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three-year performance period where awards will vest on a sliding scale. All shares 
within an award will vest if the Company’s TSR is at or above the upper quartile. 25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares 
that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Company’s TSR falls between the median and the 
upper quartile. No shares will vest if the Company’s TSR is below the median. For awards granted from 2014 the second part, amounting to 60% 
of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three-year performance period. 25% will vest if the compound 
growth in EPS is equal to the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds 
the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 9%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates. Awards made prior to 2014 
had a weighting of 60% TSR and 40% EPS. From 2015 a change has been made to measure EPS on a point to point basis over the three-year 
performance period. From 2016 EPS growth is measured against the growth of global industrial production (IP), as published by CHR Economics 
with thresholds of plus 2% and plus 8%.
Shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan have been valued using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology. The relevant

Employee Share Ownership Plan
UK employees are eligible to participate in the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP). The aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased 
shareholding in the Company by all UK employees and so there are no performance conditions. Employees are invited to join the ESOP when an 
offer is made each year. Individuals save for 12 months during the accumulation period and subscribe for shares at the lower of the price at the 
beginning and the end of the accumulation period under HMRC rules. The Company provides a matching share for each share purchased by 
the individual.
Shares issued under the ESOP have been measured using the Present Economic Value (PEV) valuation methodology. The relevant disclosures in 
respect of the Employee Share Ownership Plans are set out below.

Chromalox debt repaid on the acquisition date, £10.3m of acquisition costs less cash acquired of £36.0m.
2.   The acquisition of 100% of Chromalox Inc. and associated businesses was completed on 3rd July 2017 . The acquisition method of accounting 
has been used. Consideration of £338.6m was paid on completion. Separately identified intangibles are recorded as part of the provisional fair 
value adjustment. The acquired intangibles relate to brand names and trademarks, manufacturing designs and core technology and customer 
relationships. The goodwill recognised represents the skilled workforce acquired and the opportunity to achieve synergies from being part of a 
larger Group. Goodwill arising is not expected to be tax deductible. The acquisition has generated £75m of revenue and £14m of adjusted pre-
tax profit since acquisition. Had the acquisition been made on the 1st January 2017 , the Chromalox revenue and adjusted pre-tax profit would 
have been approximately £146m and £26m respectively. Chromalox, which has its headquarters in Pittsburgh, USA, is a well-established 
provider of thermal energy management solutions for industrial process heating and temperature management. Chromalox is highly 
complementary to our Steam Specialties business with the decision between using steam or electricity as a heating medium being driven by 
differing needs of the application or customer circumstances.

being part of a larger Group. The acquisition has generated £51m of revenue and £8m of adjusted pre-tax profit since acquisition. Had the 
acquisition been made on the 1st January 2017 , the Gestra revenue and adjusted pre-tax profit would have been approximately £77m and 
£1 1m respectively. Gestra, which has its headquarters in Bremen, Germany, is a technology leader in advanced industrial boiler control systems 
and specialises in the design and production of valves and control systems for steam and fluid process control. Gestra is highly complementary 
to the Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties business and will enhance and accelerate the implementation of Spirax Sarco's strategy for growth, as a 
result of its well-developed capabilities in a wide range of industries and applications.
4.   During the period the fair value of the assets acquired as part of the acquisition of the process control valve manufacturer, Hiter Industria e 
Comercio de Controles Termo-Hidraulicos Ltda (Hiter) on 1st July 2016 were reassessed. The outcome of the reassessment was an increase 
to goodwill of £1. 1 million. This is not included in the table above but is shown as an addition to goodwill in Note 14 on page 139.
 5.   £10.3 million of acquisition costs were incurred during the year (2016: £0.5m).

1.   The acquisition of the assets of the process control valve manufacturer Hiter Industria e Comercio de Controles Termo-Hidraulicos Ltda (Hiter) 
was completed on 1st July 2016. The acquisition method of accounting has been used. Consideration of £3.9m was paid on completion. 
Separately identified intangibles are recorded as part of the fair value adjustment. The goodwill recognised represents the opportunity to 
achieve synergies from being part of the Group and to sell to a wider customer base. Goodwill arising is not expected to be tax deductible. 
During 2016, Hiter generated £0.7m of revenue and a small pre-tax loss post-acquisition. Had the acquisition been made on 1st January 2016, 
the revenue and pre-tax profit for 2016 would have been approximately double the figures disclosed above.
2.  The acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Aflex Hose Limited and its subsidiary Aflex Hose USA LLC was completed on 30th November 
2016. The acquisition method of accounting has been used. Consideration of £62.5m was paid on completion. Separately identified intangibles 
are recorded as part of the provisional fair value adjustment. The goodwill recognised represents the skilled workforce acquired and the 
opportunity to achieve synergies from being part of a larger Group. Goodwill arising is not expected to be tax deductible. During 2016, the 
acquisition generated £2.0m of revenue and £0.5m of pre-tax profit post-acquisition. Had the acquisition been made on 1st January 2016, the 
2016 revenue and pre-tax profit would have been approximately twelve times the figures disclosed. Aflex is highly synergistic with, and a natural 
extension to, the Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group (WMFTG) fluid path product portfolio and further strengthens WMFTG's already 
strong global presence in the Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical, Industrial, Chemical and Food & Beverage sectors. Aflex's premium PTFE-lined 
hoses complement our FlowSmart silicone hoses and WMFTG's other fluid path products, as part of our strategy to provide a complete value-
added hose and tubing range.

names and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete undertakings.
28 Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions. The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise loans, cash and short-term 
deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial 
instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations. It is, and has been throughout the period under 
review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Credit risk
The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and its customer base is extremely varied in size and industry sector. 
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers’ credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non-collectable.
Interest rate risk
The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans, facilities and finance 
leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has operations around the world and therefore its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position can be affected significantly by 
movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro. The Group seeks to mitigate 
the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies. Such exposures arise from sales 
or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 
£1.0 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover. Forward cover is not taken out more than 
24 months in advance or for more than 90% of the next 12 months and 60% of the following 12 months’ forecast exposure.

There are no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis for which fair value is disclosed.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. Fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on discounted cash 
flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments.
Financial instruments fair value disclosure
Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 − Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
 − Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability; and
 − Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into Level 2.

Currency exposures
As explained on page 154, the Group’s objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas (in other words, its 
structural currency exposures) are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation. All gains and losses arising 
from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Transactional (or non-structural) exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position that are not denominated 
in the operating (or functional) currency of the operating unit involved. At 31st December 2017 the currency exposures in respect of the euro was 
a net monetary liability of £191.3m (2016: £3.4m net monetary asset) and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary liability of £101. 1m (2016: net 
monetary asset £16.6m).
At 31st December 2017 , the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 30% (2016: nil) for the euro, 1 1% (2016: nil) for the US dollar 1% 
(2016: 3%) for the Chinese renminbi and nil (2016: 1%) for Japanese yen.

Cash flow hedges
The Group uses forward currency contracts to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are 
designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship. At 31st December 2017 the Group had contracts outstanding to 
purchase £1.2m (2016: £nil), and €0.5m (2016: €nil) with US dollars, £1.5m (2016: £1.0m) with Danish krone, £3.8m (2016: £8.4m) with euros, £nil 
(2016: £0.3m) with Japanese yen, £0.6m (2016: £0.2m) with Korean won, £0.2m (2016: £0. 1m) with Canadian dollars and £nil (2016: £0. 1m) with 
Czech koruna. The fair values at the end of the reporting period were an asset of £0.2m (2016: £0.2m asset). The fair value of cash flow hedges falls 
into the Level 2 category of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 7 .
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using readily available market data.
The contractual cash flows on forward currency contracts at the reporting date are shown on page 158, classified by maturity. The cash flows 
shown are on a gross basis and are not discounted.

It is anticipated that the cash flows will take place at the same time as the corresponding forward contract matures. At this time the amount 
deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit or loss. 
All forecast transactions which have been subject to hedge accounting during the year have occurred or are still expected to occur. 
A profit on derivative financial instruments of £0.2m (2016: £0.4m) was recognised in other comprehensive income during the period. 
No amount (2016: £nil) was removed from equity during the period and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of a non-financial asset 
or non-financial liability whose acquisition or incurrence was a hedged highly probable forecast transaction.
As at 31st December 2017 no ineffectiveness has been recognised in profit or loss arising from hedging foreign currency transactions. 
Borrowing facilities
The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it. The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which 
all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows:

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December 2017 are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they 
were at short-term rates of interest. Fair values have been assessed as follows:
 − Derivatives  
Forward exchange contracts are marked to market by discounting the future contracted cash flows using readily available market data.
 − Interest-bearing loans and borrowings  
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
 − Finance lease liabilities  
The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements. 
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates.
 − Trade and other receivables/payables  
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.

Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. Over the 
longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings. At the year end 
borrowings totalled £525.7m (2016: £91.8m). At 31st December 2017 , it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates 
would decrease the Group’s profit after tax and equity by approximately £1.5m (2016: £nil).
For the year ended 31st December 2017 , it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation to the 
Group’s profit and trading flows would have increased the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £1.8m (2016: £1.5m). The effect can be very 
different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements. Forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.

trade receivables there are no financial assets that are past their due date at 31st December 2017 .

Financial Statements
Company Statement of Changes in Equity
for the year ended 31st December 2017
162 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 1 Accounting policies
The separate Financial Statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company meets the definition 
of a qualifying entity under FRS 100. Accordingly the Company has adopted FRS 101: Reduced Disclosure Framework. As permitted by FRS 
101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial 
instruments and the presentation of a Cash Flow Statement. Where relevant, equivalent disclosures have been given in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own Income Statement. As permitted 
by the audit fee disclosure regulations, disclosure of non-audit fees information is not included in respect of the Company.
The Company’s accounting policies are the same as those set out in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, except as noted below.
The Company's critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty relate to the selection of key assumptions for assessing post-
retirement defined benefit obligations and to the judgements relating to the need for impairment to the carrying value of investments. The defined 
benefit obligation judgement is consistent with the disclosures in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Loans to or from other Group undertakings and all other payables and receivables are initially recorded at fair value, which is generally the proceeds 
received. They are then subsequently carried at amortised cost.
