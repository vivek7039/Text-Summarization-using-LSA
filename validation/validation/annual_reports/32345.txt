2 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 “I’ve always loved knowing how and why things work. With Babcock, I’m being given the chance to do exactly that. My PhD in Marine 
Toxicology certainly had a nuclear element to it, which comes in handy when I’m fixing a technical problem or making sure that people 
stay safe. A typical day involves writing reports – just as it did when I was a research scientist – but it also includes talking to colleagues 
inside Babcock and to clients about safety or technical queries that might have been raised. I’m also likely to get my overalls on to go and 
examine a submarine.
As chair of Plymouth Women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), I’m very involved with sending our STEM 
Ambassadors to events and schools. Teaching was an enjoyable and integral part of my role as a postdoctoral research scientist. My STEM 
work allows me to continue teaching people about why science is so important to society and the great careers that women can build in 
the sector.”

Babcock at a glance
Sector specialists with engineering 
embedded in our DNA
Deep sector expertise
In February 2017, we announced that 
we were going to realign the business 
around the four core sectors in which 
we operate. Grouping our business into 
Marine, Land, Aviation and Cavendish 
Nuclear brings us even closer to our 
customers and markets, allows our 
teams in each sector to really focus on 
the capabilities we offer and makes 
the Group easier to understand for all 
our stakeholders. Most importantly, 
it provides us with a better platform 
for future growth, both in the UK and 
globally. We are still the same company, 
doing the same things, but aligning to 
sectors will help us do it better.
The realignment will help us achieve 
our growth ambitions. Supported by 
technology and technical training, 
it enables easier identification 
and development of international 
opportunities through Global Growth.
Each sector has a strong base of both 
defence and civil customers, with 
operations of scale in the UK and 
internationally and importantly all 
four have growth opportunities across 
the globe.
Furthermore, each sector is underpinned 
by deep technical knowledge and 
expertise and is already demonstrating 
a willingness to embrace Babcock’s 
transformational change and 
performance improvement models. 
Through infrastructure, assets, 
technology or regulation, all four 
sectors are characterised by high 
barriers to entry. Each of our sectors 
is now customer‑facing and shares deep 
sector technical knowledge, experience 
and understanding of its industry. 
Moving to a sector‑based reporting 
structure that is more closely aligned 
with our markets serves to provide 
clarity and focus. This resonates with 
our employees, our customers and our 
shareholders, creating a stronger base 
from which to build future growth.

Our sectors
Historically we have consistently built up our expertise and commercial positions across 
four key sectors: marine, land, aviation and nuclear. The realignment into our four new 
sectors provides employees, customers and investors with a clearer, more aligned 
Babcock and an improved platform for growth.
Our capabilities
Over the years we have continued to 
develop our capabilities and specialist 
skills in our four sectors, each of which 
provides good opportunities for growth 
in both the UK and, increasingly, 
internationally. The realignment will 
enable us to effectively leverage our 
capabilities and share expertise across 
the Group through four key enablers:
Marine
Delivers a wide array of complex through‑life 
marine engineering services ranging from 
supporting UK and international naval 
fleets, commercial marine, engineering 
consultancy, weapons handling, equipment 
support, intelligence and cyber‑security and 
technical training, all delivered through unique 
owned and managed infrastructure to defence 
and civil customers across the globe.
Technology
We have deep sector‑specific technical 
expertise with decades of experience; we 
understand risk and resilience and are able 
to deliver availability with innovation. We 
are equipment‑agnostic which enables 
us to work with any OEM to specify and 
support its products. We have the ability 
to identify and integrate technology into 
our through‑life support.
Training
Technical training is an integral part of our 
engineering offering. It is a fundamental and 
ongoing requirement and a core part of our 
expertise. Driving technical training across 
the Group allows us to share innovation and 
successful methodology across sectors to 
ensure our customers make the best use 
of their critical resources.
Infrastructure
We have experience of operating and 
managing complex and critical infrastructure 
assets in highly regulated environments, from 
unique owned marine facilities, critical 
air and land fleets, nuclear licensed sites, 
naval, air and army bases, technical training 
sites to customer‑owned aircraft.
Global Growth
A fundamental driver of Babcock’s realignment 
is the aim to grow our international 
business. This focus will allow us to recognise 
international opportunities and support all 
four sector teams to sell and deliver innovative 
services and transformation models to targeted 
markets and customers. We will:
• drive local country business development to 
identify and build a pipeline of opportunities
• invest in skills and frameworks needed to 
capture international opportunities
• bring together local and UK sector teams to 
support both bidding and delivery
• provide skilled people to drive, facilitate and 
establish new business across the Group.
Aviation
Delivers a wide array of critical engineering 
services to defence and civil customers, 
ranging from technical training of advanced 
fixed and rotary wing pilots, engineering, 
equipment support and maintenance, airbase 
management and logistics, to the operation 
of owned and customer‑owned aviation 
fleets delivering emergency and offshore 
services across the globe.
Land
Provides large‑scale critical fleet management 
and training for customer‑owned defence, 
emergency services, global airport and 
commercial vehicle fleets – comprising 
around 80,000 vehicles – while also providing 
engineering services and technical training for 
customers worldwide.
Cavendish Nuclear
Delivers complex nuclear engineering on major 
nuclear decommissioning programmes and 
projects across the UK and nuclear engineering 
services in training, operation support, 
newbuild programme management, design 
and installation and critical safety to both 
public and private customers. In the UK and, 
increasingly, internationally.

17 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chairman’s review
Aligning our business and  
supporting our people
our business to both internal and 
external stakeholders and provides 
a clear roadmap of growth for our 
leadership team.
The realignment also means some new 
members of the Executive Committee. 
The elevation of Cavendish Nuclear as 
a separate reporting sector means that 
Simon Bowen, CEO Cavendish Nuclear, 
joins the Committee, as does Jon Hall, 
Managing Director, Technology, reflecting 
our commitment to drive technology 
across the Group. Also, Kate Hill joined the 
Committee in April as Group Director of 
Investor Relations and Communications. 
I am pleased to have their expertise 
on the Committee and look forward 
to their contributions.
Our people
In the coming year, we will continue 
to strengthen our succession planning 
activities, placing emphasis on promoting 
diversity within our leadership teams. 
These efforts will become more important 
as we continue to build our international 
We remain confident in the long‑term 
future of our business and the Board is 
therefore pleased to recommend a 9.6% 
increase in the final dividend for 2017 to 
21.65 pence per share (2016: 19.75 
pence per share). This will give a total 
dividend for the year of 28.15 pence per 
share (2016: 25.8 pence per share), an 
increase of 9.1%.
Governance and the Board
This has been a year of smooth but 
important transition for Babcock. In 
September, Archie Bethel took over 
as Chief Executive, following Peter 
Rogers’ highly successful tenure in the 
post. Archie’s early priority has been 
to ensure the business is set up for 
continued growth, and to this end he 
has already begun making improvements 
to the business. The realignment of our 
divisional structure into four industry 
sectors enables us to focus on our core 
capabilities – those areas in which we 
have deep and rare expertise and which 
have the greatest scalability. It also 
allows us to more clearly communicate 
presence, which is a focus for us over the 
next several years. To achieve the level of 
international growth we are aspiring to, 
we will need leadership which reflects 
our businesses and the environments 
in which they operate. This means a 
continued focus on recruiting, developing 
and retaining top local talent from all 
demographics and across all genders 
and ethnicities.
We will also continue to focus on 
supporting young people studying 
STEM subjects and, through our 
graduate development programmes, 
apprenticeship training and CPD, 
we aim to ensure that those already 
working in our businesses feel supported, 
appreciated, encouraged and keen 
to help us achieve our goals. Once 
again, diversity is a key component 
of our success, and we will make a 
concentrated effort to be inclusive and 
open in our approach to recruitment 
and development. As ever, I am grateful 
to the entire team at Babcock, at 
every level, and am as keen to support 
them as they have been to support the 
business. I am very sad to say that one of 
our colleagues in South Africa lost his life 
after falling from a power transmission 
line and, in January 2017, an emergency 
rescue helicopter crashed in Italy resulting 
in the loss of six people on board. Our 
thoughts are with their families and 
friends; we are committed to learning 
any lessons which come from the 
investigations into the tragedies.
Looking forward
The strength of our order book continues 
to provide clear visibility of future 
revenues and, together with the bidding 
pipeline, offers further prospects for 
growth. The Board therefore remains 
confident in the underlying performance 
of the Group and expects to achieve 
good progress this year and beyond.

Those who have been in the Company for 
many years, or plan on joining today, can 
use the being babcock principles as a 
guide to determine what’s appropriate 
behaviour within our Company. If we all 
adopt these principles each day in our 
interactions with colleagues, customers 
and others then more people will 
experience Babcock at its best, 
more often.
In this way we can ensure that everyone 
who comes into contact with Babcock 
International has a consistent and positive 
experience, helping to grow our business 
and reinforcing the reputation that we 
are ‘trusted to deliver’.
being babcock
Our culture
In an engineering services business such as Babcock International, it’s the people who really make a 
difference to how the company is perceived, both internally and externally. As individuals, we all make 
a difference to our colleagues, our customers and others who we interact with on a daily basis. If we’re 
to remain a leading engineering services company that people are proud to work for and customers 
choose to work with, then each of us must embody the eight principles set out below, day in, day out.
being babcock
8 simple principles that define 
our behaviours and actions
Build great relationships 
based on trust
This means we will:
• Be easy to do business with
• Support each other as we work 
towards a common goal
• Tell it as it is
Never compromise on health 
and safety
This means we will:
• Ensure everyone goes home safe 
every day
• Challenge unsafe behaviour
• Update and improve our 
practices, constantly
Respect people and value 
their diversity
This means we will:
• Treat everyone with courtesy 
and thoughtfulness
• Be fair with people at all times
• Listen to others’ points of view
Trust our people to deliver
This means we will:
• Give people the authority to do 
the job
• Respect colleagues’ expertise
• Create an environment where 
everyone can excel
Thrive on complexity
This means we will:
• Be a problem‑solver
• Strive to make the complex simple
• Keep a cool head in a crisis
Challenge ourselves and 
each other
This means we will:
• Inspire colleagues to do their best
• Always look for better ways of 
doing things
• Embrace opportunities to learn
Safeguard 
customers’ reputations
This means we will:
• Pull out all the stops
• Achieve positive outcomes for 
each other
• Take ownership and responsibility
Always strive to deliver
This means we will:
• Be flexible when it counts
• Be agile and responsive to 
changing needs
• Deliver to the highest standards, 
whenever and wherever
The eight principles that make up being 
babcock aren’t new. In fact, they may 
seem rather obvious. That’s because 
they already live and breathe within our 
business. They’re what we do when we’re 
working at our best and they’ve been a 
key contributor to our successful growth 
over recent years. They’ve been gathered 
from the views of employees across the 
businesses, who were asked to consider 
the essence, or DNA, of Babcock at 
its best.
being babcock pulls together these views 
into a set of principles which explain what 
our Company stands for and what it 
expects from each of us. Whilst what we 
deliver for our customers is very diverse, 
we’re all united by a common purpose 
which spans the range of services we 
provide. The services we deliver help to 
keep nations at the top of their game.
Whether we’re delivering critical 
through‑life support for armed forces, 
operating aviation emergency services 
worldwide, training the next generation 
of engineers, pilots and firefighters or 
keeping critical fleets on the move, 
together we ensure the smooth running 
of many of the critical engineering 
services on which nations depend.
19 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s review
Aligned for growth
unaffected by the changing environment. 
This is exemplified by our success in 
winning an 11‑year contract from the 
French Ministry of Defence and our 
success in becoming the first non‑US 
company to be selected to provide a 
critical component for a US nuclear 
submarine as part of the £1 billion joint 
US‑UK missile tube programme.
In the UK, we have seen the work 
programmes identified in the 2015 
Strategic Defence and Security Review 
(SDSR) begin to come to market, ensuring 
a healthy pipeline of outsourcing 
opportunities in the provision of 
equipment, through‑life equipment 
support and training over the medium 
term. In May the UK Ministry of Defence 
(MOD) awarded us all four elements of 
a £360 million technical authority and 
equipment support package for both 
the Queen Elizabeth Class (QEC) aircraft 
carriers and Type 45 Destroyers. 
In our nuclear business, the volume 
of the additional work now required 
has led to an ending of the existing 
Magnox contract in 2019. The Nuclear 
Decommissioning Authority (NDA) will 
establish a replacement structure to be 
put in place when the current contract 
ends and we believe that Cavendish 
Nuclear is well positioned to win further 
elements of decommissioning work, 
both on the Magnox estate and in the 
decommissioning of Sellafield, which the 
NDA now estimates will cost a total of 
around £88 billion.
After starting the year as Chief Operating 
Officer, working alongside Peter Rogers 
as part of our managed handover, 
I formally became Chief Executive 
on 1 September 2016. Last autumn 
I oversaw our annual five‑year strategy 
review and update for the first time since 
becoming Chief Executive. It was an 
important moment for me; I was looking 
across the Group to understand where we 
had come from and where we could be 
in five years’ time.
Over the last 15 years, we have pursued 
a highly successful strategy, moving away 
from our origins in manufacturing and 
the power industry to become one of 
the UK’s leading engineering support 
services companies. Our customers see 
us as a trusted partner that helps them 
to manage their complex assets.
We have deep skills and experience in 
the areas of technology, technical training 
and infrastructure. At the same time 
we are familiar with a broad range of 
platforms and assets, and have technical 
agreements in place with all the major 
original equipment manufacturers 
(OEMs). This combination of depth 
and breadth is what makes Babcock’s 
offering so powerful. Wherever there 
are complex assets – whether it’s an 
airbase, a submarine, a vehicle fleet or 
a nuclear plant – we can generate the 
right engineering solutions to support 
our customers.
Today, we use this combination of depth 
and breadth to manage key assets for 
many high‑profile customers in both 
Babcock continues to deliver, with sustained 
underlying growth in revenue, operating profit and 
earnings per share demonstrating the quality of our 
operations and the resilience of the Group’s business. 
Archie Bethel CBE, Chief Executive
Our proven model of providing our 
customers with better capability, reliability 
and availability of their critical assets 
whilst delivering cost savings continues 
to prove successful and we continue to 
experience demand across our markets, 
both in the UK and internationally. With 
clear barriers to entry across many of 
our businesses, we believe we are well 
positioned to continue to grow the 
business, supported by a strong underpin 
of already secured future revenue.
We believe the market dynamics remain 
positive in the sectors in which we have 
deep expertise, both in the UK and 
internationally. There continues to be 
an appetite for increased operational 
and cost efficiencies in the delivery of 
non‑discretionary critical services, and 
for working with a partner who can 
demonstrate a track record of delivery. 
This fundamental requirement of regional 
and national governments and of blue 
chip international customers, appears

the public and private sectors. For all 
of them, our goal is to provide them 
with better availability and capability 
from their critical assets. Clearly, this 
meets a need – in the last 10 years our 
revenue has grown from £500 million 
to £5 billion today.
We’ve come a long way, but I believe we 
can go even further. One of my key roles 
is to test the robustness of our strategy 
and to be sure that the organisation has 
the capacity and capability to exploit the 
growth opportunities before us. When 
I look at the size and shape the business 
could be in five years’ time I believe the 
strategy is robust and deliverable but we 
need to make a fairly simple realignment 
of our internal divisional structure to give 
us a solid base to enable us to grow as we 
believe we can over the next five years.
Where are we going?
By 2022 we aim to be by far the biggest, 
and most successful, engineering 
services business in the UK, and one 
of the best in the world. I want to see 
us deliver top‑level returns for our 
shareholders, whilst having grown our 
revenues significantly. We plan to grow 
internationally even faster than we will 
in the UK, and in five years’ time I expect 
around 30% of our revenue will come 
from outside the UK.
Expanding our international business is 
a priority. To achieve our target we will 
double the size of our global business in 
the next five years. As well as continuing 
to grow in our established markets 
in Australia and South Africa, we’ll be 
building up our business in Italy, France, 
Canada and Spain, so that they too can 
become standalone countries. In all these 
six core countries we will be seeking 
opportunities in both the defence and 
civil sectors.
This, combined with continued growth 
in the UK, will mean expanding our 
workforce. There will be new career 
opportunities opening up in the UK and 
internationally as we grow. At the same 
time we’ll also be investing in employee 
development and training.
In Technology there will be exciting 
developments too. I want Babcock to 
be seen as the benchmark for technical 
innovation within engineering services. In 
a world where the speed of technological 
change is rapidly advancing, we need to 
stay abreast of developments and utilise 
new capability to add new dimensions 
to how we support customers. We need 
to ask ourselves questions such as ‘How 
could we service a new generation of 
iFrigates?’ We have already started up this 
curve. The challenge of the next five years 
is to be ahead of the curve and develop 
technology solutions that really help 
our customers.
So, to sum up, we have a strategy where 
in five years I want to see us have a 
significant presence in six core countries, 
expand our technology capability, 
continue to grow our revenues, provide 
good returns and employ substantially 
more people. So I need to make sure 
we have the structures, systems, 
processes and people to support that 
level of complex growth, both in the 
UK and internationally.
How will we get there?
We have a winning formula of depth and 
breadth, and that’s not going to change.
We understand complicated 
infrastructure and operations and the 
regulations involved, and how we can 
make critical assets work better for 
customers. We have strong capabilities 
in design, procurement, logistics, quality 
assurance and inspection, construction 
and implementation. And we have a 
solid base of customers who confirm 
that when we say we are trusted to 
deliver, we mean it.
But the depth and breadth of our offering 
brings its own problems when we are 
trying to win new business. How can we 
bring focus and clarity to the discussion 
when the problems and solutions are 
inherently complex? We’ve made a lot 
of progress internationally in the last two 
years, but I believe that our structure was 
holding us back.
We need to have an organisational 
structure that supports our ambitious 
growth efforts – that makes it easy for 
us to put together powerful, targeted 
solutions to overcome the problems 
faced by potential customers. That is 
why from 1 April 2017 we simplified 
our organisational structure: realigning 
our divisions into four sectors supported 
by four cross‑cutting capabilities 
including a new Global Growth 
and Operations organisation.
Let me start with the realignment. 
Overseas we sell our capabilities, not our 
UK 75% Europe 9% Rest of world 16%
21 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s review continued
internal organisational structure. We need 
to remove unnecessary complexity and 
move to a customer‑facing structure so 
that people can easily understand what 
we are offering. Therefore I decided to 
realign our organisation around four 
sectors: Marine, Land, Aviation and 
Cavendish Nuclear.
Bringing our services together under 
these four sectors has many advantages.
First, it will enable us to tell a much 
simpler and clearer story to potential 
customers about the capabilities we 
are offering.
Secondly, it will bring commercial and 
military operations together in each 
sector, so that like‑minded people can 
more easily collaborate, share knowledge, 
cross‑sell and cross‑fertilise ideas.
And thirdly, each of these sectors will 
take its rightful place as a leading player 
in its marketplace. Land at £1.8 billion 
and Marine at £1.9 billion will be some 
of the biggest players in the UK. Aviation 
at just under £0.9 billion will be the 
biggest aviation engineering business in 
the UK outside the OEMs and airlines, and 
Cavendish Nuclear at over £0.6 billion 
will be the largest nuclear engineering 
services player in the UK. This realignment 
will give us valuable brand recognition 
and credibility.
As well as the four sectors, the new 
platform will be strengthened by 
four cross‑cutting capabilities that 
will work across all the sectors: 
Technology, Training, Infrastructure 
and Global Growth.
In Technology, innovation will be an 
area of continuing focus, as we work 
to stay abreast of opportunities that 
emerge through new technological 
developments. I have asked Jon Hall, 
Managing Director, Technology, to 
form a team that will work across all 
sectors to produce a technology growth 
strategy that will meet the needs of 
all the sectors as they grow, as well 
as identifying new opportunities for 
technology‑driven growth.
Training will remain fundamental to 
supporting our offering and will be an 
important element in all our sectors. Here 
I have asked John Davies to come up with 
a strategy that will link best practices and 
tie in with Technology to identify new 
technological ways to deliver training, 
such as simulation and virtual reality.
Infrastructure, including our dockyards at 
Devonport and Rosyth, will continue to 
be a main driver for all four sectors.
The fourth cross‑cutting capability, 
Global Growth, will play a vital role in 
enabling our ambitious international 
growth strategy. Building on the 
successful work of Bill Tame and the 
International Board over the last two 
years, we are strengthening this capability 
by creating a new Global Growth and 
Operations organisation.
The Global Growth organisation will 
have two main roles: driving business 
development, and linking the in‑country 
teams with the UK sectors to ensure that 
the sectors provide the support required 
to win and implement contracts. It will 
function as a bridge to connect our 
international teams with the four sectors 
in the UK.
Driving business development will mean 
ensuring in‑country teams understand 
Babcock’s strengths in each of the 
sectors, guiding them to find customers 
and opportunities, feeding in reference 
data from satisfied customers, and 
building a pipeline of opportunities 
that are of interest to the Company.
Linking the countries and the UK sectors 
will enable our overseas operations to 
draw expertise and domain knowledge 
from the sectors based in the UK and 
from each other, supporting both the bid 
and its implementation. For example, the 
Global Growth organisation will assess 
the resources required for the project, 
identify which resources will need to be 
brought in from the sectors, and manage 
the technicalities of moving people 
around the world and deploying them 
in other countries.
To carry out these two tasks effectively, 
we are embedding business development 
people from each sector in the new 
Global Growth organisation. This will 
create a formal, reliable link between 
the countries and the sectors, so that they 
can work effectively together to win and 
implement new international contracts 
and ultimately build autonomous 
country teams in all six core countries.
With this new platform – the four 
sectors, the cross‑cutting capabilities 
and the Global Growth organisation 
– I am confident that we will be in a 
strong position to support our five‑year 
growth plan.
Outlook
We believe that the revenue visibility 
provided by our order book and near 
term bid pipeline, together with the 
strong pipeline of future opportunities 
in the longer term tracking pipeline, 
offers continued prospects for growth. 
We have identified opportunities across 
all of our core markets, and believe 
that the realignment of the business, 
which brings us closer to our customers, 
both in the UK and internationally, 
will enable us to continue to identify 
opportunities to further develop our 
business. The Board therefore remains 
confident that the Group will continue 
to generate sustainable growth over the 
coming years.
Following the realignment of the 
business, reporting for 2016/17 reflects 
the divisional structure in place through 
the financial year, but future outlooks 
reflect the new sectors, and can be seen 
on pages 24 and 25 of this document.

to build long‑term relationships.
Customer focused 
long‑term relationships
We place great emphasis on doing

23 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Market overview and outlook
In a strong position
* Annual addressable revenue
The Marine sector consists of the 
previous Babcock Marine and Technology 
division, but also includes marine 
training previously in the Defence and 
Security division.
We continue to have excellent visibility 
of our future naval support programme 
though our ToBA and our relationship 
with the MOD and Royal Navy. We 
continue to see further outsourcing 
opportunities to increase the scope of 
our complex and critical engineering 
support to the MOD as we focus on 
maximising platform availability and 
providing increased value for money.
As well as our core defence business, 
our innovative expertise in complex 
and critical engineering services 
positions us well to continue to exploit 
opportunities in adjacent commercial 
marine and energy markets, both in the 
UK and internationally.
The Aviation sector comprises MCS, 
previously in the International division, 
and the military Air business previously 
within the Defence and Security division. 
Aviation has brought together all of 
Babcock’s aviation‑related businesses, 
both civilian and military, and rotary 
and fixed wing. Whilst in the oil and gas 
business the market remains challenging, 
with continued pressure on margins and 
ongoing cost recovery issues relating to 
flight restrictions on EC225 helicopters, 
the Emergency Services business is 
pursuing a number of opportunities in 
the UK and internationally, particularly 
in HEMS.

We continue to monitor the market and 
develop our capacity and capabilities in 
these areas of growth. Additionally the 
markets for engineering consultancy and 
cyber security continue to grow, and we 
see further opportunities to win business 
in these areas.
We expect the sector to continue to 
make good progress during the next 
financial year, despite the maturing 
of QEC aircraft carrier work which will 
reduce revenues by around £260 million 
over the next three years, with a 
£100 million step down expected in 
2017/18. As we look further ahead, we 
believe the outlook for the Marine sector 
remains positive, with a strong pipeline 
of growth opportunities across our 
businesses both in the UK and established 
international markets. 
The UK military Air business is undertaking 
a number of bidding opportunities which 
have come to market following the 
SDSR15, deepening our relationship with 
the customer and providing innovative 
solutions. Our French Air Force contract 
FOMEDEC is at the earliest stages of 
transition and delivery and hence will 
initially declare lower margins, but 
provides an operational reference for our 
military Air business in continental Europe.

Cavendish Nuclear comprises the nuclear 
business previously within the Support 
Services division. As a newly created 
sector in the Babcock Group, Cavendish 
Nuclear’s growth will be focused on three 
main markets: 
• nuclear decommissioning in the UK 
and internationally;
• the design and safety justification, 
construction, commissioning, 
operational support and maintenance 
of nuclear facilities in the UK and 
internationally; and
• new sectors where current capabilities 
can be applied and developed, such as 
offshore oil and gas decommissioning.
The Land sector is a combination of 
Critical Services, Network Engineering, 
Skills & Learning, previously within the 
Support Services division, the military 
Land business, previously within the 
Defence and Security division, and 
South Africa, previously within the 
International division.
We see significant opportunities to 
expand our equipment support and 
technical training capabilities across our 
military and civil customer base. Our deep 
understanding of customers’ operational 
and financial objectives, underpinned by 
our market‑leading capabilities, enables 
us to drive greater efficiency across 
their operations. 
We are experiencing greater demand 
for equipment support, in the UK 
and internationally, as customers 
seek a flexible partner to deliver 
greater availability and efficiency 
at a reduced cost.

In UK defence, we anticipate further 
equipment support outsourcing 
opportunities as customers acquire 
and upgrade equipment to improve 
force readiness as a result of this Whole 
Force Approach.
In the civil technical training market, 
demand for the outsourced management 
and delivery of technical training is 
increasing as the technology and skills 
required for delivery become more 
complex. Our current military training 
footprint also means we are well placed 
to respond to our defence customers’ 
increasing focus on training efficiency and 
improved collective training solutions. 
The programmes identified within the 
SDSR15 are progressing, with significant 
activity expected to commence in 
2018/19.
In the UK, the civil nuclear market remains 
resilient, with opportunities for both 
decommissioning and new build services 
providing scope for growth. In particular, 
the recent Government decision to 
proceed with the Hinkley Point C project 
has given renewed momentum to new 
build activity in the UK.

26 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 “I joined the International Maritime College Oman in 2011, progressing in Marine Engineering. This included 10 months of sea time on 
several large vessels completing my cadet ship training before going back to college for my Bachelor degree in Marine Engineering. My 
society is not used to the idea of women working in this field, but I haven’t let that stop me. Being the only woman in my classes made 
it more challenging, but these challenges motivate me to keep going and I hope other women continue to break these barriers too.
Working with Babcock gives me a great opportunity to learn more about the marine industry and the technologies being developed. 
Babcock’s joint venture with Oman Dry Dock is a great chance to gain further involvement and insight into how technical projects are 
carried out with ships in the dock.”

The areas we focus on
We have identified a number of Group and divisional level financial and non‑financial key performance 
indicators (KPI) that reflect the internal benchmarks we use to measure the success of our business and 
strategy. These will enable investors and other stakeholders to measure our progress.
Operating cash flow (OCF) conversion 
rate is defined as cash generated by 
operations after adding back retirement 
benefit cash flows in excess of cost 
as a percentage of operating profit 
(pre‑exceptionals and amortisation 
of acquired intangibles).
Operating return on revenue (ORR) is 
defined as underlying operating profit 
expressed as a percentage of revenue.
Revenue growth is defined as the 
increase in the Group’s revenue (including 
jvs) when compared to that of the 
previous year.
Gearing ratio measures the extent to 
which a company is funded by debt. 
Calculated as net debt divided by 
shareholder funds excluding retirement 
benefit deficits or surpluses. 
Net debt/EBITDA is calculated as net debt 
divided by earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation.
Interest cover is profit before interest, tax, 
depreciation, amortisation, joint ventures 
and exceptionals divided by net Group 
interest payable.

Continuing to deliver
Overview
Babcock continued to deliver in 
2016/17, with sustained growth of 
6.5% in underlying operating profit 
(5.3% organic growth at constant 
exchange rates) and 7.7% growth in 
underlying revenue (4.9% organic 
growth at constant exchange rates). 
This growth demonstrates the quality of 
our operations and the resilience of the 
Group’s business, and has resulted in an 
8.0% increase in underlying basic earnings 
per share.
We continue to focus on cash 
generation and on maintaining a 
secure financial base to support our 
future growth. We have reduced 
our net debt to £1,173.5 million 
(2016: £1,228.5 million) during the year, 
reducing the ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
to 1.8x, and expect to continue to reduce 
that ratio over the coming years.
authority and equipment support 
package for both the QEC aircraft carriers 
and Type 45 destroyers.
We continue to make good progress 
on the contracts already in our order 
book, including the ongoing progress 
under the £2.6 billion Maritime Support 
Delivery Framework (MSDF) and the ramp 
up of the Type 23 frigate life extension 
programme. Growth in the Air business 
in the Defence and Security division has 
continued with the successful start to 
the fixed and rotary wing UK Military 
Flying Training System (UKMFTS) contracts 
awarded to Ascent, our joint venture 
with Lockheed Martin. The final AirTanker 
was delivered on schedule in September, 
and the joint venture will therefore 
be providing partners with dividends 
from 2017/18.
Trading in the Defence Support Group 
(DSG) contract for the British Army 
continues in line with expectations 
following a busy year. We are currently 
working on a demonstration project 
for the Warrior Capability Sustainment 
Programme and are engaged in 
discussions regarding the full programme 
of 380 armoured vehicles. We 
successfully completed the overhaul 
and reset of 670 vehicles returning from 
military operations ahead of schedule.
In 2016, following a final investment 
decision by EDF Energy, the UK 
Government confirmed the decision to 
go ahead with the construction of a new 
nuclear facility at Hinkley Point C. Our 
Cavendish Boccard Nuclear joint venture, 
which has been selected as preferred 
bidder to deliver the Balance of Nuclear 
Island (BNI) mechanical installation 
package, is currently about to transition 
from Early Contractor Involvement studies 
to an Early Works Contract for the BNI.
We are currently in the process of 
completing the disposal of our Civil 
Infrastructure business, which in the year 
ending 31 March 2017 had revenues of 
around £30 million.
Our bid pipeline of near‑term 
opportunities has also remained 
broadly stable at around £10.5 billion 
(2016: £10.5 billion), despite the 
Franco Martinelli, Group Finance Director
Order book, bid pipeline and 
contract performance
Our order book is currently £19.0 billion, 
which reflects £4.7 billion of contracts 
awarded during 2016/17 and a 
reduction of £800 million from the early 
termination of the Magnox contract 
which will now end in 2019. This 
provides clear visibility of future revenues 
in the short and medium term, with 76% 
of revenue already secured for 2017/18 
and 52% for 2018/19. 
During the year, we maintained our win 
rate, achieving success in over 40% of 
our bids for new contracts, and over 
90% for renewals. In addition to the 
c €500 million French military flight 
training contract, FOMEDEC, we were 
delighted to win a contract to support 
Qantas’ ground fleet at around 60 
locations across Australia, as well as a 
number of naval equipment support 
packages and a contract to design and 
build a fourth Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) 
for the Irish Naval Service at our yard 
in Appledore, Devon. We saw a strong 
performance in our Emergency Services 
business, including winning new contracts 
in France and Northern Ireland and 
the successful mobilisation in Victoria, 
Australia. In May, we were awarded all 
four elements of a £360 million technical

removal of around £1 billion relating to 
the consolidation phase of the Magnox 
decommissioning project. Successful 
contract awards which have moved 
into the order book have been replaced 
with £6.6 billion of new opportunities 
which are currently being processed. The 
majority of bids in the pipeline continue to 
be new business, with rebids representing 
only 30%. Around half represent contracts 
with a total value of over £100 million, 
reflecting the scale and complexity of 
the contracts for which we compete.
The bid pipeline continues to be 
supported by a buoyant tracking pipeline. 
The tracking pipeline comprises prospects 
that have yet to formally come to market 
and includes a number of opportunities 
where we are in active dialogue with our 
customer to help formulate appropriate 
long‑term support solutions. We expect 
these opportunities to deliver growth in 
the medium to long‑term. 
Income statement
Statutory revenue for the year was 
£4,547.1 million (2016: £4,158.4 million), 
an increase of 9.3%. Statutory operating 
profit increased by 2.0% to £359.6 million 
(2016: £352.5 million). Statutory 
profit before tax increased by 9.7% to 
£362.1 million (2016: £330.1 million), 
reflecting the growth from joint ventures 
and associates. Basic earnings per share 
as defined by IAS 33 was 61.8 pence 
(2016: 57.0 pence) per share, an increase 
of 8.4%.
Underlying revenue for the year was 
£5,216.6 million (2016: £4,842.1 million), 
an increase of 7.7%. The Babcock 
businesses, excluding acquisitions, delivered 
revenue growth at constant exchange 
rates of 4.9% (2016: 7.6%). The largest 
contributor to this growth was the Defence 
and Security division which reported 
organic revenue growth at constant 
exchange rates of 15.1%, primarily due to 
the start of the UKMFTS fixed wing, rotary 
wing and rear crew contracts and the 
first year of the Aviation and Engineering 
Support and Aircraft Services (AESAS) 
contract. In addition there was increased 
procurement work in the DSG business. 
The Marine and Technology division 
achieved organic revenue growth of 4.9% 
at constant exchange rates, primarily 
driven by the ramp‑up of the Type 23 
life extension programme in our Warship 
Support business and increased submarine 
maintenance activity, as well as significant 
new business wins in our complex 
equipment and renewables businesses. 
The Support Services division’s revenue 
declined by 2.3% in the year. There were 
some additional works in Dounreay and the 
rail sector was buoyant. This partly offset 
the expected step‑down in volumes in the 
Magnox decommissioning project, together 
with Apprenticeship Levy uncertainty, some 
weakness in our Training business and the 
impact of a reduction in volumes in our 
North American fleet support contracts. 
In the International division, a strong second 
half performance in our South African 
equipment business, growth in the Mission 
Critical Services (MCS) Emergency Services 
business, two second half oil and gas wins 
and new business wins in Italy, Australia and

31 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial review continued
France resulted in organic revenue growth 
at constant exchange rates of 9.5%. 
Total operating profit across the Group 
increased by 6.5% to £574.8 million 
(2016: £539.7 million). At constant 
exchange rates, Babcock achieved organic 
growth in operating profit of 5.3%, with 
the Group’s operating margin broadly 
unchanged at 11.0% (2016: 11.1%), 
primarily reflecting margin improvements 
in Support Services and, to a lesser 
extent, Marine and Technology, offset by 
reductions in Defence and Security due to 
the low margin associated with additional 
DSG procurement work, as expected, and 
in International.
In the Marine and Technology division, 
operating profit increased by 9.7%, with 
margin improvement driven by contract 
performance, including in our Australian 
joint venture, and an increase in Research 
and Development tax credits. The Defence 
and Security division achieved an 11.7% 
increase in operating profit, with increased 
volumes helped by a step up in the Royal 
School of Mechanical Engineering (RSME) 
joint venture which is now in the ninth year 
of the 30‑year contract. 
For the Support Services division, operating 
profit grew by 2.7% following an increase 
in profit recognition in the Magnox 
decommissioning contract and improved 
performance in the Rail business, whereas 
the previous year included £7.5 million 
profit on the disposal of Lewisham Building 
Schools for the Future. The International 
division’s organic operating profit 
declined by 12.9% at constant exchange 
rates, reflecting the headwinds from the 
unrecovered costs due to the industry‑wide 
grounding of Airbus EC225 helicopters, 
continued margin pressure in the oil 
and gas sector on contract renewals, 
and competitive pressures in the South 
African equipment business. On a reported 
basis, the division saw a 2.1% reduction 
in profit, benefiting from movements in 
exchange rates.
The total Group impact of the change 
in average foreign currency rates was an 
increase in revenue of £133 million with 
a corresponding £15 million effect on 
operating profit.
The impact of movements in exchange 
rates has the following effect on the 
Group’s results: a 10% movement in the 
Euro equates to a £5.9 million change 
in operating profit and a £3.4 million 
change in profit before tax. A 10% 
movement in the South African Rand 
equates to a £2.4 million change in 
operating profit and a £2.3 million 
change in profit before tax. The average 
rates used for translation of 2016/17 
revenue and profit were £/€1.19, 
£/ZAR18.5. During the year, a net 
£2.5 million of provisions were charged 
to the income statement. Over the last 
seven financial years, the cumulative 
net provision charge averaged less than 
1% of operating profit excluding joint 
ventures. Provisions cash outflow in 
the period was £28.4 million, relating 
to contracts (primarily pain share/gain 
share and warranties), onerous leases, 
personnel (taxation and reorganisation) 
and property. 
Total net finance costs remained stable 
at £80.0 million (2016: £80.0 million) 
reflecting the decrease in total Group 
debt over the year but offset by increases 
in both IAS 19 and joint venture interest. 
The Group net finance costs reduced to 
£49.0 million (2016: £53.0 million) and 
we expect these to reduce further in future, 
in line with the decrease in the average 
amount drawn on the Group’s revolving 
credit facilities at a marginal rate of around 
1%. The Group’s share of joint venture net 
interest expense increased to £24.6 million 
(2016: £21.9 million), largely reflecting 
the new Ascent fixed wing programme 
and adverse swap valuations. The IAS 19 
pension finance charge was £6.4 million 
(2016: £5.1 million) as expected. 
Underlying profit before tax 
increased by 7.6% to £494.8 million 
(2016: £459.7 million). The associated 
tax charge, including the Group’s share 
of joint venture tax of £14.2 million 
(2016: £8.0 million), totalled £86.6 million 
(2016: £81.9 million), representing 
an effective underlying rate of tax of 
17.5% (2016: 17.8%). The effective tax 
rate is calculated by using the Group’s 
underlying profit before tax and therefore 
excludes the tax effect of amortisation 
of acquired intangibles. We expect 
the effective underlying rate of tax to 
be around 18% in 2017/18 and then 
to remain stable for the following two 
years as increasing international profits 
combined with currency movements have 
increased weighting.
The Group’s net pension deficit reduced 
to £104.5 million (2016: £203.1 million), 
essentially because the liabilities were 75% 
hedged for discount rates and inflation 
by matching assets, and growth assets 
performed well along with continuing 
annual deficit contributions. The projected 
pension charge within operating 
profit for 2017/18 is £47.6 million 
(2017: £38.8 million), a £8.8 million cost 
increase which will be partially offset by 
a £4.1 million reduction in retirement 
benefit interest.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles was 
£118.5 million (2016: £121.6 million). 
This represents the amortisation of the 
value attributed on business acquisitions to 
customer relationships (both contractual 
and non‑contractual) and acquired brands.
Earnings per share
Basic underlying earnings per share for 
the year was 80.1 pence (2016: 74.2 
pence), an increase of 8.0%. Basic 
earnings per share as defined by IAS 33 
was 61.8 pence (2016: 57.0 pence) per 
share, an increase of 8.4%. 
The Group has once again achieved 
its target of delivering pre capital 
expenditure cash conversion of over 
100% and around 80% post capital 
expenditure. The cash flow has delivered 
a net debt to EBITDA reduction to 1.8 
times at the year end and we expect 
to continue to reduce the net debt to 
EBITDA ratio to around 1.6 times by the 
end of 2017/18.
Dividend
This year, underlying basic earnings per 
share increased by 8.0% and the Group 
again more than achieved its target of 
delivering pre capital expenditure cash 
conversion of over 100%. Additionally, 
the combined order book and pipeline 
of c £30 billion provides clear visibility of 
future revenue streams.

The Board therefore remains confident 
in the long‑term future of our business 
and it is recommending a 9.6% increase 
in the final dividend per share for 2017 
of 21.65 pence (2016: 19.75 pence). 
If approved by shareholders at the 
AGM on 13 July 2017, this will give a 
total dividend for the year of 28.15 
pence per share (2016: 25.8 pence per 
share), an increase of 9.1%. The final 
dividend will be paid on 11 August 2017 
to shareholders on the register at 
30 June 2017. 
Acquisitions and disposals
In April 2016 the Group acquired 100% 
of Heli Aviation GmbH for a total cash 
cost of £10.9 million. Heli Aviation GmbH 
provides helicopter services in mission 
critical operations.
Cash paid in respect of acquisitions 
and disposals during the year totalled 
£30.5 million (2016: £1.0 million 
received), reflecting the deferred 
consideration paid in respect of the 
acquisition of DSG, Scandinavian Air 
Ambulance, and other businesses 
combined with the acquisition of 
Heli Aviation.
Cash flow and net debt
Working capital cash outflows 
during the period, excluding excess 
retirement benefits, were £36.1 million 
(2016: £36.6 million), with modest 
working capital cash outflows over 
the last two years driven by milestones 
and customer requirements. The cash 
outflow includes £28.4 million of 
provision movements. Cash generated 
from operations was £504.0 million 
(2016: £490.3 million), from which 
the Group’s operating cash flow 
calculation is derived. Operating cash 
flow after movements in working 
capital was up 1.8% to £542.2 million 
(2016: £532.7 million) and represents 
a conversion rate of operating profit to 
cash of 115% (2016: 114%). 
Net capital expenditure, including new 
finance leases, during the year was 
£134.9 million (2016: £145.1million). 
The Group achieved a conversion rate of 
operating cash flow after movements in 
working capital and capital expenditure 
to operating profit of 86% (2016: 83%). 
Capital expenditure for the year was 
1.5 times the Group’s depreciation and 
amortisation charge of £90.0 million. 
For the 2017/18 financial year, capital 
expenditure will be around 1.3 times

33 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial review continued
Net Group cash interest paid, excluding 
that paid by joint ventures, was 
£51.6 million (2016: £53.4 million), 
which reflects the continuing reduction  
in the Group’s debt and some refinancing 
of credit facilities. 
Cash taxation payments of £61.5 million 
(2016: £46.6 million) increased due 
to prior year utilisation of overseas tax 
losses but still benefited from pension 
payments in the UK. Free cash flow 
pre‑excess pension payments improved to 
£320.9 million (2016: £310.6 million), 
up 3.3%, representing a free cash 
flow yield at 31 March 2017 of 7.2% 
(2016: 6.5%). Free cash flow post 
excess pension payments increased to 
£282.7 million (2016: £275.7 million), 
up 2.5%. 
During the year the Group received 
£26.7 million in dividends from its joint 
ventures (2016: £23.0 million). Cash 
dividends (including to minorities of 
£1.3 million) paid out in the year totalled 
£133.8 million (2016: £125.6 million). 
The Group expects dividends from its 
joint ventures to increase to around 
£35 million in 2017/18. 
Group net cash inflow was 
£55.0 million (2016: £97.1 million 
inflow) decreasing total net debt at 
31 March 2017 to £1,173.5 million 
(31 March 2016: £1,228.5 million). 
At constant exchange rates the net 
cash inflow would have been around 
£56 million higher. This gives a net 
debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times 
(31 March 2016: 2.0 times).
Return on invested capital 
(ROIC)
We define ROIC as underlying earnings 
before financing costs, divided by the 
average of opening and closing equity 
plus net debt, excluding retirement 
benefit deficits. ROIC, pre tax, was 14.5% 
(2016: 14.2%). Post tax ROIC was 11.9% 
(2016: 11.7%). This compares to the 
Group’s current weighted average cost 
of capital of c 7.5%. The Group continues 
to focus on capital employed and on 
improving returns, and management 
compensation includes this as a 
performance measure.
Available financial capital
The Company defines available financial 
capital (AFC) as shareholder equity, 
net debt plus undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities.
Objective
To ensure an appropriate level of AFC to:
i maintain operational flexibility and 
meet financial obligations
ii fund the Group’s organic and 
acquisitive growth
iii maintain necessary headroom to cover 
the peaks and troughs in the Group’s 
working capital cycle
iv provide sufficient liquidity to see 
the Group through any periods of 
tightened liquidity in the market.
Policy
The Board aims to maintain a balance 
between equity and debt capital which 
optimises the Group’s cost of carry whilst 
allowing access to both equity and debt 
capital markets at optimum pricing 
when appropriate.
The Group, in considering its capital 
structure and financial capital, views net 
debt to EBITDA at 2.5 times or below 
as being steady state and sustainable in 
normal market and economic conditions. 
This level may be tempered in periods 
of market volatility and economic and/
or political uncertainty. This is not to rule 
out acquisition spikes above 2.5 times, 
as illustrated by previous acquisitions, but 
only if the Group can see a clear path 
to reducing net debt to EBITDA back to 
2.5 times or below within a reasonable 
time frame.
Performance
The Group’s gearing and debt cover 
ratios, used by the Group to evaluate 
capital, saw an improvement to 1.8 
times net debt to EBITDA in 2016/17 
(2016: 2.0 times), demonstrating 
further progress in bringing gearing 
down, both in the paydown of debt and 
through increasing profits attributable 
to shareholders.
Debt ratios are below covenanted levels 
and gearing has continued to reduce, 
leaving sufficient headroom for bolt‑on 
acquisitions and the funding of organic 
growth. The Company believes that 
capital markets remain accessible if or 
when required.
Treasury
Treasury activities within the Group 
are managed in accordance with the 
parameters set out in the treasury 
policies and guidelines approved by 
the Board. A key principle within the 
treasury policy is that trading in financial 
instruments for the purpose of profit 
generation is prohibited, with all financial 
instruments being used solely for risk 
management purposes.
The Group only enters into financial 
instruments where it has a high level 
of confidence in the hedged item 
occurring. Both the treasury department 
and the divisions have responsibility for 
monitoring compliance within the Group

to ensure adherence to the principal 
treasury policies and guidelines.
The Group’s treasury policies in respect 
of the management of debt, interest 
rates, liquidity and currency are outlined 
below. The Group’s treasury policies 
are kept under close review, given the 
continuing volatility and uncertainty in 
financial markets.
Debt
Objective
With debt as a key component of 
available financial capital, the Group 
seeks to ensure that there is an 
appropriate balance between continuity, 
flexibility and cost of debt funding 
through the use of borrowings, whilst 
also diversifying the sources of these 
borrowings with a range of maturities and 
rates of interest, to reflect the long‑term 
nature of the Group’s contracts and 
commitments and its risk profile.
Policy
All the Group’s material borrowings are 
arranged by the treasury department, and 
funds raised are lent onward to operating 
subsidiaries as required.
It remains the Group’s policy to ensure 
the business is prudently funded and that 
sufficient headroom is maintained on its 
facilities to fund its future growth.
Performance
The Group continues to keep under 
review its capital structure to ensure 
that the sources, tenor and availability of 
finance are sufficient to meet its stated 
objective. During the financial year, a 
loan note of £60 million was repaid at 
maturity, the Group obtained a further 
one‑year extension to its £750 million 
Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), with the 
facility now expiring in December 2021, 
and in October 2016 a £250 million 
Sterling bond was issued.
The revised Group capital structure of 
committed facilities and headroom 
are thought to be sufficient to meet 
the Group’s ongoing commitments. In 
addition to the aforementioned RCF and 
Sterling bond, the other main Group 
debt facilities comprise of: £40 million 
loan note issued in January 2010, 
US$650 million US private placement 
notes issued in March 2011, and a 
€550 million Eurobond issued in October 
2014. Taken together, these debt 
facilities provide the Group with a total 
of £1.91 billion of available committed 
banking facilities and loan notes.
For further information see note 2 to the 
Group financial statements.
Interest rates
Objective
To manage exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations on borrowings by varying 
the proportion of fixed rate debt 
relative to floating rate debt to reflect 
the underlying nature of the Group’s 
commitments and obligations. As a result, 
the Group does not maintain a specific 
set proportion of fixed versus floating 
debt, but monitors the mix to ensure 
that it is compatible with its business 
requirements and capital structure.
Available financial capital performance
  Covenant 2017 2016
Debt service cover EBITDA/net interest >4 12.0x 10.8x
Debt cover Net debt/EBITDA <3.5 1.8x 2.0x
Gearing Net debt/shareholders’ funds n/a 42% 48%
Policy
Interest hedging and the monitoring 
of the mix between fixed and floating 
rates is the responsibility of the treasury 
department and is subject to the policy 
and guidelines set by the Board.
Performance
As at 31 March 2017, the 
Group had 74% fixed rate debt 
(31 March 2016: 61%) and 26% floating 
rate debt (31 March 2016: 39%) based 
on gross debt of £1,424.8 million 
(31 March 2016: £1,461.2 million).
For further information see note 2 to the 
Group financial statements.
Liquidity
Objective
i to maintain adequate undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities
ii to monitor and manage bank credit 
risk, and credit capacity utilisation
iii to diversify the sources of financing 
with a range of maturities and 
interest rates, to reflect the long‑term 
nature of the Group’s contracts and 
commitments and its risk profile.
Policy
i all the Group’s material borrowings are 
arranged by the treasury department 
and funds raised are lent onward to 
operating subsidiaries as required
ii to ensure that the Group has 
sufficient cash on hand and that its 
committed RCF is appropriately sized 
and has sufficient term to meet the 
Group’s general corporate funding 
requirements. Each of the business 
divisions in the Group provides regular 
cash forecasts for both management 
and liquidity purposes. These cash 
forecasts are used to monitor and 
identify the liquidity requirements of 
the Group and ensure that there is 
sufficient cash to meet operational 
needs while maintaining sufficient 
headroom on the Group’s committed 
borrowing facilities. The cash 
performance of the business divisions 
is a key performance indicator
35 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 iii the Group adopts a conservative 
approach to the investment of its 
surplus cash. It is deposited with 
financial institutions only for short 
durations, and the bank counterparty 
credit risk is monitored closely on a 
systematic and ongoing basis.
A credit limit is allocated to each 
institution taking account of its credit 
rating and market information.
Performance
i the Group continues to keep under 
review its capital structure to ensure 
that the sources, tenor and availability 
of finance are sufficient to meet its 
stated objectives. During the year, the 
Group obtained a further one‑year 
extension to its £750 million RCF, with 
the facility now expiring in December 
2021, and in October 2016 issued a 
£250 million 10‑year Sterling bond.
ii the Group had cash and cash 
equivalents as at 31 March 
2017 of £191.4 million 
(2016: £185.9 million).
For further information see note 2 to the 
Group financial statements.
Foreign exchange
Objective
To reduce exposure to volatility in 
earnings and cash flows from movements 
in foreign currency exchange rates. 
The Group is exposed to a number of 
foreign currencies, the most significant 
being the Euro, US Dollar, South African 
Rand and increasingly the Australian and 
Canadian Dollar.
Policy – Transaction risk
The Group is exposed to movements 
in foreign currency exchange rates in 
respect of foreign currency denominated 
transactions. To mitigate this risk, the 
Group’s policy is to hedge all material 
transactional exposures, using financial 
instruments where appropriate. Where 
possible, the Group seeks to apply IAS 
39 hedge accounting treatment to all 
derivatives that hedge material foreign 
currency transaction exposures.
Policy – Translation risk
The Group is exposed to movements 
in foreign currency exchange rates in 
respect of the translation of net assets 
and income statements of foreign 
subsidiaries and equity accounted 
investments. It is not the Group’s policy 
to hedge through the use of derivatives, 
the translation effect of exchange rate 
movements on the income statement or 
balance sheet of overseas subsidiaries and 
equity accounted investments it regards 
as long‑term investments. However, 
where the Group has material assets 
denominated in a foreign currency, it 
will consider some matching of those 
aforementioned assets with foreign 
currency denominated debt.
Performance
There was a net foreign exchange loss 
of £9.3 million in the income statement 
for the year ending 31 March 2017 
(2016: £4.6 million gain).
For further information see note 2 to the 
Group financial statements.
Pensions
The Group provides a number of defined 
benefit and defined contribution pension 
schemes for its employees. The largest 
schemes are the Babcock International 
Group Pension Scheme, the Devonport 
Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme and the 
Rosyth Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme 
whose combined assets are £4.1 billion 
representing 87% of the total assets of 
the Group’s defined benefit schemes. It 
also has employees in two industry‑wide 
schemes, the Railways Pension Scheme 
and the Cavendish Nuclear section of 
the Magnox Group of the Electricity 
Supply Pension Scheme, as well as 
employees in other smaller occupational 
defined benefit schemes and local and 
central government schemes. All the 
occupational defined benefit schemes 
have been closed to new members for 
some years.
The Group continues to review all options 
to reduce the risks inherent in such 
schemes. In this financial year, it will be 
consulting with employees of two of the 
largest schemes on changes to better 
share costs of the scheme to help ensure 
the schemes remain sustainable. It is also 
introducing alternative options for those 
employees who may wish to leave the 
schemes whilst remaining employed. 
Additionally, it is making a significant 
investment in the education of current 
and former members coming up to 
retirement to help them understand all 
their options under the so‑called ‘pension 
freedom changes’ introduced by the UK 
Government. The Group anticipates that 
some members will take advantage of 
these freedoms and will transfer their 
funds out of the scheme.
The Group also provides an occupational 
defined contribution scheme used to 
comply with the automatic enrolment 
legislation across the Group for all new 
employees and for those not in a defined 
benefit scheme. There are a small 
number of other much smaller defined 
contribution schemes. Almost 70% of 
employees are now members of a defined 
contribution scheme. The Group pays 
contributions to these schemes based 
on a percentage of employees’ pay. It has 
no legal obligations to pay any additional 
contributions. All investment risk is borne 
by the employees.
Investment strategy
The Group has agreed a long‑term 
investment strategy with trustees across 
the three largest schemes designed to 
generate sufficient assets by April 2037 
to be fully self‑sufficient. It also operates 
within an agreed risk budget to ensure 
the level of risk taken is appropriate.
An investment committee operating 
across the three schemes, which 
includes Group representation, has 
been established for a number of 
years to maximise effectiveness and 
to ensure consistency.
Financial review continued
36 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report 1
Directors’ report 80
Financials 142
To implement the strategy, the 
committee has divided the schemes’ 
assets into growth assets, low risk assets 
and matching assets, with the proportion 
of assets held in each category varying 
by scheme reflecting the schemes’ 
different maturities.
The growth assets are systematically 
de‑risked over time by comparing and 
equating the expected and required 
returns each month. The matching assets 
are used to hedge against falls in interest 
rates or rises in expected inflation. The 
level of hedging is steadily increased as 
the funding level on the self‑sufficiency 
measure increases, and this approach has 
protected the schemes against the falls 
in interest rates over the last few years.
Funding valuations
Actuarial valuations are carried out 
every three years in order to determine 
the Group’s cash contributions to the 
schemes. The valuation dates of the three 
largest schemes are set so that only one 
scheme is undertaking its valuation in any 
one year, in order to spread the financial 
impact of market conditions. Work has 
commenced on the valuation of the 
Devonport scheme as at 31 March 2017.
Cash contributions
Cash contributions made by the 
Group into the defined benefit pension 
schemes during the year are set out 
in the table below.

contributions 34.6 45.3
Deficit recovery 36.4 30.5
Longevity swap 6.0 5.0
Total cash 
contributions 
– employer 77.0 80.8
In the 2017/18 financial year, the total 
cash contributions expected to be paid 
by the Group into the defined benefit 
pension schemes are £92.7 million. 
£8.0 million of this is for salary sacrifice 
contributions, £31.8 million is in respect 
of the cost of future service accrual, 
£42.2 million is to recover deficits over 
periods of time agreed with the Trustee 
and £10.7 million is in respect of the 
three longevity swaps transacted for each 
of the largest schemes during 2009/10 
to mitigate the financial impact of 
increasing longevity. This total cash cost 
is expected to be around £45.0 million 
in excess of the charge within the 
income statement per annum over the 
medium term.
The current level of bond yields and 
inflation expectations has increased 
cash service costs for pension schemes. 
A consultation with the members of the 
schemes has begun in order to mitigate 
this position.
Accounting valuations
The IAS 19 valuation for accounting 
purposes showed a market value of assets 
of £4,676.2million, net of longevity 
swaps, in comparison to a valuation of 
the liabilities based on AA corporate bond 
yields of £4,780.7 million. The total net 
accounting deficit, pre deferred tax, at 
31 March 2017, was £104.5 million 
(2016: £203.1 million), representing a 
98% funding level.

A summary of the key assumptions 
used to value the largest schemes is 
shown below. The most significant 
assumptions that impact on the results 
are the discount rate, the rate of future 
pensionable salary increases and the 
expected rate of inflation. The impact of 
the longevity swaps transacted during 
2009/10 has helped to mitigate the risk 
of increasing allowances for longevity.
Governance
The Group believes that the complexity 
of defined benefit schemes requires 
effective governance and supports an 
increasingly professional approach. It 
has appointed an independent chairman 
across the three largest schemes as well 
as an independent professional trustee 
in each scheme and has appointed 
professional trustees with specialist 
investment expertise. The Group 
established a governance committee 
across the schemes to improve the 
effectiveness of the trustee boards as 
well as enhancing trustees’ knowledge 
and decision‑making.

Market overview
The Marine and Technology division’s 
core UK naval market has remained 
positive over the past year following 
the 2015 SDSR.
The UK MOD Equipment Plan 2016 
confirmed the Government’s intention 
to spend £178 billion on equipment and 
support over the decade, £67.2 billion 
of which will be spent on the support 
of existing in‑service equipment. 
This represents a 2% increase on the 
previous year’s plan. The MOD continues 
to seek opportunities to outsource 
support capabilities in order to meet 
efficiency targets, reduce support costs 
and improve operational capability. 
£19 billion is programmed for surface 
ship procurement and support to 2026, 
which includes the completion of the 
QEC aircraft carriers, the design and 
development of the Type 26 Frigate 
which will ultimately replace the Type 
23 class and the possible development of 
a general purpose Light Frigate (Type 31). 
The MOD continues to drive efficiency, 
performance and sustainability 
improvements through the Submarine 
Enterprise Performance Programme 
where we continue to play a leading 
role alongside our Tier 1 partners BAE 
Systems and Rolls‑Royce. Over the next 
decade £44 billion is programmed for 
procurement and support of the UK’s 
submarine capability, including the design 
and build of the Dreadnought Class which 
will begin to replace the Vanguard Class 
submarines by the late 2020s.
We continue to engage with the UK 
Single Source Regulations Office as its 
thinking matures. The vast majority of our 
sole source activities are contracted until 
2020 under the MSDF, and 2025 under 
the Terms of Business Agreement, and 
we anticipate that the complexity and 
value inherent in the majority of services 
we provide would continue to generate 
commensurate returns within the sole 
source environment. 
2016/17 continued to be a challenging 
period for the offshore energy markets 
but the North Sea decommissioning 
market is expected to grow in future

iFrigates – Using innovation to enhance through‑life support delivery
Babcock Analytical Services is developing the concept of iFrigates through 
Project Athena. The project uses data from ship and shore systems to translate 
into precise support decisions and provide a bespoke understanding of 
through‑life support. The project utilises innovative support technology (air and 
underwater drones, data from ship systems). The complex real‑time data capture 
is then analysed and shared with crew and shore support. Data is visualised 
in a configurable suite of mobile apps which then supports risk prediction 
(availability), live demand and supply‑chain management, engineering solution 
support, dynamic surveys and increased safety.
Benefits include improved delivery and reliability of physical assets, financial 
savings and fostering of innovation. Furthermore, the systems and processes are 
applicable to ships, submarines, vehicle fleets, aviation fleets, critical assets and 
infrastructure. Babcock is proactively working to optimise support chains and 
develop improved engineering decisions (live feedback to advance preparations 
for base support), improving operational effectiveness of the owner, operator 
and support organisation.
years. In Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), 
our market returned to baseline levels 
in 2016/17 following rapid fleet build 
in the previous four years. However the 
Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) carrier market 
demand is strong and forecast to increase 
as the market for cleaner fuel grows. 
In Canada, the Government remains 
supportive of defence, and we expect 
no material impact on our business from 
the Defence Review currently underway. 
In 2016, the Australian Government 
issued a Defence White Paper which 
outlined plans for A$195 billion of 
capital investment over the next 20 
years, a quarter of which is earmarked 
for maritime and anti‑submarine warfare. 
The Government also committed 
to a continuous build programme 
in naval warships and selected an 
international partner for the platform 
design of its A$50 billion Future 
Submarine programme.
The New Zealand MOD also published 
a White Paper which identified a 
NZ$20 billion investment programme 
over the next 15 years and outlined the 
integration of military services, while 
increasing private sector participation.
The market trend towards the adoption 
of Industry 4.0 thinking for the Internet 
of Things and digital aspects of asset 
management is driving the demand 
for our more advanced analytic and 
data exploitation capabilities across the 
energy, transport and defence sectors. 
High‑profile cyber security incidents 
over the past year, together with the 
increasing threat of cyber‑attacks, has 
continued to drive the demand for 
services in our chosen niche areas of 
the global cyber security market.
Strategy
Maximising our engineering experience 
and capability, we will focus on 
developing innovative solutions to 
improve our engineering support 
capability. We will use data analytics 
and new technologies to enhance 
the capabilities and availability of our 
customers’ existing and future platforms.
We remain the leading naval support 
provider to the Royal Navy under our 
15‑year Terms of Business Agreement 
(ToBA) which runs until 2025. The 
Maritime Support Delivery Framework 
(MSDF) contract secures our position as 
the MOD’s strategic support partner at 
HMNBs Devonport and Clyde and we 
continue to work with the MOD to deliver 
savings and efficiencies. We are working 
with the MOD to ensure that the required 
infrastructure is in place at Devonport 
and HMNB Clyde in support of the future 
submarine programme and the creation 
of a submarine centre of specialisation 
at Clyde from 2021.
Our integral role within the surface ship 
and submarine alliances continues to 
position us well alongside our industry 
partners when progressing plans to 
support existing and new UK naval 
platforms under long‑term integrated 
output contracts. Internationally, a 
number of submarine programmes are 
in their early concept phases and we 
are actively engaged in developing our 
capabilities to support the design and 
build elements of these programmes.
Increasingly we are looking to build on 
our international footprint to provide the 
Royal Navy and international customers a 
truly global support offering. In November 
2016 we finalised a joint venture with 
Oman Drydock Company (ODC) to 
develop the naval support capabilities 
at Duqm Port in Oman, providing local 
39 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 and international navies with world‑class 
engineering services. We also continue to 
build on our current marine operations in 
Canada, New Zealand and Australia.
In the energy sector, our market 
leading position in LPG/LNG handling 
systems continues to present significant 
international growth opportunities. We 
continue to develop our reputation 
in the offshore wind sector and are 
well positioned to exploit the growing 
offshore wind market in Northern Europe.
Financial review
The Marine and Technology division 
had another successful year and 
experienced growth in most sectors, 
reporting an increase in total 
revenue of 6.5%, to £1,805.6 million 
(2016: £1,695.9 million). Organic 
growth at constant exchange rates was 
4.9% (2016: 9.4%). The main drivers of 
growth this year have been the ramp up 
of the Type 23 life extension programme 
within our Warships Support business 
and increased submarine maintenance 
activities on the legacy Trafalgar and 
Vanguard Class boats and the new Astute 
Class boats at both Devonport and Clyde. 
Our complex equipment business has 
grown due to significant contract wins in 
equipment support and delivery of new 
weapons handling systems for submarine 
projects in Spain, Korea and the UK. 
Our business in New Zealand grew 
following the first full year of the new 
Dockyard Management contract. Work 
on the QEC aircraft carrier programme 
has stabilised as we push to get the 
first vessel ready for sea trials, and 
will accordingly step down by around 
£100 million in 2017/18.
Our Energy and Marine business has 
grown due to three contract wins in the 
renewables sector for offshore substations 
for Siemens, DONG Energy and E.ON. 
Additionally, joint venture revenue growth 
was 28.7%, driven by an uplift in our 
Naval Ship Management joint venture in 
Australia following the conclusion of the 
ANZAC frigates maintenance contract, 
which has led to the follow‑on contract 
being enlarged under the Warship Asset 
Management Agreement which started 
in July 2016. Disappointingly this growth 
was partially offset by a slow‑down in our 
Liquefied Gas Handling business.
Operating profit increased by 9.7% to 
£218.1 million (2016: £198.9 million). 
Organic operating profit growth 
at constant exchange rates was 
8.8%. The division’s total operating 
margin increased by 0.4% to 12.1% 
(2015: 11.7%), driven by improved 
contract performance including within 
our Australian joint venture, and 
increased Research and Development 
tax credits.
Operational review
Over the past year, we have maintained 
our position as lead support partner for 
the Royal Navy, successfully providing 
deep maintenance and in‑service support 
for warship and submarine platforms. 
We are now two years into our 
five‑and‑a‑half year MSDF contract to 
deliver a range of engineering support 
services across HMNB Devonport 
and HMNB Clyde and delivery of key 
milestones is on track. We continue to 
deliver submarine and warship refits in 
support of our customer’s programme, 
while building additional capability 
and capacity to support increasing 
operational demands and progressing 
opportunities with the MOD to upgrade 
the critical nuclear infrastructure needed 
to support both current and future 
submarine classes. 
As the lead submarine support partner, 
we remain focused on underpinning 
the UK’s Continuous At Sea Deterrence 
through support to the Vanguard 
Class. HMS Vanguard’s life extension is 
now well under way at Devonport and 
initial project milestones have been

Submarine Dismantling Programme
The Submarine Dismantling Programme (SDP) got under way on dismantling 
the first of 27 vessels, a Swiftsure Class submarine, at our Rosyth site in 
December 2016. This strategic and critical programme for the MOD 
and Babcock follows three years of planning, regulatory approvals and 
implementation of infrastructure developments. Our involvement includes 
developing the capability to safely remove the radioactive waste and dispose 
of it within the existing disposal routes in the UK. Removal of the radioactive 
waste is known as the Initial Dismantling (ID) project and will be undertaken 
in two stages. Seven defuelled submarines will be dismantled at Rosyth and 
a further 20 will be dismantled at Devonport during the project. Throughout, 
Babcock is committed to ensuring that the SDP is undertaken in a safe, secure 
and environmentally responsible manner.

successfully completed. We continue 
to invest in developing our engineering 
capability and capacity in order to 
maximise submarine availability as the UK 
transitions from the Trafalgar Class to the 
Astute Class. 
At HMNB Clyde, we continue to focus 
on driving efficiency improvements and 
developing our capacity and engineering 
capabilities to deliver the required 
outputs. In October 2016, we were 
awarded a contract to deliver submarine 
escape, rescue and abandonment and 
survival training, which will contribute to 
the UK submarine centre of specialisation 
being consolidated at HMNB Clyde from 
2021. The Astute Class Training Service 
continues to deliver world‑class training 
with crews regularly achieving pass rates 
of over 99%. 
The dismantling of the first nuclear 
submarine under the Submarine 
Dismantling Project has now begun 
with the removal of low‑level waste 
from the demonstrator submarine in 
our Rosyth Dockyard.
The QEC aircraft carrier programme 
continues at pace within our Rosyth 
facility. HMS Queen Elizabeth has 
completed the commissioning of major 
systems phase and will begin contractor 
sea trials in 2017. HMS Prince of Wales 
is now structurally complete and work 
is underway on the outfitting phase. We 
continue to progress an in‑service support 
solution for QEC with our Surface Ship 
Support Alliance partners and the MOD. 
Over the past year, we have made 
significant progress on the Type 23 life 
extension programme. HMS Argyll has 
now begun sea trials having been the first 
of its class to complete a life extension 
package, which also included the 
installation of the Sea Ceptor weapons 
system. We currently have a further three 
Type 23 vessels docked in Devonport 
and planning continues for future upkeep 
programmes. The contract to reactivate 
HMS Albion has achieved a major project 
milestone after 1.3 million man‑hours; 
work on the ship is on target to complete 
in September 2017. 
We continue to develop and improve our 
warship support capability and have a 
number of initiatives underway to exploit 
emerging innovative technologies and 
data analytics. These will enable us to 
develop a more efficient maintenance 
methodology, and reduce time and cost 
for our customer. We also continue to 
develop a global support offering for our 
customers, and last year supported Royal 
Navy vessels in Bahrain, Oman, Gibraltar 
and South Africa. 
The third OPV, LÉ William Butler Yeats, was 
successfully completed, handed over and 
commissioned into service with the Irish 
Naval Service in July 2016. As a result of 
our performance, we were contracted 
to design and build a fourth OPV in 
November 2016. Work has already 
started at our Appledore facility with the 
keel laying ceremony taking place on 
28 February 2017. 
Our market‑leading weapons handling 
and launch systems (WHLS) products 
continue to be developed for the 
UK Dreadnought Class submarine 
programme. In October 2016, we were 
awarded a contract for the manufacture 
of 22 missile launch tube assemblies 
for the joint US‑UK Trident nuclear 
submarine replacement programme. 
This is the first production batch of a 
competed 300 missile launch tube 
assembly programme. We also delivered 
WHLS for the South Korean Jangbogo III 
submarine programme and continue to 
deliver equipment for the Spanish S80 
submarine programme.
In November 2016, we were awarded 
a £20 million contract to deliver detailed 
production engineering design support 
for the US Coastguard Offshore Patrol 
Cutter programme, which is a significant 
milestone in our strategy to export our 
naval design engineering knowledge 
and expertise.
Our continued investment in the 
development of our Equipment 
Management Operations Centre (EMOC) 
has enabled us to win several equipment 
management contracts in support of 
the MOD’s strategy to outsource the 
management of maritime systems and 
equipment. In March, we were awarded 
preferred bidder status for all four 
elements of a £360 million technical 
authority and equipment support 
package, Maritime Systems Support 
Rampion
Babcock successfully loaded out a 400MW sub‑station topside and jacket for the 
Rampion offshore wind farm, off the Sussex coast, as part of a two‑year contract 
with E.ON, the UK Green Investment Bank plc and Enbridge. The programme, the 
first wind farm project delivered at Babcock’s Rosyth facility on the River Forth, 
relied heavily on the expertise of a skilled workforce and the unique facilities 
and capabilities available at our Rosyth site to deliver the customer’s complex 
asset. Following the announcement of the Rampion offshore wind farm contract, 
Babcock’s Rosyth operation won a further two renewable energy projects.
41 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Partner (MSSP), for both the QEC aircraft 
carriers and Type 45 Destroyers, a month 
after being awarded all six Maritime 
Equipment Consumables (MEC) packages. 
Our position on MSSP and MEC has been 
made possible by a dedicated EMOC 
in Bristol. We also won an availability 
contract for the support of the Royal 
Navy’s Phalanx weapons system. 
In Australia, our Naval Ship Management 
joint venture between Babcock and UGL 
Limited entered into the Warship Asset 
Management Agreement (WAMA) with 
the Commonwealth of Australia, BAE 
Systems and SAAB Australia. WAMA will 
provide maintenance support services 
until the end of life of the ANZAC 
Class Frigates.
We continue to deliver through‑life 
support for submarine equipment 
and engineering services for the 
Australian Collins Class submarines, with 
negotiations now underway to secure a 
further five‑year contract. We continue 
to pursue multiple opportunities relating 
to the A$50 billion Future Submarine 
programme and expect initial contracts 
for material systems and sub‑systems to 
come to market in 2017. 
In New Zealand, our dockyard 
maintenance contract continues to 
perform to plan and in Canada work on 
HMCS Corner Brook under our long‑term 
Victoria Class In‑Service Support contract 
is progressing well, with a planned return 
to service in late 2018. We continue to 
track several major future naval support 
opportunities including refit and 
in‑service support opportunities on 
the Halifax Class frigates. 
In line with our strategic aim to develop 
a global support offering, Babcock and 
Oman Drydock Company signed a joint 
venture agreement to develop a naval 
operation in Duqm, Oman. The business 
is ideally located to support ships and 
submarines operating in the Middle 
East region. A number of international 
navies have expressed interest in utilising 
the facility at Duqm in addition to both 
the Royal Navy of Oman and the UK 
Royal Navy.
We are seeing strong growth potential 
in LNG and Volatile Organic Compounds 
capture. In February 2017, we agreed 
a joint venture with Bernhard Schulte 
Ship Management to design and operate 
a ground‑breaking Gas Supply Vessel. 
The 7,500m³ vessel, which will be used 
for the LNG fuelling of ships and other 
shore‑based gas consumers in the Baltic 
Sea, is the first vessel of its kind to use 
our gas handling technology and we are 
exploring other opportunities in this area.
Our Energy and Marine Services business 
has successfully executed the first 
offshore renewables substation for E.ON’s 
Rampion wind farm. We are currently 
working to deliver an offshore reactive 
compensation platform for DONG Energy 
and have also won a contract to deliver 
two offshore transformer modules for the 
SSE Beatrice wind farm. Given this recent 
experience and our world‑class facility 
at Rosyth, we remain well positioned to 
take advantage of the next round of UK 
Government offshore wind funding and 
approvals in 2017.
Over the past year we have seen 
sustained growth in our independent 
technology consultancy businesses. 
Our cyber security business ContextIS has 
trebled in size since acquisition in 2013. 
We continue to develop and enhance our 
cyber capabilities through our Babcock 
Managed Security Services business which 
provides our clients with a managed 
cyber defence capability through our 
Advanced Security Operations Centre. 
Our Frazer‑Nash engineering consultancy 
continues to grow and demand for our 
engineering consultancy services looks 
set to remain strong in the medium to 
long‑term, with significant opportunities 
being tracked in the defence, power, 
energy and nuclear markets. 
Sustainability
Maintaining some of the UK’s most critical 
assets and infrastructure, we work within 
highly regulated market sectors and insist 
on the highest levels of safety and security 
compliance across all our operations, 
along with a fair and respectful working 
environment. During the period we 
reduced our ‘total accident’ and 
‘over‑three‑day injury’ frequency rates 
by 13% and 30% respectively from an 
already low level.
Operational review continued
International opportunities with Duqm dry dock joint venture
During the year, Babcock finalised a joint venture with the Oman Drydock 
Company to enhance the naval capabilities at the Duqm port in Oman. This new 
venture will initially support vessels from the Royal Navy of Oman, the UK’s Royal 
Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, with longer‑term plans to support a range of 
international navy vessels operating in the region, including the provision of a 
servicing and maintenance location for the Queen Elizabeth Class (QEC) aircraft 
carriers. The development offers a permanent presence in the Middle East that 
will enable the UK to shape the development of naval facilities to support the 
QEC and wider British maritime needs in the area.

Our award‑winning health, safety and 
environmental initiatives remain critical 
to our success. We continue to progress 
towards the introduction of a ‘Common 
Operating Model’ which will see the 
deployment of a new management 
system encompassing best practice, 
common standards and working 
arrangements. This will enable us to 
continue to improve consistently across 
all our businesses: for example, we are 
currently working on divisional standards 
for ‘working at height’ and ‘workforce 
mental health and wellbeing’.
At Devonport, our joint commitment with 
the Royal Navy to improve health, safety 
and environmental (HSE) performance 
was marked by the introduction of 
a charter. Rosyth’s Health and Safety 
team won the British Safety Council’s 
prestigious Sword of Honour Award for 
the 10th year running. And our Visible 
Leadership Programme to drive sustained 
improvement in our HSE performance 
has included around 1,700 joint reviews 
and conversations.
We have achieved a ‘Zero Waste to 
Landfill’ target across all sites by diverting 
all suitable landfill waste to alternative 
legitimate routes as a result of our 
improved waste management and 
segregation strategies, which have been 
supported by a mandatory awareness 
training programme in partnership with 
our waste services supplier.
In Devonport, our Environmental 
Charter has been signed by the trade 
unions, MOD and the contractor 
managing accommodation for the 
Royal Navy on site. We were awarded 
the Environmental Achievement Award 
for improving our environmental 
performance and enhancing sustainability 
at Rosyth at the 2016 EEF Manufacturing 
Awards. Last year, we also won an award 
for environmental efficiency at the 2016 
Future Manufacturing Awards.
We continue to invest in skills and 
capability as the business grows. Given 
the need to sustain future engineering 
skills, we place great value in our 
apprentice and graduate programmes. 
Our HMNB Clyde Apprenticeship 
Programme won the prestigious Princess 
Royal Training Award, which honours 
UK employers who have created a 
lasting impact. A record number of 161 
apprentices started their career within 
the Marine and Technology division 
during the period, including 14 higher 
apprentices, 12 business administration 
apprentices and five higher level business 
apprentices. This, along with our graduate 
scheme, helps to secure our resource 
base for the future.
Life‑extensions progressing
Following an extensive upkeep period at Babcock’s Frigate Support Centre in Devonport, Type 23 Frigate (T23), HMS Argyll, sailed 
from the dockyard to start sea trials. This engineering milestone represents the culmination of over 600,000 man hours of work 
and the completion of Babcock’s first ‘Life‑Extension’ project for the Navy’s T23s. Part of a wide‑reaching programme that will 
see each of the Royal Navy’s T23 Frigates call into Devonport for upkeep, the work has been designed to extend the platforms’ 
operational life from 18 to 35 years: maintaining, updating and upgrading capability for the 21st century. HMS Argyll returned to 
sea in a significantly improved material state and with enhanced capability. The work package represents the most complex T23 
upkeep ever undertaken in Devonport – and the first UK warship class to have its missile system changed mid‑life since the 1970s.
We have an active STEM outreach 
programme, with over 400 active STEM 
Ambassadors reaching thousands of 
students from primary schools through 
to higher education establishments 
to promote STEM careers. As proud 
sponsors of the Women in Science and 
Engineering (WISE) Awards and the 
Telegraph STEM Awards, we are well 
placed to track emerging talent and 
showcase best practice across the wider 
engineering community.
In addition, we support community 
groups and worthwhile causes in the 
areas in which we operate through 
sponsorship and donations covering a 
wide range of civic events and charities. 
In June Babcock was the title sponsor for 
Plymouth Armed Forces Weekend, which 
won the Tourism Event and Festival of 
the Year Gold Award at the South West 
Tourism Awards.
We have made good progress in support 
of the Group’s Diversity and Inclusion 
strategy, with the launch of our divisional 
Babcock Women’s Network (BWN), which 
now has in excess of 200 members in 
Bristol, Clyde, Devonport and Rosyth. 
This year we also launched our Pride in 
Babcock LGBT+ network at Devonport 
and Bristol, with a third network at Rosyth 
to be established in the coming months.

Defence and Security
Market overview
In addition to its commitment to 
increase the defence budget by 0.5% 
above inflation for the remainder of this 
Parliament, the UK Government has also 
committed to increase its equipment 
budget at 1% above inflation. This should 
enable our principal customer to plan 
for the future with some confidence, 
including its intention to spend 
£178 billion on equipment and support 
over the decade to 2025/26. These 
investments include £7.4 billion for land 
equipment and a total of £27.2 billion for 
military air equipment.
This is an increase of more than 
£11 billion against last year’s Equipment 
Plan. Importantly for Babcock, there 
is a change in financial arrangements 
where savings made by the front line 
commands can be used to fund new 
investments. This gives the armed forces 
a better incentive to seek efficiencies in 
the support arena and this should give 
rise to new opportunities for Babcock. 
The MOD will need to realise a total of 
£9.8 billion of savings over the next 10 
years, primarily through transformation 
efficiencies. For the Defence and Security 
division, the net result of the additional 
equipment commitments in the 2015 
SDSR is a 28% increase in planned spend 
on support for new equipment over the 
next 10 years, up from £18.3 billion 
to £23.4 billion for 2016‑2025, and 
a 2% increase on last year’s expected 
spend for in‑service equipment over the 
next decade.
Western European defence markets 
show many of the same financial and 
engineering skills based challenges 
associated with the UK Armed Forces. 
Our deep skills, gained from decades of 
experience serving the mature defence 
sector in the UK, have contributed to our 
ability to develop a presence in France, 
which has a similar size defence budget 
but a less mature outsourcing defence 
support services sector.

Employing technical innovation at Babcock DSG
Across the Group Babcock is driving technology to deliver results. At DSG, we 
maintain, repair, overhaul and upgrade military vehicles and equipment, and 
assemble and test new vehicles for the British Army, and technology plays a key 
role. Previously, we identified defects in vehicles’ hulls through the use of dye 
penetration testing, which could only detect surface‑breaking flaws. Recently, 
we partnered with selected companies to jointly develop techniques for specific 
vehicles and gained the technical capability to perform phased array ultrasound 
testing of these vehicle hulls. The method involves ultrasonically scanning the 
platforms and allows the detection of sub‑surface defects. This is combined 
with technical weld repair on these complex vehicles to provide a greater level 
of structural integrity assurance on completed vehicles when handing back 
to the MOD.
Strategy
The stated UK policy to protect and grow 
the defence budget and its determination 
that new equipment capabilities 
will only be secured by delivering 
significant efficiencies provide significant 
opportunities for Babcock.
Our core strategy is to drive revenue 
growth by moving up the supply chain 
across all our activities, offering better 
differentiated services and seeking 
added value and therefore higher margin 
work. We will continue to monitor and 
manage our international target markets 
with complimentary approaches to 
drive growth.
Our position as a leading support 
partner to the British Army is beginning 
to present wider opportunities to 
embed Babcock as the Army’s strategic 
supplier for equipment support and 
individual training. We aim to accelerate 
our engineering services and data 
analysis delivered to date through new 
technologies including commercial off‑
the‑shelf products to determine potential 
improvements and increase our offering 
to our customers.
Our aviation business is an important 
provider of military aircraft and base 
support services within both the UK 
military training environment and, 
through our FOMEDEC contract award, 
the French military training environment. 
Our recent success to secure the 
Royal Navy aviation and engineering 
support and aircraft services contract 
brings our aviation capabilities to 
front‑line operational customers and 
we aim to expand our services in the 
operational environment through a 
range of strategies that will enable us to 
partner with air forces as well as specific 
OEMs through smart collaborative 
partnerships to deliver maintenance, 
support and training.
We are making investments across our 
business to develop our capabilities 
in high‑end engineering, programme 
and project management and systems 
integration, and we are applying 
technology to drive differentiation, profit 
margins and new market positions. These 
activities are underpinned by productivity 
improvement initiatives and a greater 
engineering and technical focus in 
our operations.
Financial review
Revenue for the Defence and Security 
division, including the Group’s 
share of joint venture revenue, 
increased by 15.8% to £976.5 million 
(2016: £843.1 million). Organic 
revenue at constant exchange rates 
grew by 15.1%. This strong growth was 
primarily due to the start of the UKMFTS 
fixed wing, rotary wing and rear crew 
contracts and the first year of the AESAS 
contract. In addition, there was increased 
procurement work in the DSG business.
Total operating profit increased 
by 11.7% to £146.6 million 
(2016: £131.3 million). Operating 
profit growth was driven by the revenue 
increase but also by profit recognition 
within the Holdfast Training Services joint 
venture (Holdfast), which is now in the 
ninth year of a 30‑year contract. Organic 
operating profit at constant exchange 
rates grew by 11.3%. The division’s 
operating margins reduced slightly to 
15.0% (2016: 15.6%) reflecting a mix of 
lower margins on procurement revenue 
offset by additional profit recognition 
on Holdfast.
Operational review
Within our Land business, the DSG 
contract with the MOD for the British 
45 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Operational review continued
Army is trading in line with expectations 
following a busy year. The first generation 
10‑year contract is delivered from seven 
main sites across the UK. The contract 
includes maintenance, repair, overhaul 
and provision of stores and spares 
procurement services for land equipment, 
ranging from small arms to main battle 
tanks. We successfully completed the 
overhaul and reset of 670 vehicles 
returning from military operations ahead 
of schedule and met the demanding 
timelines to issue vehicles for operations 
in central Europe from the stored fleet. 
The transformation is on track with all 
contractual milestones achieved. 
During the year, we secured a contract 
amendment for eight years to provide 
equipment on a turnkey availability basis 
to the Defence School of Transport at 
Leconfield and a year’s extension to 
provide maintenance on the fleet of 
Protected Mobility Vehicles, totalling in 
excess of £30 million. We are engaged 
with Lockheed Martin to offer the 
production of the Warrior Capability 
Sustainment Programme of 380 
armoured vehicles and we anticipate 
these discussions will progress through 
the coming year. We also anticipate 
further opportunities as the Army 2020 
Refine programme crystallises to defined 
projects, with revenues expected in 
2018/19.
The six‑year contract to manage the 
MOD’s white fleet, entitled Phoenix II, 
started in the UK in September 2016. 
This service manages the MOD’s fleet of 
16,000 administrative vehicles and the 
rental vehicle requirements. We continue 
to perform well in delivery of the MOD’s 
worldwide construction fleet of 2,000 
vehicles through our ALC joint venture. 
As well as supporting a continued number 
of operational requirements, we have 
also developed more advanced fleet 
management systems to support the 
reduction of costs through the term of 
the contract.
Within our training operations, we 
continue to successfully deliver to 
our customer with no service failures 
across all main contracts, delivering 
over 20,000 training days to the British 
Army. Under the Electro‑Mechanical 
Training contract we continue to deliver 
transformation in training delivery and 
support. Recent successes include the 
development of a new Protected Mobility 
Vehicle fleet course, reducing the course 
duration from eight to five weeks, utilising 
modern learning methods and media. 
Performance at the RSME continues 
to remain at the highest level and the 
contract was showcased in the autumn 
during the visit of Her Majesty The Queen 
as part of the 300th anniversary of the 
Royal Engineers. We expect services to be 
expanded to include training support to 
the Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal, 
Munitions and Search Training Regiment 
in Bicester and Kineton. In addition, our 
contract with Defence Infrastructure 
Organisation to provide support services 
to the British Forces in Germany, which 
commenced in 2011, was extended for 
a two‑year period in 2016.
Our Air business began the year with a 
£500 million contract award to deliver 
rotary wing flying training services. This 
is the Babcock share of the contract, 
delivered through Ascent, our joint 
venture with Lockheed Martin to deliver 
UKMFTS. As this contract, and the 
previously awarded fixed wing contract, 
ramp up over the next three years, we 
shall continue to focus on current military 
flying training through our Hawk, Tucano 
and Tutor contracts. We are well placed 
to ensure that the customer transitions 
from the current services to the new 
services in a seamless fashion. 
The five‑year contract to deliver AESAS to 
the Royal Navy at Yeovilton and Culdrose, 
which we announced last year, is now 
fully operational and, as expected, there 
are clear benefits from the rotary wing 
aspects that we are able to leverage 
from the MCS helicopter business. On a 
similar basis, expertise, support and deep 
engineering knowledge from our Air 
business was provided for the FOMEDEC 
bid team in France and was a significant 
factor in our being awarded the contract 
in January. Further support is being 
provided to assist the implementation 
phase of the contract with both 
businesses operating in the new 
Aviation sector.
The Sea Training business has continued 
to deliver strong operational and safety 
performance. Our transformation 
of Royal Navy engineering training 
is progressing, providing innovative 
learning with stimulating interactive 
online content and media supported by 
simplified instruction. Feedback from the 
operational user community indicates 
that trainees who have benefited from 
this approach are more effective, being 
able to work independently and with 
higher confidence in completing practical 
tasks. Although the successful Fleet 
Outsourced Activities Project has entered 
its final year in providing wide‑ranging 
training delivery and training support 
services to the Royal Navy, we expect 
to continue as the supplier of these 
services beyond December 2017. We 
also continue to support the Royal Navy 
through the provision of sophisticated 
and realistic high‑end warfare training 
and the design of imaginative immersive 
training in support of the new QEC 
aircraft carrier.
Sustainability
In support of the business growth 
agenda, the focus for 2016 has been on 
strengthening our talent pipeline. This has 
been achieved by extending the scope of 
our high potential identification, pushing 
deeper into talent pools, stretching and 
challenging people earlier in their careers.
First line leaders are key enablers of 
business performance. During 2016 we 
completed the roll‑out of the first line 
leadership development programme 
across Babcock DSG, with 522 staff now 
having completed the programme over 
the last four years. The programme has a 
major behavioural dimension with a focus 
on practical application leadership style, 
managing self, managing performance, 
communication, motivation and 
delegation. We have implemented a 
stress resilience programme, targeted at 
staff delivering high challenge projects.

Babcock is a committed member 
of the 5% Club and apprentices 
continue to be a key element of our 
staffing strategy. Targeting critical 
technical skills, we currently have 118 
apprentices on programme and 2016 
saw the first cohort complete our 
two‑year advanced air engineering 
apprentice scheme. The quality of our 
apprenticeship development continues 
to be recognised; for example, this year 
one of our graduated female apprentices 
was elected to the Young Women In 
Science and Engineering (WISE) Board. 
We continue to develop our graduate 
population. This year, we increased our 
graduate STEM intake and 52% of our 
current programme population is female 
(2015/16: 37%).
Maintaining a focus on diversity 
and inclusion, we have delivered a 
programme of ‘No Innocent Bystander’ 
workshops to over 1,000 employees. 
We have introduced an eLearning module 
to ensure employee‑wide awareness of 
diversity, inclusion and respect and have 
actively participated in the Group’s Pride 
in Babcock and Women’s Network events.
Our refresh of the ‘Home Safe Everyday’ 
safety programmes continues to 
reduce both our accident numbers and 
accident severity rate. Overall, there has 
been a 40% reduction in both minor 
injuries and significant accidents (>3 days) 
across Defence and Security this year. 
The Sea, Land, International and Security 
business units have respectively recorded 
over 2.7 million, 2.6 million, 1.8 million 
and 400,000 hours worked without a 
significant accident. The Land business, 
including Babcock DSG, has reduced 
accident numbers in both frequency 
and severity by over 50% within the 
year. For the sixth year running, our joint 
venture company ALC has received an 
Occupational Health and Safety Gold 
Medal Award from the Royal Society for 
the Prevention of Accidents.
Working in partnership with the Defence 
Infrastructure Organisation, Babcock is 
delivering an innovative energy reduction 
scheme throughout the MOD estate in 
Advanced pilot training across the UK
Babcock is the most experienced provider of high‑quality training, engineering 
and equipment support to the UK’s military flying training. We have been 
delivering flying training, aircraft engineering and airfield services for more than 
70 years and we support over 25% of all MOD rotary and fixed wing aircraft.
Our key activities include the delivery of pilot training, flight simulator 
maintenance, asset management, multi‑activity support services and equipment 
support to ensure aircraft, and their pilots, are always mission ready.
We employ around 1,700 highly trained and uniquely skilled people to deliver 
those specialist services from more than 30 sites across the UK. We are extremely 
proud of our long association with the UK’s military flying elite. Our commitment 
to excellence in all we do is guaranteed.
Germany. Having identified and invested 
in energy saving opportunities, we have 
delivered a range of improvements, 
resulting in reduced total carbon dioxide 
emissions of 2,773 tonnes and savings in 
excess of €980,000.
For the Engineering Education Scheme 
Wales, we worked in partnership with 
the RAF and BAE Systems to host female 
students from Ysgol David Hughes 
secondary school in Anglesey at RAF 
Valley. The students gained an insight 
into the range of technical vocations 
available in the aerospace sector and 
wider careers in STEM. We also invest in 
the communities in which we are based 
through a range of projects and by 
providing support for local charities.

Support Services
Market overview
Our markets remain attractive, with 
existing and potential customers opting 
to procure outsourced solutions to further 
reduce their cost base, deliver greater 
efficiency and improve service delivery. 
Customers continue to market test 
services and our breadth and depth of 
expertise, coupled with our investment 
in innovative solutions and people 
development, mean that we are well 
placed to respond to this challenge. 
In the UK’s civil nuclear market, there are 
opportunities for both decommissioning 
and new build services which provide 
scope for growth. In particular, the recent 
Government decision to proceed with 
the Hinkley Point C project has given 
new momentum to new build activity 
in the UK.
We expect that the demand for fleet 
management and equipment support 
services in the UK and overseas will 
remain strong, particularly for customers 
with critical and complex fleets, such 
as Ground Support Equipment (GSE), 
Heavy Mobile Equipment and ‘blue‑light’ 
emergency services. Investment 
in strategic fleet management 
capabilities, such as fleet optimisation, 
asset replacement programmes and 
conversions, and decision support and 
data analytics, to span multiple industry 
sectors, will position Babcock well for 
further outsourcing opportunities and 
expansion of existing operations.
Demand for our technical training 
services remains positive. We see an 
increasing requirement for technology 
and systems in the delivery of such 
training, which increases the barriers to 
entry for competitors and incentivises 
large organisations to outsource 
these services.
The introduction of the Apprenticeship 
Levy represents a potential opportunity 
to grow our existing apprentice business 
in the engineering and workplace skills 
sectors. However, while we expect large 
organisations to look to maximise the 
value of their levy account, our customer 
base also includes small employers who

may be disincentivised from training 
apprentices under the new regime.
Our strong domestic market position has 
enabled us to expand our international 
footprint by leveraging the capabilities 
successfully developed and delivered 
for our UK customers. This breadth of 
expertise has provided a firm foundation 
upon which we will build an expanding 
pipeline of international opportunities. 
We expect that our recent contract 
wins in Europe and Australia will provide 
impetus for additional growth in 
these markets.
Strategy
Our strategy continues to focus on our 
core markets where we have established 
a successful track record of delivery and 
developed strong long‑term relationships 
with customers.
Growth in these markets will be driven 
though enhancing our capabilities 
to provide innovative and financially 
attractive solutions to customers in the 
civil nuclear, vehicle fleet management 
and support and technical training 
services sectors. Our order book and 
pipeline of new business opportunities 
support the potential for continued 
success across these core markets. They 
also provide an opportunity to align 
our business more closely to our core 
strengths and to critically review which 
sectors offer the greatest potential for 
shareholder value.
Development of our capabilities, through 
internal and external collaboration and 
greater application of technology in our 
services, will underpin our growth.
In the Group’s vehicle support businesses 
we will broaden our offering in the 
airports and ‘blue‑light’ sectors with 
strategic fleet management solutions 
based on decision support and data 
analytics tools that improve fleet 
availability and reduce through‑life asset 
costs for our customers.
Our training business will also leverage 
technology to provide more integrated 
training solutions for larger customers 
and to respond to changes in the 
apprenticeship sector during 2017.
The strategy in our civil nuclear business 
is focused on continuing to successfully 
deliver on the major UK decommissioning 
programmes and expanding our presence 
in the new build sector. In our Rail 
business, we expect Network Rail’s more 
regional structure to create opportunities 
to deliver capacity and operational 
efficiency improvement.
Across our business we continue to 
develop our routes to expansion in 
international markets and these efforts 
have been rewarded with contract wins 
in Australia and Europe. We expect 
to grow our operational capabilities 
overseas through an increasing pipeline of 
opportunities and potential acquisitions.
Financial review
Revenue in the Support Services 
division reduced slightly: 2.3% 
down to £1,478.8 million 
Dungeness dives in
In a significant step forward for nuclear decommissioning in the UK, divers are 
being used to clean up the former cooling ponds at Dungeness A Site.
Bringing with it a host of safety and environmental benefits, the work will see the 
pond skips that were once used to store used nuclear fuel cut up and packaged 
for disposal, with the water that remains in the ponds acting as additional 
radiation protection for the divers.
The technique also has additional environmental benefits, as the alternative 
of cutting skips after they have been removed from the ponds would require 
additional measures to prevent potential airborne contamination.
During the work, an additional 20 tonnes of pond furniture, including framework 
and machinery, classed as low‑level waste will be removed and cut up before 
being disposed of at the Low Level Waste Repository.
The learning from the work at Dungeness A Site will be shared with other 
Magnox sites where similar work will be carried out, with Sizewell A Site being 
the next destination.
John Clarke, NDA’s Chief Executive, said: “We always encourage our contractors 
to adopt the highest standards of safety, security and environmental 
responsibility. This work by Magnox Ltd shows that they are making real progress 
in clearing the ponds at Dungeness, in a way that is not only safe for the 
environment, but is also saving time and money.”
49 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Operational review continued
(2016: £1,513.0 million) following 
the significant growth in the prior year 
from the Cavendish Fluor Partnership’s 
(CFP) full implementation of the Magnox 
decommissioning joint venture. Organic 
revenue at constant exchange rates 
decreased by 3.3%. Activity on the 
Magnox project has now reduced in line 
with the NDA annual site funding limits 
in the original programme. However, this 
decrease was partially offset by growth in 
our rail electrification joint venture with 
Alstom and Costain. 
In addition, Cavendish Nuclear’s 
Dounreay joint venture had higher than 
expected activity levels following some 
acceleration to the programme of works. 
Despite the reduction in revenue, growth 
in operating profit increased by 2.7% to 
£110.5 million (2016: £107.6 million), 
an increase of 9.6% on an organic basis 
at constant exchange rates. This was 
been largely driven by the expected 
increase in margin recognition in the 
Magnox contract, reflecting strong 
operational performance and the 
retirement of very early stage risk in the 
contract. Across other businesses within 
the division, the negative impact of lower 
activity levels in our North American 
fleet support contracts was mitigated 
by profit growth in our rail and UK fleet 
support operations.
Operational review
In the year, Cavendish Nuclear, a 
wholly‑owned Babcock subsidiary, 
continued to strengthen its position 
as the UK’s leading supplier to the civil 
nuclear industry, remaining focused 
on site operations, maintenance, 
decommissioning and nuclear new build.
The CFP – in which the Group has a 65% 
stake – has come to a mutual agreement 
with the UK’s NDA to bring to an end the 
Magnox decommissioning contract at the 
end of August 2019, when we will have 
operated the contract for a full five years. 
Following the detailed contract 
Consolidation phase, it has become 
apparent that the work that needs to 
be done at the 12 Magnox sites is now 
materially different in volume from 
that specified in the NDA’s tender, and 
this puts the contract at risk of a legal 
challenge. Last year, a High Court judge 
ruled against the NDA in respect of its 
award of the Magnox contract. The NDA 
has been explicit that its decision was in 
no way a reflection on the operational 
performance of CFP , which has 
remained strong.
CFP is now over two years into the 
Magnox decommissioning contract, 
and making good progress in the 
delivery of the through‑life programme 
across the12 licensed sites. Through 
innovative approaches to dealing with 
the legacy waste, the contract team is 
now targeting an earlier than expected 
completion of the Bradwell site. This will 
represent a significant milestone for the 
nuclear industry in the UK. Using new 
plant systems, the team has started the 
retrieval of waste from three highly active 
legacy waste facilities. In addition, the 
programme is benefiting from utilising 
specialist divers to decontaminate the 
former fuel cooling ponds at Dungeness. 
At Dounreay, the Cavendish Dounreay 
Partnership continues to deliver the 
nationally important nuclear materials 
consolidation programme. The team 
has also achieved a significant reduction 
in two of the site’s highest hazards 
associated with the Dounreay Fast 
Sellafield’s magnificent six
The last of six mighty doors which will unlock the contents of one of Sellafield’s 
most hazardous buildings, has been installed on to the oldest plant at the 
nuclear site.
One of the ‘big four’ legacy facilities at the Sellafield site – the Pile Fuel Cladding 
Silo – is a step closer to being cleaned up thanks to the installation of the 
12.4 tonne stainless steel doors which will be key to opening the building’s 
‘locked vaults’.
The doors – equivalent to the weight of around 150 grown men and over 7m 
tall and 4m wide – will be the access point for waste retrieval machinery to safely 
begin lifting out the silo’s contents for the first time.
Following years of design, planning, manufacture and testing up at the Rosyth 
site of supply chain partners Bechtel Cavendish Nuclear Solutions and BMT , the 
first door safely arrived at the site in early August.
One by one, the doors have been successfully lifted into a massive 40 tonne,  
9m wide steel door frame on the side of the building.
The doors will play a key role in reducing hazard at the site, enabling waste 
retrieval to start in 2020.

Reactor – the safe immobilisation and 
storage of intermediate level liquid 
raffinate and the safe removal and 
processing of liquid metal coolant. As part 
of its existing Lifetime Support Agreement 
with EDF, Cavendish Nuclear successfully 
supported EDF in generating 65TWh 
in 2016, the highest annual outturn 
since 2003. Cavendish Nuclear’s safety, 
quality and operational performance 
underpinned this achievement and 
has been formally recognised by the 
EDF Executive.
Major design and construction projects 
to aid decommissioning at both 
Sellafield and Magnox sites continue 
to be delivered to agreed programmes 
and budget. Of particular note was the 
delivery of six 12 tonne stainless steel 
doors to the Sellafield site to support 
decommissioning of the Pile Fuel 
Cladding Silo, one of the highest hazard 
legacy nuclear facilities in Europe. At 
the Atomic Weapons Establishment, 
Cavendish Nuclear has continued to 
build on its existing relationship with the 
customer, supporting both new build 
and decommissioning projects.
Following the Government’s decision 
to go ahead with Hinkley Point C, 
the Cavendish Boccard Nuclear joint 
venture is about to transition from 
Early Contractor Involvement studies 
to an Early Works Contract for the 
Balance of Nuclear Island mechanical 
installation package. Work to date has 
focused on constructability studies 
and schedule integration with other 
installation contractors. Over the next 
12 months, the focus will move to supply 
chain engagement for long‑lead item 
procurement. Cavendish Nuclear is also 
pursuing additional opportunities in the 
UK new build programme, including 
Small Modular Reactors.
Internationally, Cavendish Nuclear 
continues to seek to develop long‑term 
relationships in Japan with HGNE and 
Shimizu, with both of whom we have 
Memoranda of Understanding in place 
for potential decommissioning projects. 
In support of Cavendish Nuclear’s work 
Dounreay gets the NaK
The destruction of one of the highest hazards remaining in the Nuclear 
Decommissioning Authority (NDA) estate has been completed at Dounreay.
Around 68 tonnes of highly radioactive liquid metal coolant was removed from 
the Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR) and safely destroyed over a 10‑year period. The 
liquid metal, a blend of sodium and potassium called NaK, was used to remove 
heat from the reactor’s nuclear fuel.
Dounreay used a specially built plant and removal system to safely convert 
the NaK to hydrogen gas and salt water. Handling the material is a particularly 
complex technical challenge as it reacts vigorously when exposed to air or water, 
eventually catching fire. This meant that it had to be kept under a nitrogen gas 
blanket to prevent reactions.
Reactors Director, Ken Heider, said: “The Dounreay team, in partnership with  
our supply chain, worked extremely hard over a long time to remove and 
convert the highly radioactive NaK into safe products. Most importantly,  
our highly skilled team delivered the work safely and in compliance with  
our environmental authorisations.”
in Japan, the NDA and Cavendish Nuclear 
have recently entered into a Cooperation 
Memorandum of Understanding that 
will provide unlimited access to NDA 
intellectual property, access to Magnox 
operating experience and site staff 
and access to Magnox sites for visits of 
potential customers and partners of 
Cavendish Nuclear. 
In Critical Services, our Airports business 
performed well, helping Heathrow 
to achieve its best ever recorded 
performance in baggage operations. 
Performance enhancements and 
sustained performance improvements 
are increasingly being underpinned by 
investment in innovative technology, 
such as a Babcock‑developed app that 
provides a single source of real‑time 
information for over 100 key customer 
stakeholders. This app won the ‘Best 
Innovator’ category at the Airport 
Operators Association’s annual awards.

we are working with the MPS to extend 
our support activities beyond the current 
contract life and scope. Our specialist 
vehicle conversion business, MacNeillie, 
is now being more widely leveraged 
across our Fleet Management businesses 
and in the DSG business in the Defence 
and Security division.
Following a challenging period of trading 
driven by reducing customer demand 
and escalating supply chain costs, with 
returns falling below expectations, 
we are reviewing our Heavy Mobile 
Equipment fleet management contracts 
in the Aggregates and Cement market 
in North America. The Skills & Learning 
business has developed programmes 
and technologies to respond to 
the UK Government’s changes to 
apprenticeship qualifications and funding. 
The Apprenticeship Levy represents 
an opportunity to grow our existing 
apprentice business in the engineering 
and workplace skills sectors although, 
whilst there may be more demand from 
larger employers, smaller employers 
may train less under the new regime. 
We have successfully mobilised our new 
Network Rail apprenticeship contract and 
the programme is now being delivered 
from a new site under the new Rail 
Apprenticeship standard. Delivering this 
‘trailblazer’ standard from a modern 
facility using a range of innovative 
teaching technologies underpins the 
continuing success of this major contract.
Our emergency services training 
contracts continue to perform strongly. 
We played a key part in supporting 
the LFB’s celebrations of 150 years in 
operation, and see good opportunities 
through the introduction of the Police 
and Crime Act 2017 for Babcock to 
support the blue‑light sector in its drive 
for increased inter‑service collaborations. 
We are participating in the MPS market

Delivering on our long‑term partnership with the London Fire Brigade
Babcock, as part of a 21‑year contract, has been leading the refresh and 
redesign of the London Fire Brigade (LFB) fleet and in January the LFB took 
delivery of the latest generation of state‑of‑the‑art fire engines for the first 
time in over a decade. The new engine includes a high pressure hose that can 
deliver significantly increased volumes of water, a more ergonomic crew cab 
and a EURO VI engine which further reduces emission levels compared to the 
previous model. Babcock worked in partnership with the LFB and had direct 
design and development input from front line firefighters resulting in a model 
that is both technically advanced and better equipped to meet the needs of 
today’s firefighters.
We also manage its complex fleet of 430 vehicles and over 46,000 pieces of 
specialist equipment, including two fireboats, and train firefighters from two 
purpose‑built technical training centres across London. This ground‑breaking 
partnership, combining fleet management and a 25‑year technical training 
contract, means we’re guaranteeing availability and providing whole‑life value 
for the LFB.
further international opportunities for the 
Fleet Management business.
Our Fleet Management business also 
started an extensive rollout of new fire 
engines for the London Fire Brigade (LFB) 
in 2016. Babcock worked closely with 
the LFB and end users in the design of 
the new fleet, the first since 2007. In 
April, the first appliance was unveiled at 
a special event attended by HRH Prince 
Charles and the LFB Commissioner. Our 
fleet management contract, which 
supports the Metropolitan Police Service 
projects across Heathrow and other 
airports, including Glasgow and Gatwick, 
provide further opportunities for Babcock 
to enhance its customers’ operations.
A strong performance was also delivered 
by our Fleet Management business

In Network Engineering, our Rail business 
has delivered Network Rail’s plain line 
track renewals throughout the third year 
of the customer’s five‑year control period. 
Working with this key customer, our track 
renewals team successfully completed 
a track lowering project as part of the 
Severn Tunnel closure programme to 
introduce faster, greener electric trains 
for passengers in South Wales. 
Working as part of the Edinburgh Glasgow 
Improvement Programme alliance, a 
project to electrify the main line between 
two of Scotland’s largest cities, our track 
team successfully completed major 
engineering work at Queen Street Tunnel 
following a 20‑week closure. This is the 
largest piece of engineering undertaken 
on this line since it was built. 
Following the successful completion of 
Translink’s multi‑million pound signalling 
contract to upgrade the 33 mile route 
between Coleraine and Londonderry, 
we have been awarded a further 
signalling and telecommunications 
framework contract to deliver services 
across Northern Ireland’s rail network. 
The Power business within Network 
Engineering, has seen the successful 
completion of National Grid’s overhead 
line refurbishment projects on the 
Padiham and Capenhurst projects, as well 
as the Indian Queens to Landulph route 
in Cornwall, and this is being followed by 
the refurbishment of 100km of overhead 
line between Plymouth and Exeter. Works 
for Western Power Distribution continue 
to progress steadily with projects 
such as a re‑conductoring of a 1km 
stretch of 33kV overhead lines in North 
Lincolnshire spanning a tidal river, and 
the reinforcement of the 132kV power 
network near Telford, being successfully 
completed by our Power team. 
Our Media Services business continues 
to exploit the advantages of the 
combined service offering created by 
the acquisition of WRN Broadcast in 
2015. Our relationship with Perform 
Group, supporting the roll‑out of its 
live and on‑demand sports service 
‘DAZN’, continues to expand into new 
geographies and has positioned us as 
an expert in the emerging non‑linear 
broadcast space. We also secured a 
key role in supporting local TV satellite 
distribution in the UK, delivering 
broadcast solutions to six local TV 
channels. GoMedia is utilising Babcock’s 
multi‑platform distribution offering to 
distribute video on demand direct to 
passengers’ mobile devices on Eurostar 
trains and National Express coaches.
Sustainability
This year, we have continued to progress 
our division’s people agenda through 
initiatives focused on developing talent, 
recognising achievements and increasing 
diversity across our business.
Our annual Excellence Awards 
programme received hundreds of 
nominations across a broad range of 
categories, including health and safety, 
innovation and project delivery, enabling 
us to embed our values and formally 
recognise employees who live our being 
babcock principles.
During the Group‑wide Dialogue 
Week, which focuses on diversity and 
inclusion, we arranged workshops and 
activities to engage our employees in a 
discussion about how to further advance 
performance in this area. We reaffirmed 
our commitment to flexible working and 
launched a Women’s Network to support, 
attract, retain and develop women.
We remain focused on attracting, 
employing and developing future talent. 
In September, we welcomed 26 new 
graduates, taking the total number 
participating in our two to four‑year 
divisional programmes to 83. The quality 
of this programme was also recognised 
externally through being named as 
a finalist in the ‘Strategic Alignment’ 
category of the Association of Graduate 
Recruiters awards.
A further 36 apprentices joined the 
division this year, across disciplines 
including engineering, business 
administration, automotive and 
radiometric technology, and mechanical 
and electrical design.
In line with the Group, we continue to 
focus on promoting STEM activities, 
working closely with schools to enable 
young people to better understand the 
opportunities across science, technology, 
engineering and maths. Our commitment 
to STEM Ambassador activity was recently 
recognised by the National STEM 
Learning network.
Through our Babcock Prime Education 
Fund scheme, we have also provided 
funding to a group of Worcestershire 
schools to establish innovative projects 
aimed at improving the lives of children 
and young learners in the region.
We remain firmly committed to achieving 
health and safety excellence across all our 
operations and this year we have made 
further progress in our quest to ensure 
everyone goes ‘home safe every day’.
Through a focused review of risk 
assessments, safe systems of work and 
protective equipment, supported by 
an increased number of safety tours led 
by our management team and regular 
all‑employee driving safety bulletins, we 
have reduced our all accident frequency 
rate by 20% and the over three day 
frequency rate by 50% compared to 
last year.
In addition, we remain committed to 
reducing our environmental impact 
by introducing a range of measures to 
reduce energy usage in our buildings, 
and by increasing our usage of video/
tele‑conferencing to avoid unnecessary 
business car mileage.

Market overview
At MCS, we continue to see attractive 
markets in the emergency services sector, 
with a number of new opportunities 
included in our pipeline, together with 
search and rescue and firefighting 
outsourcing opportunities in existing and 
new markets.
The business has also entered new 
countries in support of existing 
customers, as well as new markets such 
as wind farm support and Unmanned 
Aviation Services. MCS’ growth is based 
on winning organic opportunities and 
growing its pipeline, creating partnerships 
with customers and delivering 
differentiated solutions. 
Challenging conditions in the oil and gas 
sector have continued to impact our 
business in the North Sea and Australia. 
Business conditions in the sector remain 
tough and we are not envisaging any 
improvement in the medium term. Our 
exposure to this market (and particularly 
to the exploration market) is limited, and 
we continue to be a robust and reliable 
long‑term partner for the industry.
Tough trading conditions in South Africa 
persisted for the first half of the 2016/17 
trading year as commodity volumes and 
prices remained depressed. Equipment 
and commodity markets contracted by 
a further 20% which, combined with a 
fragile political economy, maintained 
pressure on pricing and volumes. 
The second half saw some revival in 
commodity pricing and a significant 
strengthening of the Rand versus 
Sterling. The recovery led to an uptick 
in the demand for mining construction 
equipment in the final quarter and 
our strategy of growing market share 
during the commodity down cycle has 
supported significant order intake from 
the mining sector. 
The power generation and distribution 
sectors remained buoyant through 
the year, with significant opportunities 
in maintenance support through the 
Eskom contract and new work being 
issued on the new Kusile and Medupi 
power stations.

Our mining export markets in Zambia, 
Namibia and the copper belt in southern 
Democratic Republic of the Congo have 
improved on the back of commodity 
pricing and early indications are that this 
will continue in 2017/18. Sustained low 
gas prices and political problems leading 
to instability in Mozambique have all but 
shut down economic activity but our oil 
and gas customers in the region remain 
optimistic for the future.
Strategy
Babcock is a world leader in providing 
aviation services for mission‑critical 
operations. Whether we are flying to 
critically injured people, supporting police 
operations, fighting fires from the air or 
transporting men and women to and 
from offshore oil and gas fields, we know 
that lives and livelihoods depend on the 
operations we fly – every day and every 
night. We are a 24‑hour company, and 
we’re trained and equipped to handle 
emergency situations and to go wherever 
our customers need us, always putting 
our absolute commitment to safety at 
the heart of everything we do.
We will secure our market leading 
positions in the geographies we serve, 
becoming a recognised partner to 
governments and blue chip corporations 
for complex aviation support.
We are looking to grow and strengthen 
our core MCS markets, raising the 
standards to differentiate our emergency 
services offering and build on our 
world leader status. We are creating 
new operating models to meet the 
needs of a world with a lower oil price 
and we are pioneering the use of new 
technologies to drive safety, boost 
efficiency, enhance performance and 
grow our revenues.
Our customer‑focused culture is marked 
by a flexible and responsive approach 
to dynamic situations. We optimise 
our operations and fleet capabilities 
to suit specific requirements and we 
leverage the unparalleled capabilities 
of the Babcock International Group to 
provide solutions our competitors simply 
cannot match.
During the protracted downturn in South 
Africa, our strategy within the operational 
division has been to control costs and 
increase market share and this has 
been achieved.
In terms of new business, efforts have 
been focused on our objective of 
establishing and growing a significant 
training business in the region. Progress 
has been made with the establishment of 
Babcock Training and early wins in power 
generation technical training. A number 
of exciting opportunities are being 
pursued in the mining and automotive 
sectors, where we are confident of 
progress using Babcock’s international 
training experience.
Financial review
The International division saw revenue 
growth but experienced margin pressure 
in 2016/17. The division’s revenue 
grew by 21.0% compared to the 
previous period, reflecting the impact 
of movements in foreign exchange rates. 
Organic revenue at constant exchange 
rates increased by 9.5% for the division 
as a whole, due to a strong second half 
performance from the South African 
Equipment business which grew by more 
than 10% and continued growth in MCS’ 
Emergency Services business, as well as 
the mobilisation of new contracts in Italy, 
Australia (Qantas) and France (FOMEDEC). 
MCS’ organic revenue increased by 6.3% 
at constant exchange rates, driven by 
continued growth in MCS’ Emergency 
Services business and the start of new 
oil and gas contracts in Australasia in the 
second half of the year.
Total operating profit for the division 
declined by 2.1%, which equates to an 
organic reduction of 12.9% at constant 
exchange rates. This reflects continuing 
competitive pressures in the South 
African Equipment business, and ongoing 
difficulties in the oil and gas business 
affecting MCS’ crew change services. 
Additionally, operating profit has been 
impacted by ongoing unrecovered costs 
from the industry‑wide grounding of the 
EC225 fleet of helicopters and by low 
margin recognition in the new long‑term 
contracts which began in the period, in 
line with prudent accounting practice. 
Overall, the division’s margin declined to 
11.0% (2016: 13.6%).
Operational review
MCS has maintained a high contract 
win rate across new bids and renewals, 
securing 38 new contracts and extensions 
to existing contracts with a total value of 
around £540 million.
We continue to see a number of 
opportunities outside the UK, following 
the award to Babcock France of an 
11‑year contract to provide and maintain 
training platforms and related services 
for the French Air Force (Armée de 
l’Air), drawing on our expertise in the 
European aviation industry and our 
experience of delivering long‑term 
military flight training programmes 
(FOMEDEC). In addition to FOMEDEC, MCS 
is also growing its business supporting 
the defence sector in Europe. We 
delivered complex projects, such as the 
life extension programme developed 
for the Spanish Navy which includes 
the upgrade of seven Agusta Bell 212 
helicopters. This project was successful 
in obtaining technical certification from 
INTA, the Spanish National Institute for 
Aerospace Technology.
The French Department of Defence 
awarded Babcock France a five‑year 
contract to deliver maintenance 
operations and logistic needs for the 
Department’s fleet of 20 Airbus EC135 
helicopters, 15 of which belong to the 
Gendarmerie Nationale and five to the 
Sécurité Civile. 
In our Emergency Services business, we 
have maintained leading positions in all 
the countries where we operate, and 
have continued to trade well throughout 
the year, as demonstrated by a number of 
recent contract wins, including important 
rebids and extensions. 
During the year, we successfully renewed 
contracts for the provision of nationwide 
and regional firefighting and search and 
rescue services in Spain on behalf of the 
Spanish Government, and in October 
55 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Operational review continued
we renewed the main medical services 
contract in Spain’s Castilla‑La Mancha 
region, one of the most significant 
services in Spain, where we have a 
15‑year customer relationship and have 
pioneered emergency night flights. 
We also continued to build on our 
presence in Ireland, with the award of 
a new three‑year contract to support 
the helicopter operations of the Irish 
National Police Service. A three‑year 
contract with Air Ambulance Northern 
Ireland also began in Spring 2017. In 
Wales, we will create one of the UK’s 
most technologically advanced fleet of 
charity air ambulances under a seven‑year 
agreement to provide the Wales Air 
Ambulance charity with new EMS aircraft.
In Italy, we signed two new contracts 
to continue providing helicopter 
emergency services (HEMS) operations 
to the healthcare service of the Italian 
Alto Adige and Abruzzo regions. Under 
the contract, Babcock Italy will provide 
a 24‑hour emergency service with 
new Airbus’ and Leonardo Helicopters’ 
technologies. Both contracts have been 
awarded for a period of nine years. In 
Australia, we are running operations for 
the Victorian Government’s Ambulance 
Victoria service and have renewed our 
emergency medical services contract at 
Horn Island. 
In October, we secured a new long‑term 
emergency medical services contract in 
the South West region of France, where 
we will provide and operate five aircraft 
for the French Ministry of Health.
In Scandinavia, a new five‑year contract 
will see Babcock operate two new HEMS 
aircraft in Stockholm and a fixed wing 
operation in Northern Sweden and we 
will be introducing new AW169 aircraft 
in Scandinavia.
As previously flagged, challenging 
conditions in the oil and gas sector have 
continued to impact our business in 
the North Sea and Australia, especially 
following the grounding of the Super 
Puma helicopters following an accident 
involving one of our competitors’ aircraft, 
with some delays and cancellations of 
bids. Despite this, we secured a long‑term 
extension to an existing contract in the 
UK, renewed two oil and gas contracts 
and won two new additional contracts 
with an existing customer in Italy, 
becoming the sole provider of these 
services in the country. We have once 
again increased our market position in 
Australia with the award of two new 
long‑term contracts by Chevron and 
Conoco Phillips. Margins and volumes 
remain challenging and are expected to 
continue to be so over the medium term.
In October, Babcock was awarded a 
five‑year contract by the consortium 
TOTAL‑ENI for Offshore Transportation and 
MEDEVAC operations in Congo, increasing 
our presence in Africa. And, recently, 
Babcock Italy has secured a new contract 
with ENI to provide oil and gas services 
from two new bases on the Adriatic Sea. 
MCS has also reinforced its position in 
the renewable energy market, winning 
a contract to support DONG Energy’s 
offshore Walney Extension wind farm.
Safety remains the highest priority for 
MCS. However, whilst MCS’ air accident 
rates are at their lowest recorded levels 
and well below the worldwide industry 
average, tragically in January 2017 an 
EMS helicopter crashed in Italy resulting 
in the loss of six people. 
In other international business, we were 
delighted to be awarded a contract to 
support Qantas’ GSE fleet at 60 locations 
across Australia. The five‑year contract, 
with an option for a further five years, 
streamlines the management of the 
airline’s fleet of over 10,000 ground 
service equipment assets. Babcock 
will deliver a programme to improve 
the equipment’s reliability and provide 
significant long‑term capability and cost 
benefits. The contract to support GSE at 
Babcock upgrades technical fleet capability in South Australia 
Babcock, in supporting the Government of South Australia, has upgraded its 
fleet of three aircraft with increased technical capability utilising Electro‑Optical 
Infra‑Red System (EOIRS) technology to enhance outcomes for tactical 
surveillance and search and rescue missions.
The project has been coordinated by the Babcock Mission Critical Services team 
in Australia with the final solution chosen to provide the latest technology for the 
customer’s requirements.
The upgrade includes turrets that provide superior high definition imaging 
resolution and were chosen for the low‑weight installation and flexibility.
This system is teamed with a mission management system and 
specifically‑designed mounts for screens to view imagery and supported  
through a dedicated console.

Rome’s Fiumicino airport is performing 
well, however, Alitalia’s financial 
difficulties create uncertainty as to the 
ongoing viability of this contract.
MCS continues to work with other 
Babcock divisions to help facilitate 
growth through existing strong customer 
relationships, operational credibility and 
administration in the geographies in 
which the Group operates. 
In South Africa, the Power business 
continued to grow both in transmission 
and generation on the back of Eskom 
power station maintenance and niche 
engineering and construction contracts 
on the new power stations at Medupi and 
Kusile. These contracts include design 
engineering, mill construction and high 
pressure piping installations. Further 
progress was made on our strategy of 
winning power work outside of Eskom 
with wins at Sasol and a number of 
industrial customers.
Our Equipment business continued to 
grow market share in a depressed market 
which, after a very slow first half, showed 
signs of strength on the back of increasing 
commodity prices. This resulted in a very 
strong final quarter leading into year end. 
Aftermarket spares and service performed 
well throughout the year as customers 
focused on life‑extension programmes 
through the downturn. The new Terex 
product line followed the same pattern 
as Volvo, with significant orders won in 
the last quarter.
Sustainability
MCS understands that mission critical 
success depends on people – both 
our own team members and the 
communities we serve.
We work with local communities to 
improve our shared environment and we 
take the time to help people understand 
what we do, particularly through working 
with local schools and youth groups. We 
believe that giving people the opportunity 
to see our aircraft up close and to speak 
with the pilots, engineers, rescuers, 
doctors and nurses who carry out our 
missions is a key part of who we are.
For example, a programme of school 
visits has seen pilots and search and 
rescue crew members at MCS Offshore 
share their experiences with hundreds 
of local school children with the aim of 
inspiring them and generating interest 
in STEM subjects.
Our employees continually demonstrate 
their capabilities, often in the most 
challenging of circumstances. Three 
Babcock pilots made up the entire 
shortlist of the 2016 Association of Air 
Ambulance ‘Pilot of the Year’ award. 
Richard Steele was the worthy recipient 
of the award for his continued efforts on 
behalf of his customer, the Midlands Air 
Ambulance Charity.
Also, the International Maritime 
Organisation awarded an Honourable 
Mention to both the Pesca II (Galician 
Coastguard) and the Helimer 401 
(Spanish Rescue and Maritime Safety 
Agency) for their part in the rescue of 
the 22 crew members of the Modern 
Express vessel.
We are aware of our responsibility to the 
environment and the need to deliver a 
sustainable business. Our work in this area 
includes numerous initiatives to reduce 
the environmental impact of operations 
– from capturing CO
2
 at our Spanish 
operations to recycling waste oil and 
installing new energy‑efficient lighting 
in Aberdeen. We also work with groups 
to help reforest areas that have been 
affected by fires.
MCS has developed and is implementing 
an industry leading Fatigue Risk 
Management System (FRMS) integrated 
within its Safety Management System 
to manage fatigue‑related risks. This 
FRMS will apply to all flying operations 
defined in each company’s operations 
manuals and all flight crew members 
and associated personnel involved in 
these operations.
Workplace health and safety, aligned with 
the direction set by the corporate safety 
steering group, has enjoyed an overall 
reduction in workplace injuries and lost 
time compared to 2015. However, in 
South Africa we were saddened by the 
loss of one of our colleagues as a result of 
a fall from a power transmission line.
During the year, Babcock in Africa 
has continued with its programme of 
supporting 25 talented but financially 
disadvantaged children with bursaries 
to private highschools. This programme 
has proved successful and our first 
students are now entering universities, 
subsidised by Babcock, and we hope 
will provide potential candidates for our 
graduate employment programme. In 
addition, our diversity activities include 
15 disabled employees working full time 
for Babcock at year end.
Our support continues with an orphanage 
catering for AIDS orphans, as well as a 
training programme, to upgrade skills 
for science and mathematics school 
teachers. Our apprentice training 
programme has over 50 apprentices on 
a four‑year automotive training course.
57 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Sustainability
Delivering and maintaining 
a sustainable business
Our priority is to ensure that Babcock continues to 
focus on creating long‑term value for shareholders 
through a strong and sustainable business.
With the Group realignment in place, 
we understand now more than ever 
that how we deal with our customers, 
our employees, our suppliers, and the 
communities in which we operate, and 
our impact on the environment are all 
fundamental to rolling out the next phase 
in Babcock’s history, achieving our plans 
and delivering performance. Core to 
the Group realignment is how we invest 
in and support our people to deliver 
sustainable growth across the sectors. It is 
our belief that strong success can only be 
delivered through a sustainable business, 
which is why at Babcock we uphold the 
strictest standards of business ethics, 
deliver a competitive talent development 
programme and put safety at the 
forefront of everything we do.
Babcock has deep technical expertise 
in providing a wide array of complex 
engineering services across four sectors, 
with a growing, international footprint. 
We are trusted to deliver in a range of 
markets and countries by operating, 
supporting and managing complex 
infrastructure, assets and training 
programmes. We are therefore required 
to consider a diverse and complex range 
of stakeholders, interests and concerns. 
We look to do this by maintaining 
three overarching, underpinning and 
interlinking pillars of sustainability as 
discussed in this report.
Over the next five years, we aim to grow, 
both in the UK and internationally, and, 
with the organisational structure now in 
place to support growth, one of the next 
key enablers to our success is people and 
potential. We believe that we can sustain 
the long‑term future of our business 
through investing in and supporting our 
talent, through technical apprenticeships, 
graduate schemes, training and 
career development with succession 
opportunities across the Group and also 
through identifying and training talented 
people to implement growth.
Our ability to attract, recruit, retain 
and develop the people we need now 
and in the future is also fundamental 
to that long‑term success. Recruitment 
Archie Bethel CBE, Chief Executive
campaigns and initiatives in the 
apprentice and graduate programmes 
as well as talent development and 
management training schemes are 
intended to underpin the long‑term 
future success of the Company. The 
support we look to provide will also 
serve the interests of individuals and 
local economies.
In implementing our growth plans, we 
continue to work hard to protect the 
health and safety of our employees 
and others and to avoid or keep to 
a minimum any adverse effect of 
our operations on the surrounding 
environment. Our Group‑wide Code of 
Business Conduct, supplemented by 
appropriate guidance and training, is not 
only the right approach to doing business 
in itself but is also intended to support 
long‑term success by minimising financial 
risk and sustaining our reputation. 
During the year, we have continued to 
demonstrate Babcock’s commitment to 
diversity in engineering by stepping up 
our relationships with universities and 
schools to encourage students to take 
up science, technology, engineering 
and maths (STEM) both in the UK and 
internationally. In Vancouver, Canada, 
we set up a new STEM competition 
in partnership with the regional 
government. We also continue to foster 
diversity in the workforce, and hosted 
a Women In Science and Engineering 
(WISE) event in Rosyth to recognise the 
invaluable contribution made by women 
in the industry. Initiatives such as these 
form part of our continued commitment 
to enhance our highly skilled workforce, 
allowing us to foster the talent needed 
to achieve and sustain our strategic 
aims. How we go about delivering our 
commitment to sustainability is discussed 
further in this report, and additionally in 
the sustainability section of each of our 
divisions’ operational reviews.

STEM outreach – inspiring the next generation around the world
In 2016, we significantly increased the impact of our Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) outreach programme… 
In Canada:
Building on the success of our sponsorship 
of the Telegraph STEM Awards in the UK, 
this year we established Babcock Canada 
as the presenting sponsor of the inaugural 
STEM Spotlight Awards – a competition 
designed for STEM enthusiasts from 
non‑traditional education backgrounds, 
such as technical training programmes 
and apprenticeships. The competition 
challenged young people to solve a 
specific problem in the transportation, 
infrastructure, energy, sustainability and 
technology sectors in British Columbia. 
Additionally, Babcock Canada’s recent 
investment of $800,000 into Camosun 
College’s TRADEMark of Excellence 
campaign will support next generation 
specialised equipment in the college’s 
new Interaction Lab, a valuable asset to 
British Columbia’s skilled workforce, and 
to STEM students throughout Babcock 
Canada. Finally, at this year’s IMarEST 
European International Submarine Races, 
Babcock sponsored a team of students 
from Montreal’s École de Technologie 
Supérieure (É.T .S) allowing them to race 
and showcase their human‑powered 
submarines, as well as partnering 
with É.T .S to launch the ‘Babcock 
Excellence Award’, with the aim of 
promoting and recognising innovative 
engineering students.

Graduate diversity
In Australia: 
Babcock Australia also ran several 
exciting STEM initiatives this year, 
with university outreach including a 
sponsorship of Adelaide University’s 
Ingenuity Exhibition – which showcased 
Final Year engineering projects, a work 
placement and mentoring scheme for 
undergraduates in the CASG Department 
of Defence industry programme, and the 
sponsorship of a PHD project researching 
underwater shock modelling through the 
Research Training Centre for Naval Design 
& Manufacture.
We also engage with STEM at a younger 
age in Australia, partnering with Brighton 
High School to provide engineering 
resources as part of the ‘SUBS in schools’ 
programme. The programme is designed 
to engage interest in the technology 
of submersible vehicles and prepare 
students to enter the new industries 
arising as a result of projects such as 
Australia’s Future Submarine Program.
We pride ourselves on our commitment 
to inspiring the next generation of 
engineers and scientists by actively 
breaking down stereotypes about what 
it means to have a career in STEM. The 
diversity of the STEM Ambassadors 
leading our activities is a great example of 
what the future of engineering looks like, 
and our schools have reported a huge 
amount of enthusiasm and an increase in 
female participation at our events. 
In the UK: 
With over 400 volunteer Babcock STEM 
Ambassadors delivering more than 300 
hours of outreach every month in local 
schools and colleges, our programme 
now reaches tens of thousands of 
students across the country. We deliver 
highly successful after‑school clubs 
and workshops at UK primary schools, 
providing young children with a fun, 
hands‑on introduction to engineering, 
and this year we were delighted to 
support three schools in the national 
finals of the prestigious Big Bang Awards. 
Our range of STEM activities spans across 
the higher education system to university 
level, where we embed Design, Make and 
Test weeks into university curricula.
From 7‑11 year olds creating and racing 
‘Goblin Cars’ built at after‑school clubs 
with Babcock engineers, to Year 13 
students presenting their design and 
creation of a load transfer device to 
Babcock managers at Devonport Royal 
Dockyard, our STEM outreach activities 
provide young people with unique and 
exciting opportunities to engage with the 
world of engineering.
Throughout this document, you will find 
examples of Babcock’s commitment 
to STEM activity, and some of the faces 
behind that commitment. We’re proud 
of our growing engagement with STEM, 
and even more proud of the people who 
make that engagement possible.

The efficiencies we deliver through 
effective contract management, 
innovation and through‑life 
management enable us to return value 
to our customers, our colleagues and 
our investors.
We buy a wide range of goods 
and services and need reliable, 
high‑performing suppliers across all 
aspects of our supply chain. Babcock 
seeks to ensure that our customers’ 
money is spent efficiently and responsibly 
and that our supply contracts are 
managed effectively. We expect 
our supply chain to adhere to our 
standards of ethical behaviour, and 
our environmental, health and safety 
and  other working practices.
Profit
Profit is largely delivered through 
our ability to manage our operations 
effectively. A significant part of this is 
driven through our relationships with 
suppliers. Over 50% of our cost base is 
via third party suppliers and our approach 
and ability to manage these relationships 
impact our ability to deliver performance 
and margin.
Over the past year, we have looked 
for supplier efficiencies across the 
organisation. This has included 
contract efficiencies through upfront 
procurement, involvement in the bid 
process, operational productivity through 
increased innovation and quality, and 
streamlined internal processes.
Babcock has implemented a rigorous 
programme across our procurement and 
supply chain function. The objective has 
been to drive best practices across the 
organisation. As a result of this initiative, 
procurement is engaging earlier in order 
to help provide our customers with the 
best possible solution while improving 
profitability. Early pre‑bid engagement 
by the procurement function allows 
our bid teams to understand potential 
market capabilities, while engagement 
as part of the team means we can 
aim to put together a proposal for the 
customer that meets the needs and 
requirements of the customer in the most 
efficient way possible, while establishing 
supplier relationships that are robust and 
sustainable in the long term.
The output of successful procurement 
activities is better value for our customers 
and shareholders through the delivery of 
effective and efficient sourcing activities. 
Savings targets are ambitious, and 
ongoing efforts to obtain efficiencies 
and lower our cost base help to increase 
profitability. Key metrics are reported 
each month to a divisional and Group 
Governance Board and approved by 
each business unit Finance Director.
Performance 
Building long‑term relationships 
We are always looking for better, 
innovative ways of serving our customers. 
Our responsibility is to provide them 
with the best options to ensure success. 
When we identify a more efficient way 
of servicing their requirements we discuss 
these options and work in collaboration 
with the customer to bring efficiency 
benefits while delivering a quality service.
The Procurement and Supply Chain team 
is actively engaged in the bidding process 
with existing and new customers. This 
enables us to bring the most effective 
offer to our customers. We are often able 
to leverage existing arrangements to offer 
a cost‑effective solution.
Suppliers
We believe that establishing long‑term 
relationships with our suppliers is an 
important part of building long‑term 
relationships with our customers. As 
part of a structured programme across 
business units and Group categories, 
the procurement and supply chain 
function is raising commercial capability 
by engaging in supplier relationship 
management programmes with 
strategic suppliers.
We have over 10,000 suppliers; however, 
we have strategic relationships with 
around 250 of them. By building an 
appropriate engagement model with 
our suppliers, we are able to effectively 
drive quality and innovation across our 
supplier base. Strategic suppliers are key 
partners in our ability to deliver quality 
service. As a result, we work closely 
with these suppliers to ensure optimal 
performance, ongoing improvement 
and innovation support.
We continue to develop end‑to‑end 
procurement tools that enable us to 
transact efficiently with our suppliers. 
These tools also provide a common 
approach, which enables us to share 
best practice across the organisation. 
We are able to use consistent business 
intelligence, which allows us to work 
collaboratively with our suppliers 
and focus on innovation and other 
value‑adding initiatives.
The e‑procurement tools that we are 
implementing provide a faster and 
more effective way of transacting with 
our supply base, resulting in sustainable 
relationships that are based on 
operationally robust processes.
We want to spend time talking to our 
suppliers about new ideas, operational 
performance and total cost opportunities 
– not about payment. We understand 
the importance of predictable customer 
payments when running a business. That 
is why Babcock is a signatory in the UK to 
the Prompt Payment Code and we would 
encourage others in our supply chain to 
make the same commitment.
Delivering business critical support 
using high‑performing, 
ethical suppliers
Our customers rely on our ability to 
provide a robust and effective supply 
chain. We take this responsibility very 
seriously and work in collaboration 
with other industry leaders to create a 
process that optimises risk management 
while encouraging the use of SMEs. 
Potential suppliers must demonstrate 
their financial, commercial and technical 
capability to meet our contractual 
requirements. We also look for a clear 
demonstration of commitment to 
corporate social responsibility.
Profit and performance
61 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Sustainability continued
Profit and performance continued
We expect high standards of conduct 
from our suppliers in what they do for 
us or our customers and will not accept 
any behaviour contrary to our codes, 
including bribery, corruption and fraud, 
threats to health and safety, conflicts of 
interest or other improper practices.
We pre‑qualify suppliers for certain 
types of supply before admitting them 
to the supply chain, and this involves 
satisfying ourselves that they can 
meet our standards. Certain suppliers 
will be selected for audit and close 
monitoring based on risk assessment or 
supplier performance. Planned reviews 
of supply chain risk are undertaken by 
our businesses.
Babcock is a key member of the joint 
MOD/industry initiative to deliver an 
effective Defence Cyber Protection 
Partnership. The Group is tasked with 
improving the protection of the defence 
supply chain from cyber threat. Babcock 
is represented on working groups for 
each of the three core work strands: 
information sharing, measurements and 
standards, and supply chain awareness. 
A primary objective has been to define 
a number of risk‑based controls to be 
applied across the relevant supplier base.
We continuously review whether our 
suppliers comply with the standards set 
out in our Code of Business Conduct. 
Last year, we simplified and standardised 
these procedures in line with the criteria 
in the anti‑corruption and competition 
compliance policy. Consequently, the 
self‑assessment process for suppliers 
was updated. In addition to the 
self‑assessment initiative, we now require 
additional evidence which gives us 
objective, verifiable supplier ratings.
Babcock is committed to creating a safe 
working environment that aims to enable 
all those working on, or visiting, Babcock 
operations to be able to return ‘Home 
Safe Everyday’. We seek to work only 
with suppliers who we believe are able to 
both meet and promote our standards – 
those that share our commitment to safe 
behaviour and performance in delivering 
services and solutions for our customers. 
Our teams aim to work with suppliers on 
safety and share continuous improvement 
practices to reduce or prevent accidents 
and injuries.
Protecting the information and 
physical assets of our customers is an 
increasingly important part of what 
we do. We always expect the highest 
controls of commercial confidentiality. 
For certain types of supply, we are 
developing exacting standards of security 
compliance. For these companies, we 
need to be certain that information is 
well managed and protected throughout 
the supply chain.
Supporting local economies by using 
diverse, locally procured services
We take our responsibility to support local 
economies seriously. The varied nature 
of what we do means that we depend 
on a wide range of talents and abilities 
from a wide range of suppliers. As part of 
our supplier programme, we have been 
managing compliance through a system 
of preferred suppliers. This approach 
is enhancing our supplier relationships 
and allows us to focus on effective 
management of our SME supplier base.
Supplier credibility, responsibility, quality 
and service performance matter. Many 
of our suppliers are small and medium 
sized enterprises. We select and manage 
suppliers to support our own experienced 
workforce in delivering complex, critical 
and often bespoke engineering services. 
Diversification of supply where possible 
makes our supply chain more robust in 
helping us to deliver for our customers.
Critical supply partner for 
through‑life support
Joint teams from Babcock and our 
supply chain engage on a wide 
range of issues such as maintenance 
planning, supply support, support 
and test equipment, training and 
training devices, and technical data. 
Targeted supply relationships use data 
dashboards to monitor performance and 
progress. Babcock is actively involved 
with our suppliers in the Aerospace, 
Defence and Security Supply Chain 
development programme.
We also lead dialogue with Government, 
suppliers and skills agencies to help 
address the skills requirement agenda, 
with the aim of ensuring that there are 
enough people with the right skills to 
fill our own vacancies and those in our 
supply chain.
Success story in the making
Engineering ace Tom Bennett, who 
works with Babcock’s Defence 
Systems Technology team in Bristol, 
joined an elite group late last year 
when he received a prestigious 
Institute of Mechanical Engineers 
(IMechE) Whitworth Award. He was 
nominated for the award by the 
University of the West of England 
(UWE), following a presentation 
on his experiences of as part of 
Babcock’s four‑year Technical 
Apprentice Scheme. 
Tom, now a ‘Whitworth Scholar’, 
finished the Scheme early and 
was appointed first as an Assistant 
Engineer and then Engineer at the 
Bristol site where his grandfather 
worked in the 1930s. He is now 
in his second year of a part‑time 
BEng in Mechanical Engineering 
at the UWE. 
Babcock supported Tom’s 
ambitions from the start of 
his apprenticeship, giving him 
well‑earned responsibility and the 
chance to get ‘hands on’ in the 
workshops. He got on the fast‑track 
to university after being identified 
as a keen draughtsman and 
someone who showed a real talent 
for engineering.

People and potential
As our business expands, the 
development of our people is a critical 
part of our business strategy. To underpin 
and sustain long‑term strategic growth, 
Babcock must ensure that it has the 
right people to be able and trusted 
to deliver to customers on technically 
complex, long‑term contracts, both 
today and in the future. We aim to 
achieve this by continually improving 
our talent management arrangements. 
Our Group Director of Organisation and 
Development coordinates this activity 
across the Group.
Our business arrangements require 
us to deliver services across an array 
of projects and assets. Our people 
need to have a range of experience, 
skills and competencies: engineering, 
management, technical, commercial, 
administrative and developmental, to 
name but a few. We recognise that 
it is the skills and commitment of our 
employees that define our uniqueness 
and our ability to deliver services to 
our customers.
Planning for growth 
and succession
Succession planning is a key focus 
throughout the businesses, from 
apprentices to Board level. We have 
plans in place that identify immediate 
and/or future potential successors to key 
senior management posts. We also have 
individual training and development plans 
for those identified.
Through our annually refreshed future 
resource planning process, we assess 
whether we have the right number 
of staff with the necessary skills and 
capabilities, both now and for the 
future. This process is based on data 
and assumptions such as workforce 
demographics, attrition and business 
growth and feeds into our future focused 
resourcing strategies.
Focus on recruitment, retention and 
development of talent
We recognise that an employee’s 
relationship with Babcock starts before 
they even apply to us. A variety of 
advertising routes are used to ensure 
vacancies are marketed to the widest 
possible audience. Our processes are 
constantly reviewed to ensure that 
candidates experience a professional, 
efficient and friendly recruitment and 
‘onboarding’ procedure. A new computer 
system has recently been implemented 
to increase the ease of making an 
application and further streamline the 
move from candidate to employee.
We deploy a number of techniques to 
motivate our workforce. To check that 
we are achieving our objective, we 
seek feedback from employees via a 
number of routes such as an international 
employee forum and employee surveys. 
We use the feedback to identify any areas 
for improvement and then develop action 
plans to address these matters.
In addition to the training and 
development provided at divisional and 
business unit level we have Group‑wide 
management development resources:
• Babcock offers an MBA programme to 
our high‑potential employees. We have 
continued our commitment to this 
programme and currently have two 
cohorts progressing through it
Babcock and the Vine Trust around the world
Babcock works closely with the Scottish‑based charity, the Vine Trust, which 
provides life‑changing medical, home‑building and care support to vulnerable 
families and children in severe poverty in Tanzania and Peru. The joint projects 
we embark on enable our employees to utilise the skills and experience they 
have gained in a very different way, directly supporting people in dire need 
of assistance. This year will see us bid farewell to the Forth Hope medical ship 
we have been converting at our Rosyth site as she sets sail to support some of 
the world’s most impoverished communities. In parallel, we have established a 
partnership that will see Babcock employees join Vine Trust volunteers on 14‑day 
expeditions to the Tanzanian municipality of Moshi. The first such group will 
leave in October this year. During the mission, 25 Babcock volunteers will work 
with the Vine Trust in the town on the lower slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, to 
build two houses that will help families stay together following the loss of parents 
or carers.
63 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 • The Babcock Academy, run in 
conjunction with Strathclyde University 
since 2005, continues to provide a 
structured framework for our managers 
to improve their managerial skills and 
strategic awareness
• Each division has identified talent pools 
and reviews their development on a 
quarterly basis.
We are also considering how 
development through apprenticeships 
can support the ongoing development 
of our existing workforce. We are 
therefore piloting a Level 4 management 
apprenticeship with existing staff this year.
Encouraging young people into 
engineering through leading 
apprentice and 
graduate programmes
Our graduate and apprenticeship 
schemes are intended to support 
business requirements with the aim of 
securing the skills and expertise we need 
now and in the future, and we seek to 
provide as many opportunities as those 
requirements justify.
With regard to graduates, we 
recruited 181 graduates for the 2016/17 
intake under our Group graduate 
programme (2015/16: 195).
At the date of this report, we expect 
to recruit over 197 graduates for 
the 2017/18 intake. In addition to 
our Group graduate scheme, we 
recruit many graduates directly to 
management positions.
At 31 March 2017, there were 717 
apprentices across the Group 
(2016: 714) of whom 222 were 
recruited during the year (2016: 232). 
The general stability in these numbers 
over the last few years demonstrates the 
commitment we have to apprenticeship 
training. Of those completing their 
training, over 97.7% (2016: 93.3%) were 
appointed into substantive roles within 
the Group.
In addition to our well established 
intermediate and advanced 
apprenticeship programmes, this 
year we have launched higher level 
apprenticeships in engineering and 
management with 60 apprentices 
currently on programme. To support the 
continued growth of apprenticeships, 
we plan to launch apprenticeships in 
digital risk and security (cyber) and 
project management.
We continue to work towards the 
target of having 5% of our workforce on 
structured training schemes, as part of 
our membership of the ‘5% Club’. We are 
closer to our target this year and remain 
on track to exceed this commitment.
Our Group‑wide commitments 
to STEM subjects
As a Group, we have a number of 
initiatives to promote activities which 
motivate and inspire young people to 
experience and understand the real 
world application of science, technology, 
engineering and maths (STEM) subjects. A 
variety of techniques have been deployed 
including training STEM Ambassadors 
who volunteer their time and support to 
promote STEM subjects to young learners, 
and providing industry placements. This 
means teachers from local schools spend 
a fortnight on one of our sites gaining an 
insight into Babcock, the type of work 
we undertake and the opportunities for 
young people. Furthermore, a number of 
schools have been identified to pilot the 
STEM engagement year‑long programme. 
The feedback on this initiative from all 
parties has been very positive.
Diversity
At Babcock, we believe diversity is about 
more than age, race, colour, ethnic 
origin, gender, marital status, religious 
or political beliefs, sexual orientation 
or disability. We believe diversity is 
also about embracing the advantages 
different experiences, skills and outlooks 
can bring.
Our diversity initiative, ‘All together 
different’, is championed by a Diversity 
Steering Group, which coordinates the 
implementation of our equality and 
diversity policy.
Equal opportunities and awareness 
of diversity are part of our talent

management system. As a business, it is 
imperative that we ensure access to the 
widest pool of talent available, selecting 
the best candidates based on their 
ability to do the job. Working with these 
expectations for diversity enables us to 
deliver our best for our customers and to 
safeguard the future of Babcock.
Babcock operates principally in sectors 
that have until recently traditionally 
been regarded as ‘male’, such as 
engineering and working with the 
Armed Forces. Inevitably, companies 
with this background will tend to be 
starting from a level of relatively low 
female participation, especially in 
management positions. However, we 
are working hard to change this: 19.5% 
(around 6,971) of our total workforce is 
female (male: 28,779), with 22% (95) 
female senior executives (male: 336), 
and two (18.2%) female Directors on our 
Board (males: nine).
We have continued to work on the 
challenges of being a woman within 
our organisation. A series of actions and 
development programmes are being 
implemented across the organisation 
following this. We focus our graduate 
recruitment programme, particularly 
for engineering graduates, on those 
universities that have a richer gender 
mix. In 2017, 21.0% (2016: 20%) of 
those employed on our graduate scheme 
were female.
In 2015, we became a member of 
OUTstanding, a not‑for‑profit professional 
network for LGBT executives and their 
allies. Like us, OUTstanding understands 
that it is executives that set the tone 
and culture of an organisation and 
their support at this level will support 
our diversity agenda. We have now 
also become a founder member of 
UPstanding, which champions equal 
opportunities for black, Asian and 
minority ethnic group (BAME) employees.
Our commitment to the 
Armed Forces
In January last year, the UK Defence 
Secretary recognised Babcock as an 
employer who has made an outstanding 
commitment to supporting the Armed 
Forces by presenting us with a Gold 
Award from the Armed Forces Covenant 
Employer Recognition Scheme (ERS). We 
are committed to the Total Support Force 
and actively recruit service leavers and 
reservists. To continue the commitment, 
we will be hosting our annual reserves 
conference to encourage employees in 
June. Archie Bethel will also be re‑signing 
the reserves covenant.
People and Potential
In September, we held this year’s 
Dialogue Conference to discuss and 
support diversity. We continued to focus 
on gender diversity whilst also looking 
more widely at issues of ethnicity, 
disability and sexual orientation, 
challenging our unconscious bias and 
how we can make the changes to 
improve diversity among our workforce. 
The event proved insightful, progressive 
and paved the way for a dynamic 
future for Babcock. It was also a useful 
opportunity to share best practice across 
the divisions.
Babcock Spain collaborates with the Ministry of Agriculture in 
reforestation to combat greenhouse gas emissions
Babcock MCS España is working with the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture 
(MAGRAMA) to develop a programme where Babcock employees can voluntarily 
cooperate in reforesting fire‑affected areas. This initiative will take place in ‘La 
Granadella’, a natural coastal area in Xabia (Alicante) that was heavily affected 
by a fire in September 2016, which devastated more than 700 hectares. 
With the aid of flora micro reserves technicians, the volunteers will help in 
the reforestation of the affected area, doing the follow‑up of the planting and 
irrigation during the first year.
This initiative is a part of the programme ‘Babcock MCS España compensates’, a 
new initiative proposed by the environmental department as a measure against 
global warming, that includes a record of our carbon footprint which guarantees 
the voluntary commitment we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Our commitment to strict ethical 
conduct, together with the importance 
we place on health and safety and our 
respect towards the wider society and 
environment in which we work, are the 
foundation of a sustainable business.
Ethics and governance
We understand that our reputation and 
good name are amongst our greatest 
assets, which could easily be lost by 
actual or suspected corrupt or unethical 
behaviour. To protect the Company 
and reduce these risks, we have set 
out a policy on how we should conduct 
business, which we summarise in the 
form of the Babcock Code of Business 
Conduct. Compliance with this policy is 
compulsory for our employees, business 
advisers and business partners (or, in the 
case of business advisers and partners, 
they must have equivalent standards 
and procedures in their own businesses). 
The policy comprises a detailed manual, 
available on the Group’s intranet, that 
contains guidelines, authorisation and 
other procedures aimed at identifying 
and reducing corruption and ethical risks. 
The controls that we have in place form 
an integral part of our risk management 
arrangements and include the training 
of employees and availability of 
whistleblowing hotlines. During the year, 
a Babcock Supplier’s Code of Business 
Conduct was published to further 
promote these values throughout our 
supply chain.
More details of these risk management 
procedures can be found on pages 68 
to 70, and the Ethics Policy and Code of 
Business Conduct and Suppliers’ Code 
of Conduct on our website. Further 
information about our whistleblowing 
process can be found on page 70.
Human rights
As an international business, we recognise 
our responsibility for upholding and 
protecting the human rights of our 
employees and other individuals with 
whom we deal in our operations across 
the world. We welcome the opportunity 
we have to contribute positively to global 
efforts to ensure that human rights are 
understood and observed. 
We believe that a culture of respect 
for, and promotion of, human rights is 
embedded throughout our business and 
can be demonstrated by our commitment 
to ethical conduct in everything we do. 
The Group’s Modern Slavery Transparency 
Statement, which is published annually 
on our website, details action taken 
to support the elimination of modern 
slavery and human trafficking.
Ensuring safety
Safety governance
Our Group‑wide goal is that everybody 
goes home safe every day. To achieve 
this, we invest in safety, providing suitable 
resources, training and time with priority 
given to addressing behavioural and 
cultural attitudes.
We also expect our managers 
to personally set a good example, 
listening to and involving others. We 
recognise that the work environment 
is constantly changing so we regularly 
review how we work to ensure it is the 
safest it can be. We aim to share our 
know‑how, ideas, experiences, successes 
and failures so we can continue to learn 
and improve.
Sector safety leadership teams and the 
Group Safety Steering Group oversee 
implementation of policy, strategy and 
initiatives across all of our businesses.
The Group Executive Committee reviews 
monthly commentary and performance 
reports and the Board receives half‑yearly 
commentary and performance 
reports for discussion.
Performance
Tragically, there have been two unrelated 
incidents that have led to fatalities in 
the business. In December 2016, one 
of our colleagues in our South African 
business lost his life after falling from a 
power transmission line. The accident has 
been investigated by the South African 
authorities and the outcome is awaited. 
In the meantime, our South African 
business has conducted its own internal 
investigation and has rigorously  
re‑emphasised its focus on safety. In 
January 2017, one of our helicopters, 
whilst out on an emergency rescue 
mission, crashed in central Italy. The 
accident resulted in the death of two 
colleagues and four passengers. The 
incident is now being investigated by 
the Italian authorities. Where there 
are lessons to be learnt, they will be

stringently applied. Health and safety 
is a core value for the Group and we 
monitor performance through a number 
of measures. Over the last year, across the 
Group, we have seen an 18% reduction in 
the total injuries and a 32% reduction in 
our RIDDOR accident numbers.
Managing 
environmental impacts
Our commitment to reducing the 
harmful environmental impact of 
what we do continues. We seek to 
apply our engineering acumen to use 
resources more efficiently throughout 
our operations.
We have successfully achieved 
recertification to the Carbon Trust 
Standard for all our UK operations, 
reducing our CO
2
 emissions against the 
metric of tonnes CO
2
 per £m turnover. 
The Company has held the certification 
continuously since 2010.
Our adoption of a centralised software 
system for monitoring our environmental 
impacts has greatly assisted our drive 
to improve the collection, collation and 
reporting of energy and environmental 
data and will continue to help in our 
commitment to continual improvement.
Following our comprehensive audit of 
the Group’s energy use for the Energy 
Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS), 
the opportunities for energy savings 
and efficiencies have been reviewed 
and action plans to target the most 
effective measures identified, with energy 
saving projects implemented across the 
business. Examples of what has been 
achieved during the year can be found 
in the Sustainability sections of the 
Operational reviews on pages 38 to 57.

revenue’ has been used to provide a more meaningful measure of energy use throughout the business. 
The total emissions from Scope 1, 2 and 3 sources have been divided by the annual revenue to 
provide a final benchmark figure, the Intensity ratio. The prior year numbers have been adjusted to 
include some additional consumption data that was not available at the time of the last report.
Babcock committed to managing energy consumption with customers 
Babcock in partnership with Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) is 
delivering an innovative energy reduction scheme that has reduced emissions 
across the enduring MOD estate in Germany by 2,773 tCO
2
 and saved in excess 
of €980,000.
Babcock was tasked to undertake the energy procurement on behalf of the DIO 
for the MOD Germany estate, and it was agreed that some of the savings from 
this exercise would be invested in the estate to reduce energy consumption.
The project identified the enduring MOD sites (those with more than a five‑year 
life), and the Babcock energy team undertook energy surveys on the sites to 
identify energy saving opportunities. Babcock undertook investment into the 
identified schemes and agreed a gain share with DIO to enable the capital to 
be recovered.

arrangements (unless delegated to the 
Board’s Finance Committee) must be 
approved by the Board. The Board 
considers and reviews the controls and 
mitigation plans in place; these are 
intended to manage and reduce the 
potential impact of the risks the Company 
takes to ensure, so far as possible, that 
the assets and reputation of the Group 
are protected.
The Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems can, however, 
only seek to manage, not eliminate, the 
risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, as any system can only provide 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Franco Martinelli, Group Finance Director
Babcock has an established formal 
process that aims to identify and evaluate 
risks and how they are to be managed. 
A range of internal control processes is 
in place as part of the risk management 
regime. The Board, principally through 
the Audit and Risk Committee, keeps 
under review the risks facing the Group, 
including the appropriateness of the level 
of risk the Group may accept in order to 
achieve its strategic objectives. The Board 
ensures that it controls the risk appetite 
of the Group through its delegated 
authorities, which impose strict controls 
on the Group – for example, all 
acquisitions and disposals, all material 
capital expenditure, all material 
non‑ordinary course tenders (material 
ordinary course tenders are approved

The Group Risk and Insurance 
Manager (who reports to the Group 
Finance Director), working with senior 
operational management teams, keeps 
the risk register and risk assessment 
and evaluation process under review 
and development. We seek to ensure 
a coherent and consistent Group best 
practice approach to risk assessment 
and risk management. Risk assessments 
made at business unit level are subject 
to regular review and challenge by 
Group senior management.
Operationally, internal control 
systems are monitored by senior 
Group management with sector 
Chief Executives having responsibility 
for risk identification and risk 
management in their businesses.

The Audit and Risk Committee 
reviews aspects of the risk 
management and control system 
at its meetings and at least once 
a year formally reviews the system’s 
effectiveness as a whole on behalf 
of the Board (see the effectiveness 
review statement on pages 139 
to 140). It also receives in‑depth 
presentations on individual major 
risks throughout the year.
The Audit and Risk Committee 
receives regular reports from Ernst 
& Young, the internal audit function 
provider, and management reports 
relating to internal control and 
risk issues.
Employees undertake a selection 
of compulsory risk management 
training programmes (for example: 
security, data protection and 
anti‑bribery and corruption training) 
appropriate to their roles in order to 
increase awareness of potential risks.
The Executive Committee considers a 
monthly report from the Chief Executive, 
the Group Finance Director and each 
of the sector Chief Executives on the 
operational and financial performance 
of their respective areas of responsibility.
The Board is ultimately responsible 
for the Company’s risk management 
and internal control system. This 
is overseen on its behalf by the 
Audit and Risk Committee (which 
is currently usually attended by all 
Board members).
Babcock has a Group Security Committee 
made up of senior functional and 
operational managers with responsibility 
for security and information assurance 
at Group and operational level. They 
meet regularly to discuss cyber and 
other security and information assurance 
issues and threats facing the Group. 
The Committee oversees the Group’s 
security and information assurance 
management infrastructure and specific 
security projects.
The Group Finance Director is Chairman 
of the Committee, and each meeting is 
attended by the Group’s Chief Information 
Officer and Chief Information Security 
Officer. The Board receives regular 
reports on security and information 
assurance matters.

Our internal controls include 
Budget process Annual budgets and medium-term financial plans are reviewed by Group management before submission to 
the Board for approval. Updated forecasts for the year are prepared at least quarterly. 
Management and  
financial reporting 
The Board receives details of monthly actual financial performance compared against budget, forecast and 
the prior year, with a written commentary on significant variances from approved plans. 
The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and sector Chief Executives report to each Board meeting 
on operating performance and matters of potential strategic significance. 
Group senior management receives a monthly narrative operating report from all business units. 
Security and information  
governance structure 
There is a formal security and information assurance governance structure in place to oversee and manage 
security and similar risks. 
Clear delegation  
and limits of authority 
The Board regularly reviews and approves a schedule of delegated authorities setting out levels of specific 
financial decision-making authority delegated by it. 
Insurance The Group has a large and comprehensive insurance programme, preferring to place risk in the 
insurance market, where available on acceptable terms, rather than to self-insure or make significant 
use of captive insurance. 
The Group has a full-time Risk and Insurance Manager who reports annually to the Board on the strategic 
approach being taken to insurance and on the placing of the programme. 
Claims and litigation 
reporting 
The Board and the Group Executive Committee receive monthly summaries of material disputes and actual 
or potential claims, their progress and potential outcomes. The Group has an internal legal service. 
Credit controls,  
Code of Conduct and 
ethical, anti-bribery and 
corruption policies and 
procedures 
All significant credit risks are reviewed by Group Finance and an Executive Director, and, where appropriate 
and available, risk limitation actions are taken. 
The Group has a Code of Conduct, summarising ethical and anti-bribery and corruption policies, making clear 
its commitment to the highest ethical standards and the ethical standards it demands from its employees and 
those who work for it and with whom it does business. 
There is an anti-bribery and corruption governance structure in place and detailed policy and procedures 
(available on the Babcock website), with supporting training programmes, which the Company believes meet 
the requirements of ‘adequate procedures’ under the Bribery Act 2010. Due diligence is carried out on actual 
or potential business partners as appropriate. Those working on our behalf or in consortium with us are 
required to abide by our Code of Conduct (or an equivalent) and to undertake not to behave corruptly. 
Group policies and 
procedures 
The Group has written policies and procedures, which are kept under review, covering a range of matters 
intended to reduce or mitigate risk, such as health, safety and environmental policies, security and 
information assurance, export controls, contracting requirements and guidelines, and legal, financial and 
accounting matters. 
These policies and procedures are available to employees on the Group intranet and are supplemented 
at sector level by further business unit specific policies and procedures. 
Whistleblowing hotline All employees have access to a confidential whistleblowing hotline with the opportunity to call, email or write 
letters detailing any area of concern (whether financial irregularities, non-compliance with laws, or breaches 
of our Code of Business Conduct, threats to health and safety, conflicts of interest or improper practices) to be 
brought to the attention of senior management if they feel unable to raise them with line management or if 
they have raised matters, but are not satisfied with the response. A report on all whistleblowing cases and 
the resultant investigations and conclusions is submitted to each Audit and Risk Committee meeting – see 
page 96. 
Critical supplier  
reviews 
Sectors regularly review the vulnerability of key supply chain partners whose continued ability to supply the 
Group is considered critical to its business performance, and also consider fall-back plans when first deciding 
to appoint such suppliers. 
Business continuity  
and disaster  
recovery plans 
All sectors, business units and Group functions are required to consider the need for, and put in place, 
appropriate plans to minimise the risk of interruption to business and contract performance in the event of 
a major disruption to normal functioning arrangements.

Principal risks, risk mitigation and controls  
The risks and uncertainties described below through to page 79 are those that the Board currently considers to be of greatest significance 
to Babcock in that they have the potential to affect materially and adversely Babcock’s business, the delivery of its strategy and/or its 
financial results, condition or prospects. For each risk there is a short description of the Company’s view of the possible impact of the risk 
on the Group should it occur, and the mitigation and control processes in place to manage the risk (which should be read in conjunction 
with the information above about our risk management approach and general controls). 
Babcock is, however, a large and developing group of businesses, and factual circumstances, business and operating environments will change 
with new risks being identified or the evaluation of the significance of existing risks changing or being better appreciated and understood. This 
means that the risks identified below are not and cannot be an exhaustive list of all principal risks that could affect the Group. 
Risks and uncertainties which might affect businesses in general and that are not specific to the Group are not included, but Babcock, 
of course, faces such risks as well. 
Our customer profile 
We rely heavily on winning and retaining large contracts with a relatively limited number of major customers, whether in the UK  
or overseas. Many of our major customers are (directly or indirectly) owned or controlled by government (national or local) and/or  
are (wholly or partly) publicly funded. Our single biggest customer is currently the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD). 
These customers are affected by political and public spending decisions. Commercial customers are also affected by conditions  
in their market sector which affect their levels of, and priorities for, spending. 
 
Risk description  
Policy changes (following a change of 
political administration or otherwise) and 
spending constraints on customers are 
material factors for the Group’s business 
and outlook. 
Whilst the Board believes that policy 
changes, spending reviews and restraints 
can offer significant opportunities to the 
Group to assist in the delivery of services 
to customers more efficiently and at 
lower cost, these factors inevitably also 
carry risk. 
Large customers, whether public or 
private sector, have significant bargaining 
power and the ability (contractual or 
otherwise) to cancel contracts without, 
or on short, notice, often without cause, 
or they can exert pressure to renegotiate 
them in their favour. 
The consequences for the Group’s 
business of the UK vote to leave the 
European Union are difficult to predict, 
as there is likely to be a period of 
uncertainty over the effects on the 
nature, timing and scope of the policies 
and procurement plans of both our 
current and potential customers in 
the UK and overseas. 
Potential impact  
Periods of uncertainty as to the course 
of customer policy and spending can 
result in the delay, suspension or 
withdrawal of tendering processes 
and the award of contracts. 
Whilst customer policy changes or 
spending constraints can potentially offer 
more outsourcing opportunities for us to 
pursue, they can also be a risk in that they 
could lead to changes in customer 
outsourcing strategy and spend, which 
could include: 
• reductions in the number, frequency, 
size, scope, profitability and/or 
duration of future contract 
opportunities; 
• in the case of existing contracts, early 
termination, non-extension or non-
renewal or lower contract spend than 
anticipated and pressure to 
renegotiate contract terms in the 
customer’s favour; 
• favouring the retention or return of  
in-house service provision, either 
generally or in the sectors in which  
we operate; 
 
• favouring of small or medium-
sized suppliers or adopting a 
more transactional rather than 
cooperative, partnering approach to 
customer/supplier relationships; and 
• imposing new or extra eligibility 
requirements as a condition of doing 
business with the customer that we 
may not be able readily to comply with 
or that might involve significant extra 
costs, thereby impacting the 
profitability of doing business 
with them. 
Mitigation  
We have extensive and regular dialogue 
with key customers, involving, as 
appropriate, our Chief Executive, sector 
Chief Executives and/or other members 
of the senior management team. 
We actively monitor actual and potential 
political and other developments and 
spending constraints that might affect 
our customers’ demand for our services. 
We aim to be innovative and responsive 
in helping customers meet their needs 
and challenges.

72 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
The nature of our contracts, bid processes and markets 
We seek to win relatively long-term contracts for the provision of complex and integrated services to our customers. Bidding for these 
contracts typically involves a protracted and detailed tendering process, often under public procurement rules. There are typically only a 
relatively limited number of customers in each of the market sectors we serve. The contracts we bid for often entail a substantial transfer 
of risk from the customer to the supplier. 
Failure to realise the pipeline of opportunities and to secure rebids can mean missed opportunities for growth and loss of revenue. 
 
Risk description 
Bidding requires a substantial investment 
in terms of manpower resource and is 
very expensive. Bids can be subject to 
cancellation, delays or changes in scope. 
Contract award decisions made under 
public procurement rules can be subject 
to legal challenge by losing bidders. 
Given the size and often long-term 
nature of the contracts we bid for and 
the relatively limited numbers of 
customers in the markets we serve, 
significant contracting opportunities tend 
not to arise on a regular or frequent basis. 
When we are bidding for such contracts 
we have to price for the long term and 
for risk transfer, and the scope for later 
price adjustment may be limited or 
not exist. 
Our contracts typically impose strict 
performance conditions and use key 
performance indicators (KPI) that if not 
complied with trigger compensation for 
the customer and/or may result in loss 
of the contract. 
Bid and rebid success rates determine 
how much of the pipeline of 
opportunities is realised and turned 
into profitable business and how 
much existing business is retained. 
 
Potential impact 
If we lose a bid or a bid process is aborted 
by the customer or we withdraw due to 
scope changes as it progresses, this is a 
significant waste of limited resource and 
substantial expenditure that has to be 
written off. 
If we win a public procurement bid and 
this is challenged, this could lead to delay 
in contract award, expensive legal 
proceedings or the competition having 
to be re-run. 
Not winning a new bid can be a 
significant missed opportunity for 
growth which may not soon be replaced 
by another. 
Not winning rebids could mean the loss 
of significant existing revenue and 
profit streams. 
If we underestimate or under-price actual 
risk exposure or the cost of performance, 
this could significantly and adversely 
affect our future profitability, cash 
generation and growth. 
Compensation to the customer for poor 
KPI performance, could significantly 
impair profitability under the contract 
and damages following termination 
could be substantial. 
Unsuccessful bids or rebids may adversely 
impact the strategic development and 
growth plans of the Group. 
A lack of success in exporting the Group’s 
business model outside the UK and its 
current core markets could adversely 
impact the growth prospects and 
strategic development of the Group. 
Mitigation 
We have a clear business strategy to 
target a large bid pipeline, both in the UK 
and internationally, and will only tender 
bids for contracts we consider have a 
clear alignment with the Group strategy 
and where we believe we stand a realistic 
chance of success, both in the UK 
and overseas. 
There are formal and rigorous reviews 
and gating processes. These at key stages 
of each material bid are intended to 
reduce the risk of underestimating risks 
and costs and ensure that limited bid 
resources are targeted at opportunities 
where we consider that we have the 
best prospects of winning or 
retaining business. 
Group policies and procedures set 
a commercial, financial and legal 
framework for all bids. 
Contractual performance is continuously 
under review (at a business unit, sector 
and/or senior Group executive level as 
appropriate) with a view to highlighting 
at an early stage risks to delivery 
and profitability.

Directors’ report 80

  Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017  73 
Reputation 
Given the nature of our customers and the markets in which we operate, our reputation is a fundamental business asset. Our businesses 
include activities that have a high public profile and/or if they were to involve adverse incidents or accidents, they could attract a high 
level of publicity. 
Risk description 
We have a relatively limited number of 
customers and potential customers in our 
market sectors and they typically have 
high public profiles. 
We are involved in the direct delivery to 
the public on behalf of our customers of 
high-profile and sensitive services. We 
also provide services which are critical to 
our customers’ ability to discharge their 
own public responsibilities or delivery 
critical services to their customers. 
Failings or misconduct (perceived or real) 
in dealing with a customer or in providing 
services to them or on their behalf could 
substantially damage our reputation with 
that customer or more generally. The 
same would be true of high-profile 
incidents or accidents. 
Attitudes to the outsourcing of services 
generally or in a particular sector can 
also be adversely affected by the poor 
performance or behaviour of other 
service providers or incidents in which 
we are not involved. 
As well as our reputation for service 
delivery, our ethical reputation is key. 
 
Potential impact  
Given our dependence on individual 
major customers and the relatively 
narrow customer base in the markets in 
which we currently operate, loss of our 
reputation (whether justified or not) with 
a major customer or more generally 
could put at risk substantial existing 
business streams and the prospect of 
securing future business from that or 
other customers in that or other sectors. 
Non-compliance with anti-bribery 
and corruption laws could result in 
debarment from bidding as well as 
criminal penalties. 
 
Mitigation  
Senior management at Group and sector 
level are keenly aware of reputational 
risks, which can come from many 
sources. Our risk control procedures 
relating to contract performance, anti-
bribery and corruption, health and safety 
performance and other matters that 
could impact our reputation are 
described elsewhere on pages 58 to 67. 
(See also health, safety and 
environmental risks on page 75.) 
 
 
73 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Principal risks and management controls continued 
74 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
Regulatory and compliance burden  
Our major businesses are dependent on being able to comply with applicable customer or industry-specific requirements or regulations. 
Following the UK vote to leave the European Union, the terms of British exit will have implications on the requirements or regulations that 
are applicable to the business of the Group, including where a licence to operate in the European Union is required. 
Risk description  
The cost of compliance can be high. 
Requirements can change. 
Compliance with some regulatory 
requirements is a precondition for being 
able to carry on a business activity at all. 
For example: 
• Our Mission Critical Services business is 
subject to a high degree of regulation 
relating to aircraft airworthiness and 
certification and also to ownership 
and control requirements (for example, 
European air operators must be 
majority-owned and controlled by 
European Economic Area nationals – 
see page 137 for more information). 
• Our civil and defence-related nuclear 
businesses operate in a highly 
regulated environment. For example, 
as part of Brexit, the UK may leave the 
Euratom treaty and it is unclear what 
agreements will replace the existing 
arrangements and what the impact 
of those new agreements will be. 
 
Potential impact  
Failure to maintain compliance with 
applicable requirements could result in 
the loss of substantial business streams 
(and possible damages claims) and 
opportunities for future business. 
A change in requirements could entail 
substantial expenditure which may not 
be recoverable (either fully or at all) 
under customer contracts. 
 
Mitigation  
We seek to maintain a clear 
understanding of ongoing regulatory 
requirements and to maintain good 
working relationships with regulators. 
We have suitably qualified and 
experienced employees and/or expert 
external advisers to advise and assist 
on regulatory compliance. 
We have management systems involving 
competent personnel with clear 
accountabilities for operational 
regulatory compliance. 
Our Articles of Association empower us 
to take steps to protect our European air 
operating licences, if necessary, by 
controlling the level and/or limiting the 
rights of non-European Economic Area 
owners of our shares (see pages 137 to 
138 for more information). However 
we will be taking steps to structure our 
Mission Critical Services business such 
that it continues to satisfy the 
requirements of the relevant regulation.

  Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017  75 
Health, safety and environmental 
Some of our operations entail the potential risk of significant harm to people, property or the environment. 
 
Risk description  
Many of our businesses involve working 
in potentially hazardous operations or 
environments, which need to be properly 
managed and controlled to minimise the 
risk of injury or damage. 
Some, for example the mission critical 
operations of our helicopter services, 
involve an inherent degree of risk that 
is compounded by the nature of the 
services provided (offshore oil and gas 
crew change services, firefighting, 
search and rescue, air ambulance and 
emergency services) or the environments 
in which they operate (low-altitude flying 
in adverse weather, terrains or 
operational conditions). 
 
Potential impact  
Serious accidents can have a major 
impact on the lives of those directly 
involved and on their families, friends, 
colleagues and community, as can 
serious environmental incidents. 
To the extent that we have caused or 
contributed to an incident as a result 
of failings on our part, or because as 
a matter of law we would be strictly 
liable without fault, the Group could 
be exposed to substantial damages 
claims, not all of which exposure may 
be insured against, and also to criminal 
proceedings which could result in 
substantial penalties. 
Such incidents (which may have a high 
public profile given the nature of our 
operations) may also seriously and 
adversely affect the reputation of the 
Group or its brand (whether that would 
be justified or not), which could lead to 
a significant loss of business or future 
business opportunities. 
 
Mitigation  
Health, safety and environmental 
performance receives close and 
continuous attention and oversight 
from the senior management team. 
We have specific health, safety and 
environmental governance structures 
in place and extensive and ongoing 
education and training programmes 
for staff. 
The Board receives half-yearly reviews 
of health and safety and environmental 
performance and the management 
reports tabled at each of its meetings 
also address health, safety and 
environmental issues on an ongoing 
basis. 
We believe we have appropriate 
insurance cover against civil 
liability exposures. 
Nuclear risks: we believe having regard 
to the statutory regime for nuclear 
liability in the UK, the terms on which we 
do nuclear engineering business and the 
terms of indemnities given to us by the 
UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority 
and the UK MOD in respect of the nuclear 
site licensee companies in which we are 
interested that the Group would have 
adequate protection against risk of 
liability for injury or damage caused by 
nuclear contamination or incidents, but 
a reputational risk as a result of any 
serious incident would remain.

People 
Our business delivery and future growth depend on our ability adequately and successfully to plan for management succession and for our 
continuing and future need to recruit, develop and retain experienced senior managers, business development teams and highly skilled 
employees (such as suitably qualified and experienced engineers, technicians, pilots and other specialist skills groups). 
Risk description  
Competition for the skilled and 
experienced personnel we need is intense 
and they are likely to remain in limited 
supply for the foreseeable future. This 
poses risks in both recruiting and 
retaining such staff. 
 
Potential impact  
Losing experienced senior managers 
for any reason without plans for their 
replacement could have a material 
adverse effect on the prospects for, 
or performance of, the Group and the 
delivery of our strategy. 
If we have insufficient experienced 
business development or bidding 
personnel, this could impair our ability 
to achieve strategic aims and financial 
targets or to pursue business in 
new areas. 
If we have insufficient qualified and 
experienced employees, this could impair 
our service delivery to customers or our 
ability to pursue new business, with 
consequent risks to our financial results, 
growth, strategy and reputation and the 
risk of contract claims. 
The cost of recruiting or retaining the 
suitably qualified and experienced 
employees we need might increase 
significantly depending on market 
conditions, and this could impact 
our contract profitability. 
 
Mitigation  
We give a high priority and devote 
significant resources to recruiting 
skilled professionals, training and 
development, succession planning 
and talent management. 
The Board, the Nominations 
Committee and the Group Executive 
Committee regularly receive reports 
on and/or discuss these matters. 
Apprentice and graduate 
recruitment programmes are run 
in all sectors. 
Further information about this subject 
and how we address it is on pages 63 to 
65 of this Annual Report.

Directors’ report 80
Financials 142
  Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017  77 
Pensions 
The Group has significant defined benefit pension schemes. These provide for a specified level of pension benefits to scheme members, 
the cost of which is met from both member and employer contributions paid into pension scheme funds and the investment returns made 
in those funds over time. 
 
Risk description  
The level of our contributions is based on 
various assumptions, which are subject to 
change, such as life expectancy of 
members, investment returns, inflation, 
etc. Based on the assumptions used at 
any time, there is always a risk of a 
significant shortfall in the schemes’ 
assets below the calculated cost of the 
pension obligations. 
When accounting for our defined benefit 
schemes, we have to use corporate  
bond-related discount rates to value 
the pension liabilities. Variations in bond 
yields and inflationary expectations can 
materially affect the pensions charge in 
our income statement from year to year 
as well as the value of the net difference 
between the pension assets and liabilities 
shown on our balance sheet. 
 
Potential impact  
Should the assets in the pension schemes 
be judged insufficient to meet pension 
liabilities, we may be required to make 
increased contributions and/or lump sum 
cash payments into the schemes. This 
may reduce the cash available to meet 
the Group’s other obligations or business 
needs, and may restrict the future growth 
of the business. 
Accounting standards for pension 
liabilities can lead to significant 
accounting volatility from year to year 
due to the need to take account of 
macro-economic circumstances 
beyond the control of the Company. 
There is a risk that future accounting, 
regulatory and legislative changes may 
also adversely impact pension valuations 
and costs for the Group. 
 
Mitigation  
Continuous strategic monitoring and 
evaluation is undertaken by Group senior 
management of the assets and liabilities 
of the pension scheme and, as 
appropriate, the execution of 
mitigation opportunities. 
The Company and the scheme trustees 
have agreed a long-term investment 
strategy and risk framework intended 
to reduce the impact of the schemes’ 
exposure to changes in inflation and 
interest rates. 
Longevity swaps have been used to 
reduce the impact of the schemes’ 
exposure to increasing life expectancy.

IT and security 
Our ability to deliver secure IT and other information assurance systems to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information is a key 
factor for our customers. 
During the coming year the Group expects to continue rolling out a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application for our ‘back 
office’ operations which also provides some front end functionality. 
Risk description  
Despite controls designed to protect 
such information, there can be no 
guarantee that security measures 
will be sufficient to prevent all risk 
of security breaches or cyber-attacks 
being successful in their attempts to 
penetrate our network security and 
misappropriate confidential information. 
The risk of loss of information or data 
by other means is also a risk that cannot 
be entirely eliminated. 
Installing major new IT systems carries the 
risk of key system failures and disruption. 
Potential impact  
A breach or compromise of IT system 
security or physical security at a physical 
site could lead to loss of reputation, loss 
of business advantage, disruptions in 
business operations and inability to meet 
contractual obligations. This could have 
an adverse effect on the Group’s ability to 
win future contracts and, consequently, 
on our results of operations and overall 
financial condition. 
Failure adequately to plan and resource 
the implementation of the new ERP 
systems or difficulties experienced in 
doing so could cause both trading and 
financial reporting difficulties that could 
be material. 
Mitigation  
We have made and will continue to make 
significant investment in enhancing IT 
security and security awareness generally. 
We have formal security and information 
assurance governance structures in place 
to oversee and manage cyber-security 
and similar risks. 
The Board receives reports at least 
quarterly on security and information 
assurance matters. 
The ERP implementation project is 
overseen and closely monitored by 
steering and working groups, is regularly 
reported on to the Group Executive 
Committee and will be implemented in 
a phased approach (with parallel running 
of old and new systems for a period) to 
what we believe is a realistic timetable. 
 
Currency exchange rates  
As we expand outside the UK, our financial results are increasingly exposed to the impact of currency exchange rates. 
Risk description  
We prepare our consolidated results in 
Sterling and translate the value of assets, 
liabilities and turnover reported or 
accounted for in non-Sterling currencies. 
Exchange rate movements can therefore 
affect the Sterling financial statements 
and results of the Group. 
Expenses or commitments may be 
incurred in a currency that is different 
from the related turnover or income 
needed to discharge them. 
Non-Sterling currencies to which we are 
currently most exposed are the Euro and 
South African Rand. 
Potential impact  
If the currencies in which our non-UK 
business is conducted are weak or 
weaken against the value of Sterling, this 
will adversely affect our reported results 
and the value of any dividend income 
received by the Company from non-UK 
operations. If the cost of an operation 
or a contractual commitment is 
denominated or incurred in a currency 
different from the currency of the income 
received from that operation or that is 
being relied on to discharge that 
commitment, movements in exchange 
rates can reduce the profitability of the 
operation and increase the effective cost 
of discharging the commitment. 
Mitigation  
We seek to mitigate exposure to 
movements in exchange rates in 
respect of material foreign currency 
denominated transactions (for example, 
through use of derivative instruments). 
Although we do not use these to hedge 
against the currency effect of translating 
for our financial statements the net assets 
and income of non-UK subsidiaries and 
long-term equity accounted investments, 
we maintain foreign currency borrowings 
to limit, in part, the net foreign 
currency exposure.

Acquisitions 
The Group has grown and expects to continue to grow by making acquisitions as well as organically. 
Risk description  
The financial benefits of acquisitions 
may not be realised as quickly and as 
efficiently as expected. 
Potential impact  
Failure to realise the anticipated benefits 
of an acquisition, or delay or higher than 
expected costs in so doing, could 
adversely affect the strategic 
development, business, financial 
condition, results of operations or 
prospects of the Group. 
The diversion of management attention 
to unexpected difficulties encountered 
with acquisitions could adversely affect 
the Group’s business. 
Post-acquisition performance of the 
acquired business may not meet the 
financial performance expected at the 
time the acquisition terms were agreed 
and could fail to justify the price paid, 
which could adversely affect the Group’s 
future results and financial position. 
Mitigation  
Full financial and other due diligence is 
conducted as far as may reasonably be 
achievable in the context of each 
acquisition and a detailed business case, 
with forward looking projections, is 
submitted to the Board in respect of each 
acquisition. Integration risk is considered 
at an early stage as part of the review of 
acquisition opportunities and detailed 
integration planning takes place before 
completion of the acquisition. 
We believe we have a good track record 
in, and experience of, integrating 
acquisitions, both large and small. 
 
Viability statement 
The Directors have assessed the Company’s viability over the three-year period to March 2020. The Directors elected to make their 
assessment on a three-year basis as that is the period of the Group’s budget and forecasting review process, which the Directors 
believe gives the appropriate level of visibility for them to make their assessment. 
During the year to 31 March 2017, the Directors carried out a robust assessment of the principal strategic, financial and operational 
risks, including the principal risks listed on pages 71 to 79, to the Group’s solvency and liquidity that were identified within the 
Group’s risk management framework in the context of the controls and mitigating matters described on pages 68 to 70.  
In their assessment the Directors considered strategic risks faced by the Group under a number of strategic themes together with 
the probability of occurrence and likely impact of the risks materialising, as well as the adequacy of the control and mitigation 
measures in place to counter them. Separately, the detailed and bottom up risk management process continued throughout the 
year and this requires, at business unit and sector level, that business risks are identified and that the probability and impact of the 
risks materialising are considered together with risk mitigation measures and the extent to which monitoring of the effectiveness 
of the mitigation measures is in place. Risk registers, located at business unit level, are subject to robust review and challenge with 
business unit and sector management, by the Group Risk and Insurance Manager and the Group Financial Controller. The results of 
these reviews were presented to the Audit and Risk Committee during the course of the year to 31 March 2017. 
The Directors considered whether in their view there were any scenarios that were plausible, and the potential impact of which, 
taking account of their assessment of the above controls and mitigating actions, was such as to threaten the ability of the Group 
to meet its liabilities over the three-year period. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet all 
their liabilities as they fall due up to March 2020.

80 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 “Having loved STEM subjects such as Mathematics and Physics from a young age, transitioning into Engineering was a natural step. My 
Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering led me to Babcock International and my current placement at RAF Valley. Being based at an 
operational site is particularly rewarding; it allows me to see the entire scale of the contract as well as working alongside the customer to 
deliver the best output possible – training the next generation of military pilots.
My enthusiasm for STEM subjects is ever present, and my hope is to get the next generation involved in STEM wherever possible. By 
organising talks, workshops and other events for young people, our goal is to increase participation in all areas of STEM as we continue to 
solve the challenges of today.”

Maintaining high standards 
84 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
Dear Shareholder 
The Board is committed to working in an 
effective, transparent and ethical manner 
so that it can make its decisions in a way 
it believes will benefit shareholders by 
promoting and maintaining the long-
term success of the Company. We 
understand the need to undertake a 
formal and rigorous annual evaluation 
of the performance of the Board and its 
Committees to allow the Board to test 
whether it has the appropriate balance 
of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Company. This year, 
this evaluation exercise was led by 
Independent Board Evaluation, a business 
with wide experience and expertise in 
carrying out senior level evaluations. 
No significant concerns were highlighted 
as a result of this process, although a 
summary of the evaluation’s review is 
described on page 89. We are addressing 
and will continue to address the matters 
identified as areas for focus or 
improvement. 
The period under review saw the 
appointment of Archie Bethel as Chief 
Executive on the retirement of Peter 
Rogers. Archie’s appointment was the 
culmination of a number of years 
planning for succession by the 
Nominations Committee. At Babcock, 
succession planning is taken seriously 
and the Board does devote time to 
considering the talent management, 
recruitment and training and 
development programmes of 
the business. 
I believe that the importance placed by 
the Board and the Company as a whole 
on succession planning assists in ensuring 
that the senior management team has 
the strength in depth which means that 
excellent candidates are ready 
throughout the business to step up as 
and when opportunities present 
themselves, whilst ensuring that the 
culture and deep understanding of 
Babcock are maintained. 
Finally, we are satisfied as a Board that 
all our Non-Executive Directors are 
independent for UK Corporate 
Governance Code purposes and have 
the necessary time to devote to their 
duties. We, therefore, recommend to 
shareholders that they reappoint each 
of our Non-Executive Directors at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting in 
July. In this regard, the Nominations 
Committee, after consideration, has 
extended for a further three-year term, 
subject to annual re-election, the current 
expected term of appointment of Jeff 
Randall. Jeff has been a Director since 
April 2014. The Nominations Committee 
was satisfied as to both Jeff’s continuing 
independence and the ongoing value of 
having him serve as our Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.

Governance Code  
Compliance Statement  
The Company is required to report 
on how in the year under review 
it has applied the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published in 
September 2014 (the Code). The 
Code contains broad principles and 
specific provisions which set out 
standards of good governance 
practice in relation to leadership, 
effectiveness, remuneration, 
accountability and relations with 
shareholders. 
The Board considers that the 
Company complied with all the 
provisions of the Code throughout 
the year to 31 March 2017. 
The required governance and 
regulatory assurances are provided 
throughout this Directors’ report 
and in some cases in other parts 
of the Annual Report. The Other 
Disclosures section on page 134 
provides further cross references 
to where in this Annual Report 
disclosures under the Code 
and also the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and Listing 
Rules can be found. 
How the Company has applied the principles of the Code 
Leadership 
The Board, led by the Chairman, sets the strategic direction for the Company, providing 
leadership within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enable risk to 
be assessed and managed. This section details the composition of the Board and its 
Committees, how responsibilities are divided and the key areas of focus for the Board 
during the year. 
Effectiveness 
The Board and its Committees review their skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge to enable the discharge of their duties and responsibilities effectively. This 
section provides details on the 2017 Board evaluation process, including the progress 
made since the 2016 Board evaluation, and sets out the induction process for new 
Directors. The Report of the Nominations Committee (pages 92 to 93) expands on 
the process for Board appointments including diversity policy. 
Accountability 
The Board, principally acting through the Audit and Risk Committee which reviews the 
effectiveness of the risk management systems and internal controls in place, believes 
that it has presented a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s 
position and prospects throughout this Annual Report. Principal risks and management 
controls are described in the Strategic report (pages 68 to 79) where the Board also 
makes its viability statement. Internal controls and risk management are further discussed 
in the Report of the Audit and Risk Committee (pages 94 to 97). 
Remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee has principal responsibility for determining and agreeing 
with the Board the overall remuneration of the Executive Directors. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (on pages 98 to 133) details the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy and how it is applied. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining open dialogue with its shareholders. 
Throughout the year the Company undertook a wide variety of presentations, meetings 
and roadshows. This section (pages 90 to 91) outlines how the Board has communicated 
with shareholders and how the shareholders can engage with the Company.

Leadership 
Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors of Babcock 
International Group PLC (the Board) is 
collectively responsible to the Company’s 
shareholders for the long-term success of 
the Company. This responsibility includes 
matters of strategy, performance, 
resources, standards of conduct and 
accountability. The Board also has 
ultimate responsibility for corporate 
governance, which it discharges either 
directly or through its Committees 
and the structures described in this 
Governance statement. 
The current Directors’ biographies are 
set out on pages 82 and 83. The Board 
is satisfied that each Director has the 
necessary time to devote to the effective 
discharge of their responsibilities and that 
between them the Directors have a blend 
of skills, experience, knowledge and 
independence suited to the Company’s 
needs and its continuing development. 
The powers of the Directors are set out 
in the Company’s Articles of Association 
(the Articles), which may be amended 
by way of a special resolution of the 
members of the Company. The Board 
may exercise all powers conferred on it 
by the Articles and in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006, and other 
applicable legislation. The Articles are 
available for inspection online at 
www.babcockinternational.com and 
can also be seen at the Company’s 
registered office. 
Board meeting attendance 
The Board has at least 10 scheduled full 
Board meetings each financial year and 
two other meetings devoted solely to 
strategy. The Chairman also meets 
separately with Non-Executive Directors 
without Executive Directors or other 
managers present from time to time. 
Debate and discussion at Board and 
Committee meetings is encouraged to 
be open, challenging and constructive. 
Directors regularly receive presentations 
by functional and senior managers. In the 
annual Board and Committee evaluation 
review, no Directors expressed 
dissatisfaction with the timing or quality 
of information provided to them.

Board Committee terms of reference 
and other delegated authorities are 
formalised and reviewed from time to 
time, usually at least once a year. Key 
Committee terms of reference are 
available to view on our website:

In addition to the principal Committees 
of the Board – the Remuneration 
Committee, the Audit and Risk 
Committee and the Nominations 
Committee (each of which has its own 
report in the pages that follow) – the 
Board from time to time establishes 
committees to deal with specific matters 
on its behalf. The Board also allows for 
routine matters, or the implementation 
of formal steps for matters approved in 
principle by the Board, to be dealt with 
by a Board meeting of any two 
Directors, but these are later ratified 
by the full Board. 
There is also a Group Finance Committee 
consisting of any two Directors, one of 
whom must be the Group Finance 
Director, to approve borrowing, 
guarantees, treasury and related 
matters within its terms of reference. 
The Company has, as described on 
page 89, an Executive Committee and an 
International Committee, though neither 
committee is a formal Board Committee.

The Chairman and Chief Executive 
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate, 
clearly established and set out in writing, and have been approved by the Board. The 
Chairman is responsible for the leadership and governance of the Board as a whole, and 
the Chief Executive for the management of the Group and the successful planning and 
implementation of Board strategy. The descriptions below summarise their current 
respective roles and responsibilities. A copy of the formal written statement is also 
maintained on the Company’s website at www.babcockinternational.com. 
 
Chairman

highest standards of integrity and probity 
throughout the business 
• Ensure effective operation of the Board 
and its Committees in conformity with the 
highest standards of corporate governance

for the day-to-day leadership of the 
business and managing it within the 
authorities delegated by the Board. 
In particular, his role is to: 
• Develop strategic proposals and 
annual plans for recommendation 
to the Board and ensure that agreed

as regards health and safety and 
environmental matters 
• Develop and promote effective 
communication with shareholders 
and other relevant constituencies. 
Senior Independent Director 
Sir David Omand is currently and has throughout the year been the Senior Independent 
Director. Shareholders can bring matters to his attention if they have concerns which 
have not been resolved through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or 
Group Finance Director, or if these channels are not deemed appropriate. The Chairman 
looks to the Senior Independent Director as a sounding board and he is available as an 
intermediary between the other Directors and the Chairman. The Senior Independent 
Director is also responsible for leading the Non-Executive Directors in the annual 
performance evaluation of the Chairman. The specific role of the Senior Independent 
Director has been set out in writing and approved by the Board. 
Non-Executive Directors 
The Non-Executive Directors bring 
external perspectives and insight to 
the deliberations of the Board and its 
Committees, providing a range of 
knowledge and business or other 
experience from a range of sectors and 
undertakings (see their biographies on 
page 83). They play an important role 
in the formulation and progression of 
the Board’s agreed strategy, and review 
and monitor the performance of the 
executive management in the 
implementation of this strategy. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
for an expected initial three-year term 
(though the appointments are terminable 
at will by either party at any time), 
subject to their annual re-election by 
shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM), commencing with their 
election by shareholders at the first AGM 
following their appointment by the 
Board. Reappointment after the expiry 
of their three- year terms is subject to 
review by the Nominations Committee. 
The Board considers the independence 
of each Non- Executive Director against 
criteria specified in the Code. The Board 
is conscious that before extending the 
appointment of any Non-Executive 
Director in office over six years they 
should be subject to a ‘particularly 
rigorous review’ of their performance 
and commitment. 
The table below shows that we have a 
Board of Non-Executives that is clearly 
being renewed and enjoys the benefit 
of a range of periods in office. 
Non-Executive Period in office to date
Sir David Omand 8 years, 1 month
Ian Duncan 6 years, 6 months
Anna Stewart 4 years, 6 months

Group Executive Committee 
The Group Executive Committee reviews 
and discusses all matters of material 
significance to the Group’s management, 
operational and financial performance as 
well as strategic development. It is not a 
formal Board Committee and has no 
delegated powers as such. It is now made 
up of the Chief Executive, the Group 
Finance Director, the sector Chief 
Executives, the Chief Executive, Global 
Growth and Operations, the Company 
Secretary, the Group Director of 
Organisation and Development, the 
Group Director of Investor Relations and 
Communications and the Managing 
Director Technology. It is scheduled to 
meet 10 times a year and minutes of its 
meetings are circulated to Board members. 
Group International Committee 
The Group International Committee 
reviews and discusses the Group’s 
international development. It is not a 
formal Board Committee and has no 
delegated powers as such. It is principally 
made up of the Group Finance Director 
and the sector Chief Executives and is 
chaired by Bill Tame, Chief Executive, 
Global Growth and Operations. It is also 
attended by the heads of the principal 
overseas operations. It is scheduled to 
meet 10 times a year and minutes of its 
meetings are circulated to the Board. 
Effectiveness 
Board evaluation 
The evaluation for the financial year 
ending 31 March 2017 was carried 
out externally by Independent Board 
Evaluation (IBE). Neither IBE nor any 
of its representatives had any other 
connections with the Company. IBE 
carried out confidential one on one 
meetings with each Director, the 
Company Secretary and other senior 
managers, as well as representatives 
from certain external advisers who work 
closely with the Board or its Committees. 
The review considered the balance of 
skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge on the Board; its diversity; 
how the Board, its Committees, the 
Chairman and individual Directors 
performed and how they worked 
together; as well as other factors relevant 
to effectiveness. As part of the evaluation 
process, IBE attended, as observers, a 
Board meeting and a Remuneration 
Committee meeting. IBE found that the 
feedback from Board members was 
positive and concluded that the Board 
was functioning well. No significant 
concerns were expressed by Board or 
Committee members as to the way in 
which the Board or its Committees 
functioned, the support given to them, 
the matters covered at their meetings 
or how they were dealt with, or as to the 
contribution of any individual Director. 
Recommendations for primary areas 
of focus or consideration going 
forward were: 
• Overseeing a changing organisation 
• Talent management and bench 
strength below Board and sector level 
• Planning to ensure that the Group has 
the necessary diversity of talent and 
skills for its long term needs. 
The Board is addressing and will continue 
to address the above matters and will 
report back to shareholders on progress 
in the 2018 Annual Report. 
Follow up on the review for year ending 
31 March 2016 
As reported last year, the Board 
evaluation for the year ending 31 March 
2016 was led internally, by the Company 
Secretary. Key areas of focus to come 
out of that review and how they were 
addressed in the year to 31 March 
2017 included: 
Executive succession plans and their 
implementation 
The succession of Archie Bethel to 
the position of Chief Executive as of 
1 September 2016 was the culmination 
of the succession plans put into place 
in the event of the retirement of Peter 
Rogers. However, the Board has 
continued to look to the future and 
considers succession planning and 
talent development across the Group 
(as described on page 92). 
Planning to ensure that the Group has the 
necessary talent and skills being recruited 
and developed for its long-term needs 
This was the subject of formal 
presentations at both the Board and the 
Executive Committee following detailed 
divisional reviews. Further information 
on activity in this area can be found on 
page 63. 
Strategy and awareness of potential 
strategic risks 
In the year the Board, in addition to 
the time spent in its regular monthly 
meetings, devoted at least two meetings, 
of which one was a full day meeting held 
off-site, solely to consider the Company’s 
strategy. The Board also asks senior 
management to attend these meetings. 
As part of these discussions, the Board 
considers potential strategic risks. In 
addition, the Company can also draw on 
the International Committee which has as 
its principal focus the setting and review 
of the Company’s international strategy, 
the coordination and focus of effort by 
the Group on international development, 
and the review of progress. The 
International Committee is concentrating 
on expanding the capabilities of the 
Company’s international operations.  
Induction and training for Directors 
New Non-Executive Directors receive 
detailed business briefings on the Group’s 
operations and make induction visits to 
operational sites. Those who have not 
previously served as a director of a listed 
company receive a briefing from the 
Company’s external lawyers on their 
duties and responsibilities. 
As required by the Chairman, training 
for new Directors and ongoing general 
director training is arranged as necessary 
or as they may request, and the Company 
Secretary briefs, or arranges briefings for, 
Board members about significant changes 
in the law, regulations or governance 
codes affecting their duties as Directors. 
Non-Executive Directors may at any 
time make visits to Group businesses or 
operational sites and Board visits are also 
made to sites. Presentations on the Group’s 
businesses and specialist functions are 
made to the Board from time to time. 
 
89 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance statement continued 
90 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
Non-Executive Directors receive copies 
of minutes of meetings of the Group 
Executive Committee, the Group 
International Committee and divisional 
Boards and monthly divisional 
operating reports which also cover 
health, safety and environmental matters 
and compliance with the Group’s ethical 
and security standards. They are also 
invited to attend the Group’s senior 
management conferences. 
Information and support  
for the Board 
The Chairman, with the assistance 
of the Company Secretary, ensures 
appropriate information flows to the 
Board and its Committees to facilitate 
their discussions and allow fully informed 
decisions to be made. The Company 
Secretary attends all Board meetings and 
all Directors have access to his advice 
and, if necessary, to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense to assist with the discharge of 
their responsibilities as Directors. 
Election of Directors 
The rules relating to the appointment 
and replacement of Directors are 
contained within the Articles. The Articles 
provide that Directors may be appointed 
by an ordinary resolution of the members 
or by a resolution of the Directors, 
provided that, in the latter instance, a 
Director appointed in that way retires 
and is submitted for election at the first 
AGM following their appointment. In 
compliance with provision B.7.1 of the 
Code, all existing Directors will be seeking 
re-election at the 2017 AGM. The names 
and biographical details of each of the 
Directors are set out on page 82 and 83. 
Executive Directors are entitled under 
their service agreements to 12 months’ 
notice of termination of employment 
from the Company; Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Chairman, have 
letters of appointment which can be 
terminated at will. 
Relations with shareholders 
Dialogue with shareholders 
The Board believes it is important 
to maintain open and constructive 
relationships with all of its shareholders – 
large and small, institutional and private. 
The Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director and Group Director of Investor 
Relations and Communications undertake 
a programme of meetings, conference 
calls and presentations to discuss the 
Group’s strategy and financial 
performance with investors, brokers’ 
sales teams and analysts. The Company 
offers meetings with the Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director to its top 
20 shareholders at least twice a year 
and, additionally, during the year the 
Chairman wrote to our largest 
shareholders inviting them to meet with 
him to discuss strategy, performance and 
corporate governance matters, resulting 
in meetings with two shareholders. 
The Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee was also in contact with 
leading shareholders as further 
explained in his annual statement on 
pages 98 to 99. Both the Chairman and 
Sir David Omand, the Senior Independent 
Director, are available to shareholders 
should they have any concerns where 
contact through the normal channels 
is deemed inappropriate or where 
shareholders believe a matter has not 
been adequately resolved.

Over 95% of Babcock shares are held 
by institutional shareholders. Whilst it is 
normal practice for institutional funds to 
have a greater degree of contact with 
the Company, all shareholders are 
welcome to raise questions with the 
Board at the Annual General Meeting. 
In addition, on a day-to-day basis our 
investor relations team engages with 
shareholders on a wide range of issues on 
a variety of platforms. To assist our private 
and international shareholders, the investor 
relations team makes sure that all price-
sensitive information is released in 
accordance with the applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements. All 
announcements and major presentations 
given to institutional shareholders, along 
with annual reports, shareholder circulars, 
shareholder services information, other 
stock exchange releases and share price 
information, are made available to all 
shareholders through the Babcock website 
(www.babcockinternational.com/investors).
The Company ensures that the Board has 
an up-to-date perspective on the views 
and opinions of shareholders and the 
investment market. An investor relations 
report summarising share price 
performance compared to market, 
changes to the shareholder register and 
feedback from shareholders is produced for 
each Board meeting. During 2016/17, the 
Company once again commissioned Clare 
Williams Associates to undertake a market 
perception review to provide an 
independent evaluation of investor 
attitudes towards the Group (which this 
year involved nine investors, including 
some of the Company’s major 
shareholders, accounting for around 43% 
of the shareholder register, as well as some 
underweight or non-holding institutions). 
The results were formally presented to the 
Board in July 2016. 
Annual General Meeting 
The 2017 AGM will be held at 11 am 
on Thursday 13 July 2017 at the 
Grosvenor House Hotel, Park Lane, 
London W1K 7TN. The Company will 
send notice of the AGM and any related 
papers at least 20 working days prior to 
the date of the meeting in accordance 
with best practice standards. 
All shareholders are welcome. The event 
provides a platform for the Chairman 
and Chief Executive to explain how the 
Company has progressed during the year. 
It also provides all shareholders with the 
opportunity to put questions to the 
Chairman of the Board, the Chairmen 
of the Audit and Risk, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees, and the 
Senior Independent Director. At these 
meetings a poll is conducted on each 
resolution; shareholders also have the 
opportunity to cast their votes by proxy, 
either electronically or by post. Directors 
also make themselves available before 
and after the AGM to talk informally to 
shareholders. Following each AGM the 
results of the polls are published on the 
Company’s website and released to the 
London Stock Exchange.

Membership of the Committee 
The Nominations Committee is chaired 
by the Chairman of the Company and its 
other members are the Company’s Non-
Executive Directors (all of whom are 
independent). The Committee sometimes 
invites Executive Directors to attend 
meetings of the Committee, if appropriate. 
The current membership of the 
Committee, and its membership 
throughout the year to 31 March 2017 
as well as attendance at Committee 
meetings during the year, is 
shown opposite. 
No individual participates in discussion 
or decision-making when the matter 
under consideration relates to him or her. 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to 
the Committee. 
In addition to its formal meetings, 
members of the Committee also met 
together informally to discuss senior 
executive succession planning. 
Matters within the Committee’s remit 
are also sometimes taken as specific 
items at full Board meetings, principally 
consideration of succession planning 
more widely within the Group and 
talent identification, management 
and development. 
Responsibilities of the Committee 
The Committee is responsible for 
making recommendations to the Board, 
within its agreed terms of reference, on 
appointments to the Board. The terms 
of reference of the Committee are 
available on the Company’s website. 
The Committee also assists the Board 
in discharging its responsibilities in 
respect of: 
• Regularly reviewing and evaluating 
the size, structure and composition 
(including the balance of skills, 
diversity, knowledge and experience) 
of the Board and making 
recommendations to the Board 
with regard to any changes  
• Considering succession planning for 
Directors and other senior executives, 
taking into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Company and 
the skills and expertise needed on the 
Board in the future  
• Reviewing the leadership needs of 
the Group, both executive and non-
executive, with a view to ensuring 
the continued ability of the Group to 
compete effectively in the marketplace 
• Identifying and making 
recommendations for the approval 
of the Board regarding candidates to 
fill Board vacancies and reviewing the 
time required from Non-Executive 
Directors for the performance of 
their duties to the Company.

Diversity 
When considering recommendations 
for appointment to the Board the 
Committee has in mind the strategic 
plans and the development of the 
business in both existing and new 
market sectors and with new, and new 
types of, customers, both in the UK and 
internationally, and the need to maintain 
the Board’s credibility in its chosen 
business areas. The Committee also takes 
into account as part of its deliberations 
the Board’s aspiration and intent to foster 
and encourage greater diversity of 
gender, outlook, background, perception 
and experience at Board level.  
The Board is clear that it wants to see an 
increasing number of women in senior 
executive management roles and 
throughout the workforce as a whole. 
However, we believe that diversity should 
not be about firm quotas or solely a 
gender debate and that instead we 
should look at a wide-ranging approach.  
For this reason the Board has chosen 
not to set any specific objectives but 
will continue to maintain its practice 
of embracing diversity in all its forms 
when compiling a shortlist of suitable 
candidates and recommending any 
future Board appointments. Further 
insight into the work being done to foster 
female participation in the industries in 
which we operate is provided in the 
Strategic report on pages 64 to 65. 
Activities undertaken by the Committee 
during the year  
During the year ended 31 March 2017, 
the Committee:  
• Oversaw the appointment of Archie 
Bethel as Group Chief Executive, 
effective 1 September 2016, following 
the retirement of Peter Rogers; 
• Considered the governance 
structure established by the Group’s 
realignment; and 
• Considered and recommended the 
extension of the term of appointment 
as Chairman of Mike Turner and the 
extension of the term of appointment 
as Non-Executive Director of Jeff 
Randall, in both cases for up to a 
further three years. 
The Committee was pleased with the 
smooth succession of Archie Bethel, as 
his appointment was the culmination 
of a number of years’ planning. The 
Committee will continue to focus 
on ensuring that the Board has the 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the 
Company in order to meet the 
Company’s strategic goals.

The Group Company Secretary and 
General Counsel was Secretary to the

that the Committee complies with

Who attends Committee meetings? 
In addition to the members of the 
Committee, the Committee, at its 
discretion, usually invites the Group 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director, Group Company 
Secretary and General Counsel, and 
Group Financial Controller to attend its 
meetings. Divisional Chief Executives 
(each of whom is a Director and/or 
Group Executive Committee member) 
have in the past also been invited to 
attend meetings and since 1 April 2017, 
with the implementation of the Group’s 
realignment, the Committee has invited, 
at its discretion, the sector Chief 
Executives and the Chief Executive, 
Global Growth and Operations. The 
Committee is satisfied that having 
these invited attendees present 
does not influence or constrain the 
Committee’s discussions or compromise 
the Committee’s independence. Their 
presence ensures that all Board Directors 
and the senior management of the Group 
are directly aware of the Committee’s 
deliberations, how it goes about the 
discharge of its responsibilities on behalf 
of the full Board and any areas of concern 
or focus for the Committee. It also assists 
the Committee by allowing direct

questioning of executives on matters 
that the Committee thinks need further 
challenge, clarification, explanation 
or justification. Should a situation arise 
where the presence of any such attendee 
would be inappropriate or might 
compromise discussion the Committee 
would either not invite the attendee 
concerned or request that they not 
attend the relevant part of that meeting. 
The Group Risk Manager attended 
Committee meetings for its discussion 
of Group risk reports and related items.  
During the year to 31 March 2017, Ernst 
& Young LLP provided internal audit 
services to the Company and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was the 
Group’s external auditor. Both auditors 
attended the Committee’s meetings 
during the year to 31 March 2017. 
The Committee Chairman also met 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) and 
Ernst & Young LLP in the absence of 
executive management. The auditors 
are also invited to address the Committee 
without executives present at least 
once a year. 
The Committee’s terms of reference 
were reviewed during the year to 
ensure that they are in line with best 
practice guidelines. 
Activities undertaken by the Committee 
during the year 
During the year to 31 March 2017 the 
Committee met four times. The agenda 
for each meeting is set by the Committee 
Chairman in conjunction with the 
Company Secretary and other members 
of the Committee as appropriate. During 
the year ended 31 March 2017, the 
Committee considered the following: 
Audit re-tender process 
The Committee completed the external 
audit re-tendering process and 
recommended the reappointment of 
PwC as the Company’s external auditor. 
This appointment was approved by the 
Company’s shareholders at the AGM on 
21 July 2016. 
Financial results 
• full-year and half-year financial 
statements and related results 
announcements 
• reports and reviews from the external 
auditors 
• matters that required the exercise of 
a significant element of management 
judgement in relation to the financial 
statements for the year to 31 March 
2017 (see page 96) 
• advising the Board on the requirement 
for a statement from it that the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year to 
31 March 2017 are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and 
strategy during the relevant period. 
The Committee satisfies itself that this 
is so by circulating to Board members 
draft wording at an early stage with 
sufficient time and detailed content to 
allow for an assessment of the content 
against the reports and accounts 
provided to the Board and its 
discussions throughout the relevant 
period. In addition, the Committee 
asks the Group Financial Controller 
to prepare a formal written report 
for the Committee reviewing the 
relevant draft, its consistency with 
his knowledge and understanding of 
matters and the appropriateness of 
the weighting given to them, in each 
case to allow for their review and 
consideration by the Committee (with 
all Directors and divisional (or now 
sector) Chief Executives present) in the 
context of their own understanding of 
reports and accounts provided to the 
Board and its discussions throughout 
the year. Before drafts are submitted 
to the Board, the Group Director of 
Investor Relations and Communications 
reviews the content of the Strategic 
report to ensure consistency with other 
financial statements made by the 
Group during the year 
• review of the assumption that the 
Company’s financial statements are 
prepared on a going concern basis 
• considering the Company’s approach 
to the requirement on the Company to 
examine the Company’s longer term 
solvency and viability (please see page 
for further details). 
Audit plans 
Internal and external audit plans for 
the year. 
Internal audit 
At each meeting, the Committees 
received internal audit reports on findings 
from audit visits to business units, which 
as a matter of course look at accounting, 
anti-bribery and corruption controls, 
business continuity, contract performance 
and contract bidding risks. These include 
follow-up reports on any matters 
identified in earlier reports as requiring 
attention or improvement. The reports 
contain tracking information to enable 
the Committee easily to see the control 
performance of business units over 
time and how quickly any matters 
are addressed. 
Risk and Internal controls 
• review of internal control processes 
and their effectiveness 
• regular detailed reports identifying 
areas of risk at business unit, divisional 
and Group level, assessing and 
prioritising potential impact, risk 
mitigation steps in place and the 
pre- and post-mitigation risk levels 
• focused reviews of selected major risk 
areas: insurance strategy, business 
critical suppliers, treasury risk, and 
contract performance.

Fraud 
Reports covering any suspected incidents 
of fraud, their investigation and any 
remedial or preventive action. 
Whistleblowing 
The Committee is responsible for 
monitoring the Group whistleblowing 
policy and receives regular reports of 
calls and emails to the Group’s external 
independent whistleblowing services 
and how these have been investigated 
and concluded. The total number of 
whistleblowing reports in the year to 
31 March 2017 was 41 (2016: 60). For 
further explanation of the whistleblowing 
procedure please see page 70. 
 
 
Audit/non-audit fees and auditor 
independence 
Audit and non-audit fees for the external 
and internal auditors were reviewed by 
the Committee and considered in 
relation to their effect on auditor 
independence. 
Significant issues considered by 
the Committee in relation to the 
financial statements 
We are required to provide an 
explanation of the significant issues that 
the Committee considered in relation to 
the financial statements for the year to 
31 March 2017 and how these issues 
were addressed, having regard to 
matters communicated to the 
Committee by the auditors. 
In planning the year-end audit, 
the Committee considered with 
management and the Company’s 
auditors the key areas of focus for the 
audit having in mind their significance 
to the Group’s reporting of results and 
the degree of judgement involved in 
their evaluation. The significant issues 
considered in relation to the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 
2017 and how the Committee addressed 
them are set out in the table below. 
 
Significant issue How the Committee addressed it 
Contract accounting and revenue 
recognition 
The Committee considered the material contracts which require a significant degree of 
management judgement that could materially affect the appropriate accounting treatment for 
them; these were the subject of discussion and challenge with management to ensure that the 
Committee was satisfied as to the reasonableness of those judgements. 
Pensions accounting – the choice of 
assumptions in the valuation for 
accounting purposes of the liabilities of 
the Group’s defined benefit schemes 
The Committee assessed the particular assumptions proposed to be used by management and 
their impact on scheme assets and liabilities in the context of assumptions being used in respect 
of the same factors by other companies and the pensions industry more widely. See note 24 on 
pages 186 to 190. 
Business acquisitions – goodwill 
impairment assessment 
The Committee reviewed and challenged management’s assessment of the goodwill balance by 
considering, amongst other things, management’s evaluation of cash flow forecasts, budget, 
and growth rates. See note 10 on page 170.

 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 97 
Internal controls and risk management 
The Committee believes that the 
identification, control, mitigation and 
reporting of risk is central to the delivery 
of the Company’s strategy. The way that 
the Company manages risk is set out in 
the Strategic report on pages 68 to 70, 
with the principal risks facing the Group 
set out on page 71 to page 79. The 
Committee has conducted a rigorous 
and robust review of the ongoing 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management processes in light of the 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
(and the Financial Reporting Council’s 
associated Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting). 
A statement regarding the effectiveness 
of the internal controls and control 
processes, including those over financial 
reporting, can be found on pages 139 
to 140. 
Internal audit 
The Committee considers that it is still 
appropriate to have an internal audit 
service provided by an external adviser, 
but keeps this under review. In the year 
to 31 March 2017, the Committee 
was satisfied with the service provided 
by Ernst & Young LLP acting as 
internal auditor. 
External audit and the re-tender of 
external audit 
The Committee manages the 
relationship with the external auditor 
on behalf of the Board and monitors the 
auditor’s independence and objectivity 
along with the effectiveness of the 
external audit on an annual basis. Audit 
fees are re-evaluated periodically. 
For the year to 31 March 2017, PwC 
has been the Group’s external auditors 
having been reappointed by shareholders 
at the AGM on 21 July 2016 on the 
recommendation of the Board following 
a re-tendering process. The Chairman and 
the Committee regularly assess PwC’s 
effectiveness in the provision of audit 
services in their meetings with PwC, and 
after each annual audit there is a rigorous 
review of PwC’s audit services in that 
audit examining the level and consistency 
of qualification, expertise and resources, 
the effectiveness of the audit (including, 
inter alia, the understanding of our 
business and reporting processes for 
subsidiary audit teams), independence 
and leadership. The review includes the 
provision to PwC, and discussion with it, 
of detailed feedback from those exposed 
to the audit process within the Group. 
The question of PwC’s continuing 
independence in the provision of audit 
services is considered and discussed with 
PwC including the basis upon which that 
assessment can reasonably be made and 
supported. The Group and Company 
audits for the year to 31 March 2017, 
were the first for audit partner, Nicholas 
Campbell-Lambert. 
The Company expects to tender the 
external audit function in four years and 
PwC, having been auditor since 2002, 
will not be invited to participate in that 
tender. The Committee confirms that the 
Group is in compliance with the Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014. 
Non-audit fees 
The Committee regularly considers the 
engagement of, and level of fees payable 
to, the auditor for non-audit work, 
considering potential conflicts and the 
possibility of actual or perceived threats 
to their independence. The Company’s 
policy is to consider whether to place 
material non-audit services work with 
external auditor on a case-by-case basis 
based on an assessment of who is best 
placed to do the work having regard to 
the availability, resources, capability, 
experience and any conflicts of interest 
of potential candidate firms for the work, 
and to make the choice based on what is 
considered to be in the Company’s best 
interest overall having regard to potential 
independence issues if the work is placed 
with the Company’s auditor. Non-audit 
services offered to the auditor would 
not include the design or operation of 
financial information systems, internal 
audit services, maintenance or 
preparation of accounting records or 
financial statements that would be 
subject to external audit or work that the 
Committee considers as reasonably 
capable of compromising their 
independence as auditors. If use of the 
auditors for non-audit work would lead 
to non-audit fees payable to them in the 
year exceeding 20% of their audit fee, 
the Committee Chairman’s approval is 
required. In addition, any fee for non-
audit work in excess of £100,000 
must be approved by the Committee 
Chairman. Having considered the non-
audit services provided by the auditor 
during the year ended 31 March 2017, 
the Committee is satisfied that these 
services were provided effectively and 
did not prejudice the objectivity or 
independence of the auditor. 
For the year ended 31 March 2017, the 
Committee has approved the payment 
to PwC of fees of £2.1 million for audit 
services (£0.4 million of which was for 
the statutory audit of the Company’s 
consolidated financial statements) and of 
fees of £0.1 million for tax related work. 
Non-audit related work accounted for 4% 
of the total audit and non-audit related 
fees paid to the external auditor during 
the year. A breakdown of fees paid to the 
auditor is set out in note 4 on page 166.

Annual Statement of the 
Remuneration 
Committee Chairman 
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for 2016/17.  
This Directors’ remuneration report has 
three parts: this, the Chairman’s Annual 
Statement, a Policy Report and an Annual 
Report on Remuneration. Together they 
present full and transparent disclosure of 
the Company’s intentions as to Directors’ 
remuneration and how our remuneration 
arrangements operate. Our current 
remuneration policy was approved at 
the 2014 AGM. As such we are required 
by governing legislation to put a new 
remuneration policy to shareholders for 
a binding vote at this year’s AGM, which 
is set out on pages 101 to 111 below. 
We will also be seeking an advisory vote 
as to your approval of this Annual 
Statement and the Annual Report 
on Remuneration at the AGM on 
13 July 2017. 
Changes to remuneration 
arrangements for Executive 
Directors 
The remuneration policy is pitched to 
deliver fixed remuneration at or below 
median and total remuneration capable 
of delivering upper quartile reward for 
upper quartile performance.  
During the year the Committee 
conducted an in-depth review of 
our remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors and concluded that the 
structure of executive remuneration 
arrangements, as revised last year to 
remove the Deferred Bonus Matching 
Plan (DBMP), continues to be appropriate 
and effective going forward. Our updated 
policy therefore remains largely 
unchanged, but will incorporate some 
new features that ensure alignment with 
best practice and shareholders’ interests. 
The Committee consulted with its largest 
shareholders during the year on the 
above changes, and received broad 
support for the proposals. 
Annual bonus measures 
The Committee has reweighted financial 
measures to reflect the Company’s 
business priorities and has simplified 
the approach to measurement of non-
financial measures. The weightings 
are now 40% on EPS; 20% on PBT; 
20% on cash flow; and 20% on non-
financial measures. 
All financial measures will be assessed 
on a sliding scale with corresponding 
payment between a threshold and 
maximum level of performance, defined 
by the Committee at the start of each 
financial year. Non-financial measures will 
be condensed to focus on the key c 5-6 
strategic targets for each executive. We 
will provide enhanced retrospective 
disclosure of non-financial measures. 
Removal of the DBMP 
Following shareholder feedback, and  
as outlined in our Annual Report on 
Remuneration for 2015/16, no further 
matching awards will be made to 
Executive Directors (or any other 
members of the senior management 
team) under the DBMP. As such, we 
will formally remove this element 
from the Policy Report this year. 
Holding periods for the Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) 
For awards granted from 2017 a 2-year 
holding period will be introduced for any 
shares vesting under the PSP following 
the 3-year performance period, resulting 
in a total 5-year time horizon for long-
term incentives. 
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) 
We have removed the provision to 
grant a portion of awards as CSOP 
options, simplifying and reducing the 
administrative complexity of the PSP. 
The flexibility to make awards in the form 
of conditional shares or nil-cost options 
has been retained, in line with typical 
market practice.

Clawback and malus 
We have extended the malus and 
clawback provisions to apply to all 
incentive awards, including the annual 
bonus plan and PSP for Executive 
Directors. The circumstances in which 
malus and clawback may be applied are:  
• if the accounts used to determine 
vesting levels have to be materially 
corrected;  
• actual performance being materially 
worse than originally believed; 
• gross misconduct; and 
• the award holder leaving employment 
in circumstances in which the award 
did not lapse and facts emerge which, 
if known at the time, would have 
caused the award to lapse on leaving 
or caused the Committee to exercise 
any discretion under the plans 
differently. 
Leaver provisions 
As communicated in our announcement 
to the market on 21 July 2016, the 
Committee notes that a significant 
proportion of our shareholders disagreed 
with the decision to disapply time pro-
rating for the outstanding awards for our 
retiring Executive Directors. As a result of 
this, we have removed from our policy 
the Committee’s discretion to waive time 
pro-rating of any incentive awards; any 
incentive awards paid to an Executive 
Director who is a good leaver will be 
subject to performance and time  
pro-rating.  
New Chief Executive 
Archie Bethel took over as Chief Executive 
on 1 September 2016, at which point 
the Committee reviewed his salary and 
determined that a salary of £750,000 (as 
initially indicated in last year’s report) was 
appropriate. Following the removal of the 
DBMP this represents a reduction in 
overall total remuneration relative to his 
predecessor. His maximum annual bonus 
and PSP opportunities remain unchanged 
at 150% and 200% of salary respectively. 
At the annual salary review for 2017/18, 
all Executive Directors’ salaries were 
increased by 2%, broadly in line with the 
average salary increase across the wider 
employee population.  
Remuneration outcomes for 
2016/17 
Against the background reported in the 
Chairman’s statement earlier in this 
Annual Report: 
• annual bonus payments in respect of 
the year to 31 March 2017 ranged 
from 44% to 65% of maximum (see 
page 115 for more detail); and 
• performance over the longer-term 
performance period from 1 April 2014 
to 31 March 2017 is expected to result 
in 26.5% vesting of the PSP awards 
made in 2014 and 17.0% vesting of 
the matching awards made that year 
under the DBMP.

Terms of reference for the Committee are available for inspection on the Company’s website and were reviewed during the year. Duties 
of the Committee include the review of the policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman, as well as their 
specific remuneration packages. In determining the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account all factors which it deems 
necessary to ensure that members of the senior executive management of the Group are provided with appropriate incentives to 
encourage strong performance and that they are rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company in a fair 
and responsible manner.

Remuneration Policy Report 
Our current remuneration policy was approved at the 2014 AGM. As such we are required by governing legislation to put a new 
remuneration policy to shareholders for a binding vote at the 2017 AGM and, if approved, we will apply that new policy to payments 
made after that date and replace the existing remuneration policy in its entirety. It is intended that the new Remuneration Policy will 
apply for three years, although the Committee may seek approval for a new policy at an earlier point if it is considered appropriate. 
Key principles of the remuneration policy  
Objective 
To provide fair remuneration arrangements that allow for enhanced rewards for delivery of superior performance by allowing for the 
possibility of upper quartile rewards for upper quartile performance, that align Directors’ and shareholders’ interests and take account of risk. 
Our policy for executives reflects a preference that we believe is shared by the majority of our shareholders – to rely more heavily on the 
value of variable performance-related rewards, rather than on the fixed elements of pay. The rationale is to incentivise and reward success. 
Weighting towards long-term, performance-related pay 
The focus of our executive remuneration is, therefore, weighted towards performance-related pay with a significant element weighted 
towards long-term rather than short-term performance. We believe that, properly structured and with suitable safeguards, variable, 
performance-related rewards are the best way of linking pay to strategy, risk management and shareholders’ interests. 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy  
Summary of the remuneration policy for Executive Directors (Policy Table) 
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance metrics 
Fixed pay    
Base salary     
Should be at a level that 
is (i) fair and (ii) capable, 
when taken with the 
gearing effect of 
performance-related pay, of 
delivering upper 
quartile actual 
remuneration for 
upper quartile 
performance. 
Base salaries are reviewed annually, 
with reference to the individual’s 
role, experience and performance; 
salary levels at relevant comparators 
are considered but do not in 
themselves drive decision-making. 
In respect of existing Executive Directors, 
it is anticipated that decisions on any salary 
increases will be guided by the increases 
for the wider employee population over the 
term of this policy. In certain circumstances 
(including, but not limited to, a material increase 
in job size or complexity, market forces, 
promotion or recruitment) the Committee has 
discretion to make appropriate adjustments to 
salary levels to ensure they remain fair and 
competitive. 
Latest salaries are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 119. 
Business and individual 
performance are 
considerations in 
setting base salary. 
Pension    
To provide market 
competitive retirement 
benefits. 
Cash supplement in lieu wholly 
or partly of pension benefits for 
ongoing service and/or 
membership of the group’s 
Defined Benefit or Defined 
Contribution pension scheme. 
All the Executive Directors currently receive 
a cash supplement of 25% of base pay in lieu 
of all pension benefits.  
The cash supplement payable is set having regard 
to market practice, and in the context of the 
other elements of the remuneration package, 
notably base salary. Other than in exceptional 
cases (such as to replace existing arrangements 
for new recruits) the Committee does not 
anticipate employer contributions into a defined 
contribution pension scheme or cash in lieu of 
benefit as being at a cost to the Company that 
would exceed 25% of base salary. 
Not performance

Fixed pay    
Benefits    
Designed to be 
competitive in the market 
in which the individual is 
employed or to meet 
costs effectively incurred 
at the Company’s request. 
A range of benefits are provided which may include life 
insurance; medical insurance; car and fuel benefits and 
allowances; home to work travel and related costs if 
agreed on an individual basis or if incurred at the request 
of the Company; accommodation benefits and related 
costs if based away from home at the request of the 
Company; Board function-related costs; and, in certain 
circumstances, cash allowances in respect of the tax 
charge on accommodation or travel to work benefit 
if incurred at the request of the Company or with its 
prior approval. 
Other benefits (eg relocation) may be offered if considered 
appropriate and reasonable by the Committee. 
Benefit values vary by 
role and are periodically 
reviewed and set at a  
level which the Committee 
considers appropriate in 
light of relevant market 
practice for the role and 
individual circumstances. 
The cost of the benefits 
provided changes in 
accordance with market 
conditions and will, 
therefore, determine the 
maximum amount that 
would be paid in the form 
of benefits during the 
period of this policy.  
The Committee retains 
the discretion to approve 
a higher cost in certain 
circumstances (eg 
relocation) or in 
circumstances where 
factors outside 
the Company’s control 
have changed materially.

Variable pay 
   
Annual bonus    
To underpin delivery of 
year-on-year financial 
performance and progress 
towards strategic non-
financial objectives, being 
structured to motivate 
delivery against targets 
and achievement 
of stretching 
outperformance, whilst 
mindful of achievement 
of long-term strategy and 
longer-term risks to the 
Company. 
The requirement to defer  
a substantial part of bonus  
into Company shares 
strengthens the link to 
long-term sustainable 
growth. 
Performance targets are set at the start of the year and 
reflect the responsibilities of the executive in relation to 
the delivery of our strategy. 
At the end of the year, the Committee determines the 
extent to which these targets have been achieved. The 
Committee has the discretion to adjust the outcome 
(up or down) within the limits of the plan for corporate 
transactions, unforeseen events, factors outside 
reasonable management control, changes to business 
priorities or operational arrangements, to ensure targets 
represent and remain a fair measure of performance. In 
addition, the Committee considers health and safety 
performance and it may reduce or cancel any annual 
bonus otherwise payable if it considers it appropriate to 
do so in light of that performance. 
At least 40% of annual bonus payments for Executive 
Directors must be deferred into awards over Company 
shares for three years. Mandatory deferred bonus awards 
are subject to potential forfeiture if the holder leaves before 
the awards vest. Malus and clawback apply to cash and 
deferred bonus awards if the accounts used to determine 
the bonus level have to be materially corrected, if the 
Committee subsequently comes to a view that bonus year 
performance was materially worse than originally believed, 
in the event of gross misconduct, or if the award holder 
leaves employment in circumstances in which the deferred 
bonus did not lapse and facts emerge which, if known at 
the time, would have caused the deferred bonus to lapse 
on leaving or caused the Committee to exercise any 
discretion differently. 
Maximum bonus 
opportunity is 
150% of salary. 
For achievement of 
threshold, up to 15% of 
maximum bonus is earned; 
for achievement of target 
up to 55% of maximum 
bonus is earned. 
Performance is 
determined by the 
Committee on an 
annual basis by 
reference to Group 
and/or divisional 
financial measures, eg 
EPS growth, PBT, OCF, 
as well as the 
achievement of non-
financial objectives. 
The financial and 
personal/strategic 
objectives are  
typically weighted  
80% and 20% of 
maximum, 
respectively. 
The Committee retains 
discretion to vary the 
financial measures  
and their weightings 
annually, to ensure 
alignment with the 
business priorities for 
the year.

The award levels and performance conditions, on which 
vesting depends, are reviewed from time to time to 
ensure they remain appropriate. 
Participants will receive cash or shares equal to the value 
of any dividends that would have been paid over the 
vesting period on awards that vest. 
The Committee has the ability to exercise discretion to 
override the PSP outcome in circumstances where strict 
application of the performance conditions would 
produce a result inconsistent with the Company’s 
remuneration principles. 
An additional 2-year holding period will apply to Executive 
Directors’ vested shares before they are released. 
Malus and clawback apply to PSP awards if there is a 
misstatement of the Group’s financial results for any period,
if the Committee subsequently comes to a view that 
performance was materially worse than originally believed, 
in the event of gross misconduct, or if the award holder 
leaves employment in circumstances in which the award

All-employee plans – Babcock Employee Share Plan 
To encourage employee 
ownership of Company 
shares. 
Open to all UK tax resident employees of participating 
Group companies. Executive Directors are eligible 
to participate. 
The plan is an HMRC approved share incentive plan that 
allows an employee to purchase shares (through the plan 
trustees) out of pre-tax salary which, if held for periods of 
time approved by HMRC (currently three to five years), are 
taxed on a favourable basis. 
The Company can match purchased shares with an 
award of free shares. Matching shares are forfeited if 
employees leave within three years of their award 
(other than for ‘good leaver’ reasons). 
Participants can purchase 
shares up to the prevailing 
HMRC limit at the time 
employees are invited 
to participate. 
The Company currently 
offers to match purchases 
made through the plan at 
the rate of one free 
matching share for every 
10 shares purchased.  
The matching rate is 
reviewed periodically, and 
any future offer will be 
bound by the prevailing  
HMRC limit.

Approach to recruitment remuneration – (Recruitment policy) 
In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of 
remuneration, as follows: 
Pay element Policy on recruitment Maximum 
Salary Based on size and nature of responsibilities of the proposed role; the 
candidate’s experience; implications for total remuneration positioning 
vs. market pay levels for comparable roles; internal relativities; and the 
candidate’s current salary. 
N/A 
Pension Membership of pension scheme or salary supplement on a similar basis 
to other executives, as described in the policy table. 
N/A 
Benefits Provision of benefits on a similar basis to other executives, as described 
in the policy table. 
N/A 
Annual bonus As described in the policy table, and may be pro-rated for proportion of 
year served. 
150% of salary 
Performance Share 
Plan  
New appointees may be granted awards under the PSP on similar terms 
to other executives. 
200% of salary 
All-employee plans New appointees may be granted awards under all-employee plans on 
similar terms to other executives. 
As per Policy Table 
Other In determining appropriate remuneration for new Executive Directors, 
the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors 
(including quantum, the nature of remuneration and where the 
candidate was recruited from) to ensure that arrangements are in the 
best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Committee 
may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to ‘replace’ 
incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In 
doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any 
performance conditions attached to these awards, time to vesting 
and the likelihood of those conditions being met. The fair value of the 
compensatory award would not be greater than the awards being 
replaced. In order to facilitate like-for-like compensatory awards on 
recruitment, the Committee may avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.2(2) 
if required. 
N/A 
Other recruitment events 
Internal promotion When appointing a new Executive Director by way of promotion 
from an internal role, the Committee will be consistent with the 
policy for external hires detailed above. Where an individual has 
contractual commitments, outstanding incentive awards and/or 
pension arrangements prior to their promotion to Executive Director, 
the Company may honour those arrangements; however, where 
appropriate, these would be expected to transition over time 
to the arrangements as stated above. 
N/A 
Non-Executive  
Director 
When recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee or 
Board will structure pay in line with the existing policy, namely a 
base fee in line with the current fee schedule, with additional fees 
for fulfilling the role of Senior Independent Director and Chairmanship 
of the Audit and Risk and Remuneration Committees.

Changes to the approved Remuneration Policy 
• Formally removing the matching element of the DBMP (as outlined in last year’s annual report on remuneration) 
• Introducing a 2-year holding period on any shares vesting under the PSP 
• Simplifying the PSP by removing the provision to grant a portion of awards as CSOP options 
• Ensuring that clawback and malus provisions apply on a consistent basis for all incentive awards 
• Removing the discretion for the Committee to waive time pro-rating on any incentive awards for Executive Directors who are  
‘good leavers’. 
Rationale for the changes above is set out in the Annual Statement. 
Payments from existing awards and commitments 
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award or other commitment made prior to the approval and implementation 
of the remuneration policy detailed in this report.  
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting 
The measures used under annual bonus plans are selected annually to reflect the Group’s main strategic objectives for the year and reflect 
both financial and non-financial priorities. Performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, taking into account the Company’s 
strategic priorities and the economic environment in which the Company operates. Financial targets are set taking into account a range of 
reference points including the Group’s strategic and operating plan. 
The Committee considers at length the appropriate financial conditions and non-financial objectives to attach to annual bonus awards and 
the financial targets to attach to share awards to ensure they continue to be: (i) relevant to the Group’s strategic objectives and aligned 
with shareholders’ interests mindful of risk management; and (ii) fair by being suitably stretching whilst realistic. 
The Committee believes that TSR, EPS and ROCE continue to be effective measures of long-term performance for the Company, providing 
a good balance between shareholder value creation and line of sight for executives. 
The TSR performance measure is tested by reference to the Company’s relative long-term share price performance against suitable peers. 
The Committee believes that the use of relative TSR provides strong alignment with shareholders’ interests by incentivising management 
for the delivery of above-market returns. The TSR calculation would normally use a 12-month average for opening and closing share prices 
adjusted for dividends paid during the period. The Company feels that this is the most appropriate period because a 12-month average 
ensures both that short-term market volatility is excluded and that for each company a 12-month period will capture the impact of the 
announcement of results and payment of dividends. A shorter period would not capture all these events and would not necessarily put 
all companies on an equal footing. 
The use of an EPS growth performance measure, in the opinion of the Committee, focuses management on continued strong financial 
performance and is heavily dependent on the Company’s success in achieving its strategic goals. The Committee believes that ROCE 
reinforces the focus on returns for shareholders and encourages capital discipline.  
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to make adjustments to the calculation of short and long-term performance outcomes 
in circumstances where application of the formula would produce a result inconsistent with the Company’s remuneration principles. Such 
circumstances may include: changes in accounting standards, certain major corporate events such as rights issues, share buybacks, special 
dividends, corporate restructurings, acquisitions and disposals. 
The Committee reviews the performance conditions for share awards prior to the start of each cycle to ensure they remain appropriate. No 
material reduction in long-term incentive targets for future awards would be made without prior consultation with our major shareholders. 
Differences between Executive Director and general employee remuneration 
The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Board is consistent with that for the Executive 
Directors. Senior executives generally participate in the same long-term incentives as the Executive Directors with similar performance 
measures applied. The remuneration policy for our Executive Directors is considered with the remuneration philosophy and principles that 
underpin remuneration for the wider Group in mind. The remuneration arrangements for other employees reflect local market practice 
and seniority of each role. As a result, the levels and structure of remuneration for different groups of employees will differ from the policy 
for executives as set out above but with the common intention that remuneration arrangements for all groups might reasonably be 
considered to be fair having regard to such factors.

Balance of remuneration for Executive Directors 
The charts below provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split 
between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: ‘Minimum’, ‘On-target’ and ‘Maximum’. 
Potential reward opportunities are based on the Company’s remuneration policy and implementation in 2017/18, as outlined in the 
Chairman’s statement and later in the Annual Report on Remuneration, applied to base salaries as at 1 April 2017. Note that the projected 
values exclude the impact of any share price movements. For this reason, were the PSP shares to vest in full, actual total remuneration may 
exceed the value shown in the chart below. 
 
The ‘Minimum’ scenario shows base salary, pension (and/or pay in lieu of pension) and benefits (i.e. fixed remuneration). These are the only 
elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages which are not at risk. 
The ‘On-target’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus a pay-out of 55% of the annual bonus and threshold vesting of 16.7% of 
the maximum award under the PSP. 
The ‘Maximum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full pay-out of all incentives.

Shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors 
The Committee sets shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal 
(and/or spousal) holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least twice the Executive Director’s annual base salary (three 
times for the CEO).  
The guidelines also state that an Executive Director is expected to retain at least half of any shares acquired on the exercise of a share 
award that remain after the sale of sufficient shares to cover tax and national insurance triggered by the exercise (and associated dealing 
costs) until the guideline level is achieved and thereafter maintained. The Executive Directors’ compliance with these guidelines is shown 
in the table on page 126. 
Details of Directors’ service contracts and exit payments and treatment of awards on a change of control 
The following summarises the key terms (excluding remuneration) of the Directors’ service contracts or terms of appointment: 
Executive Directors

(Chief Executive)

12 months from Company,  
6 months from Director 
John Davies  
(Chief Executive, Land) 
20 December 2012 12 months from Company,  
12 months from Director 
The latest service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office and will also be available at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting. 
The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors’ service contracts should be capable of being terminated by the Company on not more 
than 12 months’ notice. The Executive Directors’ service contracts entitle the Company to terminate their employment without notice by 
making a payment of salary and benefits in lieu of notice. In these circumstances, since 2012, new Executive Directors’ contracts (those for 
Archie Bethel, John Davies and Franco Martinelli) allow the Company to choose to make the payment in lieu by monthly instalments and 
mitigation applies such that the Committee may decide to reduce or discontinue further instalments. For contracts made before 2012 
(for Bill Tame only) such a payment would be by way of a lump sum payment on termination. If the Company terminates an Executive 
Director’s service contract it will have regard to all the circumstances (including the scope for mitigation) and the Company’s 
interests in determining the amount of compensation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination. 
The contract for Bill Tame contains provisions which provide that within 90 days of the occurrence of a change of control of the Company, 
he may terminate his employment forthwith. If he exercises this right, he is entitled, for a 12-month period, to be paid (on a monthly basis) 
his base salary plus 40% (compared to a maximum entitlement under the annual bonus plan of 150%) in lieu of bonus and all other 
contractual entitlements. From this payment there is to be deducted any amount that he receives by way of income, if it exceeds 10% of 
his Babcock salary, from other sources that he would not have been able to earn had he continued in employment with the Company. 
The contract for Bill Tame also provides that if the Company terminates his appointment within 12 months of a change of control, he 
would be entitled to a termination payment equal to 100% of annual salary (plus 40% in lieu of bonus and all other benefits), subject to 
any additional entitlement as outlined below. 
No other Executive Director has these arrangements in their service contract.

(in each case evidenced to the Committee’s satisfaction). The treatment of share awards held by Directors who leave on other grounds is entirely at the discretion 
of the Committee and in deciding whether (and the extent to which) it would be appropriate to exercise that discretion the Committee will have regard to all 
the circumstances. 
External appointments of Executive Directors 
The Executive Directors may accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Chairman, provided that such appointments do 
not prejudice the individual’s ability to fulfil their duties at the Group. Any fees for outside appointments are retained by the Director.

The latest written terms of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office and at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting. The expected time commitment of Non-Executive Directors is set out in their current written terms of appointment. 
The Group’s Non-Executive Directors serve under letters of appointment as detailed in the table above, normally for no more than 
three-year terms at a time; however, in all cases appointments are terminable at will at any time by the Company or the Director. All Non-
Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election by the Company in general meeting in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Details of the Non-Executive Directors’ terms of appointment are shown in the table. The appointment and re-appointment and the 
remuneration of Non-Executive Directors are matters reserved for the Nominations Committee and Executive Directors, respectively. 
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees have been set at a level to reflect the amount of time and level of involvement required in order to carry 
out their duties as members of the Board and its Committees. The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Company’s 
performance-related incentive plans and do not receive any pension contributions. 
Details of the policy on fees paid to our Non-Executive Directors are set out in the table below: 
Function Operation Opportunity Performance measures 
To attract and retain high-calibre 
Non-Executive Directors with 
commercial and other 
experience relevant to the 
Company 
Fee levels are reviewed against market 
practice from time to time (by the 
Chairman and the Executive Directors 
in the case of Non-Executive Director fees 
and by the Committee in respect of fees 
payable to the Chairman), with any 
adjustments normally being made on 
1 April in the review year. Additional 
fees are payable for acting as Chairman 
of the Audit and Risk, and Remuneration 
Committees.  
Non-Executive Directors do not 
participate in any incentive schemes, 
nor do they receive any pension or 
benefits (other than the cost of nominal 
travel and accommodation expenses). 
Fee levels are reviewed by reference to 
FTSE listed companies of similar size and 
complexity. Time commitment, level of 
involvement required and responsibility 
are taken into account when reviewing 
fee levels. This may result in higher fee 
levels for overseas Directors. 
Fees for the year ending 31 March 2017 
and those for the year ending 31 March 
2018 are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 124. 
Non-Executive Director fee 
increases are applied in line 
with the outcome of the 
periodic fee review.  
Any increases to the Non-
Executive Director fee will 
typically be in line with general 
movements in market levels of 
Non-Executive Director fees.  
In the event that there is a 
material misalignment with the 
market or a change in the 
complexity, responsibility or time 
commitment required to fulfil a 
Non-Executive Director role, the 
Board has discretion to make an 
appropriate adjustment to the 
fee level.

Consideration of employee views 
When reviewing Executive Director pay the Committee is aware of the proposals for review of remuneration of all employees. 
The Committee receives regular updates on salary increases, bonus and share awards made to employees throughout the Group. 
These matters are considered when conducting the annual review of executive remuneration.  
The Company seeks to promote and maintain good relationships with employee representative bodies as part of its employee 
engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and 
regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company now formally presents a summary of its policy for 
remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors to the Babcock Employee Forum, which is attended by representatives from 
across the business operations, and will consider any feedback from that Forum.

Consideration of shareholder views 
When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account views of leading shareholders and best practice guidelines issued by 
institutional shareholder bodies. The Committee is always open to feedback from shareholders on remuneration policy and arrangements, 
as reflected in the changes to this Remuneration Policy, and commits to undergoing consultation with leading shareholders in advance of 
any significant changes to remuneration policy. The Committee will continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate 
governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the executive remuneration remains appropriate.

The Committee  
The members of the Committee are appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee and, in accordance 
with provision D 2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee is made up of the independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
membership of the Committee currently and during the year to 31 March 2017 (with each member serving throughout the year) as well 
as attendance at Committee meetings in the year is shown below. The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.

The Group Chairman and the Chief Executive normally attend meetings by invitation, as does the Group Finance Director on occasion, but 
they are not present when their own remuneration is being decided. The Company Secretary attends meetings as Secretary to the 
Committee. The Group Director of Organisation and Development also attends meetings. 
Advisers 
Kepler, a brand of Mercer (which is part of the MMC group of companies), was appointed by the Committee in late 2008, following a 
selection process including interviewing a number of candidate firms, to provide it with objective and independent analysis, information 
and advice on all aspects of executive remuneration and market practice, within the context of the objectives and policy set by the 
Committee. Kepler reports directly to the Committee Chairman. A representative from Kepler typically attends Committee meetings. 
Kepler also provides participant communications, performance reporting, and non-executive directors’ fee benchmarking services to 
the Company. Kepler is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for consultants to 
remuneration committees of UK listed companies, details of which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. Kepler 
adheres to this Code of Conduct. The fees paid to Kepler in respect of work for the Committee carried out in the year under review 
totalled £125,190 on the basis of time and materials, excluding expenses and VAT. 
The Committee reviews Kepler’s involvement each year and considers any other relationships that Kepler’s parent company has with the 
Company that may limit their independence. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Kepler is objective and independent 
and that any services provided by their parent to the Company do not impair their independence. 
How often it meets 
In total there were 6 meetings in the year to 31 March 2017. The Committee plans to meet at least 6 times in the year to 
31 March 2018.

As communicated in our announcement to the market on 21 July 2016, the Committee notes that a significant proportion of our 
shareholders disagreed with the decision to disapply time pro-rating for the outstanding awards for our retiring Executive Directors in 
2016. As a result of this, we have removed Committee discretion to waive time pro-rating of any incentive awards; any incentive awards 
paid to a ‘good leaver’ will be subject to performance and time pro-rating. Additionally, the Committee has consulted with its major 
shareholders during the year, and will continue to engage with shareholders to facilitate a better understanding of the Company, the 
environment in which it operates and how this translates into the Group’s executive remuneration policy.

(a) Archie Bethel was appointed as Chief Operating Officer on 1 April 2016 on a salary of £550,000. On 1 September 2016, he was appointed as Chief Executive on a 
salary of £750,000.  
(b) Peter Rogers retired as a Director on 31 August 2016, figures for 2016/17 are shown for the part-year up to this date. 
The figures have been calculated as follows: 
(1) Salary: basic salary amount paid in the year.  
(2) Benefits in kind and cash: the value of benefits and salary supplements (other than those in lieu of pensions) including medical insurance, home to work travel 
expenses incurred at the request of the Company, accommodation-related benefits, car and fuel benefits and costs in connection with accommodation. Archie Bethel 
in 16/17 received £173,806 and John Davies £62,200 in connection with their accommodation costs in London, at the Company’s request, to enable them to lead 
the business effectively. 
(3) Pension: for all Executive Directors the numbers above represent for each year the value of the cash supplement of 25% of salary paid to each of them; except for 
John Davies in 2016 for which they represent (i) 20 times the increase in accrued benefit over the year in question less his contributions, plus (ii) a cash supplement 
of £36,000. 
(4) Annual bonus (cash or voluntarily deferred bonus): this is the part of total annual bonus earned for performance during the year (see page 115) that is not required to 
be mandatorily deferred into a basic award of shares under the DBMP (see page 116) and that is to be satisfied in cash. As disclosed in last year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration, Peter Rogers was eligible for a time pro-rated annual bonus opportunity for 2016/17 of 75% of annualised salary. 
(5) DBMP deferred annual bonus: this is the mandatorily deferred element of the annual bonus earned for performance during the year, which will vest after three years. 
(6) DBMP (matching awards): the market value of awards that vest on performance to (i) 31 March 2017: based on vesting as to 17.0% of the total award (see page 118) 
and an average share price in the 3 months to 31 March 2017 of 910p and (ii) 31 March 2016: based on vesting as to 57.8%. Note: the difference between the 
2015/16 DBMP figures in the table above and the equivalent numbers disclosed in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration reflects truing up for the actual share 
price on subsequent actual vesting on 13 June 2016 of 999.5p. 
(7) PSP: the market value of awards that vest on performance to (i) 31 March 2017: based on vesting as to 26.5% of the total award (see page 118) and an average share 
price in the 3 months to 31 March 2017 of 910p and (ii) 31 March 2016: based on vesting as to 37.3%. Note: the difference between the 2015/16 PSP figures in 
the table above and the equivalent numbers disclosed in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration reflects the actual share price on subsequent actual vesting on 
13 June 2016 of 999.5p. 
(8) Dividends: the total value of dividends accruing on long-term incentive awards (other than on mandatory and voluntary deferral of bonus awards under the 
DBMP/DBP) vesting on performance to (i) 31 March 2017 and (ii) 31 March 2016, payable in cash on exercise of the award.

Pensions 
None of the Executive Directors participated in a Group pension scheme or otherwise receive pension benefits from the Group for service 
during the year to 31 March 2017. They instead received a cash supplement equal to 25% of their base salary in lieu of pension benefits. 
There are no additional early retirement benefits. 
Supplements paid in lieu of pension do not count for pension, share award or bonus purposes. 
Babcock International Group Pension Scheme (the Scheme) (audited) 
Bill Tame was an active member of the senior executive tier of the Scheme until 30 September 2011. Archie Bethel was an active member 
of the executive tier of the Scheme until 31 March 2012. Franco Martinelli was an active member of the executive tier of the Scheme until 
31 March 2015. Whilst still members of the Scheme, Bill Tame accrued benefits at the rate of one-thirtieth, and for Archie Bethel and 
Franco Martinelli the rate of accrual was one-forty-fifth, of pensionable salary for each year of service, with a cash supplement on earnings 
over the applicable scheme earnings cap. Until 31 March 2016, John Davies was a member of the VT Upper Section Ex-Short 
Brothers section of the Scheme and accrued benefits on earnings up to the scheme earnings cap at the rate of one-sixtieth of pensionable 
salary for each year of service. 
Pension entitlements under the Scheme (defined benefit) for the year to 31 March 2017 are set out in the following table:

Note: The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme, or for any benefits in 
respect of earnings in excess of the earnings cap. In calculating the above figures no account has been taken of any retained benefits that 
the Director may have from previous employments. 
Directors also benefit from life assurance cover of four times base salary. The cost of providing that life assurance cover was:

Annual Bonus 
2016/17 Annual bonus (audited) 
For our Executive Directors’ annual bonus plans in 2016/17, as in previous years, a mix of financial and non-financial measures was used. 
The non-financial measures were principally based on the key themes that the Committee considers to be of material importance to the 
continued success of the Company. Objectives for the 2016/17 bonus were set by the Committee at the beginning of the year. 
The table below sets out the annual bonus plan in place for the Executive Directors and the outturn under them in 2016/17. The figures in 
the table below for actual outturn exclude the effect of changes in exchange rates.

(1) Threshold vesting is 20% of maximum for each financial bonus element except for EPS performance, where 18% of maximum vests at threshold. In line with our policy, 
overall vesting at threshold is no more than 15% when all measures are taken into account. 
(2) Before amortisation of acquired intangibles. The treatment of exceptional items is at the discretion of the Committee. 
(3) The Committee considers that the divisional budgets remain commercially sensitive given the strategic nature of some of our customers or their activities and they 
would also be of assistance to competitors, and will not be published. 
(4) Non-financial objectives were set around the strategic and risk management ‘Themes’, which for the year were Reputation; Growth; Employees; and Processes. Within 
these Themes were areas of ‘Focus’ and for each such area there were a number of more detailed ‘Indicators’ relating to specific matters that fall within that area of 
Focus. The plan did not ascribe fixed amounts of potential bonus to particular Themes, areas of Focus or Indicators as Directors are expected to respond to changing 
internal or external priorities, conditions or developments within those areas over the year in the best interests of the Group without being tied to or having to have 
regard to a set of objectives that were framed before the year got under way. At the end of the bonus year, the Committee reviewed progress against the Themes, 
Focuses and Indicators overall having regard to all relevant circumstances and made an assessment as to performance on non-financial measures and what the 
appropriate bonus payment was for that. 
The actual ‘Indicators’ used in the year are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they tend to be ongoing in nature, relating as they do to customer 
relationships, specific bids, specific strategic steps or objectives, security measures and personnel matters. By way of example, areas of focus typically include 
maintenance and development of reputation (with customers and investors, including specified improved strategic and customer engagement and key relationship 
objectives; ethical training and compliance); growth (relating to strategy planning and business development steps and positioning, progress against existing strategic 
plans, particularly for territories outside the UK, specific bidding or market targets and objectives, development and leveraging of identified strategic partnerships, 
organisational and management changes to support growth and strategic objectives); employee development and engagement (communications and cultural 
initiatives, diversity; talent identification, development and succession planning initiatives and programmes; development of graduate and apprentice recruitment 
and development of the group’s relationships with universities); process improvements (development of IT strategy, upgrading and development of resource planning 
and management information systems, cyber-security and information assurance objectives). 
Additionally, Health and Safety performance is an overriding underpin to all elements of the annual bonus scheme allowing the Committee to reduce or withhold 
entirely any bonus otherwise payable if it considers such performance to have been unsatisfactory. 
(5) As disclosed in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, Peter Rogers was eligible for a time pro-rated annual bonus opportunity for 2016/17 of 75% of salary.

Annual bonus deferral into shares (audited) 
To ensure that a substantial part of the Director’s annual bonus is exposed to the longer term impact of decision-making and further to 
align their interests with shareholders, 40% of any annual bonus earned by Executive Directors (and other senior executives) must be 
deferred into Company shares (by means of an award of nil-cost options). 
Mandatorily deferred annual bonus awards (Basic Awards) are subject to potential forfeiture if the holder leaves before the awards vest 
(other than by reason of death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company or business in which they are employed ceasing to be 
part of the Group).

exceptional performance. For the comparative TSR element, threshold vesting (16.7% of this element) would be for performance in line with the median of the FTSE 350 
(excluding investment trusts and financial services companies) and maximum vesting would be for 9% pa outperformance of the median, representing upper quartile 
performance. For the ROCE element, the target for maximum vesting of these awards was set at 15% and for threshold vesting at 12%.

performance. For the ROCE element, the target for maximum vesting of these awards was set at 15% and for threshold vesting at 12%.

Annual bonus deferral into shares (audited) 
To ensure that a substantial part of the Director’s annual bonus is exposed to the longer term impact of decision-making and further to 
align their interests with shareholders, 40% of any annual bonus earned by Executive Directors (and other senior executives) must be 
deferred into Company shares (by means of an award of nil-cost options). 
Mandatorily deferred annual bonus awards (Basic Awards) are subject to potential forfeiture if the holder leaves before the awards vest 
(other than by reason of death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company or business in which they are employed ceasing to be 
part of the Group).

Note: TSR comparators are the companies comprised in the FTSE 350 (excluding investment trusts and financial services companies). Threshold vesting (16.7% of this 
element) for the EPS element was set at growth of 4% per annum and maximum vesting at growth of 11% per annum. We believe that growth of 11% would represent 
exceptional performance. For the comparative TSR element, threshold vesting (16.7% of this element) would be for performance in line with the median of the FTSE 350 
(excluding investment trusts and financial services companies) and maximum vesting would be for 9% pa outperformance of the median, representing upper quartile 
performance. For the ROCE element, the target for maximum vesting of these awards was set at 15% and for threshold vesting at 12%.

* In the form of nil-cost options. 
Only Peter Rogers was eligible to participate in the DBMP in 2016/17. The plan has now been removed from the Remuneration Policy and 
no further matching awards will be granted to Executive Directors. The DBMP allowed the Committee to make matching share awards of 
up to two times the deferred bonus shares (40% of bonus) and any additional shares or extra bonus deferral self-invested under the plan by 
the Director (of an amount equal to up to 40% of salary). The matching share award is performance-related and only vests to the extent 
that the performance criteria are met in respect of the three-year performance period. For the 2016 cycle, the performance period runs 
from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2019, the same as for PSP awards made in 2016 and the same performance targets apply. The maximum 
match is 2 for 1 on any shares held under the plan; 0.25 matching shares would be released for each such share at threshold vesting. 
Therefore, for each measure, threshold vesting would be a (0.25/3) for 1 match (4.2% of maximum) and maximum vesting would be a 
(2/3) for 1 match (33% of maximum).

Sourcing of shares 
Shares needed to satisfy share awards for Directors are either fresh issue shares issued to the Group’s employee share trusts to meet share 
awards or shares purchased in the market by the trusts using funds advanced by the Company. The source selection is finalised on or 
before vesting, the choice being based on what the Board considers is in the best interests of the Company at the time, and what is 
permissible within available headroom and dilution limits.

Executive Directors’ remuneration for 2017/18 
Following consultation with the Company’s major shareholders, the Committee has considered carefully both best practice and 
shareholders’ interests. Whilst the updated policy is substantially unchanged, it does incorporate new features that further align 
the policy with best practice and shareholder interests. These new features are described in the Chairman’s Annual Statement. 
Base salary 
Executive Directors base salaries are reviewed each year with any changes usually taking effect from 1 April. The remuneration policy 
is pitched to deliver fixed remuneration at or below median and total remuneration capable of delivering upper quartile performance. 
The increase in Executive Directors’ salary for 2017/18 was in line with increases for the wider UK work force (see below).

Internal relativity 
As noted in our Remuneration policy, when reviewing Executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee takes note of proposals for pay in 
the wider Group. Each business within the Group determines its own pay structures and remuneration in light of its own position and the 
employment market in which it operates.  
The overall average salary increase for employees in the UK generally for the year to 31 March 2018 is expected to be in the range of 1% 
to 2% (with individual increases significantly above this amount in some cases) dependent on business and personal performance and local 
market conditions. The salary increase for the Executive Directors has been set at 2%. 
2017/18 Annual bonus 
For our Executive Directors’ annual bonus plans for 2017/18 we are continuing to use the broad structure adopted in 2016/17 as set out 
on page 115, with a reweighting of measures to be based 40% on EPS, 20% on PBT, 20% on OCF and 20% on non-financial objectives. For 
Executive Directors other than the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, a portion of the PBT and OCF element will be based on 
performance of their area of the business, and for the Chief Executive, Global Growth and Operations (GGO) a portion of the OCF element 
will be based on GGO measures. The Committee intends to disclose the Group financial performance targets for 2017/18 and non-
financial objectives retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, subject to these no longer being considered by the 
Board to be commercially sensitive. The Committee will seek to enhance its retrospective disclosure of non-financial objectives in 
particular. These will fall under the categories of: 
• Growth: continue delivery of value-creating growth 
• Technology: improve our technical offering and build barriers to entry 
• Resources: develop robust resourcing plans to meet the future growth plans of the business 
• Reputation: deliver value to our customers, enhance our reputation and sustain operational performance 
• Processes: continually improve our systems, technologies and processes to maximise business opportunities. 
The weighting of the elements of bonus is kept under review. 
For all Executive Directors, 40% of any earned bonus will continue to be deferred into shares for three years. 
PSP awards for 2017/18 
The Committee intends to grant awards in 2017/18 under the PSP of 200% of salary for all Executive Directors, with the performance 
measures and targets as follows: the EPS growth targets for 2017 awards in nominal terms of 4% pa to 11% pa over three years; TSR targets 
between median and median +9% relative to the peer group; ROCE targets (based on the average return over the performance period) will 
vest from 12% to 14.5%.

The awards are not subject to re-testing. The TSR element will vest only to the extent the Committee is satisfied 
that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying performance of the Company over the 
performance period. 
EPS is adjusted to exclude acquired intangible amortisation, but, unless the Committee decides otherwise in respect of 
any item, is after exceptional items. 
ROCE is underlying EBIT after amortisation of acquired intangibles but before exceptional items and including IFRIC 12 
investment income and the Group’s share of the EBIT of JVs, as a percentage of Average Capital Employed over the 
Performance Period where Capital Employed is calculated as Total Shareholders’ Equity plus Net Debt (or minus Net 
Funds), as stated in the Company’s consolidated audited accounts for the relevant Financial Year; and Average Capital 
Employed will be calculated as the average of the opening and closing value of Capital Employed for each year of the 
applicable Performance Period. ROCE targets set at the start of each cycle represent challenging returns in relation to 
the capital structure at that time, including the impact of any acquisitions or disposals made in the period prior to 
grant. The Committee has discretion to adjust the ROCE outcome for significant changes to the capital structure 
made during the performance period (e.g. acquisitions and disposals) to ensure a fair outcome for participants 
and shareholders. 
The awards carry the right to receive on vesting a payment equal to the value of any dividends in the period between 
grant and vesting but this right applies only to the shares that actually vest under the award. Exercise periods 
commence not less than three years from actual or nominal award grant date. 
CSOP and PSP awards are linked so that in aggregate the holder cannot receive more gross value from them than 
a standalone PSP award of shares equal to the relevant award multiple of the Director’s base salary.

Performance Period. For 2014 awards, the test is based on Average Capital Employed in the 2016/17 Financial Year, 
with EBIT for the Babcock businesses excluding Avincis (now called Mission Critical Services) being calculated after 
amortisation of acquired intangibles and EBIT for the Avincis business being calculated before amortisation of

disposals made in the period prior to grant. The Committee has discretion to adjust the ROCE outcome for significant 
changes to the capital structure made during the performance period (eg acquisitions and disposals) to ensure a fair 
outcome for participants and shareholders. 
The awards carry the right to receive on vesting a payment equal to the value of any dividends in the period 
between grant and vesting but this right applies only to the shares that actually vest under the award.  
Exercise periods commence not less than three years from actual or nominal award grant date.

Linkage of remuneration to strategic objectives, risk management and its alignment with shareholder interests 
The Committee links the remuneration of executives to the long-term interests of shareholders and key strategic and risk management 
objectives by the performance criteria it uses in the annual bonus and long-term incentive plans.  
Examples include the following: 
Strategic Objective (SO)/Risk (R) Annual bonus scheme metric Long-term incentive metric 
SO/R: Delivering superior  
and sustainable value for our 
shareholders, whilst balancing  
risk and reward. 
Financial measures focused on annual delivery of 
sustainable earnings and/or profits with stretch targets, 
whilst maintaining strict control of cash.  
Incentivising delivery of top quartile 
shareholder returns and earnings growth 
over the longer term. 
Long-term measures and deferral of 
significant part of annual bonus to guard 
against short-term steps being taken to 
maximise annual rewards at the expense 
of future performance. 
SO: Growth. Setting challenging budgets and stretch targets,  
as well as non-financial measures specifically aimed at: 
• laying the foundations for sustainable growth  
in specific existing and new geographical  
business markets; 
• winning key bids and re-bids; 
• fostering strategically important  
partnering arrangements. 
 
SO: Developing and maintaining 
leading market positions in the  
UK and selected overseas markets. 
Specific non-financial objectives for: 
• progressing plans for entry into or expansion 
in targeted domestic and overseas markets; 
• securing key business development milestones. 
 
SO: Building and maintaining 
customer focused, long-term 
relationships with strategically 
important customers.  
R: Loss of business reputation,  
poor contract performance. 
Non-financial objectives linked to: 
• customer satisfaction; 
• continuing improvement of management processes; 
• meeting and planning for existing and  
future customer expectations on capability and 
compliance, for example, in the field of security 
and information assurance. 
 
SO/R: Ensuring the Group will continue 
to retain and attract the suitably 
qualified and experienced people it 
needs to deliver its growth and 
strategic plans, maintain and develop 
its technical and management 
expertise. 
Non-financial objectives linked to recruitment and 
development, resource and succession planning,  
and fostering diversity and employee engagement. 
Retentive nature of the requirement for deferral  
into shares of 40% of annual bonuses earned by  
senior executives. 
Retentive nature of the  
long-term plans. 
SO/R: Maintenance of an  
excellent health, safety and 
environmental record. 
Overriding health, safety and environmental performance 
criterion in annual bonus plans.

Exit payments made in year (audited) 
No exit payments were made to Executive Directors during the year under review. 
Payments to past Directors (audited) 
As outlined in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, Peter Rogers retired from the Board on 31 August 2016. As he served as Chief 
Executive for most of the first half of the 2016/17 financial year, he also participated in the 2016/17 annual bonus plan on similar terms 
as for other Executive Directors, although on a time pro-rated basis, so that he will only receive 50% of the amount that would be payable 
for the full year after testing for performance. This payment, as included in his single figure of remuneration on page 113, is to be made in 
June 2017 as to 60% in cash and 40% by way of deferral in shares for three years into a basic award under the DBMP. He will not be eligible 
for a matching award on the deferral. Details of Peter Rogers’ other outstanding equity awards are included elsewhere in this report. 
Kevin Thomas retired from the Company on 31 March 2016, having previously served as an Executive Director until stepping down on 
31 December 2015. 37.3% and 57.8% of his existing 2013 PSP and 2013 DBMP matching awards, totalling 49,004 shares, vested at the 
normal time and in line with other participants on 13 June 2016. 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees (including the Chairman) 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive fixed fees. These fees are reviewed against market practice. From this year the review 
will take place annually (by the Chairman and the Executive Directors in the case of the Non-Executive Director fees and by the Committee 
in respect of the fees payable to the Chairman). The Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees were reviewed and set as of 1 April 2017. 
Prior to this, they were last increased in April 2015.

was invested on 1 April 2009 (investment in the Company was worth £276 on 31 March 2017). The Board considers that these indices 
currently represent the most appropriate of the published indices for these purposes as they provide a view of performance against the 
broad equity market and sector index of which the Company is a constituent.

Notes applicable to all tables on pages 127 to 131. 
Outstanding awards granted prior to June 2014 were adjusted to reflect the rights issue which completed during May 2014 using a standard adjustment factor of 
1.13417. Any reference price, including the exercise prices shown was also adjusted. 
(1) PSP = 2009 Performance Share Plan; CSOP = 2009 Company Share Option Plan; DBMP = 2012 Deferred Bonus Matching Plan; DBP = 2012 Deferred Bonus Plan. 
Further details about these plans and, where applicable, performance conditions attaching to the awards listed are to be found on pages 120 to 122. 
(2) The PSP and DBMP awards are structured as nil priced options. DBMP basic awards represent the amount of the annual bonus mandatorily deferred and DBMP 
voluntary deferral awards represent the amount voluntarily deferred by the Director, in each case converted into shares at their value at the award date.  
(3) Subject to the rules of the plan concerned, including as to meeting performance targets for PSP, CSOP and DBMP Matching Awards.  
(4) Where this date is less than ten years from the date of award, the Committee may extend the expiry date on one or more occasions, but not beyond the tenth 
anniversary of the award.  
(5) Awards shown in the table for Franco Martinelli for 2013 and June 2014 were made prior to his appointment as a Director, which took effect on 1 August 2014.

Employee involvement 
Engagement with our employees is 
important to Babcock. 
The Company operates a UK-approved 
share plan, the Babcock Employee Share 
Plan, which is open to all employees of 
participating UK Group companies. The 
Plan allows the Company to award free 
and/or matching shares to participants. 
The shares bought on behalf of the

employee trust. 
The trustees of the Plan exercise 
voting rights attached to those shares 
in accordance with directions from the 
employees on whose behalf they are held.

Plan which reflects the structure of the 
UK Plan. 
Senior employees of the Group are given 
awards under the Company’s long-term 
incentive plans as detailed in the 
Remuneration report on pages 98 to 
133. Shares intended to be used for 
satisfying existing share awards and 
options are held by the trustees of the 
Babcock Employee Share Trust and the 
Peterhouse Employee Share Trust. The

present intention of exercising the 
voting rights attached to the shares 
held by them. 
Twice a year representatives from across 
the UK and the other European countries 
in which we operate attend the Babcock 
International Group Employee Forum. 
Further information regarding our 
employees and their involvement within 
the business, including the Company’s 
policy on discrimination and diversity, can 
be found within the Sustainability Report 
on pages 64 to 65 and the Nominations 
Committee Report on page 93. 
Employment of disabled 
persons/equal opportunities 
Babcock is committed to equal 
opportunities and will not discriminate 
on the basis of disability, age, race, 
colour, ethnic origin, gender, marital 
status, religious or political beliefs or 
sexual orientation. 
We believe that only by encouraging 
applicants from the widest pool of talent 
possible and then selecting the best 
candidate based on their ability to do the 
job, can we ensure we continue to deliver 
our best for our customers and safeguard 
the future of Babcock. 
Research and development 
The Group commits resources to  
research and development to the extent 
management considers necessary for the 
evolution and growth of its business.

There are also qualifying third-party

between the Company and Archie Bethel 
and Kevin Thomas in their capacity as

Qualifying pension scheme indemnity 
provisions are also in place for the benefit

act as trustees of Group pension schemes. 
Significant agreements that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control 
Many agreements entered into by the 
Company or its subsidiaries contain 
provisions entitling the other parties to 
terminate them in the event of a change 
of control of the Group company 
concerned, which can often be triggered 
by a takeover of the Company. 
Although the Group has some contracts 
that on their own are not significant to 
the Group, several may be with the same 
customer. If, upon a change of control, 
the customer decided to terminate all 
such agreements, the aggregate impact 
could be significant. 
The following agreements are those 
individual agreements which the 
Company considers to be significant 
to the Group as a whole that contain 
provisions giving the other party a 
specific right to terminate them if 
the Company is subject to a change 
of control. 
Group 
Borrowing facilities 
The Company extended the maturity date 
of its five year £750,000,000 Revolving 
Credit Facility by a further year, from 
December 2019 to December 2020. 
The facility provides funds for general 
corporate and working capital purposes. 
In the event of a change of control of the 
Company, the facility agreement 
provides that the lenders may, within a 
certain period, call for the payment of 
any outstanding loans and cancel the 
credit facility. 
Multi-Currency Loan Note facility 
The Company has in issue £40 million 
5.405% Series B Shelf Notes due 21 
January 2020 (the Notes), a facility which 
is unsecured and unsubordinated and 
ranks pari passu with all other unsecured 
and unsubordinated financial 
indebtedness obligations of the 
Company. Unless previously redeemed 
or purchased and cancelled, the 
Company will redeem the Notes on 
21 January 2020 at their principal 
amount. In the event of a change of 
control of the Company before then, the 
Company must offer to repay the Notes 
together with a make-whole premium. 
US Dollar Loan Notes 
The Company has in issue the following 
US Dollar Loan Notes: (i) US$150 million 
aggregate principal amount of 4.94% 
Series A Senior Notes due 17 March 
2018; and (ii) US$500 million aggregate 
principal amount of 5.64% Series B Senior 
Notes due 17 March 2021. Each series is 
unsecured and unsubordinated and ranks 
pari passu with all other unsecured and 
unsubordinated financial indebtedness 
obligations of the Company. In the event 
of a change of control of the Company 
before then, the Company must offer to 
purchase the Notes. 
£1,800,000,000 Euro Medium-Term 
Note Programme 
The Company has in place a Euro 
Medium-Term Note Programme under 
which the Company could issue notes up 
to £1,800,000,000. Under the Note 
Programme, the Company has in issue 
€550,000,000 1.75% Notes due in 
2022 as well as £250,000,000 1.875% 
Notes due in 2026. 
If there is a change of control of the 
Company and the Notes then in issue 
carry an investment-grade credit rating 
which is either downgraded to non-
investment-grade, or carry a non-
investment-grade rating which is further 
downgraded or withdrawn, or do not 
carry an investment-grade rating and the 
Company does not obtain an investment-
grade rating for the Notes, a Note holder 
may require that the Company redeem 
or, at the Company’s option, repurchase 
the Notes. 
Share plans 
The Company’s share plans contain 
provisions as a result of which options 
and awards may vest and become 
exercisable on a change of control of 
the Company in accordance with the 
rules of the plans. 
Contracts with employees or Directors 
A description of those agreements with 
Directors that contain provisions relating 
to payments in the event of a termination 
of employment following a change of 
control of the Company is set out on 
pages 108 and 109. 
Marine 
Articles of Association of Devonport 
Royal Dockyard Limited and Rosyth 
Royal Dockyard Limited 
The Articles of Association of Devonport 
Royal Dockyard Limited (DRDL) and Rosyth 
Royal Dockyard Limited (RRDL), both 
subsidiaries of the Company, grant the 
MOD as the holder of a special share in 
each of those companies certain rights in 
certain circumstances. Such rights include 
the right to require the sale of shares in, 
and the right to remove Directors of, the 
company concerned. The circumstances 
in which such rights might arise include 
where the MOD considers that 
unacceptable ownership, influence or 
control (domestic or foreign) has been 
acquired over the company in question 
and that this is contrary to the essential 
security interests of the UK. This might 
apply, for example, in circumstances where 
any non-UK person(s) directly or indirectly 
acquire control over more than 30% of the 
shares of the relevant subsidiary, although 
such a situation is not of itself such a 
circumstance unless the MOD in the given 
situation considers it to be so. Any level of 
ownership by particular foreign or domestic 
persons may, on the facts of the case, be 
so treated. 
Under its Articles of Association RRDL is 
not entitled to redeem the special share.

The ToBA confirms Babcock as a key 
support partner of MOD in the maritime 
sector and covers the 15-year period 
from 2010 to 2025. The MOD may 
terminate the ToBA in the event of a 
Change in Control of the Company in 
circumstances where, acting on the 
grounds of national security, the MOD 
considers that it is inappropriate for the 
new owners of the Company to become 
involved, or interested, in the Marine 
division. ‘Change in Control’ occurs 
where a person or group of persons that 
controls the Company ceases to do so 
or if another person or group of persons 
acquires control of the Company.

between (1) The Secretary of State for 
Defence (2) Devonport Royal Dockyard 
Limited (3) Babcock Marine (Clyde) 
Limited and (4) Babcock Marine (Rosyth) 
Limited 
In October 2014, Babcock signed the 
Maritime Support Delivery Framework 
(MSDF) with MOD. Working within the 
ToBA, which runs through to 2025, MSDF 
confirms the continuation of Babcock’s 
contract to deliver services at HMNB 
Clyde and HMNB Devonport to March 
2020, replacing Babcock’s Warship 
Support Modernisation Initiative (WSMI) 
contracts. The MSDF agreement also 
covers a number of surface ship projects 
which will be delivered through the 
Surface Ship Support Alliance. MOD can 
terminate the MSDF in the event of a 
change of control of the Company. 
The provisions follow those in ToBA 
in this respect. 
Cavendish Nuclear 
Parent Body Agreement between 
Cavendish Fluor Partnership (CFP) and 
the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority 
(NDA) dated 27 August 2014 
CFP, a joint venture between Cavendish 
Nuclear, part of Babcock International, 
and US-based Fluor Corporation, with 
ownership split 65:35 to Cavendish and 
Fluor respectively, is the parent body 
organisation (PBO) for the site licence 
company Magnox Limited. 
Magnox Limited is responsible for ten 
Magnox nuclear power plants, as well 
as the Harwell and Winfrith research 
centres. The sites are all owned by the 
Nuclear Decommissioning Authority 
(NDA). The NDA has appointed CFP as 
the PBO in respect of the management 
of the 12 UK nuclear sites and their 
respective decommissioning 
programmes. Under the terms of 
appointment the NDA may terminate 
CFP’s appointment if there is a change 
of control to which it has not consented. 
Aviation 
MCS Operator’s Licences 
Certain of the operating subsidiaries of 
Babcock Mission Critical Services Limited 
engaged in the provision of the air 
services described on pages 54 to 57 of 
this report are required to hold operating 
licences in order to operate their 
principal business. Under Regulation (EC) 
No. 1008/2008 (the Regulation), a 
holder of an operating licence is required 
to be majority-owned and majority-
controlled by European Economic Area 
(EEA) nationals, which includes for these 
purposes nationals of member states of 
the European Union, Norway and 
Switzerland. If the relevant operators 
cease to be owned and effectively 
controlled by EEA nationals, this could 
lead to aviation regulators refusing, 
withholding, suspending or revoking the 
relevant operating licence which in turn 
could have a material adverse effect 
on the business, financial condition 
and/or operations of the Group. The 
Board believes that these companies 
currently satisfy the relevant nationality 
requirements of the Regulation. However, 
as compliance with the Regulation is an 
ongoing requirement, the risk of this 
ceasing to be so cannot be ruled out. 
See also Nationality-related restrictions on 
share ownership on page 138 below. 
Share capital and rights attaching to 
the Company’s shares 
General 
Under the Company’s Articles of 
Association, any share in the Company 
may be issued with such rights or 
restrictions, whether in regard to 
dividend, voting, return of capital or 
otherwise, as the Company may from 
time to time by ordinary resolution 
determine (or, in the absence of any such 
determination, as the Directors may 
determine). The Directors’ practice is to 
seek authority from shareholders at each 
year’s Annual General Meeting to allot 
shares (including authority to allot free 
of statutory pre-emption rights) up to 
specified amounts and also to buy back 
the Company’s shares, again up to a 
specified amount. 
At a general meeting of the Company, 
every member has one vote on a show 
of hands and, on a poll, one vote for each 
share held. The notice of general meeting 
specifies deadlines for exercising voting 
rights, either by proxy or by being present 
in person, in relation to resolutions to be 
proposed at a general meeting. 
No member is, unless the Board decides 
otherwise, entitled to attend or vote, 
either personally or by proxy, at a general 
meeting or to exercise any other right 
conferred by being a shareholder if they 
or any person with an interest in their 
shares has been sent a notice under 
Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 
(which confers upon public companies 
the power to require the provision of 
information with respect to interests in 
their voting shares) and they or any 
interested person have failed to supply 
the Company with the information 
requested within 14 days after delivery 
of that notice. The Board may also decide 
that no dividend is payable in respect of 
those defaulting shares and that no 
transfer of any defaulting shares shall be 
registered. These restrictions end seven 
days after receipt by the Company of a 
notice of an approved transfer of the 
shares or all the information required 
by the relevant Section 793 notice, 
whichever is the earlier.

The Directors may refuse to register any 
transfer of any share which is not a fully-
paid share, although such discretion may 
not be exercised in a way which the 
Financial Conduct Authority regards as 
preventing dealings in the shares of the 
relevant class or classes from taking place 
on an open or proper basis. The Directors 
may likewise refuse to register any 
transfer of a share in favour of more than 
four persons jointly. 
The Company is not aware of any other 
restrictions on the transfer of shares in the 
Company other than certain restrictions 
that may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, 
insider trading laws) or by the nationality-
related restrictions, more particularly 
described later on this page. 
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or voting rights 
in the Company. 
At the date of this report 505,596,597 
ordinary shares of 60 pence each have 
been issued and are fully paid up and are 
quoted on the London Stock Exchange. 
Nationality-related restrictions on share 
ownership 
As noted on page 137 under MCS 
Operator’s Licences’ certain Group 
companies must comply with the 
requirements of EC Regulation 
1008/2008 (the Regulation) which, 
amongst other things, requires those 
companies to be majority-owned and 
majority-controlled by EEA nationals. 
At the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting in July 2014, shareholders 
approved the amendment of the 
Company’s Articles of Association (the 
Articles) to include provisions intended 
to assist the Company in ensuring 
continuing compliance with these 
obligations by giving the Company and 
the Directors powers to monitor and, in 
certain circumstances, actively manage 
nationality requirements as regards 
ownership of its shares with a view to 
protecting the value of the Group 
undertakings that hold the relevant 
operating licences. A summary of these 
powers is set out below. Reference 
should, however, also be made to the 
Company’s Articles, a copy of which 
may be found on its website at 
www.babcockinternational.com. In 
the event of any conflict between the 
Articles and this summary, the Articles 
shall prevail. 
Relevant Shares 
Relevant Shares are any shares which the 
Directors have determined or the holders 
have acknowledged are shares owned by 
non-EEA nationals for the purposes of the 
Regulation (Relevant Shares). It is open to 
shareholders to make representations 
to the Directors with a view to 
demonstrating that shares should 
not be treated as Relevant Shares. 
Maintenance of a register of non-EEA 
shareholders 
The Company maintains a register (which 
is separate from the statutory register of 
members) containing details of Relevant 
Shares. This assists the Directors in 
assessing, on an ongoing basis, whether 
the number of Relevant Shares is such 
that action (as outlined below) may be 
required to prevent or remedy a breach 
of the Regulation. 
The Directors will remove, from the 
separate register, particulars of shares 
where they are satisfied that either the 
share is no longer a Relevant Share or 
that the nature of the interest in the 
share is such that the share should not 
be treated as a Relevant Share. 
Disclosure obligations on share 
ownership 
The Articles empower the Company to, at 
any time, require a shareholder (or other 
person with a confirmed or apparent 
interest in the shares) to provide in 
writing such information as the Directors 
determine is necessary or desirable to 
ascertain such person’s nationality and, 
accordingly, whether details of the shares 
should be entered in the separate register 
as Relevant Shares or are capable of 
being ‘Affected Shares’ (see below). 
If the recipient of a nationality 
information request from the Company 
does not respond satisfactorily to the 
request within the prescribed period 
(being 21 days from the receipt of the 
notice), the Company has the power to 
suspend the right of such shareholder to 
attend or speak (whether by proxy or 
person) at any general or class meeting 
of the Company or to vote or exercise 
any other right attaching to the shares in 
question. Where the shares represent at 
least 0.25% of the aggregate nominal 
value of the Company’s share capital, the 
Company may also (subject to certain 
exceptions) refuse to register the transfer 
of such shares. 
The Articles also require that a 
declaration (in a form prescribed by the 
Directors) relating to the nationality of 
the transferee is provided to the Directors 
upon the transfer of any shares in the 
Company, failing which the Directors 
may refuse to register such transfer 
(see further below). 
Power to treat shares as ‘Affected 
Shares’ 
The Articles empower the Directors, 
in certain circumstances, to treat shares 
as ‘Affected Shares’. If the Directors 
determine that any shares are to be 
treated as Affected Shares, they may 
serve an ‘Affected Share Notice’ on the 
registered shareholder and any other 
person that appears to have an interest 
in those shares. The recipients of an 
Affected Share Notice are entitled to 
make representations to the Directors 
with a view to demonstrating that such 
shares should not be treated as Affected 
Shares. The Directors may withdraw an 
Affected Share Notice if they resolve 
that the circumstances giving rise to the 
shares being treated as Affected Shares 
no longer exist. 
Consequences of holding or having an 
interest in Affected Shares 
A holder of Affected Shares is not 
entitled, in respect of those shares, to 
attend or speak (whether by proxy or 
person) at any general or class meeting 
of the Company or to vote or to exercise 
any other right at such meetings and the 
rights attaching to such shares will vest in 
the Chairman of the relevant meeting 
 
  Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017  139 
(who may exercise, or refrain 
from exercising, such rights at his 
sole discretion). 
The Affected Shares Notice may, if the 
Directors determine, also require that the 
Affected Shares must be disposed of 
within 10 days of receiving such notice 
(or such longer period as the Directors 
may specify) such that the Affected 
Shares become owned by an EEA 
national, failing which the Directors may 
arrange for the sale of the relevant shares 
at the best price reasonably obtainable at 
the time. The net proceeds of any sale of 
Affected Shares would be held on trust 
and paid (together with such rate of 
interest as the Directors deem 
appropriate) to the former registered 
holder upon surrender of the relevant 
share certificate in respect of the shares. 
Circumstances in which the Directors 
may determine that shares are 
Affected Shares 
The Articles provide that where the 
Directors determine that it is necessary 
to take steps in order to protect an 
operating licence of the Group they may: 
(i) seek to identify those shares which 
have given rise to the determination 
and to deal with such shares as Affected 
Shares; and/or (ii) specify a maximum 
number of shares (which will be less than 
50% of the Company’s issued share 
capital) that may be owned by non-EEA 
nationals and then to treat any shares 
owned by non-EEA nationals in excess 
of that limit as Affected Shares (the 
Directors will publish a notice of any 
specified maximum within two business 
days of resolving to impose such limit). In 
deciding which shares are to be dealt 
with as Affected Shares the Directors shall 
be entitled to determine which Relevant 
Shares in their sole opinion have directly 
or indirectly caused the relevant 
determination. However, so far as 
practicable, the Directors shall have 
regard to the chronological order in 
which the Relevant Shares have been 
entered in the separate register. 
Right to refuse registration 
The Articles provide the Directors with 
the power to refuse registration of a 
share transfer if, in their reasonable 
opinion, such transfer would result in 
shares being treated or continuing to 
be treated as Affected Shares. 
The Articles also provide that the 
Directors shall not register any person as 
a holder of any share in the Company 
unless the Directors receive a declaration 
of nationality relating to such person and 
such further information as they may 
reasonably request with respect to that 
nationality declaration. 
The Directors believe that currently the 
nationality requirements, set out in the 
Regulation, are met and, based on the 
Company’s understanding of the 
application of the Regulation and of its 
shareholder base, more than 70% of the 
share capital of those companies which 
are required to be majority-EEA-owned 
and controlled is owned by EEA nationals 
or funds managed in the EEA. There can 
however be no guarantee that this will 
continue to be their assessment and that 
it will not be necessary to declare a 
Permitted Maximum or exercise any other 
of their or the Company’s powers in the 
Articles referred to above. 
Directors’ duty to avoid conflicts 
of interest 
The Company has adopted a formal 
procedure for the disclosure, review, 
authorisation and management of 
Directors’ conflicts of interest and 
potential conflicts of interest in 
accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006. 
The procedure requires Directors 
formally to notify the Board (via the 
Company Secretary) as soon as they 
become aware of any actual or potential 
conflict of interest with their duties to the 
Company or of any material change in 
existing actual or potential conflicts that 
may have been authorised by the Board. 
Notified actual or potential conflicts will 
be reviewed by the Board as soon as 
possible. The Board will consider whether 
a conflict or potential conflict does, in 
fact, exist and, if so, whether it is in the 
interest of the Company that it be 
authorised and, if so, on what terms. 
In making their judgement on this, the 
other Directors must have regard to 
their general duties to the Company. 
A register is maintained for the Board of 
all such disclosures and the terms of any 
such authorisation. 
Authorisations may be revoked, or the 
terms on which they were given varied, 
at any time. Cleared conflicts will in any 
event be reviewed annually by the Board. 
In the event of any actual conflict arising 
in respect of any matter, mitigating 
action would also be considered (for 
example, non-attendance of the Director 
concerned at all or part of Board 
meetings and non-circulation to him 
or her of relevant papers). 
Post-balance-sheet events 
There have been no reportable events 
from the balance sheet date to the date 
of this report. 
Internal controls and risk 
management 
There has been a process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing principal risks 
throughout the year to 31 March 2017 
and up to the date of the approval of the 
financial statements for that year. In 
respect of our financial reporting process 
and the process for preparing our 
consolidated accounts, management 
monitors the processes underpinning 
the Group’s financial reporting systems 
through regular reporting and review, 
and data for consolidation into the 
Group’s financial statements is reviewed 
by management to ensure that it reflects 
a true and fair view of the Group’s results 
in compliance with applicable 
accounting policies. 
The Board, through the Audit and Risk 
Committee, reviews the effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal control processes 
formally at least once a year. The Group 
Financial Controller is asked to report on 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and the Audit and Risk 
Committee reviews this report in light 
of all the other information supplied to 
it during the course of the year including 
internal audit reports, risk reports and 
monthly financial and operational reports.

management 
There has been a process for identifying,

throughout the year to 31 March 2017 
and up to the date of the approval of the

The Board considers the system to be 
effective and in accordance with 
Guidance for Risk Management, Internal 
Control, and Related Financial and 
Business reporting (which has replaced 
the Turnbull Guidance). Further 
information on the principal internal 
controls in use in the Company is to 
be found on pages 68 to 70. 
Going concern and viability 
After making enquiries, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for 
at least one year from the date these 
accounts were signed. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. Directors are also required 
to provide a broader assessment of 
viability over a longer period, which 
can be found on page 79. 
Auditor 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is willing to 
continue in office as independent auditor 
of the Company and a resolution to 
reappoint it will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Disclosure of relevant 
audit information 
So far as the Directors who are in office 
at the time of the approval of this report 
are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (namely, information needed 
by the Company’s auditor in connection 
with the preparation of its auditor’s 
report) of which the auditor is unaware. 
Each such Director has taken all steps 
that he or she ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make himself or 
herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
auditor is aware of that information. 
Directors’ responsibility statement 
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulation. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have prepared the group 
financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and the company 
financial statements in accordance with 
UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”, and applicable 
law). Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group and 
Company for that period. In preparing 
the financial statements the Directors 
are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently; 
• state whether applicable IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed for the group financial 
statements and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101, have been followed for the 
company financial statements, subject 
to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial 
statements; 
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and 
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis, unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and Company will continue 
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group 
and Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and the 
Company, and enable them to ensure 
that the Group’s financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration 
report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and the Company, and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
Company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.  
The Directors consider that the annual 
report and accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group and 
Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed in the Directors’ 
report confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge: 
• the company financial statements, 
which have been prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework”, 
and applicable law), give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company; 
• the group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; and 
• the Directors’ report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and Company, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
it faces.

In the case of each Director in office 
at the date the Directors’ report 
is approved: 
• so far as the director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which 
the Group and Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and 
• they have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Group and 
Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information. 
Each of the Directors listed below (being 
the Board of Directors at the date of 
this Annual Report and these financial 
statements) confirms that to the best 
of his or her knowledge: 
• the Group financial statements (set out 
on pages 150 to 202) which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the 
Group taken as a whole; and the 
Strategic report and Directors’ report 
contained on pages 1 to 141 include 
a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with 
a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces. 
In addition, each of the Directors listed 
below considers that the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model 
and strategy.

Report on the Group financial statements 
Our opinion 
In our opinion, Babcock International Group PLC’s Group financial statements (the ‘financial statements’): 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European  
Union; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
What we have audited 
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the ‘Annual Report’) comprise: 
 the Group balance sheet as at 31 March 2017; 
 the Group income statement and Group statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended; 
 the Group cash flow statement for the year then ended; 
 the Group statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and 
 the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, and applicable law. 
Our audit approach 
Overview 
Materiality 
 Overall Group materiality: £24.0 million (2016: £22.5 million) which represents 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets. 
Audit scope 
 We conducted our audit work over the complete financial information for 25 of the largest and highest risk reporting components 
located in the UK, Europe and South Africa. 
 In addition, we performed specific audit procedures at one further reporting component, and on the Group’s share of the results of five 
joint ventures, selected based on their relative materiality.  
 Where the operating businesses were located outside the UK, we worked together with our network firms located in the relevant 
territory to make sure we had sufficient evidence upon which to base our audit opinion. 
 Taken together, our audit work covers 78% of Group revenue and 74% of profit before tax adjusted for amortisation of acquired 
intangibles (on an absolute basis). 
Areas of focus 
 Contract accounting and revenue recognition. 
 Goodwill impairment. 
 Defined benefit pension liabilities.

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk 
of material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to 
provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in 
this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Area of focus  How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Contract accounting and revenue recognition  
Refer to note 1 to the Group financial statements, 
and to the Report of the Audit and Risk Committee on

The Group’s business involves entering into contractual 
relationships with customers to provide a range of 
services with a significant proportion of the Group’s 
revenues and profits derived from long term contracts. 
Due to the contracting nature of the business, revenue 
recognition involves a significant degree of judgement 
and estimates including to: 
 estimate the total contract costs; 
 estimate the stage of completion of the contract; 
 forecast the profit margin after taking consideration 
of additional revenue relating to cost and time 
completion incentive targets; and 
 appropriately provide for loss making contracts. 
There is a broad range of acceptable outcomes 
resulting from these estimates and judgements that 
could lead to different revenue and profit being 
reported in the financial statements.  
 
We read the relevant clauses within new and amended key contracts and 
discussed each with management to obtain a full understanding of the specific 
terms and risks, which informed our consideration as to whether revenue and 
profit for these contracts was appropriately recognised. 
We evaluated and tested the relevant IT systems and tested the operating 
effectiveness of internal controls over the accuracy and timing of revenue 
recognised in the financial statements, including: 
 detailed contract reviews performed by management and reviewed at both 
Group and divisional level, which included estimating total costs, stage of 
completion of contracts, profit margin and evaluating contract profitability; 
and 
 transactional controls that underpin the production of underlying contract 
related cost balances, including the purchase to pay and payroll cycles. 
Our testing of the controls did not identify any matters that caused us to 
change our audit approach. 
For the more significant and judgemental contracts, we: 
 attended management’s contract review meetings, and, through discussions 
with the contract project teams, we obtained an understanding of the 
performance and status of the contracts; 
 corroborated management’s positions through the examination of externally 
generated evidence, such as customer correspondence; 
 discussed and understood management’s estimates for total contract costs 
and forecast costs to complete, including taking into account the historical 
accuracy of such estimates; and 
 compared management’s position on the recognition of any cost and time 
completion incentive target amounts to the actual costs incurred and 
current progress of the contract. 
Our testing did not identify any factors that management had not taken into 
account in their estimates of the total contract costs, stage of completion and 
expected profit margin of each contract (including the expected losses on loss 
making contracts).

Area of focus  How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Goodwill impairment  
Refer to note 10 to the Group financial statements and to the 
Report of the Audit and Risk Committee on page 94. 
The goodwill balance of £2,608 million (2016: £2,551 million), 
which principally relates to the acquisitions of the VT Group in 
2010 and Avincis (now MCS) in 2015, is subject to an annual 
impairment review. No impairment charge has been recorded 
against these balances in the current financial year.  
The value in use assessment to support the continued carrying  
amount of goodwill involves the application of subjective 
judgement about future business performance. Certain 
assumptions made by management in the impairment review are 
considered by the engagement team to be key areas of judgement, 
including the forecast cash flows, the overall growth rates and the 
discount rates applied. 
 
We evaluated management’s future cash flow forecasts and the 
process by which they were determined and approved, including 
confirming that the forecasts were consistent with the latest Board 
approved budgets and confirming the mathematical accuracy of 
the underlying calculations. We also considered the accuracy of 
previous forecasts made by management. 
We obtained corroborating evidence regarding the carrying value 
of goodwill, and the related disclosures, through challenging key 
assumptions including: 
 growth rates in the cash flow forecasts by comparing them to 
historical results, and economic forecasts; and 
 the discount rates by independently estimating a range based  
on market data. 
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key drivers of the cash 
flow forecasts. Having ascertained the extent of change in those 
assumptions that either individually, or collectively would be 
required for the impairment to arise, we considered the likelihood 
of such a movement occurring. 
Our work supported management’s assessment that there was no 
material impairment. For those assets where the Directors 
determined that no impairment was required and that no 
additional sensitivity disclosures were necessary, we found that 
these judgements were supported by reasonable assumptions that 
would require significant downside changes before any additional 
material impairment was necessary. 
 
Area of focus  How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Defined benefit pension liabilities  
Refer to note 24 to the Group financial statements, and to the 
Report of the Audit and Risk Committee on page 94. 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension plans, 
giving rise to net and gross pension liabilities of £105 million 
(2016: £203 million) and £4,781 million (2016: £4,028 million) 
respectively, which are significant in the context of the overall 
balance sheet of the Group.  
The valuation of pension liabilities requires judgement and  
technical expertise in choosing appropriate assumptions, and 
management engages external actuarial specialists to assist them 
in selecting appropriate assumptions and calculate the liability. 
Inappropriate selections of assumptions or methodologies for 
calculating the pension liability could result in a material difference 
in the value of the liability.   
We assessed, using our actuarial specialists, whether the 
assumptions used in calculating the pension plan liabilities, 
including salary increases, inflation, mortality rate and discount  
rate assumptions, were consistent with our internally developed 
benchmarks based on national and industry data. We were satisfied 
that the rates used fell within acceptable ranges. 
We also performed sample testing to agree underlying membership 
data to supporting human resources documentation and assessed 
the appropriateness of the closing liability based on known 
movements and assumptions. No issues were identified which 
raised concerns over the valuation of the Group’s pension liability.

 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 147 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
Group operates.  
During the period the Group was primarily structured and monitored across four divisions, being Marine and Technology, Defence and 
Security, Support Services and International. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of multiple reporting components, 
including both operating businesses and central functions. 
The Group’s reporting components vary significantly in size and we identified 25 components that, in our view, required an audit of their 
complete financial information due to their size and risk. Specific risk-based audit procedures were performed at one further reporting 
component and over the Group’s share of the results of five joint ventures. In scope reporting components and joint ventures were based 
in several jurisdictions including the UK, Spain, Italy, Canada and South Africa. 
We sent detailed instructions to all component audit teams, which included communication of the areas of focus above and other 
required communications, and we held an audit planning workshop in London attended by component teams as well as regular meetings 
with the teams throughout the year. 
In addition the Engagement Leader and senior members of the Group team undertook visits to two components in the UK during the 
audit, including the Group’s only financially significant component, Devonport. Senior team members also attended all four of the 
divisional audit clearance meetings in person. 
During both the site visits and the clearance meetings, the findings reported to the Group team by the component teams were discussed 
and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component audit team. 
This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level (including audit procedures over material head office entities, 
pensions, impairment assessments, financial statement disclosure, tax, treasury, share based payments and consolidation adjustments), 
gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.  
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of  
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements,  
both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Overall Group materiality £24.0 million (2016: £22.5 million). 
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles. 
Rationale for benchmark applied Given the contractual nature of the business, and consistent with last year, we adjusted for 
amortisation of acquired intangibles as this better reflects the true underlying performance and 
nature of operations. When a business is acquired the full value of contractual relationships is fair 
valued and included on balance sheet as intangible assets, representing the future profitability of 
the contracts. 
Component materiality For each component in our audit scope, we allocated a materiality that is less than our  
overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between 
£20.0 million and £1.0 million. 
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £1.2 million
(2016: £1.0 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going Concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 140, in relation to going concern.  
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing  
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements 
Companies Act 2006 reporting 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
 the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are 
required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report. We have nothing to 
report in this respect. 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 information in the Annual Report is: 
 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group  
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
 otherwise misleading. 
We have no  
exceptions  
to report. 
 the statement given by the Directors on page 141, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced  
and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit. 
We have no  
exceptions  
to report. 
 the section of the Annual Report on page 95, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of 
the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
We have no  
exceptions  
to report. 
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the Group 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
 the Directors’ confirmation on page 79 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the  
Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
We have nothing 
material to add or to 
draw attention to. 
 the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed  
or mitigated. 
We have nothing 
material to add or to 
draw attention to. 
 the Directors’ explanation on page 79 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code,  
as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions. 
We have nothing 
material to add or to 
draw attention to. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking 
that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Adequacy of information and explanations received 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information  
and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibility statement set out on page 140, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:  
 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and  
adequately disclosed;  
 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and  
 the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the  
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent  
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we consider whether 
those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of Babcock International Group PLC for the year ended  
31 March 2017 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the Group financial statements  
154 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  
and International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRSIC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and 
with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments and on a going concern  
basis. The Company is a public limited company, is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.  
Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are disclosed below. They have been applied consistently throughout the year.  
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements comprise the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March. 
(a) Subsidiaries 
An entity is controlled by the Group regardless of the level of the Group’s equity interest in the entity, when the Group has power over  
the entity, when it is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to use its power  
to affect those returns. 
In determining whether control exists, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances to assess its control over an entity such  
as contractual commitments and potential voting rights held by the Group if they are substantive. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date control has been transferred to the Group and de-consolidated from the date control 
ceases. Where control ceases the results for the year up to the date of relinquishing control or closure are analysed as continuing or 
discontinued operations. 
(b) Joint ventures and associates 
Associates are those entities in which the Group exercises its significant influence over an entity when it has the power to participate  
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but it does not have the power to control or jointly control the entity.  
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets  
of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. 
The Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded  
at cost. The Group’s investment in joint ventures and associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss) identified  
on acquisition. 
The Group’s share of its joint ventures and associates post-acquisition profits or losses after tax is recognised in the income statement,  
and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted 
against the carrying amount of the investment. 
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its joint venture and associate are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the joint venture and associate. The Group’s share of joint venture revenue is disclosed after elimination of sales to  
that joint venture. Loans to joint ventures are valued at amortised cost. 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: 
(a) Sale of goods 
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably 
measured and recovery of consideration is considered probable. As can be seen from note 3, this represents approximately 10% of  
the business. 
(b) Provision of services 
Revenue from services rendered is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction. The provision of services  
over a long-term period are accounted for under the principles of construction contracts, and the revenue recognised as set out below.  
In a limited number of contracts where performance and revenue are measured annually, the revenue and costs are similarly recognised 
over the course of the year. 
(c) Long-term service contracts  
Revenue from long-term service contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract in accordance with  
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’. The stage of completion is determined according to the nature of the specific 
contract concerned. Methods used to assess the stage of completion include incurred costs as a proportion of total costs, labour hours 
incurred or earned value of work performed.

contract concerned. Methods used to assess the stage of completion include incurred costs as a proportion of total costs, labour hours 
incurred or earned value of work performed. 
 
155 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued) 
Revenue (continued) 
(c) Long-term service contracts (continued) 
The profit element of the revenue attributable to a contract is recognised if the final outcome can be reliably assessed. In order to assess  
the likely outcome of a contract a full estimated cost of completion is produced which will assess risks and opportunities including cost 
rates, time, volume and performance for the contract and apply a probability to these being realised. As time elapses these risks and 
opportunities will become more predictable. Risks and opportunities will vary dependent on the terms of each contract and the 
commercial environment of each market. Certain contracts will have pain/gain share arrangements whereby target cost under/over 
spends are shared with the customer. These sharing arrangements are included in assessing the overall contract outturn and the 
expected profit.  
Any expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Exceptional items 
Items that are exceptional in size or nature are presented as exceptional items within the consolidated income statement. The separate 
reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. Events which may give  
rise to the classification of items as exceptional include gains or losses on the disposal of properties and businesses, material acquisition 
costs along with the restructuring of businesses and asset impairments. 
Transactions with non-controlling interest 
The Group policy is to treat transactions with non-controlling interest as transactions with owners of the parent and therefore is reflected  
in movements in reserves. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event,  
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.  
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.  
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring  
has either commenced or has been publicly announced. Future operating costs are not provided for.  
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than  
the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. A provision for warranties is recognised on completed contracts  
and disposals when there is a realistic expectation of the Group incurring further costs. 
Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract 
revenues. Such provisions are recorded as write downs of work-in-progress for that portion of the work which has already been completed, 
and as liability provisions for the remainder. Losses are determined on the basis of estimated results on completion of contracts and are 
updated regularly.  
A provision is made where operating leases are deemed to be onerous. 
A provision for deferred consideration on acquisitions is recognised at the fair value at acquisition. Fair value is based on an assessment  
of the likelihood of payment. 
A provision for employee benefits is recognised when there is a realistic expectation of the liability. 
Goodwill and intangible assets 
(a) Goodwill 
When the fair value of the consideration for an acquired undertaking exceeds the fair value of its separable net assets, the difference  
is treated as purchased goodwill and is capitalised. When the fair value of the consideration for an acquired undertaking is less than the  
fair value of its separable net assets, the difference is taken directly to the income statement. 
Goodwill relating to acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004 is maintained at its net book value on the date of transition to IFRS. From that date 
goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed at least annually for impairment.  
Annual impairment reviews are performed as outlined in note 10. 
(b) Acquired intangibles 
Acquired intangibles are the estimated fair value of customer relationships and brands which are in part contractual, represented by  
the value of the acquired order book, and in part non-contractual, represented by the risk adjusted value of future orders expected to arise 
from the relationships. 
The carrying value of the contracted element is amortised straight-line over the remaining period of the orders that are in process or  
the future period in which the orders will be fulfilled, as the case may be. The amortisation periods, reflecting the lengths of the various 
contracts, are mainly in the range one year to five years, with a minority of contracts and hence amortisation periods, up to fifteen years.

1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued) 
Goodwill and intangible assets (continued) 
(b) Acquired intangibles (continued) 
The carrying value of the non-contracted element is amortised over the period in which it is estimated that the relationships are likely  
to bring economic benefit via future orders. The method of amortisation is tailored to the expectations of the timing of the receipt of 
specific future orders and therefore the charge to the income statement matches the timing of value likely to be generated in those years. 
Relationships are valued on a contract-by-contract and customer-by-customer basis and the pattern of amortisation reflects the expected 
pattern of benefit in each case. The amortisation profile is determined on a case-by-case basis and in all cases results in a front-loaded 
profile, reflecting the greater certainty of future orders in the near term compared with the longer term. The amortisation period is in  
the range one year to fifteen years.  
Acquired brand names are valued dependent on the characteristics of the market in which they operate and the likely value a third party 
would place on them. Useful lives are likewise dependent on market characteristics of the acquired business brand. These are amortised  
on a straight-line basis up to five years. 
(c) Research and development 
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets 
when it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and only if the cost can be 
measured reliably. Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as  
an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the 
date the product is available for use on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit but not exceeding seven years. 
d) Computer software 
Computer software, excluding the Group’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, includes software licences acquired plus the costs 
incurred in bringing the software into use and is shown at cost less accumulated amortisation and is amortised over its expected useful 
lives of between three and five years. 
The Group is implementing an ERP system in phases over several years. The ERP system is amortised over its useful life of 10 years from the 
date when the asset is available for use, which occurs once the implementation has been completed for each respective phase. 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) 
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment, except for land, which is shown at cost less 
impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Depreciation is provided on a straight-
line basis to write off the cost of PPE over the estimated useful lives to their estimated residual value (reassessed at each balance sheet 
date) at the following annual rates: 
Freehold property 2% to 8%
Leasehold property Lease term
Plant and equipment 6.6% to 33.3%
Aircraft airframes 3.33%
Aircraft components 14% to 33.3%
PPE is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not 
be recoverable. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount exceeds 
the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell or value in use. 
Net debt 
Net debt consists of the total of loans, bank overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents, joint venture and associate loans and finance leases 
granted or received plus any derivatives whose objective is to fair value hedge the underlying debt. This will include swaps of the currency 
of the debt into the functional currency and interest rate basis of the company carrying the debt and fair value hedges.  
Leases 
Assets under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding capital element of instalments is included in borrowings. The interest 
element is charged against profits so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations. Depreciation is 
calculated to write the assets off over their expected useful lives or over the lease terms where these are shorter. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis. A provision is made where the 
operating leases are deemed to be onerous. 
As a lessor, the Group recognises assets held under a finance lease in the balance sheet as a financial asset. The lease payment receivable  
is treated as finance income and a repayment of principal including initial direct costs. Finance income is allocated over the lease term,  
with the gross receivable being reviewed for impairment on a regular basis.

1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued) 
Inventory and work in progress 
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first-in first-out method. In the case of finished 
goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct material and labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. 
Contract accounting balances 
The Group presents as an asset the gross amount due from customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which costs 
incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceed progress billings. 
The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which progress 
billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses). 
Pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset and amortised 
over the life of the contract when it can be reliably expected that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in 
future net cash inflows. 
Post-contract award but pre-contract operational start-up mobilisation costs are recognised as an asset and amortised over the life of  
the contract. 
Taxation 
(a) Current income tax 
Current tax, including UK Corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that  
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
(b) Deferred income tax 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 
enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing  
of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in  
the foreseeable future. 
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in either other comprehensive 
income or in equity. 
Foreign currencies 
(a) Functional and presentational currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling,  
which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. 
(b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the local currency at the year end 
exchange rates.  
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling  
at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement 
except when deferred in equity as part of the net investment of a foreign operation. 
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the balance sheets and income statements of foreign operations into Sterling are 
recognised as a separate component of equity on consolidation. Results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated using the average 
exchange rate for the month of the applicable results. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the 
income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity  
and translated at period end exchange rates.

1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued) 
Finance costs 
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred unless they are attributable to an asset under 
construction, in which case finance costs are capitalised. 
Employee benefits 
(a) Pension obligations 
The Group operates a number of pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments to trustee-administered funds, 
determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined benefit plan  
is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or 
more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays 
fixed contributions into a separate entity. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation 
method. The service cost and associated administration costs of the Group’s pension schemes are charged to operating profit. In addition, 
a retirement benefit interest charge on the net pension deficit is charged to the Income statement as a finance cost. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised directly in equity through the Statement of comprehensive income so that the Group’s balance sheet reflects the  
IAS19 measurement of the schemes’ surpluses or deficits at the balance sheet date. 
(b) Share-based compensation 
The Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to  
employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded. The fair value is 
determined by reference to option pricing models. The charge is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of 
the award. 
The shares purchased by the Group’s ESOP trusts are recognised as a deduction to equity. 
(c) Holiday pay 
Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits are earned. 
Discontinued and held for sale 
A significant business stream sold in a prior year or during the year or being actively marketed with an expectation of being sold within  
a year will be treated as discontinued within the income statement. The prior year comparatives will be restated. If such a business has  
not been sold at year end the relevant assets and liabilities will be shown as held for sale within the balance sheet. 
In addition businesses bought as part of a larger acquisition but identified for sale on purchase will be treated as discontinued. 
Service concession arrangements 
IFRIC 12 ‘Service concession arrangements’ addresses the accounting by private sector operators involved in the provision of public  
sector infrastructure assets and services. For all arrangements falling within the scope of the Interpretation (essentially those where the 
infrastructure assets are not controlled by the operator), the infrastructure assets are not recognised as property, plant and equipment  
of the operator. Rather, depending on the terms of the arrangement, the operator recognises: 
 a financial asset – where the operator has an unconditional right to receive a specified amount of cash or other financial asset over  
the life of the arrangement; or 
 an intangible asset – where the operator’s future cash flows are not specified (eg where they will vary according to usage of the 
infrastructure asset); or 
 both a financial asset and an intangible asset where the operator’s return is provided partially by a financial asset and partially by  
an intangible asset. 
As a consequence of this treatment the operator recognises investment income in respect of the financial asset on an effective interest  
basis and amortisation of any intangible asset arising.  
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. 
The Group designates certain of the derivative instruments within its portfolio to be hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or 
liabilities or unrecognised firm commitments. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement,  
together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.

 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 159 
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued) 
Derivative financial instruments (continued) 
For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are deferred in equity until such time as the firm commitment is 
recognised, at which point any deferred gain or loss is included in the assets’ carrying amount. These gains or losses are then realised 
through the income statement as the asset is sold. 
Certain derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments and any movement in their fair values is recognised  
in the income statement immediately. 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which they are approved. Interim dividends are 
recognised when paid. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations  
of future events that are believed to be reasonable in light of known circumstances. The key areas of estimates and judgements for the 
Group are contract accounting and revenue recognition (see above), the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes (see note 24)  
and impairment of goodwill (see note 10). 
Fair value adjustments on acquisitions are by nature subject to critical judgements.  
Profit and revenue recognition on contracts is a key judgement exercised by management on a contract-by-contract basis. In order to  
make such a judgement an estimate of contract outturn is made for all significant contracts. Local management divisions and Group 
review and challenge estimates made. 
Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards  
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2017 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted.  
(a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2017 with minimal or no impact on the Group: 
 IAS 7 (amendments), ‘Statement of cash flows’, effective 1 January 2017;  
 IAS12 (amendments), ‘Income taxes on recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses’, effective 1 January 2017. 
(b) Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective, have not been endorsed by the EU and the impact on 
the Group’s operations is currently being assessed but is not expected to be significant: 
 IFRS 2, ‘Share based payments’, effective 1 January 2018; 
 IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’, effective 1 January 2018; 
 2016 Annual improvements, effective 1 January 2018. 
(c) Standards and interpretations that are not yet effective and the impact on the Group’s operations is currently 
being assessed: 
 IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, effective from 1 January 2018 and endorsed by the EU, identifies performance 
obligations in contracts with customers, allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognises revenue as the 
performance obligations are satisfied. The standard additionally requires more detailed disclosures. We have completed an initial but 
detailed review of all significant contracts, including consideration of all types of contracts undertaken by the Group and the results of 
our review indicate that IFRS 15 is not expected to result in any significant change to the timing of revenue or profit recognition on 
service provision contracts or long-term service contracts. This assessment reflects, amongst other matters, that the Group’s contracting 
arrangements meet the requirements set out in IFRS 15 to satisfy performance obligations and recognise revenue over time. The review 
also indicates that the new standard is not expected to introduce any significant change to the Group’s revenue recognition policy in 
relation to revenue from the sale of goods not under service provision contracts or long-term service contracts; 
 IFRS 16, ‘Leases’, effective 1 January 2019 but not yet endorsed by the EU. Currently, operating leases are not recognised on the 
balance sheet and the impact of this standard will be to recognise a lease liability and corresponding asset on the Group’s balance sheet 
in relation to most leases currently classified as operating leases. The change will result in an improvement in operating profit, with the 
amortisation of the asset being less than the current operating lease charge. This will however be offset by an increase in interest charge 
with the net position dependent on the average lease length on adoption. See note 31 Operating lease commitments. 
 The Interpretations Committee proposed amendments to IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum 
Funding Requirements and their Interaction’, which has yet to be approved; however management does not expect that there would 
have been any material impact on the amounts disclosed in the accounts had the amendments proposed in the exposure draft been 
in force this year.

The Group’s treasury and capital policies in respect of the management of debt, interest rates, liquidity, and currency are outlined below. 
The Group’s treasury policies are kept under close review given the continuing volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets. 
Capital availability 
The Company defines capital as shareholder equity plus net debt but in addition considers available financial capital which adds 
committed undrawn facilities to capital as a measure.  
Objective on available 
financial capital 
To ensure an appropriate level of capital and available financial capital to maintain operational flexibility  
and meet financial obligations whilst funding the Group’s organic and acquisitive growth. The Group seeks 
to maintain the necessary headroom to cover the peaks and troughs in its working capital cycle, and 
sufficient liquidity to see it through any periods of tightened liquidity in the market. 
Policy  The Board aims to maintain a balance between equity and debt capital which optimises the Group’s cost of 
carry whilst allowing access to both equity and debt capital markets at optimum pricing when appropriate.  
The Group, in considering its capital structure and financial capital, views net debt to EBITDA at two and a 
half times or below as being steady state and sustainable in normal market and economic conditions. This 
level may be tempered in periods of market volatility and economic and/or political uncertainty. This is not 
to rule out acquisition spikes above two and a half times, as illustrated by previous acquisitions, but only to 
the extent that the Group can see a clear path to reducing net debt to EBITDA back to two and a half times 
or below within a reasonable time frame. 
Performance The Group’s gearing and debt cover ratios, used by the Group to evaluate capital, saw an improvement to 
1.8 times net debt to EBITDA in 2017 (2016: 2.0 times), demonstrating further progress in bringing gearing 
back towards a steady state level, both through the pay down of debt and increasing profits attributable to 
shareholders.  
 Covenant 2017 2016
Debt service cover EBITDA/net interest >4 12.0 10.8x
Debt cover Net debt/EBITDA <3.5 1.8x 2.0x
Gearing Net debt/shareholders’ funds n/a 42% 48%
Debt ratios are below covenanted levels and gearing has continued to reduce, leaving sufficient headroom 
for bolt-on acquisitions and funding of organic growth. The Group believes that capital markets remain 
accessible, if or when required.  
Financial risk management 
Financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising  
from the business activities of the Group and the financing of those activities. 
The Group looks in the first instance to prime rated counterparties with which to carry out treasury transactions, including investments  
of cash and cash equivalents. 
The Group’s customers are mainly from government, government backed institutions or blue chip corporations and as such credit risk  
is considered small. 
Treasury activities within the Group are managed in accordance with the parameters set out in the treasury policies and guidelines 
approved by the Board. A key principle within the treasury policy is that trading in financial instruments for the purpose of profit generation 
is prohibited, with all financial instruments being used solely for risk management purposes. 
The Group only enters into financial instruments where it has a high level of confidence of the hedged item occurring. Both the treasury 
department and the divisions have responsibility for monitoring compliance within the Group to ensure adherence with the principal 
treasury policies and guidelines. 
The Group’s treasury policies in respect of the management of debt, interest rates, liquidity, and currency are outlined below. The Group’s 
treasury policies are kept under close review given the continuing volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets.

2. Financial risk management (continued) 
Management of capital 
The Group’s capital structure is derived from equity and net debt and is overseen by the Board through the Group Finance Committee. 
All the Group’s material borrowings are arranged by the treasury department, and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries  
as required. 
A range of gearing and liquidity ratios are used to monitor and measure capital structure and performance, including: Net debt to  
EBITDA (defined as net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals), Gearing ratio (defined  
as net debt, excluding retirement benefit deficits or surpluses, divided by shareholders’ funds), ROIC (defined as net income divided by 
total capital (equity, excluding retirement benefit deficits or surpluses, plus net debt)) and EBITDA interest cover (defined as profit before 
interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals divided by net interest payable). These ratios are discussed under the 
business review. 
Through the monitoring of these metrics it remains the Group’s intention to ensure the business is prudently funded, balancing risk  
and price on the capital markets and to retain sufficient flexibility to fund future organic and acquisitive growth. 
Foreign exchange risk 
The functional and presentational currency of Babcock International Group PLC and its UK subsidiaries is pounds Sterling. The Group  
has exposure primarily to EUR, USD, ZAR and increasingly AUD and CAD. The USD exposure arises firstly through the US$650 million US 
Private Placements which are swapped into Sterling and secondly, through a number of activities in Babcock Mission Critical Services 
where it has some revenue and costs denominated in USD. The EUR exposure is largely due to the activities of Babcock Mission Critical 
Services in Europe, where both translational and transactional exposure exists. The ZAR exposure arises from the activities of Babcock’s 
subsidiaries in South Africa where both translational and transactional exposure exist. The increasing AUD and CAD exposure arises from 
the activities of Babcock’s subsidiaries in those counties where both transactional and translational exposure exists. 
Objective To reduce exposure to volatility in earnings and cash flows from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. 
The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies, the most significant being the Euro, US Dollar and South 
African Rand. 
Policy –  
Transactional risk 
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency 
denominated transactions. To mitigate this risk, the Group’s policy is to hedge all material transactional exposures, 
using financial instruments where appropriate. Where possible, the Group seeks to apply IAS 39 hedge accounting 
treatment to all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency transaction exposures. 
Policy –  
Translational risk 
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets 
and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures and associates. It is not the Group’s policy to 
hedge through the use of derivatives the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income 
statement or balance sheet of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures and associates it regards as long-term 
investments. However, where the Group has material assets denominated in a foreign currency, it will consider 
matching the aforementioned assets with foreign currency denominated debt. 
Performance There have been no material unhedged foreign exchange losses in the year. 
A key principle within the treasury policy is that trading in financial instruments for the purpose of profit generation is prohibited, with all 
financial instruments being used solely for risk management purposes. 
The Group only enters into financial instruments where it has a high level of confidence of the hedged item occurring. Both the treasury 
department and the divisions have responsibility for monitoring compliance within the Group to ensure adherence with the principal 
treasury policies and guidelines. 
The foreign exchange exposure of Group entities on the net monetary position against their respective functional currencies expressed  
in the Group’s presentation currency, with the largest exposure being £17.4 million Euro to US Dollars (2016: Euro to US Dollars  
£16.4 million). 
The pre-tax effect on profit and equity, increase or decrease, if the rates moved up or down by an appropriate percentage volatility, 
assuming all other variables remained constant, would in total be £0.8 million (2016: £0.9 million). The reasonable shifts in exchange  
rates are based on historical volatility and range from 10% for Sterling to US Dollars; 15% for Euro to Sterling and US Dollars; 25% for  
Sterling to Canadian and Australian Dollars; 25% for South African Rand to Euro; and 15% Sterling to Omani Rial.

2. Financial risk management (continued) 
Interest rate risk 
The fair values of debt, and related hedging instruments are affected by movements in interest rates. The following table illustrates the 
sensitivity in interest rate-sensitive instruments and associated debt to a hypothetical parallel shift of the forward interest rate curves of 
±50bp (2016: ±50bp), with pre-tax effect annualised and an additional shift in variable rates for the floating rate element of the gross 
debt. All other variables are held constant. The Group believes ±50bp is an appropriate measure of volatility at this time. 
2017 2016
£m +50bp £m –50bp £m +50bp £m –50bp
Net results for the year (2.2) 2.2 (3.4) 3.4
Equity 3.7 (3.7) 8.8 (8.8)
Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps, each being 
reviewed on a regular basis to ensure the appropriate mix is maintained. 
Objective To manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt 
relative to floating rate debt to reflect the underlying nature of its commitments and obligations. As a result,  
the Group does not maintain a specific set proportion of fixed versus floating debt, but monitors the mix to  
ensure that it is compatible with its business requirements and capital structure. 
Policy Interest hedging and the monitoring of the mix between fixed and floating rates are the responsibility of the  
treasury department, and are subject to the policy and guidelines set by the Board. 
Performance As at 31 March 2017, the Group had 74% fixed rate debt (March 2016: 61%) and 26% floating rate debt  
(March 2016: 39%) based on gross debt including derivatives of £1,424.8 million (March 2016: £1,461.2 
million). For further information see note 20 to the Group financial statements.  
Liquidity risk 
The key objectives are to ensure that the Group has an appropriate balance between continuity, flexibility and cost of debt funding 
through the use of borrowings, whilst also diversifying the sources of these borrowings with a range of maturities and rates of interest, to 
reflect the long-term nature of the Group’s contracts and commitments and its risk profile. 
Liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed 
credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining 
availability under committed credit lines (see note 19). 
The Group’s committed Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) of £750 million has an expiry date of December 2021, and is available to meet 
general corporate funding requirements. At 31 March 2017, £120.7 million (2016: £306.2 million) was drawn on this facility. 
The Group has US Private Placements with a value of US$650 million, with notes maturing in March 2018 and March 2021. 
The Group has a Sterling loan note with a value of £40 million, with the note maturing in January 2020. 
The Group has a Eurobond with a value of EUR 550 million, with notes maturing in October 2022. 
The Group has a Sterling bond with a value of £250 million, with the notes maturing in October 2026. 
Each of the business divisions in the Group provides regular cash forecasts for both management and liquidity purposes. These cash 
forecasts are used to monitor and identify the liquidity requirements of the Group, and ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet 
operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on the Group’s committed borrowing facilities. The cash performance of  
the business divisions is a KPI. 
The Group adopts a conservative approach to the investment of its surplus cash. It is deposited with strong financial institutions for short 
periods, with bank counterparty credit risk being monitored closely on a systematic and ongoing basis. A credit limit is allocated to each 
institution taking account of its market capitalisation and credit rating.

2. Financial risk management (continued) 
Liquidity risk (continued) 
Objective With debt as a key component of available capital, the Group seeks to ensure that there is an appropriate balance 
between continuity, flexibility and cost of debt funding through the use of borrowings, whilst also diversifying the sources 
of these borrowings with a range of maturities and rates of interest, to reflect the long-term nature of the Group’s 
contracts and commitments and its risk profile. 
Policy All the Group’s material borrowings are arranged by the treasury department, and funds raised are lent onward to 
operating subsidiaries as required. 
It remains the Group’s policy to ensure the business is prudently funded and that sufficient headroom is maintained on its 
facilities to fund its future growth. 
Performance The Group continues to keep under review its capital structure to ensure that the sources, tenor and availability of finance 
are sufficient to meet its stated objective. During the course of the financial year, the Group extended the maturity date 
of its £750 million Revolving Credit Facility to December 2021 and in October 2016 issued a £250 million ten year 
Sterling bond. In addition to the aforementioned Revolving Credit Facility and the Sterling bond, the Group’s other main 
debt facilities include: £40 million loan note issued in January 2010, US$650 million US private placement notes issued in 
March 2011, a EUR 550 million Eurobond issued in October 2014. These debt facilities provide the Group with total 
available committed banking facilities and loan notes of £1.91 billion and sufficient sources of liquidity and headroom to 
meet the Group’s ongoing commitments. For further information see note 19 to the Group financial statements.

In the UK 2015 Budget it was announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 19% from April 2017. It was announced in the  
2016 UK Budget that it will be further reduced to 18% from April 2020. It was subsequently announced in the 2017 budget that it will be 
reduced to 17% from April 2020. As a result of this change, UK deferred tax balances have been remeasured at 17% as this is the tax rate 
that will apply on reversal. As a result a charge of £0.5 million has been taken to the Income statement in respect of the remeasurement of 
year end UK deferred tax balances to 17%. A further £1.1 million has been charged to reserves in respect of the remeasurement of year 
end UK deferred tax balances to 17%.

During the year, the goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. The recoverable amount for all the cash-generating 
units (CGUs) has been measured based on a value-in-use calculation derived from Board approved three year budgeted cash flows and 
extrapolated cash flows thereafter based on an estimated growth rate of 3%. A pre-tax discount rate in the range 8.5% to 9.8% was used  
in the value-in-use calculation for the CGUs within each segment. The Group’s weighted average cost of capital post-tax is approximately 
7.0% to 8.0% (2016: 7.0% to 8.0%). 
As part of the year end process, the Group has undertaken a comprehensive review of its goodwill and identified a £2.3 million 
impairment in WRN Broadcast Limited in respect of milestones not reached. 
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs based on value in use, identified according to the business segment. A segment level summary  
of goodwill allocation is presented below:

Support Services 591.1 590.3
International  957.0 903.2
 2,608.8 2,550.6
The MCS CGU within the International segment is the CGU with the lowest percentage headroom of £0.5 billion (24%). In the MCS CGU  
an increase of 1.4% in the discount rate or a 1.9% decrease in the terminal year growth rate would cause an impairment.

All amortisation charges for the year have been charged through cost of revenue. 
Acquired intangibles are in part the estimated fair value of customer relationships which are in part contractual, represented by the value  
of the acquired order book, and in part non-contractual, represented by the risk adjusted value of future orders expected to arise from  
the relationships.  
The carrying value of the contracted element is amortised straight-line over the remaining period of the orders that are in process or  
the future period in which the orders will be fulfilled, as the case may be. The amortisation periods, reflecting the lengths of the various 
contracts, are mainly in the range of one year to five years, with a minority of contracts and hence amortisation periods, up to fifteen years.  
The carrying value of the non-contracted element is amortised over the period in which it is estimated that the relationships are likely  
to bring economic benefit via future orders. The method of amortisation is tailored to the expectations of the timing of the receipt of 
specific future orders and therefore the charge to the income statement matches the timing of value likely to be generated in those years. 
Relationships are valued on a contract-by-contract and customer-by-customer basis and the pattern of amortisation reflects the expected 
pattern of benefit in each case. The amortisation profile is determined on a case-by-case basis and in all cases results in a front-loaded 
profile, reflecting the greater certainty of future orders in the near term compared with the longer term. The amortisation period is in  
the range of one year to fifteen years.  
Acquired brand names are valued dependent on the characteristics of the market in which they operate and the likely value a third party 
would place on them. Useful lives are likewise dependent on market characteristics of the acquired business brand. These are amortised  
on a straight-line basis up to five years. 
The reclassification of IFRIC 12 assets to financial assets follows a review of those contracts and the certainty of revenue regulations.

The net deferred tax liability of £21.5 million includes a deferred tax asset of £55.2 million and a deferred tax liability of £75.9 million  
in respect of the Group’s non-UK operations.  
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets  
because it is probable that these assets will be recovered. 
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for  
financial reporting purposes:

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses (excluding UK capital losses and advance corporation tax) of £70.0 million 
(2016: £101.0 million) available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £nil  
(2016: £nil) of such losses, which may be carried forward.

Trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables and are stated at amortised cost. 
As of 31 March 2017, trade receivables with gross value of £6.7 million (2016: £4.9 million) were impaired. Impairment arises in the 
main, through contract disputes rather than credit defaults. The amount of the provision was £6.1 million (2016: £3.9 million). The 
individually impaired receivables mainly relate to receivables in the International division. It was assessed that a portion of these receivables 
is expected to be recovered.

The creation and release of provisions for impairment of receivables have been included in cost of sales in the income statement. Amounts 
charged to the impairment provision are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. 
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivables mentioned above. The Group does 
not hold any collateral as security other than retention of title clauses issued as part of the ordinary course of business (note 20).

The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales, purchases, deposits and 
borrowings denominated in foreign currencies, as the transactions occur. 
The Group enters into interest rate hedges against interest rate exposure and to create a balance between fixed and floating interest rates. 
The fair values of the financial instruments, excluding the non-controlling interest put option, are based on valuation techniques (level 2) 
using underlying market data and discounted cash flows.  
The fair value of the non-controlling interest put option is based on valuation techniques (level 3) using a multiple of EBITDA as defined in 
the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

Potential issues of ordinary shares 
The table below shows options and conditional share awards existing over the Company’s shares as at 31 March 2017 that are capable  
of being met on exercise or vesting by the issue of new shares. They represent outstanding awards granted under the Company’s executive 
share plans. The awards were granted directly by the Company and satisfied either by the Trustees of the Babcock Employee Share Trust 
(BEST) – a total of 7,366,007 shares (2016: 7,299,826 shares) – or the Trustees of the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust (PEST) – a total of 
58,658 shares (2016: 114,336 shares). The Company decides from time to time whether to satisfy the awards by way of a fresh issue of 
shares (either to the award holder or to the employee share trust) or by way of financing the employee share trusts to purchase already 
issued shares in the market. This decision is made according to available headroom within the dilution limits contained in the relevant 
share plan rules and what the Directors consider to be in the best interest of the Company at the time.

The weighted average share price for awards exercised during the year was 984.8p per share (2016: 1,087.50p per share). 
During the year 2,206,114 ordinary shares (2016: 2,000,000 shares) were acquired or subscribed for through either the Babcock 
Employee Share Trust or the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust (together ‘the Trusts’). The Trusts hold shares to be used towards satisfying 
awards made under the Company’s employee share schemes. During the year ended 31 March 2017, 1,217,957 shares (2016: 
1,998,629 shares) were disposed of by the Trusts resulting from options exercised. At 31 March 2017, the Trusts held between them a 
total of 1,269,447 ordinary shares (2016: 281,290 ordinary shares) at a total market value of £11,196,523 (2016: £2,670,849) 
representing 0.25% (2016: 0.06%) of the issued share capital at that date. The Company elected to pay dividends to the Babcock 
Employee Share Trust at the rate of 0.001p per share during the year, though full dividends were paid in respect of shares held by the 
Peterhouse Employee Share Trust. The Company meets the operating expenses of the Trusts. 
The Trusts enable shares in the Company to be held or purchased and made available to employees through the exercise of rights or 
pursuant to awards made under the Company’s employee share schemes. The Trusts are discretionary settlements for the benefit of 
employees within the Group. The Company is excluded from benefiting under them. They are controlled and managed outside the UK  
and each has a single corporate trustee which is an independent trustee services organisation. The right to remove and appoint the 
trustees rests ultimately with the Company. The trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust is required to waive both voting rights and 
dividends payable on any share in the Company in excess of 0.001p, unless otherwise directed by the Company, but the trustee of the 
Peterhouse Employee Share Trust does not have the power to waive dividends due on Babcock ordinary shares and therefore receives the 
full amount of any dividends declared.

23. Share-based payments 
The charge to the income statement has been based on the assumptions below and is based on the binomial model as adjusted,  
allowing for a closed form numerical-integrated solution, which makes it analogous to the Monte Carlo simulations, including performance 
conditions. The detailed description of the plans below is included within the Remuneration report.  
During the year the total charge relating to employee share-based payment plans was £15.0 million (2016: £16.2 million), all of which 
related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. 
After tax, the income statement charge was £12.0 million (2016: £13.0 million). 
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:

Both the vesting period and the expected life of all DBMP, PSP and CSOP awards is three years, but for the DBP it is two years, other than 
for Executive Directors where the vesting period is three years. The holders of all awards receive dividends, except for CSOP awards. 
The DBMP Matching awards are split evenly between the performance criteria of TSR, EPS and ROCE, whilst the PSP and CSOP awards are 
split evenly between TSR and EPS. There are no performance conditions attached to the DBP. 
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last one to three years. The expected life is the average expected period  
to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. 
The Group also operates the Babcock Employee Share Plan which allows employees to contribute up to £150 per month to the fund, 
which then purchases shares on the open market on the employees’ behalf. The Group provides matching shares, purchased on the open 
market, of one share for every 10 purchased by the employee. During the year the Group bought 61,292 matching shares (2016: 58,036 
matching shares) at a cost of £0.6 million (2016: £0.6 million). 
The Group also operates the Babcock Employee Share Plan International which reflects the structure of the UK Plan. During the year the 
Group bought 1,000 matching shares (2016: nil matching shares) to be used when vesting is due to begin in 2019. 
1. DBMP = 2012 Deferred Bonus Matching Plan, PSP = 2009 Performance Share Plan, DBP = 2012 Deferred Bonus Plan and CSOP = 2009 Company Share Option Plan.

The Group provides a number of pension schemes for its employees. The principal defined benefit pension schemes for employees in the 
UK are the Devonport Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme, the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme and the Rosyth Royal Dockyard 
Pension Scheme (the Principal schemes). The nature of these schemes is that the employees contribute to the schemes with the employer 
paying the balance of the cost required. The contributions required and the assessment of the assets and the liabilities that have accrued 
to members and any deficit recovery payments required are agreed by the Group with the trustees who are advised by an independent, 
qualified actuary. 
The key risks in all of the defined benefit schemes relate primarily to longevity, the expected inflation rate in the future which impacts on 
pension increases and indirectly salary increases and the discount rate used to value the liabilities. The Principal schemes have mitigated 
some of these risks by taking out longevity swaps in respect of pensioners and their spouses at the time, through a common investment 
strategy which has significantly hedged the interest rate and inflation risk through derivative instruments and introduced benefit changes 
in 2014 and 2015 impacting future service benefits which included capping of pensionable salaries, capping pension increases, increased 
normal retirement age in line with state pension ages and increased the level of members’ contributions.  
The Group also participates in the Babcock Rail Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme (the Railways scheme). This scheme is 
a multi-employer shared cost scheme with the contributions required and the assessment of the assets and the liabilities that have accrued 
to members and any deficit recovery payments agreed with the trustees who are advised by an independent, qualified actuary. The costs 
are, in the first instance, shared such that the active employees contribute 40% of the cost of providing the benefits and the employer 
contributes 60%. However the assumption is that as the active membership reduces, the liability will ultimately revert to the Group. The 
Group’s share of the assets and liabilities is separately identified to those of other employers in the scheme and therefore the Group cannot 
be held liable for the obligations of other entities that participate in this scheme.  
The schemes are funded by payments to legally separate trustee-administered funds. The trustees of each scheme are required by law to  
act in the best interests of each scheme’s members. In addition to determining future contribution requirements (with the agreement of 
the Group), the trustees are responsible for setting the schemes’ investment strategy (subject to consultation with the Group). All the 
schemes have at least one independent trustee and member nominated trustees. The schemes are subject to regulation under the funding 
regime set out in Part III of the Pensions Act 2004. The detail of the latest formal actuarial valuation of the scheme is as follows. The 
valuation of the Babcock International Group Scheme is currently being finalised. The valuations of the Railways scheme and the 
Devonport Royal Dockyard scheme are currently being undertaken:

The Group also participates in or provides a number of other smaller pension schemes including a number of sections of the local 
government pension schemes where in most cases the employer contribution rates are fully reimbursed by the administering authorities.  
It also participates in the Magnox Electric Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme and runs the Babcock Naval Services Pension 
Scheme for which the MOD fully reimburses the contributions payable.

Expected total employer contributions £39.2m £18.5m £29.7m £2.7m £2.6m £92.7m
Where salary sacrifice arrangements are in place, the Group effectively meets the members’ contributions. The above level of funding is 
expected to continue until the next actuarial valuation of each scheme; valuations are carried out every three years. 
The expected payments from the schemes are primarily pension payments, most of which increase at a fixed rate or in line with RPI or  
CPI inflation when in payment and lump sums. Benefit payments commence at retirement, death or incapacity and are predominantly 
calculated with reference to final salary.  
Although the Group anticipates that scheme surpluses will be utilised during the life of the scheme to address member benefits, the Group 
recognises its retirement benefit surpluses in full in respect of the schemes in surplus, on the basis that it is management’s judgement that 
there are no substantive restrictions on the return of residual scheme assets in the event of a winding-up of the scheme after all member 
obligations have been met. 
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes have been updated to 31 March 2017 by independent 
qualified actuaries for IAS 19 purposes using the following assumptions:

The longevity swaps have been valued in line with assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IFRS 13, the valuation of which 
is equal to the amount of collateral posted by the schemes as at balance sheet date. This is a level 3 derivative and the key inputs to the 
valuation are the discount rate and mortality assumptions.

The figures in the table above have been calculated on an approximate basis, using information about the expected future benefit 
payments out of the schemes. The analysis above may not be representative of actual changes to the position since changes in 
assumptions are unlikely to happen in isolation. The change in inflation rates is assumed to affect the assumed rate of RPI inflation, CPI 
inflation and future pension increases by an equal amount. The fair value of the schemes’ assets (including reimbursement rights) are 
assumed not to be affected by any sensitivity changes shown and so the balance sheet values would increase or decrease by the same 
amount as the change in the defined benefit obligations.

over the dockyard in favour of the Authority.

Report on the Company financial statements  
Our opinion 
In our opinion, Babcock International Group PLC’s company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’): 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017;

The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the Annual Report), comprise: 
 the Company balance sheet as at 31 March 2017;  
 the Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended: and 
 the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Other required reporting 
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements 
Companies Act 2006 reporting 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:  
 the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and, 
 the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are 
required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report. We have nothing to 
report in this respect. 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is: 
 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Company acquired in the course  
of performing our audit; or 
 otherwise misleading. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received  
from branches not visited by us; or

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibility statement set out on page 140, the Directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3  
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by 
our prior consent in writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:  
 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and  
adequately disclosed;  
 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and  
 the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures 
or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the  
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent  
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements  
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Babcock International Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2017.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 207 
1. General information 
Babcock International PLC is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of the registered office is 33 Wigmore Street,  
London, W1U 1QX. 
2. Significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented.  
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’  
(FRS 101). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain 
financial instruments on a going concern basis. The financial statements are prepared in Sterling which is the functional currency of the 
Company and rounded to the nearest £ million.  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. 
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance 
with FRS 101: 
 Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, ‘Share based payments’ 
 IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’  
 Paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement 
of assets and liabilities) 
 Paragraph 38 of IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’ comparative information in respect of: 
 paragraph 79(a) (iv) of IAS 1, ‘Share capital and reserves’; 
 paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’; and 
 paragraph 118(e) of IAS 38, ‘Intangible assets’ (reconciliations between the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period) 
 The following paragraphs of IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’: 
 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38, 40, 111, and 134-136 
 IAS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows’ 
 Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8, ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’ 
 Paragraph 17 of IAS 24, ‘Related party transactions’ in respect of key management compensation 
 The requirements of IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing these financial statements. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value. 
Taxation 
Current income tax 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred income tax 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 
enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Notes to the Company financial statements continued 
208 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Taxation (continued) 
Deferred income tax (continued) 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in either other comprehensive 
income or in equity. 
Finance costs 
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 
Employee benefits 
(a) Share-based compensation 
The Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans which are recharged to the relevant subsidiaries. Full details of the 
share-based compensation plans are disclosed in note 23 of the Group financial statements. 
(b) Treasury shares 
The shares purchased by the Company’s ESOP trusts are recognised as a deduction to equity. See note 22 to the Group financial 
statements for further details. 
(c) Pension arrangement 
The Company operates a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme, however all assets and liabilities are recognised in the relevant 
subsidiary in which the employee operates. See note 24 to the Group financial statements for further details. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. 
The Company designates certain of the derivative instruments within its portfolio to be hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or 
liabilities or unrecognised firm commitments. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement,  
together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. 
For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are deferred in equity until such time as the firm commitment is 
recognised, at which point any deferred gain or loss is included in the assets’ carrying amount. These gains or losses are then realised 
through the income statement as the asset is sold. 
Certain derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments and any movement in their fair value is recognised in the 
profit and loss account immediately. 
Financial risk management 
All treasury transactions are carried out only with prime rated counterparties as are investments of cash and cash equivalents. 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which they are approved and in the case of interims,  
when paid. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements  
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the 
year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.  
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key estimate and judgement for the Company relate to 
the valuation of derivative financial instruments.
