At a glance 
We are one of the world’s largest investor-owned utilities focused 
on transmission and distribution activities in electricity and gas in 
the UK and the US. We play a vital role in connecting millions of 
people to the energy they use, safely, reliably and efficiently. We 
are organised into operating segments, which we describe below.
UK Electricity Transmission
We own and operate the electricity 
transmission network in England and Wales, 
with day-to-day responsibility for balancing 
supply and demand. We operate but do not 
own the Scottish networks. Our networks 
comprise approximately 7 ,200 kilometres  
(4,474 miles) of overhead line, 1,500 kilometres 
(932 miles) of underground cable and 342 
substations.
UK Gas Transmission
We own and operate the gas National 
Transmission System (NTS) in Great Britain, 
with day-to-day responsibility for balancing 
supply and demand. Our network comprises 
approximately 7 ,660 kilometres (4,760 miles)  
of high-pressure pipe and 618 above-ground 
installations.
Our role as system operator
As Great Britain’s System Operator (SO) we make sure Great Britain’s gas and electricity is 
transported safely and efficiently from where it is produced to where it is consumed. We seek to 
ensure that supply and demand are balanced in real-time and we facilitate the connection of assets 
to the transmission system. In the US, similar services are provided by independent system operators.

3 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report Chairman’s statement 
National Grid is responding positively to wide-reaching 
developments in our operating environment and taking 
steps to build a stronger foundation for the future. 
Over the past year, we have seen significant 
developments both in our external environment 
and within the Company. 
In the summer of 2016, the UK voted to leave 
the European Union (EU), leading to a change 
in government leadership. More recently, a 
General Election was announced for 8 June 
2017 . We have also seen a new administration 
in the US following the Presidential election. 
We await developments in its policy positions.
Amid these developments, public trust in  
big business and political institutions remains 
low. The cost of energy and the impact of 
investment in new technology on bills remains  
a matter of concern for politicians, regulators 
and consumers. The energy industry needs  
to work hard to demonstrate affordability and 
build trust with consumers and communities 
who feel disconnected from the opportunities 
that technological and market changes 
can bring.
In early 2017 , the UK Government presented 
proposals for a UK industrial strategy, including 
recommendations for developing energy 
infrastructure, skills and investment in 
technology and innovation.
The commitment of governments across the 
world to support the agreement on climate 
change made at the Paris Conference of the 
Parties sent a strong signal that we have to 
tackle the threat of rising temperatures. You 
can read more about these changes and our 
responses on page 9. 
In light of these changing external 
circumstances, together with the ongoing 
evolution of the energy industry and growth in 
distributed generation, Chief Executive John 
Pettigrew, together with the Executive team,

has led a review of our business. This has 
resulted in a clear articulation of our purpose 
and the evolution of our vision, values and the 
strategic priorities that guide our business.  
You can read more about these on page 8.
I am pleased that John has delivered a very 
strong performance in his first year as Chief 
Executive. Together with his team, he has made 
significant progress on our commitments and 
towards evolving the direction for National Grid. 
Nicola Shaw joined the Board on 1 July 2016  
as Executive Director, UK, and I am pleased  
that she has also made a very good start.
Gas Distribution
This year we concluded the sale of a majority 
interest in our UK Gas Distribution business to a 
consortium of investors. This has created value 
for our shareholders through a significant gain 
on the disposal.
We announced a one-off return of £4 billion 
of net proceeds to shareholders through a 
combination of a special dividend and share 
buy-backs. I am also pleased that we voluntarily 
set aside £150 million of the sale proceeds  
that will be used to benefit consumers. 
On 19 April 2017 , following Board approval, 
we announced the special dividend of 84.375 
pence per share ($5.4224 per American 
Depositary Shares) which will be paid to 
ordinary shareholders on 2 June 2017 . To 
ensure, as far as possible, that the share 
price is not affected by the special dividend, 
shareholder approval is sought for a share 
consolidation on an 11 for 12 basis, which 
means that for every 12 shares you had, you 
will have 11 if approved. This and other related 
resolutions will also be considered at a General 
Meeting on 19 May 2017 . Notice of this meeting 
was sent to all shareholders.
 “We have a  
role to play  
in helping 
communities 
have fair and 
equal access to 
opportunities  
to be successful.”
4 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Strategic Report Chairman’s statement
Results
As a consequence of the sale of a 61% interest 
in the UK Gas Distribution business, this year’s 
accounts are more complex than in previous 
years. In particular, we report our earnings  
for the Group excluding UK Gas Distribution 
(the ‘continuing Group’) separately from the 
results of that business, which we report  
within ‘discontinued operations’. You can find  
out more about the main aspects of this  
on pages 112–115. 
Standing back from the detail of these 
accounts, I would like to highlight two aspects. 
Firstly, the strength of the balance sheet and 
our key credit metric of retained cash flow 
divided by adjusted net debt. Secondly, the 
cash flows in the business, which have enabled 
us to grow the full-year dividend in line with  
our policy, and continue to grow the capital 
investment in the business to help meet our 
growth aims.
Dividend policy
Our dividend policy aims to grow the ordinary 
dividend per share at least in line with the 
rate of UK RPI growth each year for the 
forseeable future. Accordingly, the Board has 
recommended an increase in the final dividend 
to 29.10 pence per ordinary share ($1.8924 per 
American Depositary Share)*. If approved, this 
will bring the full-year dividend to 44.27 pence 
per share ($2.8351 per American Depositary 
Share), an increase of 2.1% over the 43.34 
pence per ordinary share in respect of the 
financial year ended 31 March 2016.
Responsible business
It is a fundamental fact of our business that  
the work we do carries risks for our employees, 
customers and the general public. Operating  
a safe working environment is the primary 
responsibility of the Board and our Executive 
leadership team. It is a responsibility we  
take very seriously, and when we fall short  
of expected levels of safety, we make sure 
lessons are learnt and shared, as well as 
making sure we take any necessary remedial 
actions as soon as is practicable. 
We also have a responsibility to contribute 
towards the economic, social and 
environmental well-being of the communities 
where we operate. In early 2016, the UN 
presented their 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals. At National Grid we are focusing on five 
of these goals where we can help to make a 
difference. These include affordable and clean 
energy, as well as climate action. 
For example, we have made significant 
progress in our search for low-carbon 
alternatives to SF
6
, an electrical insulator that 
has a global warming impact 23,900 times  
that of CO
2
. We are trialling an alternative 
(Green Gas for Grid, or g
3
) that delivers the 
same technical benefits at less than 2% of  
the global warming impact of SF
6
. I am pleased 
to say g
3
 has now been certified for use on part 
of our network and the equipment insulated 
with this gas is now energised.
National Grid recognises the wider role we  
can play in helping communities have fair  
and equal access to opportunities to be 
successful. We work with community groups, 
charities and educational institutions to help 
address some of the challenges felt by the 
most disadvantaged in our society who can 
struggle to access decent and sustainable 
education and employment. 
For example, working with Teach First in  
the UK, our employees coach new teachers  
as they start their careers in some of the  
most challenging schools in the country.  
We share Teach First’s aim to end educational 
inequality, which is one of the main barriers  
to social mobility. 
In the US, we are supporting United Way of 
Rhode Island’s Housing for All Fund. The fund 
helps people who are making tough choices 
around which basic needs they can afford. 
Through this support, we are playing our part  
in building a stronger community by helping 
people access more affordable housing. It 
helps to retain and attract people to the area, 
supporting the wider economic recovery of  
the region.
How we manage our operational sites can have 
a major impact on the environmental well-being 
of communities. For example, I was pleased  
to see a project in the UK where our newest 
graduate recruits worked with site managers 
and the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust to enhance the 
environment at our site in Kirkstall, Leeds. 
The land around our site has been subject to 
anti-social behaviour and fly-tipping. Our project 
will see graduate volunteers addressing these 
issues, building a sensory garden and improving 
the woodland and ponds so that the local 
community can access and use the site safely.
Corporate governance
After nearly six years’ tenure as a Non-
executive Director, Ruth Kelly has decided  
that due to personal circumstances and  
time commitments she will not be seeking 
re-election by shareholders at the next Annual 
General Meeting. Ruth has made a significant 
contribution throughout her time with the 
Company and we are sorry to see her go. 
I was pleased to welcome Pierre Dufour to  
our Board in February 2017 . Pierre’s wealth  
of experience will bring great value to our  
Board and to the Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees. Additionally,  
his strong track record in safety and industrial 
risk management, and the supervision of 
complex multinational engineering projects, 
makes him ideally placed to strengthen the 
expertise on our Safety, Environment and 
Health Committee.
The topic of corporate governance has  
been the subject of considerable political  
and media attention in the UK during 2016/17 . 
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is now 
undertaking a fundamental review of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and we shall be 
an active participant in its consultation process. 
Your Board continues to be very mindful of the 
need to create value for our shareholders within 
a framework of high standards of corporate 
governance, recognition of our responsibilities to 
the wider group of the Company’s stakeholders 
and setting the right tone from the top. 
Looking ahead
We will work closely with our customers  
and stakeholders to understand the impact  
of the UK exit from the EU as Brexit 
negotiations develop. 
We believe it is in the interests of consumers  
to make sure the UK has continued barrier-free 
access to neighbouring energy markets and  
to the benefits realised through harmonised 
trading arrangements with the EU. 
Our US business will continue to work with all 
levels of government to find efficient energy 
solutions for the communities we work in, and 
to solve issues facing the energy sector. We 
remain committed to ensuring a sustainable 
and clean energy future for all our customers.
The increasing threat from cyber attacks  
mean we must remain vigilant to the very real 
risks posed to our critical national infrastructure. 
We continue to focus on the strategies needed 
to protect our business, our customers and the 
communities that rely on our services. 
I would like to extend my deepest appreciation 
to all our employees and the management 
team for their hard work, dedication and 
commitment to your Company’s success.
 
Sir Peter Gershon
Chairman
5 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report Chief Executive’s review
The past year was an important period for National Grid. 
We completed the sale of a majority interest in our UK Gas 
Distribution business, made progress with our new rates  
in the US, and developed our thinking on National Grid’s 
purpose, vision and strategic direction.
I am proud of what we have achieved during 
2016/17 . We have continued being innovative 
and efficient to deliver savings for customers, 
while taking steps across the Group to evolve 
by investing in newer technologies. These 
developments come at a time when there have 
been considerable changes in our operating 
environment, as described on page 9. 
This is why our leadership team has conducted 
a strategic review of our business to articulate  
our purpose and evolve our vision and strategy. 
I am excited by the evolution of our strategy, 
which we are setting out in this report.
Our performance in 2016/17
In terms of safety, our overall lost time injury 
frequency rate for the Group was 0.08, which  
is considered to be world class. This figure, 
which includes our contractors and excludes 
the UK Gas Distribution business, is slightly 
different to our KPI for the Group’s employee 
injury frequency rate. You can read about this 
on page 10.
However, we were all reminded of the 
importance of safety this year, following a tragic 
incident in which one of our UK employees  
lost his life. We take safety very seriously  
at National Grid – it remains a fundamental 
priority – and we will do everything we  
can to learn from incidents, so we can 
continually improve our performance.
Both our UK and US businesses remain 
committed to achieving the highest possible 
standards for safe working.
We invested £4.5 billion of capital this year in 
our businesses, a record level for the Group, 
driving growth of 5% in our total asset base. 
In both the UK and US, we continued to 
achieve close to 100% reliability across  
our networks.
At National Grid, we are very aware of the  
need to put our customers at the heart of  
how we run our business. In all of our business 
areas, both in the UK and in the US, we have 
exceeded our customer satisfaction targets, 
which I believe is testament to the continuous 
efforts we have made on improving the 
services we provide.
Finally, through the strong operational 
performance and growth in our assets, we 
support our growing dividend. We measure  
our performance through our Group Return  
on Equity (RoE), which remained strong at 
11.7% this year and Value Added, which 
increased to £1.9 billion this year, equivalent  
to 51.6 pence/share. 
Developments in our business
In 2016/17 , we have made progress in our 
business in a number of important areas.
The sale of a majority interest in our UK Gas 
Distribution business marks an important 
milestone for National Grid. We worked closely 
with the purchasing Consortium to ensure a 
smooth transition for our customers and 
employees so that services continue to be 
delivered safely and efficiently. The sale puts 
our portfolio in a strong position to support 
higher growth and to continue delivering an 
attractive dividend while maintaining a healthy 
balance sheet.
We have retained a 39% interest in the new 
Gas Distribution business, and have entered 
into an option agreement with the Consortium

we face see page 9

and how we have evolved our vision 
and strategy on page 8
A period of change
The energy sector is undergoing 
transformation. It faces greater 
change and uncertainty than  
ever before, which brings fresh 
challenge and new opportunities. 
As a result, we have spent 
considerable time over the past 
year re-evaluating how we will 
respond to these new challenges. 
The result is an articulation of  
our purpose, and evolution of our 
vision and strategy, which guide 
everything we do. 
 “Our purpose, 
which sets out 
why National 
Grid exists, is 
simple – we 
bring energy  
to life.”
6 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Strategic Report Chief Executive’s review
for the potential future sale and purchase of 
an additional 14% interest. This would be  
on broadly similar terms to the sale of the  
61% equity interest.
During 2016/17 , we made progress with our 
rate cases in the US, securing agreements  
in Massachusetts, New York City and Long 
Island. The New York agreements include 
provision to phase the impact on consumer 
bills over time to help manage the increase  
in costs. 
Our ability to make new investments in our US 
networks means we can continue our work to 
ensure a clean, sustainable energy supply for 
our customers. In December, we began the 
transmission of electricity to Rhode Island from 
the Block Island wind farm, the first offshore 
wind generation in the US. You can read more 
about our US investments on pages 26–27 .

review of the RIIO price control for Gas and 
Electricity Transmission, giving us certainty 
over our core revenues for the remaining 
RIIO period. 
Also this year, we issued a joint statement with 
BEIS and Ofgem about the enhanced role and 
greater separation of the Electricity System 
Operator (ESO) function. While the proposals 
are subject to consultation, we support the 
principle of greater separation of the ESO role 
within National Grid. We believe it is the most 
effective way to balance the interests of 
consumers with the need to maintain security  
of supply in a fair and competitive energy 
market. We look forward to working with the 
regulator and our stakeholders to deliver the 
best possible outcome for UK consumers.
The outcome of the UK referendum on EU 
membership has challenged all businesses  
to consider the impact Brexit will have on their 
operations. We continue to work positively  
with both UK and EU legislators to maintain 
access to cross-border services so we are  
able to ensure the UK’s security of supply  
and the interests of energy consumers.
We welcome the opportunity the UK 
Government’s Green Paper ‘Building our 
Industrial Strategy’ provides to contribute  
to the industrial development of the UK. We 
believe secure, low-carbon and affordable 
energy underpins the success of all the UK’s 
industries. We welcome the commitment to 
investing in the skills and education needed to 
encourage future innovation in energy systems.
We have brought together our Other Activities, 
which mainly comprise businesses that are 
adjacent to our core regulated operations, to 
create a new division with its own leadership. 
It will be called National Grid Ventures and its 
objectives are to focus on the development of 
new growth opportunities and strengthening  
our commercial and partnership capabilities  
for the future. A recent example of this is our 
partnership with US solar supplier Sunrun, 
which we announced in January. I would like  
to welcome Badar Khan to my leadership team 
as Group Director, Corporate Development and 
National Grid Ventures.

in our UK, US and other businesses on pages 
24–29.
Our purpose, vision and strategy
Throughout this year’s Annual Report and 
Accounts, we describe our performance  
for 2016/17 against our current strategy. 
However, as Sir Peter has described, there  
is much change taking place in our operating 
environment. 
The shift to a low-carbon economy is  
gathering pace in both the UK and US. Globally, 
investment in coal-powered generation is falling 
and renewables have now overtaken coal as 
the world’s largest source of installed power 
capacity. This year, for the first time, we saw 
periods where no coal-fired power stations 
generated electricity in the UK. In the US, 
investment in solar, battery storage and energy 
efficiency continues apace.
With such change happening all around us,  
we cannot stand still. That’s why we have 
developed our thinking on National Grid’s 
purpose, vision and strategic direction. 
Our purpose, which sets out why we exist,  
and what we bring to our customers and  
wider society, is simple: we bring energy to  
life. This means getting the heat, light and 
power that customers rely on to their homes 
and businesses; and supporting the 
communities that we are a part of.
Our vision is to exceed the expectations of  
our customers, shareholders and communities 
today and make possible the energy systems 
of tomorrow. How we perform individually,  
and as an organisation, is guided by this  
single ambition. 
So, what does this all mean for our strategy? 
Our strategic focus is predicated on our 
customers. As a responsible, purpose-led 
organisation, we must put into sharper focus 
the customers to whom we deliver – their 
needs and priorities must come first. And by 
making decisions that consider our customers’ 
interests, we will be able to deliver sustainable 
performance over the long term. Therefore,  
we are focused on three specific areas. 
Firstly, we are finding new ways of optimising 
our operational performance, so we can 
maximise value from our businesses. And  
as we improve performance, it increases our 
efficiency and ultimately benefits the customer 
by improving affordability.
Secondly, we are seeking opportunities to drive 
asset growth by investing in our core regulated 
assets where we see strong potential. This 
investment is needed to deliver asset health, 
network expansion and modernisation. We 
expect the current levels of spend to continue 
over the medium term. 
And thirdly, we are making further changes  
to make sure National Grid is better equipped 
for the future. As I described earlier, we have 
created National Grid Ventures, which will focus 
on developing new growth opportunities and 
strengthening our commercial and partnership 
capabilities for the future. 
You can read more about our purpose, vision 
and strategy on page 8.
Our people
Our performance is dependent on the 
commitment and achievements of our people. 
As Chief Executive, it’s been a privilege to meet 
many of our employees across the organisation 
and see how they deliver for their customers, 
their communities and each other.
That’s why I am pleased to report that our 
annual employee engagement score has risen 
to 77% from 73%. 
If we are to achieve the strategic objectives I 
have described, it’s important that we continue 
to make sure our employees have the right 
skills and capabilities to lead us through this 
period of change.
Over the past year, we’ve delivered an average 
of 6.5 days of technical, safety, leadership or 
professional effectiveness training per employee 
in the UK and US. You can read more about 
this on pages 30 – 31.
Looking ahead
Our focus will remain on driving the 
performance of the business to deliver strong 
Group returns and increasing Value Added. 
To achieve this, our UK and US regulated 
businesses will continue looking for ways to 
optimise performance. In 2017/18, we will look 
to achieve good outcomes for our US rate 
filings. In the UK, we’ll begin the process of 
preparing for RIIO-T2. The performance of our 
regulated businesses will be underpinned by 
continued investment, so we can make sure we 
deliver a safe, reliable and affordable service for 
our customers. Our newly formed National Grid 
Ventures will look for opportunities adjacent to 
our core business to support its growth. 
John Pettigrew
Chief Executive.
7 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report Our purpose
Having a clear sense of what we stand for  
as a company and what it is that binds us all 
together is vitally important. This is what we  
call our purpose. In simple terms it’s what 
drives our desire to serve our customers and 
it’s that thing that makes us proud about the 
work we do.
Our purpose is to bring energy to life.
In its simplest form ‘bring energy to life’  
means getting the heat, light and power  
that customers rely on to their homes and 
businesses. But ‘life’ also means supporting 
the communities that we are a part of and  
live amongst to support the economic  
growth and sustainability of wider society.
Our vision
Our vision describes how we create value –  
not just today, but in the future too. 
Our vision is: “We will exceed the  
expectations of our customers, 
shareholders and communities  
today and make possible the  
energy systems of tomorrow.”
The needs of our customers, shareholders and 
communities are at the heart of everything we 
do. So, our vision statement clearly describes the 
ambitious challenge we have set ourselves – to 
make sure we deliver value for them every day.
Our vision also looks to the future, reminding  
us of the critical role we will play for future 
generations. We are already seeing changes  
in our energy system as more renewable and 
decentralised generation is introduced. To be 
relevant in this future, we have to play an active 
role in helping shape the energy landscape, 
and benefiting from what it provides.
Our strategy 
We have three strategic priorities for our 
business that will help us achieve our vision.
1)  Find new ways of optimising our 
operational performance
Our customers want and need us to be more 
efficient, so we must find ways to improve how 
we run our business. We have looked at 
enhancing our productivity and customer 
experience through more efficient and 
customer-focused processes. Given the scale 
of our core business in the UK and US, even 
small improvements will have a huge impact  
on our overall performance. Finding new ways 
of optimising our operational performance will 
be an important factor in our ability to compete 
and grow. It creates the financial capacity  
and the capability for us to future-proof  
our business.
2)  Look for opportunities to grow  
our core business
Delivering strong operational performance 
provides us with a foundation to pursue  
other opportunities. We will continue to  
pursue business development opportunities 
that are close to our core business. In the US, 
we will build on our successful efforts over  
the past two years to pursue opportunities  
in electricity and gas transmission. In the UK, 
interconnectors and competitive onshore 
transmission projects will be our focus over  
the next decade.
3)  Make sure National Grid is better 
equipped for the future
We need to future-proof our business against 
the effects of a changing energy landscape. 
The operation of our networks is already 
affected by changes to the generation mix, 
while the needs and expectations of our 
customers are evolving. 
Our preparations for the future have already 
begun in the UK and US with the establishment 
of National Grid Ventures, which brings 
together our non-network businesses to focus 
on targeted investment in the energy sector 
outside of our core business. We are also 
looking to develop new capabilities that are 
essential for long-term success.
For example, our partnership with Sunrun,  
the largest dedicated residential solar company 
in the US, allows us to increase our capability  
in the distributed energy space, and enhance 
our ability to meet the changing energy needs 
of our customers and communities.
Our values
We know that how we deliver is as important 
as what we deliver. If our purpose is the ‘why’, 
our values are the ‘how’. They help shape our 
spirit, attitude and what guides us. We have  
to adapt and develop our values to align with 
the expectations of our customers and 
communities, without losing sight of the  
things that make us strong today.
Our values build on and protect our strong 
foundations while looking to the future.  
They are aligned to our purpose and help our 
people understand how we expect to achieve 
our purpose and vision for our customers  
and each other. 
Every day we do the right thing and find  
a better way.
‘Do the right thing’ pulls together our 
foundational values – keeping each other and 
the public safe; complying with all the relevant 
rules, regulations and policies; respecting  
our colleagues, customers and communities; 
and saying what we think and challenging 
constructively. ‘Find a better way’ challenges 
us to focus on performance and continuous 
improvement for our customers, our 
shareholders and communities.
Our purpose, vision, strategy and values
We describe on page 9 how the operating environment  
for our industry is changing. To make sure National Grid  
is well positioned to respond to these changes, we have 
evolved our purpose, vision, strategy and values.
Our vision 
 “We will exceed  
the expectations  
of our customers, 
shareholders and 
communities 
today and make 
possible the 
energy systems  
of tomorrow.”

Affordability
 
Security of supply
 
Sustainability
Commentary The cost of the energy is an issue for 
consumers, industry, energy providers, 
regulators and governments. Consumers 
expect a reliable energy system that delivers 
gas and electricity when and where it is 
needed. They pay for the cost of this 
infrastructure and improvements to it 
through the network costs part of their 
energy bills. The costs are subject to 
regulatory approval.
The energy system is in a phase of 
transition from high to low carbon. Coal 
plants are closing down and being replaced 
with nuclear, renewables and gas, as well 
as emerging battery storage. During the 
transition, electricity margins need to be 
monitored and actively managed as we 
move to a generation mix with greater 
volumes of intermittent generation.
Our world is changing as a result of human 
activity and its impact on the environment. 
The Paris Agreement sends a clear signal 
that the shift to a low-carbon economy  
is inevitable, and it is now accepted that 
sustainable business is good business – 
delivering value for people, the environment 
and business. This includes reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, managing 
non-renewable resources, and preserving 
and protecting habitats and ecosystems.
Developments In the UK, the Government set out  
proposals for an industrial strategy that 
confirms the high priority placed on 
affordability of energy. Ofgem proposed  
a number of adjustments to allowances  
for UK Gas and Electricity Transmission  
following its mid-period review of the  
RIIO-T1 price control. 
In the US, the cost of energy remains a 
concern for consumers and regulators  
who expect affordable, reliable and cleaner 
energy while keeping costs low. As new 
technologies, such as solar, are adopted, 
there are fears that low-income customers 
may not have access to cheaper, cleaner 
sources of energy.
Energy security remains a priority for  
the UK Government, and a number of 
balancing tools are available to manage 
capacity. BEIS introduced amendments  
to the UK capacity market to improve 
long-term planning of capacity and  
reduce costs to consumers. 
The UK Government has also committed  
to proceed with the Hinkley Point C  
nuclear power station.
In the US, the reliability of energy 
infrastructure remains a concern for 
consumers, regulators and policy  
makers. Regulators are seeking  
investment to improve the security  
and resilience of energy networks.
In December 2015, the Paris Agreement 
entered into force, and as at 17 May 2017 
has been ratified by 146 national 
governments. The Agreement requires 
signatories to commit to reducing global 
greenhouse gas emissions with the aim  
of limiting increases in global average 
temperature.
Investment in solar generation has 
continued in both the UK and US. The  
first offshore wind project in the US went 
operational off the coast of Rhode Island. 
This year, for the first time, we saw periods 
where no coal-fired power stations 
generated electricity in the UK. 
The UK BEIS green paper on industrial 
strategy included a focus on developing 
education and skills for energy innovation. 
In the US, state regulators continue to 
support energy innovation projects through 
programmes such as New York State’s 
‘Reforming the Energy Vision’. 
Our response Our US and UK regulated businesses 
continue to strive for greater efficiency to 
help offset the impact of costs for energy 
and capital investment programmes. We 
continue to find innovative ways to reduce 
both the time and cost to repair or replace 
assets, minimising the costs to consumers.
In the US, the rate case outcomes for  
New York included plans to phase increases 
over three years to mitigate the impact  
on consumer bills. We also provide 
low-income assistance to more than  
118,000 households in upstate New York 
annually, with programmes and experts 
dedicated to delivering solutions for those 
struggling to pay their energy bills. 
In the UK, we have been able to generate 
£460 million of savings for consumers in  
the first four years of the RIIO arrangements 
and additionally we voluntarily set aside  
£150 million of the proceeds from the sale  
of a majority interest in our UK Gas 
Distribution business that will be used to 
benefit consumers. We are expecting around  
£200 million of cost savings for consumers 
resulting from awarding Enhanced Frequency 
Response contracts for more than 200 MW  
of battery storage in July 2016.
We continue to support BEIS and Ofgem  
on capacity market policy development  
and applicant readiness. We also continue 
to work with our delivery partners to achieve 
operational milestones. National Grid  
was asked to play an important role  
in Electricity Market Reform and act as the 
Delivery Body administering new market 
arrangements – the Capacity Mechanism 
and Contracts for Difference – which 
provide incentives for the investment 
required in our energy infrastructure.
In the US, recent rate case decisions 
in New York State and Massachusetts 
have approved increased capital investment 
programmes to improve electricity and gas 
infrastructure. We have also extended our 
grid modernisation pilot in Worcester.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions forms 
part of the Company’s KPIs (see page 12).
In the UK, we are working with customers 
and stakeholders to gather insights on the 
future role of gas in managing the transition 
to a low-carbon future. We continue  
to work with BEIS and Ofgem on the 
development of future energy systems  
as we respond to the shift to low-carbon 
energy in the UK. 
In the US, we support the Clean Power  
Plan. We continue to invest in new gas  
and electricity infrastructure that will further 
decarbonise generation, removing the use  
of coal and oil while increasing the use  
of renewables. We own 21 MW of solar 
generation and plan to add 14 MW more. 
In January 2017 , we formed a partnership 
with Sunrun, the largest dedicated provider 
of residential solar systems in the US.  
The partnership includes a residential  
solar co-marketing pilot already in progress 
in our service area on Staten Island, 
targeting roughly 100,000 homeowners.
Our operating environment
Our operating environment is shaped by the regulatory 
choices governments make to respond to the changing 
needs of energy consumers. In meeting these demands, 
regulators seek to balance often conflicting objectives. In 
the last year we have seen a shift in focus to affordability 
and moving to a low carbon economy.

Progress against our current strategy
We first set out our current strategy in our 2012/13 Annual 
Report and have continued to report on our progress 
against it since then. As we describe on page 9, there is  
an extraordinary amount of change facing our industry,  
so we have articulated our purpose, and evolved our vision 
and strategy (see page 8).
10 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Strategic Report Progress against our current strategy
Our customer satisfaction KPI comprises  
four components: Ofgem’s UK electricity and 
gas transmission and distribution customer 
satisfaction scores, and the US residential 
Customer Trust Advice survey metric. The US 
metric has been in place for two years and 
measures customers’ sentiment and overall 
satisfaction with National Grid by asking  
their level of trust in our advice to make  
good energy decisions.
In all of our key business areas, both in the US 
and in the UK, we have exceeded our customer 
satisfaction targets. You can find out more 
about our work on behalf of customers on 
pages 24–27.
Network reliability
Network reliability is measured separately for 
each of our business areas. The table below 
provides a simple visual representation of  
our performance across all of our networks. 
Our targets are set out in the table for our  
UK networks, and are set individually for  
each of our US jurisdictions.

We aim to deliver reliability by planning our 
capital investments to meet challenging 
demand and supply patterns, designing and 
building robust networks, having risk-based 
maintenance and replacement programmes, 
and detailed and tested incident response 
plans. We have not met our targets for UK  
Gas Transmission and Distribution. UK Gas 
Transmission missed its target as there was 
cessation to the flow at two supply points on 
the NTS on a small number of occasions. UK 
Gas Distribution had two incidents in the East 
of England network. One of these affected 
around 6,000 customers and was caused by 
third-party damage to our assets. The other 
affected around 2,500 customers.
You can find more information about our UK 
principal operations on pages 24–25, and our 
US principal operations on pages 26–27. 
Group return on equity (RoE)
We measure our performance in generating 
value for our shareholders by dividing our 
annual return by our equity base. This 
calculation provides a measure of the 
performance of the whole Group compared 
with the amounts invested by the Group in 
assets attributable to equity shareholders.

Group RoE has decreased during the year  
to 11.7%, from 12.3% in 2015/16. During the 
year, the UK regulated businesses (including 
UK Gas Distribution) delivered a solid 
operational return of 13.1% in aggregate 
(2015/16: 13.3%), including an assumption  
of 3% long run average RPI inflation. The  
US operational return of 8.2% (fiscal year)  
was up on last year’s 8.0% (calculated on a 
calendar year basis), reflecting increased 
revenues from new rate plans in MECO, 
KEDNY and KEDLI. 
A target for Group RoE is included in  
the incentive mechanisms for executive 
remuneration within both the Annual 
Performance Plan (APP) and the Long  
Term Performance Plan (LTPP). You can  
find more information about our Directors’ 
remuneration on pages 54-71. 
Engage our people
Create an inclusive, high-
performance culture by 
developing all our employees.
It is through the hard work of our employees 
that we will achieve our vision, respond to  
the needs of our stakeholders and create a 
competitive advantage. Encouraging engaged 
and talented teams that are in step with our 
strategic objectives is vital to our success.
How we assess progress:
Employee engagement index
This is a measure of how engaged our 
employees feel, based on the percentage  
of favourable responses to certain indicator 
questions repeated annually in our employee 
engagement survey. Our target is to increase 
engagement compared with the previous year.

well and those areas we need to improve.  
Our engagement index has risen 4 points  
to 77% favourable. 
The above engagement data for 2015/16  
and 2016/17 excludes our UK Gas Distribution 
employees because they did not take part in 
the 2016/17 survey due to the sales process.
The employee engagement figures including 
UK Gas Distribution for 2012 to 2015 were as 
follows: 63% for 2012/13, 71% for 2013/14,  
and 75% for 2014/15.

how we promote an inclusive and diverse 
workforce on page 30. The above data 
includes UK Gas Distribution employees.  
If they were excluded, the figures for 2016/17 
would be 24.1% and 17 .3% for women and 
ethnic minorities respectively. 
Stimulate innovation
Promote new ideas to work 
more efficiently and effectively.
Our commitment to innovation allows us to  
run our networks more efficiently and effectively 
and achieve our regulatory incentives. Across 
our business, we explore new ways of thinking 
and working to benefit every aspect of what  
we do.
You can read more about how we have 
innovated during 2016/17 in our principal 
operations sections on pages 24–29.
Engage externally
Work with external stakeholders 
to shape UK, EU and US 
energy policy.
Policy decisions by regulators, governments 
and others directly affect our business. We 
engage widely in the energy policy debate,  
so our position and perspective can influence 
future policy direction. We also engage with  
our regulators to help them provide the right 
mechanisms so we can deliver infrastructure 
that meets the changing needs of our 
customers and stakeholders.
Community engagement  
and investment in education
Working with our communities is important  
in creating shared value for us as a business 
and the people we serve. We use the London 
Benchmarking Group measurement framework 
to provide an overall community investment 
figure which includes education (but excludes 
investment in university research projects). 
While we have no specific target, our overall 
aim is to make sure we are creating shared 
value for the communities that we serve 
and work in.

In the UK, our community engagement and 
investment in education is £5,850,965 for 
2016/17 . In the US it is £6,513,926. This is a 
financial measurement of a number of activities, 
including the time our employees give through 
volunteering, the money our employees raise 
through fundraising and also the support  
we give to our charity partners. Overall our 
Company-wide investment is £12,364,891.
Skills and capabilities
We support developing the skills and 
capabilities of young people through skills-
sharing employee volunteering, especially  
in the science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics (STEM) subjects, because it 
supports our future talent recruitment and our 
desire to see young people gain meaningful 
employment. While we have no specific target, 
our aim is to encourage young people to get 
involved in STEM subjects.

an increase of 11,183 interactions with young 
people on STEM.
Embed sustainability
Integrate sustainability into  
our decision-making to create 
value, help preserve natural 
resources and respect the 
interests of our communities.
Our long-term sustainability strategy sets our 
ambition to deliver these aims and to embed a 
culture of sustainability within our organisation.
Climate change
A measure of our reduction of Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions of the six 
primary Kyoto greenhouse gases (excluding 
electricity transmission and distribution line 
losses). Our target is to reduce our greenhouse 
gas emissions by 45% by 2020 and 80% by 
2050, compared with our 1990 emissions  
of 19.6 million tonnes.

electricity line losses) equate to 0.3 million tonnes 
(2015/16: 0.3 million tonnes); combined this is  
a 63% reduction against our 1990 baseline. 
These are equivalent to an intensity of around 
424 tonnes per £million of revenue (2015/16: 
496). Our Scope 2 emissions from electricity  
line losses equate to 3. 1 million tonnes  
(2015/16: 3.4 million tonnes).
12 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Strategic Report Our Scope 3 emissions for 2016/17 were  
34 million tonnes (2015/16: 35.6 million tonnes). 
We measure and report in accordance with  
the World Resources Institute and World 
Business Council on Sustainable Development 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 100% of our Scope 
1 and 2 emissions and 92% of our Scope 3 
emissions are independently assured against 
ISO 14064-3 Greenhouse Gas assurance 
protocol. This statement, along with more 
information about our wider sustainability

Drive growth
Grow our core businesses  
and develop future new 
business options.
We continue to maximise value from our  
existing portfolio, while exploring and evaluating 
opportunities for growth. Making sure our 
portfolio of businesses maintains the appropriate 
mix of growth and cash generation is necessary 
to meet the expectations of our shareholders.

of our other financial KPIs.
Value Added in the year of £1.9 billion or  
51.6 pence per share was higher than 2015/16  
(£1.8 billion or 47 .6 pence per share) primarily 
as a result of higher inflation on UK regulated 
assets (March 2017 RPI of 3.1%, prior year 
1.6%) and improved US performance. Of the 
£1.9 billion Value Added in 2016/17 , £1,463 
million was paid to shareholders as cash 
dividends and £189 million as share 
repurchases (offsetting the scrip issuance 
during the year), with £289 million retained in 
the business. 
A target for Value Growth, a derivative of  
Value Added, is included in the incentive 
mechanisms for executive remuneration  
within the LTPP . You can find more

Adjusted EPS
Adjusted earnings represents profit for the  
year attributable to equity shareholders.  
This excludes exceptional items and

revenues in the UK and US, including a 
significant benefit from timing, the benefit  
of foreign exchange rates, reduced 
depreciation in the UK Gas Distribution 
business and a lower effective tax rate,  
partly offset by increased financing costs.

Regulated asset base growth
Maintaining efficient growth in our regulated 
assets ensures we are well positioned to 
provide consistently high levels of service  
to our customers and increases our revenue 
allowances in future years. While we have  
no specific target, our overall aim is to  
achieve between 5% and 7% of regulated 
asset base growth each year.

reflects the continued high levels of investment 
in our networks in both the UK and US, 
together with the impact of the stronger  
US dollar. Following the sale of a 61% interest  
in the UK Gas Distribution business on  
31 March 2017 the Group’s total RAV and

Strategic Report Revenue Cash flows Investment
Our business model
How we generate long-term value
Our ability to convert 
revenue to profit and 
cash is important. By 
managing our operations 
efficiently, safely and  
for the long term, we  
are able to generate 
strong sustainable  
cash flows to finance 
returns through 
dividends but also to 
provide funds for growth.
We invest efficiently  
in our networks to 
deliver strong and 
sustainable growth  
in our regulated asset 
base over the long term. 
We continually assess, 
monitor and challenge 
investment decisions  
in order to allow us  
to continue to deliver  
safe, reliable, and 
cost-effective networks.
We are a long-term asset-backed business. The diagram below illustrates how our regulated 
businesses create value, over time in the UK and US.
The vast majority of our 
revenues are set in 
accordance with our 
regulatory agreements, 
(see pages 17 4–179)  
and are calculated based 
on a number of factors: 
investment in network 
assets; performance 
against incentives; allowed 
returns on equity and  
cost of debt; and 
customer satisfaction.
Our business
Our transmission and distribution businesses  
in the UK and US operate as regulated 
monopolies. During 2016/17 , they generated 
96% (2015/16: 91%) of Group adjusted operating 
profit. Regulators safeguard customers’ interests 
by setting the level of charges we are allowed  
to pass on and the standards of performance 
we must achieve.
In the UK, we have one regulator, Ofgem,  
which regulates our electricity and gas 
businesses. As System Operator we make  
sure that supply and demand are balanced  
in real time and we facilitate the connection of 
assets to the transmission system. In the US,  
our retail activities are regulated by state utility 
commissions (in New York, Massachusetts  
and Rhode Island) and by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC) for wholesale 
activities, including interstate transmission and 
wholesale electricity generation. 
The foundations of our business model
Our people and our culture
Our business is built by our people. We work 
hard to make sure that we keep them as safe 
as possible. At the end of 2016/17 , after the sale 
of a majority interest in our UK Gas Distribution 
business and the transfer of its employees to the 
Consortium, we had more than 6,000 people 
working in the UK and nearly 16,000 in the US.
Being a responsible business 
Doing the right thing is a responsibility we take 
seriously. Being a responsible and sustainable 
business is fundamental to the way we work 
and how we manage our impact on the 
communities in which we operate.
Our relationships with stakeholders 
and regulators
We engage widely in debate that helps guide 
future energy policy direction. We work with our 
regulators to help them develop the frameworks 
within which we can meet the changing energy 
needs of the communities we serve. 
Our customer focus
Our customers’ wants and needs are evolving 
with a greater desire to manage their energy 
use and expectations of how we interact with 
them. To remain relevant to our customers,  
we must understand and respond to their 
changing requirements and deliver outstanding 
experiences, products and services.
Innovation 
Thinking differently and challenging the norms 
allow our people to develop innovative and 
more efficient ways of delivering our services 
and maintaining our networks.
Our financial capital and fixed asset base
The way in which our investment is funded is 
an important part of our business. As a UK 
business with a secondary ADS listing in New 
York, long-term sustainable assets and strong 
credit ratings, we are able to secure efficient 
funding from a variety of sources.
How we generate value
Our stakeholders Our measures of success
Our business creates value for our stakeholders  
in both financial and non-financial terms.
Our KPIs benchmark our performance in  
each of these key areas as shown below.
We create value for our stakeholders  
and communities by:
• operating as safely, reliably and sustainably 
as possible;
• focusing on affordability to reduce the  
impact on customer bills;
• delivering essential services, while  
managing loss of supply and customer  
service issues in a timely way; and
• aiming to improve customer satisfaction  
at all times.
• Operating excellence/safety
• Network reliability
• Greenhouse gas emissions
• Customer satisfaction
We create value for our people by:
• paying them a market competitive wage,  
and an overall pay package that rewards 
competency and performance; and
• providing an inclusive culture and  
encouraging development and  
employee enablement.
• Employee engagement
• Workforce diversity
We create value for our shareholders by: 
• making sure our regulatory frameworks  
maintain an acceptable balance  
between risk and return;
• operating within our regulatory frameworks 
as efficiently and compliantly as possible;
• performing well against our regulatory 
incentives, so we can make the most  
of our allowed returns; 
• careful cash flow management and  
securing low-cost funding; and
• disciplined investment in our networks  
and protecting our reputation.
• Adjusted EPS
• Returns on equity

Internal control and risk management
Risk management activities occur through all 
levels of our organisation. Through a ‘top down, 
bottom up’ approach, all business functions 
identify the main risks to our business model 
and to achieving their business objectives. 
They assess each risk by considering the 
financial and reputational impacts, and how 
likely the risk is to materialise. They identify and 
implement the actions being taken to manage 
and monitor those risks and indicate the 
adequacy of our existing risk controls. The 
identified risks and actions are collated in risk 
registers and reported at functional and 
regional levels of the Group.
An important feature of our risk management 
process is our three lines of defence model. 
Each business function owns and is 
responsible for managing its own particular 
risks (the first line of defence). A central risk 
management team (the second line of defence) 
acts as an advisory function on implementing 
the risk process and also provides independent 
challenge of the principal risk assessments  
and actions taken to mitigate and manage 
those risks. This team partners with the 
business functions through nominated risk 
liaison staff members and collaborates with 
assurance teams and specialists, such as the 
safety and compliance management teams to 
evaluate gaps in controls, identify performance 
trends and provide recommendations for 
improvements. Our internal audit function then 
audits selected controls to provide independent 
assessments of the effectiveness of our risk 
management and internal control systems  
(the third line of defence).
Managing our risks
National Grid is exposed to a variety of 
uncertainties that could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s financial condition, our 
operational results, our reputation, and the 
value and liquidity of our shares.
The Board oversees the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems.  
As part of this role, the Board sets and 
monitors the amount of risk the Company is 
prepared to seek or accept in pursuing our 
strategic objectives (our risk appetite). The 
Board assesses the Company’s principal risks 
and monitors the risk management process 
through risk review and challenge sessions 
twice a year. Over the course of the year, the 
Board has also considered specific principal 
risks including cyber security, emerging 
technology, the future role of the System 
Operator, asset safety, Brexit and strategic 
workforce planning.
Risk management process
Overall risk strategy, policy and process are  
set at the Group level with implementation 
owned by the business. Our enterprise risk 
management process provides a framework 
through which we can consistently identify, 
assess and prioritise, manage, monitor  
and report risks, as shown in the diagram 
below. The process is designed to support  
the delivery of our vision and strategy,  
as described on page 8.
Regional senior management regularly reviews 
and debates the outputs of the bottom-up risk 
management process. This helps ensure the 
business is aligned to the Company’s strategic 
objectives and that the prioritisation of the 
principal risks is discussed regularly. The most 
significant risks for the UK and US businesses 
are highlighted in regional risk profiles and 
reported to the Chief Executive. 
We develop our main strategic uncertainties  
or ‘principal risks’ for the Company through 
discussing the Group risk profile with the  
Group Executive Committee and the Board. 
These risks are reported and debated with the 
Group Executive Committee and Board every 
six months. Workshops are held with UK and  
US business leadership teams so we can  
make sure the principal risks remain closely 
aligned to our strategic aims and that no 
significant risks (or combination of risks)  
are overlooked. 
The Board and leadership teams also discuss 
the results of testing our principal risks. The aim 
of this testing is to establish the impact of the 
principal risks on the Group’s ability to continue 
operating and meet its liabilities over the 
assessment period. We test the impact of 
these risks on a reasonable worst case basis, 
alone and in clusters, over a five-year 
assessment period. This work informs the 
viability statement (see page 19).
The outcomes from each level of the risk review 
process are fed back to the relevant teams and 
incorporated as appropriate into the next cycle 
of our ongoing risk process.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is committed to protecting and enhancing our 
reputation and assets, while safeguarding the interests of 
our shareholders. It has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of risk management and internal control.
Risk management process Feedback and reporting
15 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report Our principal risks
Accepting that it is not possible to identify, 
anticipate or eliminate every risk that may  
arise and that risk is an inherent part of doing 
business, our risk management process  
aims to provide reasonable assurance that  
we understand, monitor and manage the  
main uncertainties that we face in delivering  
our objectives. This includes consideration  
of inherent risks, which exist because  
of the nature of day-to-day operations  
in our industry, and financial risks, which  
exist because of our financing activities.  
Our principal risks and a summary of 
management and mitigation actions are 
provided in the table below. We have provided 
the overview of the key inherent risks we face 
on pages 180–183, as well as our key financial 
risks, which are incorporated within the notes 
to our consolidated financial statements  
on pages 92–165. Our corporate risk profile 
contains the principal risks that the Board 
considers to be the main uncertainties  
currently facing the Group as we endeavour  
to achieve our strategic objectives. Following 
the referendum vote for the UK to leave the  
EU and the consequential uncertainties in  
the political and economic environment,  
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has 
highlighted matters for boards to consider.  
In relation to principal risks, the FRC states  
that boards must consider the nature and 
extent of risks and uncertainties arising  
from the result of the referendum and the 
impact on the future performance and  
position of the business. Consequently,  
our risk owners have considered Brexit  
in their assessments of the principal risks.  
These assessments continue as we gain  
more clarity on the likely impact of Brexit  
on our business. Our principal risks are  
shown in the table below. 
Risk area Risk description Example of mitigations
Growth Failure to identify and execute the right 
opportunities to deliver our growth strategy.
Failure to grow our core business and have viable 
options for new business over the longer term would 
adversely affect the Group’s credibility and jeopardise 
the achievement of intended financial returns. 
Our ability to achieve our ambition for growth is  
subject to a wide range of external uncertainties, 
including the availability of potential investment targets 
and attractive financing and the impact of competition 
for onshore transmission in both the UK and US;  
and internal uncertainties, such as the performance  
of our operating businesses and our business  
planning model assumptions.
• Processes and resources are in place to review, undertake due 
diligence and progress new investment opportunities, dispose of 
existing businesses and identify and execute on opportunities that 
provide organic growth. These processes, along with twice-yearly 
Board strategy offsite discussions, are reviewed regularly to ensure 
they remain supportive of our short- and long-term strategy. We 
regularly monitor and analyse market conditions, competitors  
and their potential strategies, the advancement and proliferation  
of new energy technologies, and the performance of our  
Group portfolio. 
• While good progress has been made this past year, we must  
remain focused on increasing development opportunities in our  
core business and emerging opportunities. Mitigating actions  
focus on building our business development pipeline and our 
capability to pursue non-organic growth options.
Energy policy Failure to secure satisfactory regulatory 
outcomes and to influence future  
energy policy.
Policy decisions by regulators, governments and 
others directly affect our business. We must engage 
widely in the energy policy debate, making sure  
our position and perspective help to shape future  
policy direction.
• In both the UK and US we strive to maintain a good understanding  
of the regulatory agenda and emerging issues, so that robust, public 
interest aligned responses can be selected and developed in good 
time. Our reputation as a competent operator of important national 
infrastructure is critical to our ability to do this. 
• As part of our new business strategy, we have renewed our 
stakeholder engagement strategy to improve focus on business 
objectives. The new strategy incorporates senior executive  
ownership of each priority, and the development of key positions  
and engagement plans by cross-functional teams.
Emerging  
technology
Failure to effectively respond to the threats 
and opportunities presented by emerging 
technologies, particularly adapting our 
networks to meet the challenge of increasing 
distributed energy sources.
Technology developments in areas such as solar 
energy, energy storage, electric vehicles and 
distributed generation have developed at a faster  
pace than many anticipated. We face the challenge  
of adapting our networks to meet new demands  
as well as ensuring we act on the opportunities  
that will benefit our customers and stakeholders. 
• We created a technology team within our Strategy function to 
develop relationships with emerging and technology-centric 
organisations, to monitor disruptive technology and business model 
trends and to act as a bridge for emerging technology into the core 
regulated businesses and business development teams. In addition, 
the partnership with Energy Impact Partners was established to gain 
exposure to emerging start-up companies. The new National Grid 
Ventures function will further the focus on new strategies, business 
development and technology and innovation.
Safety Catastrophic asset failure resulting  
in a significant safety event.
Safety is a fundamental priority. Some of the assets 
owned and operated by National Grid are inherently 
hazardous and process safety incidents, while 
extremely unlikely, can occur. Our objective is to be 
an industry leader in managing the process safety 
risks from our assets to protect our employees, 
contractors and the communities in which we 
operate. We operate in compliance with regional 
legislation and regulation. In addition, we identify  
and adopt good practices for safety management. 
• We continue to commit significant resources and financial 
investment to maintain the integrity of our assets and we strive  
to continuously improve our key process safety controls. Our 
Group-wide process safety management system is in place to 
ensure a robust and consistent framework of risk management 
exists across our higher hazard asset portfolio.
• We have a mature insurance strategy that uses a mix of  
self-insurance, captives and direct (re)insurance placements.  
This provides some financial protection in respect of property 
damage, business interruption and liability risks. Periodically, 
independent surveys of key assets are undertaken, which provide 
risk engineering knowledge and best practices to the Group  
with the aim of further reducing our exposure to hazard risks.

Data management Failure to operate with a sufficiently mature 
business data management capability.
The need for accurate, timely, and meaningful data  
lies throughout the organisation and is critical to our 
core processes and our ability to grow the business. 
We must rely upon the performance of our systems 
and data to demonstrate the value of our business  
to our shareholders, meet our obligations under our 
regulatory agreements and comply with agreements 
with bond holders and other providers of finance.
• We have developed data management principles and minimum 
standards with supporting guidelines. These documents provide 
clarity around what is expected, with a strong focus on what we 
need in place to keep us safe, secure and legally compliant. 
• These standards have been launched in the business and will  
be developed in the coming year. In support of this, we are also 
developing a capability framework, to make sure our people have 
the appropriate skills and expertise in data management. The 
businesses will continue to develop their own implementation  
plans against these new standards and capabilities. The aim  
of these plans will be to ensure we can demonstrate we are 
compliant with the minimum standards and have the core 
capabilities in place for all of our business critical data. 
• To support these efforts, we are establishing regional centres  
of excellence for data management. Their role will be to provide 
expertise to the businesses and to help provide assurance  
around the effectiveness of the data management standards.
Cyber breach We experience a major cyber security  
breach of business and critical national 
infrastructure (CNI) systems.
Due to the nature of our business we recognise  
that our CNI systems may be a potential target  
for cyber threats. We must protect our business 
assets and infrastructure and be prepared for  
any malicious attack.
• We use industry best practices as part of our cyber security 
policies, processes and technologies. Our cyber security 
programme is a global programme of work which started in  
2010 and continues to be modified and updated to this day.  
This programme is intended to reduce the risk that a cyber  
threat could adversely affect the Company’s business resilience. 
• We continually invest in cyber strategies that are commensurate 
with the changing nature of the security landscape. This includes 
collaborative working with BEIS and the Centre for Protection of 
National Infrastructure on key cyber risks and development of an 
enhanced CNI security strategy and our involvement in the US  
with developing the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
Cyberspace Security Framework. We also collaborate with a 
number of regulatory agencies focused on protection of CNI.
Leadership  
capacity
Failure to build skills and leadership capacity 
(including effective succession planning) 
required to deliver our vision and strategy.
It is through the high-quality work of our employees 
that we will achieve our vision, respond to the 
changing needs of our stakeholders and create  
a competitive advantage. Obtaining and fostering  
an engaged and talented team that has the 
knowledge, training, skills and experience to  
deliver on our strategic objectives is vital to our 
success. We must attract, integrate and retain  
the talent we need at all levels of the business.
• Strategic workforce planning allows us to effectively inform our 
strategic resourcing plans. Our entry level talent development 
schemes (graduate training and apprenticeships) are a potential 
source of competitive advantage in the market place. We are 
involved in a number of initiatives to help secure the future 
engineering talent required. Improvements to our talent  
processes mean we continue to improve in identifying talent  
and in accelerating development of future leaders (e.g. our 
Accelerated Development Programme).
• The rigour of our succession planning and development  
planning process has been improved, particularly at senior  
levels and is now being applied deeper into the organisation. 
• In all strategies and programmes we continue to promote  
inclusion and diversity. 
• To help understand our workforce, we formally solicit  
employee opinions via a Group-wide employee survey  
that is conducted annually.

our risk management and internal controls 
systems. The CoA process operates via a 
cascade system and takes place biannually  
in support of the half- and full-year results.  
The Audit Committee considers the CoA and 
provides a recommendation to the Board  
in support of its review.
The periodic SOX reports on management’s 
opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls 
over financial reporting are received by the 
Board in advance of the half- and full-year 
results. They concern the Group-wide 
programme to comply with the requirements  
of s404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are 
received directly from the Group Controls  
team; and through the Executive and  
Audit Committees. 
Our internal control process 
We have a number of processes to support our 
internal control environment. These processes 
are managed by dedicated specialist teams, 
including risk management, ethics and 
compliance management, corporate audit  
and internal controls, and safety, environment 
and health. Oversight of these activities  
is provided through regular review and 
reporting to the Board and appropriate Board 
committees as outlined in the Corporate 
Governance section on pages 32–52. 
Monitoring internal control is conducted 
through established boards and committees at 
different levels of the organisation. Deficiencies 
are reported and corrected at the appropriate 
entity-level. The most significant risk and 
internal controls issues are monitored at the 
Senior Executive and Board level. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for keeping under 
review and reporting to the Board on 
effectiveness of reporting, internal control 
policies, compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley 
(SOX), Bribery Act legislation, appropriateness 
of financial disclosures and procedures  
for risk and compliance management,  
business conduct and internal audit.
Reviewing the effectiveness of our 
internal control and risk management 
Each year the Board reviews the effectiveness  
of our internal control systems and risk 
management processes covering all material 
systems, including financial, operational  
and compliance controls, to make sure  
they remain robust. 
The latest review covered the financial year to 
31 March 2017 and the period to the approval 
of this Annual Report and Accounts. In this 
review, the Board considered the effectiveness 
of areas such as the control environment, risk 
management and internal control activities, 
including those described below. 
Internal control and risk management continued
The Board evaluated the effectiveness of 
management’s processes for monitoring  
and reviewing internal control and risk 
management. It noted that no significant 
failings or weaknesses had been identified  
by the review and confirmed that it was 
satisfied the systems and processes  
were functioning effectively.
Our internal control and risk management 
processes comply with the requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. They are also 
the basis of our compliance with obligations set 
by SOX and other internal assurance activities. 
Internal control over financial reporting 
We have specific internal mechanisms that 
govern the financial reporting process and  
the preparation of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. Our financial controls guidance  
sets out the fundamentals of internal control 
over financial reporting, which are applied 
across the Company.
Our financial processes include a range  
of system, transactional and management 
oversight controls. In addition, our businesses 
prepare detailed monthly management reports 
that include analysis of their results, along with 
comparisons to relevant budgets, forecasts 
and prior year results. These are presented  
to, and reviewed by, senior management  
within our Finance function. 
These reviews are supplemented by quarterly 
performance reviews, attended by the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director. The reviews 
consider historical results and expected future 
performance and involve senior management 
from both operational and financial areas of the 
business. 
As part of our assessment of financial controls 
in previous years, we identified a number  
of weaknesses in our US financial control 
framework. We are making progress in 
remediating these weaknesses. For more 
information, including our opinion on internal 
control over financial reporting, see page 180.
18 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Strategic Report Viability statement
The Board’s consideration of the longer-term 
viability of the Company is an extension of our 
business planning process, which includes 
financial forecasting, a robust risk management 
assessment, regular budget reviews and 
scenario planning. Our business strategy aims  
to make sure that our operations and finances 
are sustainable. 
Although it has considered adopting a longer 
period, the Board believes that five years is  
the most appropriate timeframe over which  
we should assess the long-term viability of  
the Company. The following factors have been 
taken into account in making this decision:
1. We have reasonable clarity over a five-year 
period, allowing an appropriate assessment 
of our principal risks to be made; 
2. In order to test the five-year period the 
Board considered whether there are 
specific, foreseeable risk events relating  
to the principal risks that are likely to 
materialise within a five to ten year period, 
and which might be substantial enough  
to affect the Company’s viability and 
therefore should be taken into account 
when setting the assessment period.  
No risks of this sort were identified; and
3. It matches our business planning cycle.
We have set out the details of the principal  
risks facing our Company on pages 16–17 ,  
and described the process we use on page 18.  
Over the course of the year the Board has also 
considered the principal risks shown in the 
table below in detail.
In addition to the principal risks, the Board has 
considered the impact of Brexit and the sale  
of a majority share in our UK Gas Distribution 
business. We are not of the view that Brexit will 
have an impact that could affect the viability  
of the Company. In relation to the sale of a 
majority interest in the UK Gas Distribution 
business, the Board has also concluded that 
Risk Matters considered by the Board
Failure to secure satisfactory regulatory outcomes/ 
failure to influence future energy policy.
Updates and reviews of:
• the future role of the ESO;
• the impact of Brexit;
• US Regulatory Strategy and initiatives to improve customer service; and
• UK Regulatory Strategy.
Catastrophic asset failure resulting in a significant  
safety event.
Safety is a fundamental priority and as such is looked at in detail by the Safety, Environment  
and Health Committee who have delegated authority from the Board. The Board receives  
an oral report from the Committee Chairman after every meeting. Additionally, the Board  
reviews the current safety performance of the Company at each meeting.
We experience a major cyber security breach of business  
and CNI systems/data.
The Board has received regular updates on cyber security. From April 2017 the Board will  
receive cyber security updates three times a year.
The Board has also undertaken cyber security training. 
Failure to identify and execute the right opportunities  
to deliver our growth strategy.
The Board has held three strategy sessions this year.
We fail to effectively respond to the threats and opportunities 
presented by emerging technology, particularly the challenge  
of adapting our networks to meet the challenges of increasing 
distributed energy resources.
The impact of emerging technology is a key part of our strategy sessions.
Failure to build skills and leadership capacity (including 
effective succession planning) required to deliver our vision  
and strategy.
The Board has had two sessions on strategic workforce planning and building our human 
resources capability.
this will not have an adverse impact on the 
viability of the Company.
The Board has discussed the potential financial 
and reputational impact of the principal risks 
against our ability to deliver the Company’s 
business plan. This describes and tests the 
significant solvency and liquidity risks involved  
in delivering our strategic objectives within our 
business model. 
The Board assessed our reputational and 
financial risk capacity, and reviewed the stress 
testing of the principal risks against that risk 
capacity, based on assessing reasonable 
worst-case scenarios over the assessment 
period. The reputational and financial impacts 
(to the nearest £500 million) were considered.  
The risks relating to growth, skills and 
leadership capacity were not tested, as the 
Board did not feel they would threaten the 
viability of the Company within the five-year 
assessment period. 
We chose a number of scenarios for individual 
testing for impact on the Company’s viability, 
including the following: 
Scenario 1 – A cyber-attack on our critical 
national infrastructure leading to a serious 
loss of service.
Scenario 2 – A catastrophic gas pipeline 
failure on one of our assets leading to an 
explosion and loss of service. 
Scenario 3 – A serious fire in our Liquefied 
Natural Gas terminal at the Isle of Grain.
Scenario 4 – A serious system breach 
leading to loss of customer data.
Scenario 5 – Emerging technology  
leading to significant numbers of people 
going ‘off grid’. 
Viability statement
In addition to testing individual principal  
risks, the Board also considered the impact  
of a cluster of the principal risks materialising 
over the assessment period. Scenarios 
developed to represent reasonable worst-case 
examples of principal risk clusters were 
assessed for cumulative impact upon our 
reputation and stakeholder trust. We chose  
a combination of risks that would represent  
the greatest potential financial impact and a 
combination that would represent a potentially 
significant long-term impact.  
Scenario 6 – A cyber security attack and 
catastrophic US asset failure occurring 
together within the assessment period. 
Scenario 7 – A significant safety event 
followed by a cyber-attack resulting in  
a loss of supply and loss of data. 
No principal risk or cluster of principal  
risks was found to have an impact on the 
viability of the Company. Preventative and 
mitigating controls in place to minimise the 
likelihood of occurrence and/or financial  
and reputation impact are embedded within  
our assurance system.
In assessing the impact of the principal risks  
on the Company, the Board has considered  
the fact that we operate in stable markets and 
the robust financial position of the Group, 
including the ability to sell assets, raise capital 
and suspend or reduce the payment of 
dividends. It has also considered Ofgem’s  
legal duty to have regard to the need to fund 
licenced National Grid Gas plc and National 
Grid Electricity Transmission plc activities.
Each Director was satisfied that they had 
sufficient information to judge the viability  
of the Company. Based on the assessment 
described above and on page 16, the  
Directors have a reasonable expectation  
that the Company will be able to continue 
operating and meet its liabilities over the  
period to May 2022.

Measurement of financial performance
We describe and explain our results principally 
on an adjusted basis and explain the rationale 
for this on page 193. We present results on  
an adjusted basis before exceptional items  
and remeasurements. See pages 193–195  
for further details and reconciliations from the 
adjusted profit measures to IFRS, under which 
we report our financial results and position.  
Further commentary on movements in the 
income statement is provided on page 85.
On a statutory basis, operating profit and 
earnings include a £633 million charge in 
respect of environmental and gas holder 
demolition costs and a £68 million gain on 
commodity contracts in the US. Our total 
statutory earnings and EPS figures include  
the profit arising from the sale of the  
UK Gas Distribution business. 
Adjusted operating profit from 
continuing operations
Adjusted operating profit for the year ended 
31 March 2017 was £3,773 million, up

For the year ended 31 March 2017 ,  
adjusted operating profit in the UK Electricity 
Transmission segment increased by  
£199 million to £1,372 million. Revenue was 
£462 million higher, mainly reflecting higher 
system balancing revenues, increased 
regulated revenue allowances and the impact 
of higher volumes. Pass-through costs were 
£263 million higher, mainly due to increased 
system balancing costs. Regulated controllable 
costs were £25 million lower including reduced 
environmental costs partly offset by increased 
employee costs. Depreciation and amortisation 
costs were £31 million higher, reflecting the 
continued capital investment programme, and 
other costs were £6 million lower than prior 
year including lower asset disposal costs. 
UK Gas Transmission adjusted operating 
profit increased by £25 million to £511 million. 
Revenue was £33 million higher, including 
increased regulated revenue allowances in the 
year and higher volumes than expected, partly 
offset by lower LNG storage revenues following 
a site closure. After deducting pass-through 
costs, net revenue was £31 million higher than 
prior year. Regulated controllable costs were 
£2 million higher than last year, with lower LNG 
storage costs offset by costs resulting from 
an increase in the number of employees 
to support higher levels of asset health 
investment. Depreciation and amortisation 
costs were £8 million higher, reflecting ongoing 
investment. Other operating costs were  
£4 million lower than last year. 
Within our US Regulated business, adjusted 
operating profit increased by £528 million to 
£1,713 million. The stronger dollar increased 
revenue and operating profit in the year by 
£1,160 million and £184 million respectively 
compared to last year’s results. Excluding the 
impact of exchange rate movements, revenue

Additional commentary on financial KPIs 
This year, as a result of the UK Gas Distribution 
sale, our financial statements are more complex 
than in prior years. In particular, we report our 
earnings for the Group excluding UK Gas 
Distribution (‘continuing operations’) separately 
from the results of that business, which we 
report within discontinued operations.
The commentary below is focused principally 
on the results for the continuing Group.

to allowance. Pass through costs were  
£2 million lower and regulated controllable 
costs were £13 million higher including costs 
resulting from an increase in the number of 
employees. Depreciation and amortisation 
costs were £84 million lower reflecting the 
cessation of depreciation from 8 December 
2016, following the agreement for the sale of  
a majority stake in the business. Other costs 
were £17 million higher than prior year, which 
included the release of provisions for gas 
holder demolition costs. 
Scrip restatement 
In accordance with IAS 33, all EPS and 
adjusted EPS amounts for comparative periods 
have been restated as a result of shares issued 
through the scrip dividend scheme. 
Group return on equity (RoE) 
We measure our performance in generating 
value for our shareholders by dividing our 
annual return by our equity base. 
Group RoE has been calculated for the year 
including a full year of contribution from the 
disposed UK Gas Distribution business.
Group RoE has decreased during the year  
to 11.7%, from 12.3% in 2015/16. During the 
year, the UK regulated businesses (including 
Gas Distribution) delivered a solid operational 
return of 13.1% in aggregate (2015/16: 13.3%), 
including an assumption of 3% long-run 
average RPI inflation. US operational return  
of 8.2% (fiscal year) was up on last year’s  
8.0% (calculated on a calendar year basis), 
reflecting increased revenues from new  
rate plans in MECO, KEDNY and KEDLI. 
As discussed earlier profits from Other  
activities in the Group were lower than last  
year, adjusted interest costs for the continuing 
and discontinued businesses combined were 
higher and the effective tax rate was lower. 
Regulated asset base growth 
In total, including all of the regulated asset value 
(RAV) of UK Gas Distribution, our UK RAV and 
US rate base increased by £3.8 billion (10%) in 
the year to £42.6 billion. The increase reflects 
the continued high levels of investment in our 
networks in both the UK and US, together with 
the impact of the stronger US dollar. Following 
the sale of a 61% interest in the UK Gas 
Distribution business on 31 March 2017 the 
Group’s total RAV and rate base decreased to 
£37 .1 billion (including a 39% share of the RAV 
of the disposed UK Gas Distribution business).
The UK RAV (including 100% of the RAV of Gas 
Distribution) increased by £1.1 billion, reflecting 
significant capital expenditure, together with 
inflation. RPI inflation at 3.1% (March to March), 
was in line with our 3% long-term expectation. 
UK RAV growth also included capitalised 
efficiencies or ‘performance RAV’ of £110 
million this year. 
increased by £278 million. Increased revenue 
allowances under new rate cases, the benefit 
of capex trackers and over-recovery of allowed 
revenues due to cold weather were partly offset 
by lower commodity cost recoveries. Overall 
pass-through costs reduced by £231 million 
(excluding the impact of foreign exchange). 
Regulated controllable costs increased by  
£152 million at constant currency, partly as a 
result of increased information systems costs, 
write-offs of prior years’ capital costs and 
higher costs of health care and other benefits. 
These were partly offset by a £32 million 
decrease in bad debt costs. Depreciation and 
amortisation costs were £24 million higher this 
year at constant currency as a result of ongoing 
investment in our networks. Other operating 
costs were £21 million higher at constant 
currency, reflecting increased operating taxes 
and cost of removal of existing assets. 
Adjusted operating profit in Other activities  
was £193 million lower at £177 million. In the 
US, adjusted operating profit was £80 million 
lower (including £3 million of foreign exchange 
benefit) partly reflecting higher US project 
development costs. In addition, 2015/16 
included a £49 million gain on disposal of  
the Iroquois pipeline. In the UK, adjusted 
operating profit was £113 million lower  
including lower auction revenues from  
the French Interconnector and increased 
business change costs. 
Adjusted earnings from continuing 
operations
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , adjusted 
net finance costs were £173 million higher than 
they were in 2015/16 at £1,029 million, with the 
impact of higher UK RPI inflation on index-
linked borrowings and increased average net 
debt levels combined with the impact of the 
stronger US dollar. This was partly offset by 
lower tax and pension-related interest. 
Our adjusted tax charge was £62 million  
higher than it was in 2015/16. This was mainly 
due to higher profits before tax partly offset by 
some tax settlements in respect of prior years.  
The effective tax rate for 2016/17 was 23.7% 
(2015/16: 25.0%). 
The earnings performance described  
above has translated into adjusted earnings  
of £2,141 million, up £329 million on last year.  
This equates to adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) of 56.9 pence, up 8.9 pence (19%)  
on 2015/16. 
Discontinued operations 
Discontinued operations are comprised 
primarily of the UK Gas Distribution and 
Xoserve businesses. Adjusted operating  
profit for discontinued operations increased  
by £12 million to £894 million. Operating  
profit from Xoserve decreased by £8 million, 
reflecting system implementation costs. In  
UK Gas Distribution, revenue was £36 million 
lower. This primarily reflects the non-recurrence 
of last year’s revenue over-recovery compared 
US rate base has increased by £2.7 billion  
this year. Of this, £1.9 billion was due to foreign 
exchange movements increasing the rate  
base reported in sterling. Excluding foreign 
exchange, rate base increased by £0.8 billion, 
reflecting a significant year of US investment. 
Value Added 
Our dividend is an important part of returns to 
shareholders along with growth in the value of 
the asset base attributable to equity investors. 
These are reflected in the Value Added metric 
that underpins our approach to sustainable 
decision-making and long-term incentive 
arrangements. 
Value Added for the year has been calculated 
on a combined basis and so excludes the 
impact of the UK Gas Distribution sale, which 
completed on 31 March 2017 . 
Overall Value Added in the year was £1.9 billion 
or 51.6 pence per share as set out below:

Value Added per share 51.6p 47.6p
Value Added in the year was higher than 
2015/16 (£1.8 billion or 47 .6 pence per share)  
as a result of higher inflation on UK regulated 
assets (March 2017 RPI of 3.1%, prior  
year 1.6%) and improved US performance.  
Of the £1.9 billion Value Added in 2016/17 ,  
£1,463 million was paid to shareholders as 
cash dividends and £189 million as share 
repurchases (offsetting the scrip issuance 
during the year), with £289 million retained  
in the business. 
The Board is confident that growth in assets, 
earnings and cash flows, supported by 
improving cash efficiency and an exposure to 
attractive regulatory markets, should help the 
Group to maintain strong, stable credit ratings 
and a consistent prudent level of gearing, while 
delivering attractive returns for shareholders.

Other performance 
measures
Regulated return on equity 
US and UK regulated returns are calculated 
using the capital structure assumed within their 
respective regulatory arrangements and, in  
the case of the UK, assuming 3% RPI inflation.  
As these assumptions differ between the UK 
and the US, RoE measures are not directly 
comparable between the two geographies.  
In our performance measures, we compare 
achieved RoEs to the level assumed when 
setting base rate and revenue allowances  
in each jurisdiction.
UK regulated return on equity 
UK RoE has decreased 20bps to 13.1%.  
This reduction in RoE reflects a reduction in 
incentive performance year-on-year, particularly 
as a result of the decline in legacy revenue 
incentive recoveries in the Gas Transmission 
business. Totex out-performance was at a 
similar level to last year, representing 160bps  
of our out-performance over allowed returns.

The UK RoCE has decreased from 8.1% to 
7 .8% in 2016/17 . This reflects the reduction  
in legacy incentive revenues in our Gas 
Transmission business in the year. 
US RoCE has remained at the same level  
as last year at 5.7%. Regulated financial 
performance has increased compared with  
last year, offset by growth in the rate base, 
driven by capital investment. 
Capital expenditure 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , capital 
expenditure of £3,735 million for the continuing 
business was £408 million higher than last  
year. The Group also invested £127 million  
in a number of joint ventures including a new 
electricity interconnector between the UK and 
Belgium and £42 million into a partnership with 
Sunrun Inc. in the US. In addition, the Group 
invested a further £10 million in the St William 
Homes joint venture with Berkeley Group.
Our US Regulated business continues to 
increase levels of investment in network 
reinforcement and resilience. Capital expenditure 
in 2016/17 was £391 million higher than last 
year, and reflected higher spend on gas mains 
replacement, gas customer growth and system 
reinforcement together with the impact of a 
stronger US dollar.

which aims to grow the dividend per share at 
least in line with the rate of RPI inflation each 
year for the foreseeable future. 
During the year we generated £1.2 billion 
of business net cash flow after our capital 
expenditure programmes. This has enabled 
the growth of the dividend per share in line 
with average RPI, being 2.1% (2015/16: 
1.1%; 2014/15: 2.0%), taking into account 
the recommended final dividend of  
29.10 pence per ordinary share. 
During the year, the Company has repurchased 
shares in the market with the overall goal being 
to reduce the dilutive effect of the scrip as 
much as possible to the extent that is 
consistent with maintaining the Group’s strong 
financial position as reflected in its credit rating.
Net debt and credit metrics 
We expect capital investment programmes  
and network enhancement will continue to be 
funded by market borrowings. We continue to 
borrow at attractive rates when needed and  
the level of net debt remains appropriate for  
the size of our business. 
During 2016/17 , net debt has decreased by  
£6 billion. This is driven by cash flows related to  
the disposal of 61% of our UK Gas Distribution 
business of £10.2 billion and business net  
cash inflows (after cash capital investment)  
of £1.3 billion (excluding UK Gas Distribution 
disposal costs), partly offset by outflows from 
interest, dividends, tax and other financing flows 
of £2.7 billion, with non-cash movements such 
as foreign exchange and accretion of interest 
increasing net debt by a further £2.8 billion. 
A key measure we use to monitor financial 
discipline is retained cash flow divided by 
adjusted net debt (RCF/net debt). This is  
a measure of the operating cash flows we 
generate, before capital investment but after 
dividends paid to shareholders, compared  
with the level of debt we hold. The principal 
adjustments made to net debt are in respect  
of pension deficits and hybrid debt instruments. 
The impact of the UK Gas Distribution 
transaction has a positive effect on the metric 
in the year of sale. RCF/net debt was 15.8% 
for the year (2015/16: 11.5%; 2014/15: 11.2%). 
We have actively managed scrip uptake 
through buying back shares when supported 
by sufficient headroom in the RCF/net debt 
metric. Deducting the costs of buying back 
these shares reduces RCF/net debt to 14.9% 
for the year. 
Our long-term target for RCF/net debt is to 
exceed 9.0%, which is consistent with the  
A3 rating threshold used by Moody’s, the  
rating agency. 
We additionally monitor interest cover, which  
is a measure of the cash flows we generate 
compared with the net interest cost of servicing 
our borrowings. Interest cover for the year  
was 5.0 times (2015/16: 5.5 times; 2014/15:  
5.1 times). Our target long-term rate for  
interest cover is in excess of 3.0 times.

Regulatory financial 
performance 
Timing and regulated revenue 
adjustments 
As described on pages 174 to 179, our allowed 
revenues are set in accordance with our 
regulatory price controls or rate plans. We 
calculate the tariffs we charge our customers 
based on the estimated volume of energy we 
expect will be delivered during the coming 
period. The actual volumes delivered will differ 
from the estimate. Therefore, our total actual 
revenue will be different from our total allowed 
revenue. These differences are commonly 
referred to as timing differences. 
If we collect more than the allowed revenue,  
the balance must be returned to customers  
in subsequent periods, and if we collect less 
than the allowed level of revenue we may 
recover the balance from customers in 
subsequent periods. In the US, a substantial 
portion of our costs are pass-through costs 
(including commodity and energy efficiency 
costs) and are fully recoverable from our 
customers. Timing differences between costs 
of this type being incurred and their recovery 
through revenue are also included in timing. 
The amounts calculated as timing differences 
are estimates and subject to change until  
the variables that determine allowed revenue 
are final. 
Our continuing operating profit for the year 
includes a total estimated in-year over-
collection of £398 million (2015/16: £1 million 
under-collection). Our closing balance  
at 31 March 2017 was £414 million over-
recovered. In the UK, there was cumulative 
over-recovery of £82 million at 31 March 2017 
(2016: under-recovery of £133 million for 
continuing operations). In the US, cumulative 
timing over-recoveries at 31 March 2017 were 
£332 million (2016: £135 million over-recovery). 
A sizeable part of that balance will be 
returned to customers next year. 
In addition to the timing adjustments described 
above, as part of the RIIO price controls in  
the UK, outperformance against allowances  
as a result of the totex incentive mechanism, 
together with changes in output-related 
allowances included in the original price 
control, will almost always be adjusted in 
future revenue recoveries, typically starting 
in two years’ time. We are also recovering 
revenues in relation to certain costs incurred 
(for example pension contributions made)  
in prior years.
As required under accounting standards our 
current IFRS revenues and earnings include 
these amounts that relate to certain costs 
incurred in prior years or that will need to be 
repaid or recovered in future periods. Such 
adjustments will form an important part of the 
continuing difference between reported IFRS 
results and underlying economic performance 
based on our regulatory obligations. 
For our UK regulated businesses as a whole 
(excluding the UK Gas Distribution business), 
timing and regulated revenue adjustments 
totalled £408 million in the year (2015/16:  
£227 million). In the US, accumulated regulatory 
entitlements cover a range of different areas, 
with the most significant being environmental 
remediation and pension assets, as well as 
deferred storm costs. 
All regulatory entitlements are recoverable  
(or repayable) over different periods, which  
are agreed with the regulators to match the 
expected payment profile for the liabilities.  
As at 31 March 2017 , these extend until 2071.

training, remains important to us. You will find 
further details on this and additional awards  
on pages 30–31.
Operational performance
Our key performance indicators are reported  
in detail on pages 10–13. Our network reliability 
figures decreased slightly for Gas Transmission 
and Gas Distribution and are marginally  
below target this year. Electricity Transmission 
exceeded target. We continue to work on 
initiatives that aim to strengthen reliability, such 
as our asset health improvement work. For 
example, we have made good progress on  
the Feeder 9 gas pipeline replacement project. 
This involves boring a five kilometre tunnel 
beneath the River Humber to replace a section 
of gas pipeline. We are also developing new 
technologies to deliver work faster and increase 
network reliability. This includes using a 
malleable material that can be quickly installed 
to replace porcelain and polymer insulators 
where underground cables and overhead 
technology meet.
We have worked hard to find ways of operating 
more efficiently, so we can make our business 
more agile and competitive. For example,  
our Electricity Transmission business is now 
carrying out protection system replacements in 
less than half the time and for significantly lower 
cost. Within Gas Transmission, we initiated a 
project to upgrade some air compressor units, 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 1,228 
tonnes, and yielding long-term financial savings 
of £2.42 million.
We installed new gas control systems and 
made significant progress in installing new 
electricity control systems – these will help us 
meet the challenges of the changing energy 
world and, therefore, help us balance gas and 
electricity even more efficiently, keeping costs 
to consumers down.
We have used our regulatory innovation funding 
to develop ways to serve our customers more 
effectively, provide greater value, and shape the 
energy systems of the future. Through Project 
This year, sadly, safety has been brought 
into the sharpest focus for all of us.
A National Grid employee died following  
an incident at our East Claydon substation.  
We have undertaken a detailed internal 
investigation to establish exactly how and  
why this happened and to learn all possible 
lessons from it. We are continuing to  
co-operate with the Health and Safety 
Executive (HSE) as it carries out its 
independent investigation. We are also 
implementing a wide-ranging plan aimed at 
delivering safety improvements. Safety will 
continue to be a fundamental priority.
Looking now at organisational developments,  
this year, in line with our plans, we separated 
Gas Distribution into a stand-alone business 
and sold a majority interest. While preparing  
the business for sale and a new ownership 
structure, we maintained our focus on 
operational delivery, which resulted in 
continued solid performance for Gas 
Distribution. You can read more about the 
performance of this business on pages 20–22. 
In addition, the Board approved the second 
interconnector between the UK and France 
(IFA2), and we launched our new smart 
metering business. You can read more about 
these developments on pages 28–29.
As John has described in his review on pages 
6–7 , we issued a joint statement with BEIS  
and Ofgem regarding the enhanced role and 
greater separation of the ESO function. This is a 
sensible step forward, recognising the need for 
stability in the organisation during a period of 
rapid industry change, and the importance of 
bolstering the perceived independence of the 
ESO within the National Grid Group. 
We welcomed the conclusion of the mid-period 
review of the RIIO price control for Transmission 
which has given us certainty over our core 
revenues for the remaining RIIO period. Ofgem 
made some adjustments to allowances in both 
Electricity and Gas Transmission for outputs  
no longer needed in the RIIO period, and 
approved additional funding for new activities 
undertaken by the ESO.
We have also taken the decision to volunteer a 
deferral of £480 million of RIIO-T1 allowances. 
This deferral will enable better alignment of the 
allowances with the likely timing of spend and 
also help to lower bills in the near term.
Ofgem continues its work to enable onshore 
competition in electricity transmission. The 
majority of projects will not be contested, and 
National Grid Ventures is preparing to compete 
for any that are. We are also providing input 
and support into the ongoing development  
of the regulatory framework for competition. 
Earlier in 2017 , BEIS confirmed, through the 
‘Building our Industrial Strategy’ green paper, 
its intention to focus on developing technical 
education and skills. So, I was particularly 
delighted when we received an Outstanding 
grade from Ofsted, for the third time

CLoCC (Customer Low Cost Connections),  
for example, we’re challenging every aspect  
of the current Gas Transmission customer 
connections process. It aims to reduce the  
time to connect from three years to less than 
one, and reduce the cost from up to £2 million 
to significantly less than £1 million. It will also 
make it easier for non-traditional customers  
to connect to the NTS.
In November 2016, Ofgem confirmed funding 
for new Network Innovation Competition 
projects. We were successful in our bid with 
UK Power Networks on the ‘Power Potential’ 
project, which is a new £9.5 million market trial 
relating to voltage control. Also, National Grid 
will work with SP Energy Networks on a  
£19.9 million project that will help address 
some of the current and future challenges 
associated with the stability of Britain’s 
electricity transmission system as we  
transition to low-carbon energy. Details of  
our innovation projects are published at  
www.nationalgrid.com/innovation.
This year we made good progress on several 
major customer connection projects. We have 
improved the way we consult with all our 
stakeholders on major projects by simplifying 
how we present information – using clear 
language, more visual displays and virtual 
reality modelling – and by holding more events 
in a variety of easily accessible venues. We 
received positive feedback on our stakeholder 
engagement via our major project survey.
Although we exceeded our customer 
satisfaction targets, the figure for Electricity 
Transmission decreased slightly compared to 
last year. We are working hard across our UK 
business to place customers at the heart of  
our operations. We’re holding workshops for 
customers so we can gain a more in-depth 
understanding of their requirements. We have 
also started to examine each point of contact 
they have with our Company, so we can identify 
where we can improve our processes and  
our customers’ experience with us. We will  
be testing proposed improvements with 
customers before we implement them.
Shaping the future of energy
This year we launched a nationwide 
conversation on the future of gas to gather 
insights on the future role of gas and the  
gas transmission network. Gas will continue  
to be an important part of the mix in ensuring  
a secure energy supply at best value for 
consumers while Britain transitions to a 
low-carbon future. By engaging with 
stakeholders to understand what customers 
and end consumers value, this project will  
help us to identify optimal levels of future 
investment in the system and innovative ways 
to adapt our commercial arrangements.
We have collaborated with organisations that 
provide demand side flexibility to develop  
new electricity balancing services. Enhanced 
Frequency Response provides a sub-second 
response to fluctuations in system frequency 
and contracts have been awarded for over  
200 MW of battery storage. Our Demand  
Turn Up service was used for the first time 
during the summer, calling on organisations  
to make productive use of excess electricity 
in the system during this traditionally 
low-usage period.
We developed these balancing services in 
anticipation of fundamental changes in system 
operation. This year, for the first time, we saw 
periods where no coal-fired power stations 
generated electricity and periods where the 
Scottish network was operated successfully 
with no fossil fuel generation. This was against 
a backdrop of an increase in installed wind  
and solar generation of more than 10%.
We continue to provide input to Government 
and Ofgem on the development of future 
energy systems. This includes the call for 
evidence on ‘A Smart Flexible Energy System’, 
which examines how we can make the most  
of innovation and new technologies in 
designing the future electricity system. 
At a European level, we have worked closely 
with organisations such as ENTSO-E and 
ENTSOG (the European Network of 
Transmission System Operators – for electricity 
and gas respectively) to implement a number  
of framework changes in a way that works for 
Britain’s energy market and our customers.
Looking ahead
Our main focus in the UK is on the first of  
our three strategic priorities described on  
page 8, which is to drive a step change in  
core business performance. We have detailed 
plans in place to improve safety, our delivery  
for customers and our efficiency. We are 
continuing work in a number of priority  
areas, including the separation of the ESO.
I am proud to be the executive sponsor for this 
year’s UK employee chosen charity, which is 
Alzheimer’s Society. I look forward to providing 
an update on this in next year’s Report.
Switchgear replacement in Walpole
“ Replacing our switchgear in Walpole in the UK 
was a complex operation. It involved replacing  
23 circuits – some owned by National Grid, 
others by UK Power Networks and Western 
Power Distribution. It was originally installed  
in the 1960s, and updating it was important, 
helping make sure it continues to provide a 
reliable service.  
 
The replacements needed to be done in a 
specific order and involved an enormous 
amount of planning. When I took on 
responsibility for the project, we gradually 
developed a strong collaborative partnership 
approach with National Grid – concentrating on 
outcomes that were best for both companies. 
 
A weekly technical issues conference call was  
an important part of developing a team spirit. 
Although I created a technical issues log it was 
National Grid who picked this up and reviewed  
it each week on the conference call – a good 
example of National Grid’s responsiveness 
during this project.”
“The positive team ethic, 
which we developed 
together over a period of 
time, led to an extremely 
productive 2016.”
Geraint Hancock 
Project Manager at UK Power Networks
25 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report I believe that our focus on providing affordable, 
safe, reliable energy for all customers will make 
us a great operating company.
Safety
This year, the US business has seen a 5% 
reduction in the number of injuries requiring 
medical attention beyond first aid. Safety, 
Health and Environment (SHE) plans 
addressing current risks and injury trends 
were expanded to all managers. To increase 
transparency, under-performing teams were 
required to develop and communicate 
performance improvement plans to the 
executive leadership. Additional focus has  
been on reducing road traffic collisions through 
targeted training and communications.
We will continue to use SHE plans to  
focus on hazard elimination and road traffic  
collision reduction in 2017/18. We will also be 
implementing a mental well-being programme.
A clean energy company
Another factor in becoming a great operating 
company is becoming a clean energy company. 
This is nowhere more apparent than in Rhode 
Island where, in a first-in-the-nation milestone, 
we began delivering electricity generated by  
an offshore wind farm.
In December, after just 11 months of 
construction on ‘sea2shore: The Renewable 
Link project’, we began delivering electricity 
generated by the offshore Block Island Wind 
Farm to the electricity grid in Rhode Island  
and to customers. 
The Block Island Wind Farm is expected to 
supply approximately 30 MW of electricity,  
more than enough to meet Block Island’s entire 
current peak demand of 3-4 MW. The excess 
will be redirected to mainland Rhode Island  
via the submarine cable running between  
Block Island and the town of Narragansett. 
Another example is our new approach to 
testing large-scale solar. We are deliberately 
targeting installations that will provide additional 
energy to communities when they need it  
the most, vastly improving the value of solar 
projects to customers.
When I think about the past year, it’s the times 
spent visiting with customers that stand out.  
I feel fortunate because wherever I am in our 
service territory, I see solid evidence that we 
are making energy more affordable, safe, and 
reliable for all customers. We’re doing it through 
infrastructure investments, energy efficiency, 
and economic development. 
While energy can’t be free, our customers 
shouldn’t have to pay for waste. The work  
we’re doing in each of our jurisdictions shows 
how we’re eliminating waste, becoming a  
clean energy company, and future-proofing  
our business for generations to come.
Becoming a great operating company
We aspire to be a great operating company 
and one way is by making rate cases a priority. 
Our rate plans set the foundation for how we 
run our business and serve our customers  
and communities, focusing on safe, reliable, 
and affordable electricity and gas service.  
Our rate plans inform infrastructure investment, 
innovation and bill impact. 
After several years under the same rate 
structures in all three states we serve, we filed 
new rate cases last year. Like any business or 
municipality, our costs have risen, so we filed  
a rate proposal in Massachusetts to increase 
electricity distribution rates, and two proposals 
in downstate New York, to increase gas 
delivery rates in New York City and Long Island.
In September, we received an order from the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities 
(MADPU) that allows us to update our electricity 
distribution prices for the first time since 2010. 
The order lets us invest $249 million to update 
and strengthen the electricity system and 
recover the increasing costs of running  
our business, which include operation and 
maintenance expenses, property taxes  
and storm response.
In December, the NYPSC approved our rate 
proposals for KEDNY and KEDLI. The decision 
outlines a three-year rate plan for our 1.2 million 
gas customers in downstate New York, 
effective from 1 January 2017 . By the end of 
2019, we intend to invest $3 billion into our  
gas systems and replace 585 miles of ageing 
pipes in New York City and Long Island.
Our key objective for this year is to achieve  
a good outcome in our rate filing for Niagara 
Mohawk, which was filed in April 2017 . This 
represents 30% of our US rate base. 
The filing is the first full rate review for this  
utility since 2013 and will allow us to modernise 
the electric and gas networks to further 
enhance reliability and resiliency. It will also  
help us improve customer service, including 
programmes to assist vulnerable customers, 
promote economic growth and develop the 
energy infrastructure and technologies 
that support the demands of a modern 
energy system.

The Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus (BNMC) 
is an economic engine for the City of Buffalo 
and the region. A collection of hospitals,  
life science research and educational  
facilities, medical offices, and even a hotel,  
it encompasses 120 acres just north of  
the downtown business district. 
Together, we have formed a unique energy 
partnership, as BNMC’s pace of growth  
is matched by its demand for energy. We 
developed a comprehensive strategy to 
transform the campus into a global leader  
in energy innovation, and are looking  
to extend the innovation approach to 
surrounding neighbourhoods. It involves 
adopting new technologies and sustainable 
energy solutions – creating a blueprint for 
other large campus developments. 
Matt Enstice, President and CEO of BNMC, 
believes the campus is firmly on the map and 
that its remarkable energy journey would not 
have been possible without National Grid.

We received good news in July that New 
Hampshire regulators had approved 
construction of the Merrimack Valley Reliability 
Project (MVRP) – a 24.4 mile, 345 kV overhead 
transmission line that will run in existing utility 
rights-of-way between Londonderry, New 
Hampshire, and Tewksbury, Massachusetts. 
The MVRP addresses the concerns of New 
England’s independent system operator, 
ISO-New England, relating to ageing 
infrastructure and anticipated increases  
in electricity demand.
In January, we assumed primary responsibility 
for developing the Vermont Green Line (VGL) 
project. VGL is a proposed 400 MW, HVDC 
electricity transmission project, designed to 
unlock and deliver reliable and affordable 
renewable energy to New England.
In August, we withdrew our petition for capacity 
on the Access Northeast (ANE) gas pipeline, 
after the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that 
Massachusetts electric companies could not 
charge their customers for the cost of building 
natural gas pipelines in New England. 
ANE is designed to help secure New England’s 
clean energy future, ensure the reliability of the 
electricity system, and save customers more 
than $1 billion annually on their electricity bills. 
We continue to explore our options for a 
potential path forward with ANE and pursue  
a balanced portfolio of solutions to provide  
the clean, reliable, and secure energy our 
customers deserve.
Looking ahead
It’s been a busy year, living first-hand how  
we bring energy to life for our customers, 
stakeholders, and communities. And it’s what 
we’ll aim to do again next year. Our US priority 
initiatives support National Grid’s three strategic 
priorities – below are some examples.
We will find new ways of optimising our 
operational performance. We’ve started by 
enabling our supervisors to spend more time  
in the field, strengthening the connection to  
our customers, coaching and mentoring 
employees, and creating a learning and growth 
environment. Through a new gas enablement 
initiative, we are upgrading systems, improving 
processes and developing ways of working  
to serve our customers better. And, we are 
strengthening the energy supply chain that  
will take us to a decarbonised future.
Next, we will look for opportunities to grow  
our core business. We’ll do this through capital 
delivery and stakeholder engagement. 
And, we will future-proof our business for 
technology and value shifts. This means 
continuing the work we are doing with Grid 
Modernization in Massachusetts, with REV  
in New York and with the New Energy initiative 
in Rhode Island.
We presently have 21 MW of National  
Grid-owned solar built or under contract in 
Massachusetts, with plans to add 14 MW  
more. This includes the ability to build 7 MW  
of renewable energy storage, marking the first 
time an investor-owned utility in the region will 
build, own, and test renewable energy paired 
with storage.
We’re also starting to add battery storage 
technology to our large-scale solar installations, 
experimenting with the same technology you’d 
find in a Tesla all-electric vehicle, but more than 
10 times the size.
New York State’s Reforming the Energy Vision 
(REV) has enabled us to pursue innovative 
demonstration projects that address 
affordability and renewable energy. 
Traditional solar installations generate electricity 
only for one resident or business who can afford 
it. Through our Fruit Belt Neighborhood Solar 
project in Buffalo, we are bringing rooftop solar 
to an entire city section. We will aggregate the 
power from 100 neighbourhood solar 
installations and share the benefits with 
residents who otherwise might not be in  
a position to install on their own. 
Investing for the future
As I’ve described above, having the right rate 
plans in place allows us to invest. Below are 
some examples of how investments are helping 
us to future-proof our business for generations 
to come.
We are assisting with green transportation in 
Massachusetts. In January, we filed a proposal 
with MADPU to develop more than 1,200 
electric vehicle charging ports at 140 sites over 
a three-year period. Our proposal came on the

(Nemo Link) and Norway (North Sea Link) 
interconnectors in 2015, significant progress 
has been made on both projects.
Nemo Link, developed between National Grid 
and Elia, the Belgian transmission system 
operator, will connect Richborough in the  
UK and Herdersbrug in Belgium. The subsea 
cable will be 130 kilometres in length and  
have a capacity of 1 GW. Seabed surveys  
and construction work have already taken  
place on the project, which is planned  
to be operational in 2019.
North Sea Link (NSL) will connect Blyth in the 
UK and Kvilldal in Norway. Developed between 
National Grid and the Norwegian transmission 
system operator Statnett, NSL will be the 
longest subsea cable in the world at 720 
kilometres. The 1.4 GW link is expected to  
be operational by 2021. Construction started  
in Norway in 2016, while work in the UK will 
begin this year.
The Board also approved the 240 kilometre 
IFA2 interconnector in November 2016. 
Developed with RTE, the 1 GW subsea 
cable will connect Hampshire in the UK 
and Normandy in France. The link is expected 
to be operational in 2020, with construction 
starting in 2018.
Grain LNG
Grain LNG is one of three LNG importation 
facilities in the UK. It operates under long-term 
contracts with customers and provides 
importation services of ship berthing, temporary 
storage, ship reloading and re-gasification  
into the NTS.
National Grid Ventures
We have announced the creation  
of National Grid Ventures to drive 
growth outside of our regulated core  
in competitive markets across the US 
and the UK. The business will comprise 
all commercial operations in metering, 
LNG and electricity interconnectors, 
and focus on investment and future 
activities in emerging growth areas,  
a recent example of which is our 
partnership with Sunrun. 
In focus
Sunrun
In January, we formed a partnership 
with Sunrun, the largest dedicated 
provider of residential solar systems  
in the US. This partnership comprises  
a $100 million equity investment in 
Sunrun’s portfolio of approximately 
180 MW of residential solar systems 
across 18 states, including those 
in which we operate. National Grid 
Ventures will manage our interest 
in Sunrun. 
 “It’s a project that  
ticks the boxes –  
helping to meet 
renewable energy 
targets and  
keeping the lights  
on for customers.”
Nigel Williams 
Project Director, North Sea Link

Our road tanker loading facility was 
commissioned in November 2015. The new 
loading hub offers a more environmentally-
friendly alternative fuel and allows road tanker 
operators to load and transport LNG in bulk. 
Grain carried out its 1,000th road tanker  
reload in 2016.
Metering
National Grid Metering (NGM) provides 
installation and maintenance services to  
energy suppliers in the regulated market  
in Great Britain. It maintains an asset base  
of around 12.3 million domestic, industrial  
and commercial meters.
Customer satisfaction scores for NGM remain 
positive for domestic, industrial and commercial 
businesses. We continue to work with our 
customers on areas for improvement by 
exploring additional products and services  
so we can respond to the rapidly changing 
non-domestic sector.
National Grid Smart became operational in 
November 2016, supporting energy suppliers in 
fulfilling their UK smart meter roll-out obligations. 
National Grid Smart offers a variety of services 
from meter asset financing and customer 
relationship management through to installation 
and maintenance services, and has secured 
customer contracts over the last six months.  
By the end of 2020, around 53 million smart 
meters will be fitted in more than 30 million 
premises (households and businesses) across 
England, Scotland and Wales.
UK Property
National Grid Property is responsible for the 
management, clean-up and disposal of surplus 
sites in the UK, most of which are former gas 
works. During 2016/17 , we sold 19 sites and 
exchanged conditional contracts on a further 
14 future land sales. We entered a new phase of 
our joint venture, St William Homes LLP , starting 
construction of 955 new homes on our first site 
at Battersea. Our estate management, gas 
holder dismantling and contaminated land 
clean-up programmes continue to reduce 
operational risk across our portfolio.
US non-regulated businesses
Some of our US businesses are not subject to 
state or federal rate-making authority. These 
include interests in LNG road transportation, 
some gas transmission pipelines (our minority 
equity interests in these are not regulated)  
and certain commercial services relating to 
solar installations, fuel cells and other new 
technologies that are an important part of  
our future.
Stretching 720 kilometres under the 
North Sea, the €2 billion North Sea  
Link (NSL) will be the first electricity 
interconnector between the UK  
and Norway.
This joint project, between National  
Grid and Statnett, the Norwegian 
transmission operator, is the biggest  
of its kind in the world and will mean 
laying new cable over four years  
in challenging North Sea sub-sea 
conditions. We’ve developed a close 
working partnership with Statnett –  
a one-team approach – so we can  
make sure the project progresses safely, 
economically and to stringent deadlines. 
NSL will allow both countries to  
trade energy, and contribute to more 
production of renewable energy on  
both sides. This will give both countries 
a wider spread of electricity supply to 
turn to when they need it. 
North Sea Link
29 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report In the US, we completed the seventh year  
of our National Grid Engineering Pipeline 
programme, designed to inspire high school 
students to pursue an engineering education 
and career. To date, 304 promising students 
have participated.
We promoted STEM education and careers  
to more than 300 middle and high school 
students during our Engineering our Future 
initiative. We also partner with seven local 
community colleges to deliver programmes 
designed to produce future electricity  
line workers. 
We have further partnerships with the Center 
for Energy Workforce Development on its 
‘energy industry fundamentals’; and with 
Jefferson Community College, Con Edison  
and Fort Drum to establish the Troops to 
Energy Natural Gas Bootcamp. This six-week 
training programme helps soldiers exiting the 
military transition to civilian work – and will  
help meet the need for natural gas workers  
in the northeast. 
US work experience opportunities include 
summer internships – with some interns 
starting their journey into the energy industry 
through our Engineering Pipeline programme. 
Some students go on to join our Company 
through our graduate development programme 
or regular full-time opportunities. This past year, 
we have doubled our graduate development 
programme in the US and incorporated best 
practices from the UK, including adopting 
the UK’s online assessment and interview 
day processes. 
Promoting an inclusive and  
diverse workforce
Our inclusion and diversity activities include 
attraction and recruitment, development, 
leadership, role modelling and cultural change.
We aim to attract a diverse range of applicants, 
including under-represented groups. In the UK, 
our Women in National Grid Yearbook, which 
showcases a number of our UK female role 
models, is available to potential applicants so 
they can envisage a career with us. In the US, 
our priorities have included more veterans and 
women into ‘non-traditional’ roles, such as 
engineering and field technicians.
We recognise the value that a diverse 
workforce and an inclusive culture bring to  
our business. Our policy is that people with 
disabilities should have fair consideration for  
all vacancies against the requirements for the 
role. Where possible, we make reasonable 
adjustments in job design and provide 
appropriate training for existing employees  
who become disabled. We are committed to 
equal opportunity in recruitment, promotion 
and career development for all employees, 
including those with disabilities, and our policy 
recognises the right of all people to work in an 
environment that is free from discrimination.
Building skills and expertise to  
drive performance
Our sector is undergoing a period of massive 
transformation and uncertainty, so we are 
taking steps to help make sure our workforce 
capacity and capability remains flexible enough 
to deliver our strategic objectives. For example, 
we are using a new strategic workforce 
planning programme. This helps us determine 
where we could have future shortfalls in our 
workforce requirements across a range of 
possible scenarios over the next 10 years.  
It also helps us plan investment for recruitment 
and training, so we can make sure we always 
have the right skills in the right place at the  
right time. 
During 2016/17 , we have taken steps to 
improve our people’s capability, primarily 
across four main areas: leadership, contract 
management, stakeholder management and 
performance excellence. We are also setting 
the standards that we need to achieve in other 
capability areas, including data management, 
customer focus and commerciality.
Our Accelerated Development Programme  
is designed to enhance our leadership 
succession planning by developing the skills  
of employees seen as having potential to grow 
into our senior roles. During 2016/17 , 117 
participants started the 18-month programme.
Safeguarding the future 
We remain committed to helping address  
the significant skills challenge facing the 
engineering profession in the UK and US. 
In the UK, the 2015 Employer Skills Survey 
highlighted that 36% of hard-to-fill vacancies  
in the UK energy and utilities sector were due 
to a lack of proficient skills – well above the 
23% national average and notably higher  
than any other sector.
To help address this, we are involved in  
a number of initiatives. For example, our  
Chief Executive and specialists from our 
Academy are members of both the Council  
and Delivery Board of the Energy Utility Skills 
partnership and have supported the creation  
of the Energy and Utilities’ Workforce Renewal 
Skills Strategy 2020. This has involved 
collaborating with the wider sector to address 
priorities such as recruitment, investment in 
skills and targeting skills gaps. 
Our Academy offers residential work 
experience programmes for 100 young people 
annually, balanced 50/50 between boys and 
girls. We participate in the annual Big Bang Fair, 
which is designed to promote interest in STEM 
subjects and careers. 
During 2016/17 , 316 people have participated  
in our apprentice, engineering, student and 
graduate development programmes. In 
November 2016, our apprentice programme 
was ranked ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted for the  
third time consecutively.
Our people
If we are to achieve our strategic objectives, we need to make 
sure our employees have the right skills and capabilities.
Being good neighbours
 “When someone does a great job, the 
company they work for needs to know 
and that’s why I’m writing to you.”
Ron Lamb, Rhode Island
 “When we lost electricity in my 
neighbourhood in Rhode Island,  
I called to report the outage and  
then went to bed. I woke up at  
3:30am and noticed we still didn’t  
have electricity, so I went downstairs  
to check the National Grid website, 
which showed a crew was assigned 
and the estimated time electricity  
would be back on was 8:00am.  
I looked out of the front window,  
to find a large crew of workers,  
trucks and equipment. 
The thing that amazed me was this 
crew was going about doing their  
jobs making very little noise, I would 
never have known they were there.  
At 6:30am one of the guys came to  
tell us they’d repaired the cable and  
he brought me my newspaper, so  
I emailed to say thanks for being a  
good neighbour.”
30 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Strategic Report Our people
We have reviewed some of our leadership 
development programmes to place a stronger 
emphasis on inclusion and diversity. For 
example we have further developed our 
unconscious bias training and added it to  
our US supervisor development programme.
We believe leadership involvement is an 
important factor in building an inclusive culture. 
Many leaders are sponsors of our employee 
resource groups or mentees in our reverse 
mentoring programme. These activities provide 
our leaders with a greater understanding of the 
challenges facing our diverse workforce, and 
more confidence in discussing diversity in the 
organisation. Senior role models are being 
encouraged to show how they are bringing  
an inclusive culture to life.
Our Employee Resource Groups build 
awareness and understanding of inclusion  
and diversity throughout the organisation.  
They also provide valuable feedback and 
suggestions for improvements. For example,  
a proposal from our US Work-Life group led  
to the launch of our new Parental Bonding 
Policy, which provides enhanced support to 
employees after the birth or adoption of a child. 
In the UK, ‘One’, our ethnic minority group, 
organised Black History Month events to  
raise the profile of ethnic diversity.
Externally, we were recognised as an employer 
of choice in the US with an award from the 
Human Rights Campaign Foundation as one  
of the ‘best places to work’ for LGBT equality. 
In the UK, our EmployAbility scheme, which 
provides supported work experience for  
young people with learning disabilities, is 
recognised as best practice by the Business 
Disability Forum.
Following the UK Gender Pay Gap  
Information Regulations in the UK, approved  
by Parliament in February 2017 , we will be 
disclosing additional pay gap information 
during 2017 according to the approach  
outlined in the regulations.
The table opposite shows the breakdown in 
numbers of employees by gender at different 
levels of the organisation. We have included 
information relating to subsidiary directors,  
as this is required by the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013. We define ‘senior 
management’ as those managers who are  
at the same level, or one level below, our 
Executive Committee. It also includes those 
who are directors of subsidiaries, or who  
have responsibility for planning, directing  
or controlling the activities of the Group,  
or a strategically significant part of the Group, 
and are employees of the Group.

Health and well-being
During 2016/17 we have continued to  
promote the importance of well-being  
across our business. 
In the UK, we have a leading role in the 
Business in the Community Workwell 
campaign, which promotes mental well-being 
in the workplace. More than 900 people, 
including around 30 of our senior leaders,  
have attended our mental health first aid course 
to date. We also ran a diabetes awareness 
campaign in which employees could assess 
risk and learn more about diet and activity. 
Our activities in the US included a programme 
aimed at reducing soft tissue injuries through 
early intervention and prevention. Specialists 
are available to employees, providing on-site 
therapy services and advice. Other activities 
included a focus on chronic disease prevention 
through educational programmes and 
wellbeing initiatives. 
Building strong communities
We believe a strong community is good for the 
people who live there, good for our business 
and good for the wider economy. To further 
support the communities in which we work  
and live, we partner with charity organisations, 
and provide communities with one-off grants  
to support their social, economic and 
environmental development. We also empower 
our employees to pursue projects and their 
chosen causes through volunteering in their 
neighbourhoods. 
We support local schools and colleges  
with work experience opportunities and 
careers advice sessions. Our engineers help  
to bring STEM subjects to life. Last year, our 
community engagement and investment in 
education was valued at £12,364,891, with  
our UK employees giving over 18,400 hours  
of volunteering support and the US providing 
more than 22,900 hours of interactions with 
young people on STEM subjects.

Strategic Report Management reporting
During the year, a review was undertaken to make sure  
that the management reports to the Board were providing 
the information required to facilitate effective discussions 
and support decisions. Changes were also made to the 
timing and frequency of reporting to the Board. We believe 
that these changes will allow the Board to better monitor  
the performance of the Company and hold management  
to account.
Cyber security 
Cyber security continued to be a key area of focus for  
the Board this year. In addition to various updates from 
management, an external advisor delivered a Board training 
session designed to highlight the role of the Board in 
effective cyber security governance and provide an insight 
to the key challenges unique to the Company. The training 
also sought to equip Board members with examples  
of questions to ask in order to challenge management  
and make sure that the controls in place align with the 
Company’s risk appetite and culture. Management has 
recently developed a new cyber security management 
report and we will continue to monitor the performance  
and level of risk on a regular basis next year. 
Corporate Governance Reform
Corporate Governance developments continue to be 
subject to political and media scrutiny. This topic is kept 
under frequent review by your Board. In February, we 
responded to the Department of Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy’s consultation on Corporate Governance 
Reform. We also noted the Financial Reporting Council’s 
(FRC) intention to undertake a fundamental review of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and we will  
look to play an active role in the consultation process.
Board culture 
In my role as Chairman, I am responsible for promoting a 
culture of openness and debate by facilitating the effective 
contribution of all directors in meetings. We welcome the 
FRC’s report on ‘Corporate Culture and the Role of Boards’ 
and the re-emphasis on the importance of setting the 
standards at the top of the Company to permeate throughout 
the organisation. Culture formed the basis of this year’s  
Board performance evaluation. You can read more about  
the process and outcomes of the evaluation on page 38.
Board changes 
As previously announced, we will be saying goodbye to 
Ruth Kelly at the end of the 2017 AGM after nearly six years 
on the Board. Additionally, Steve Holliday stepped down 
from the Board in July last year and Nicola Shaw joined  
as Executive Director, UK the same month. More recently, 
we welcomed Pierre Dufour as a Non-executive Director  
in February. The Nominations Committee oversaw the 
rigorous selection process for Pierre’s appointment.

Dear Shareholders,
This last year has seen a significant focus on shaping  
the strategic direction of the Company and maximising  
value creation for our shareholders. The Board has  
overseen the sale of a majority interest in the Company’s  
UK Gas Distribution business, given approval for the IFA2 
interconnector, the formation of a partnership with Sunrun  
in the US and the work undertaken to support a more 
independent electricity system operator in the UK. 
We are mindful of value creation for shareholders as  
well as our responsibility to all stakeholders in our decision 
making. The Board always takes into consideration its 
fiduciary duties to the Company under the Companies Act 
2006, in particular the duty to promote the success of the 
business, when arriving at decisions that it believes are in 
the best interests of shareholders and the long-term future 
of the Company. 
The Board has also undertaken site visits in Buffalo, US, 
participated in three strategy sessions and received training 
on the Market Abuse Regulations that came into force in 
July 2016 as a result of EU legislation.

Looking back. Examples of Board focus during the year included: 
Areas of focus Commentary
The sale of the Gas 
Distribution business
The sale of the UK Gas Distribution business has been a 
feature on every agenda this year and the Board has had 
input into all the key decisions. The Board has received 
updates from the project management team on a range  
of topics, including the transfer of employees to the new, 
separate company, negotiations with the pension trustees 
and progress against the project timetable.
In September, an additional Board meeting was arranged 
to consider the first round bids and again in December to 
consider second round bids. The Board assessed the 
bids against a set of financial and non-financial criteria  
that evaluated the value of the bid but also the suitability  
of the bidder. Following discussion, the Board unanimously 
approved entering in to detailed discussions with the 
Consortium for the disposal of a majority interest in the 
UK Gas Distribution business and an announcement to  
the market was made. 
Discussions in March and April focused on the most 
appropriate way to return the proceeds of the sale to 
shareholders. 
The future of the  
System Operator
The Board has been kept involved with the future of  
the ESO ahead of the joint announcement with the 
government and Ofgem of a more independent system 
operator (ISO) earlier this year. Updates on progress were
received in April, June and November and the Board 
considered the proposed operator model and governance 
arrangements and whether the move to an ISO was in the 
interests of both customers and shareholders.
Cyber security Cyber security has remained high on the Board agenda 
this year. In December the Board participated in a 
two-hour cyber training session delivered by an industry 
expert. Moving forward the Board will also receive triannual 
cyber management reports to monitor this risk. 
The strategic 
partnership  
with Sunrun in the US
In line with the Code, the Board, and in particular, the 
Non-executive Directors should constructively challenge 
and help develop proposals on Strategy. Further to 
discussions in the July and September strategy sessions
around distributed energy resources, the Board 
considered a proposal to form a strategic partnership  
with Sunrun in December. The proposal was carefully 
considered and approved.
European Energy and 
the implications of 
Brexit
Following the outcome of the EU Referendum, the Board 
discussed the implications for the Company at its June 
meeting. The issue was also considered in relation to the 
final investment decision for the IFA2 interconnector 
project with respect to access to the Internal Energy 
Market and any adverse effect on import tariffs.
The Board will receive an update on a triannual basis  
so it can monitor the external political environment and 
take this into account in its strategic decision making. 
US regulatory  
rate case filings
The Board has received regular updates on the 
Company’s regulatory strategy and the progress of 
regulatory rate case filings in the US. Senior employees 
from the US jurisdictions have attended Board
meetings to provide an overview of the political and 
stakeholder context in each area and to discuss the 
opportunities and challenges that exist.
Mid-period review In August, Ofgem published initial proposals for a 
mid-period review into the price controls for RIIO-T1.  
The Board has been kept up to date with progress on the 
Company’s response to the consultation and also market
reaction to the review stages. The Board noted Ofgem’s 
final decision in February and will continue to monitor the 
Company’s engagement with the regulator.
Principal risks and 
viability
The Board is responsible for determining the nature  
and extent of the Company’s principal risks. The Board 
discussed the Group risk profile in September and  
March and gave consideration to whether there were  
any changes to existing risks, any emerging risks, and 
whether the agreed principal risks were consistent with 
the Company’s risk appetite levels. 
The impact of the principal risks was tested over the 
established assessment period of five years. The Board 
confirmed that it was satisfied with the assessment of  
the risks including the testing, management and mitigation. 
In May, the Audit Committee recommended the viability 
statement to the Board and it was approved.
Purpose, vision  
and strategy
In addition to time spent in Board meetings discussing 
strategy, the Board also participated in three separate 
strategy sessions this year. The first session focused  
on how the energy industry is evolving, the Company’s 
strategic priorities and proposals for developing the
Company’s purpose, vision and values. The final two 
sessions considered the Company’s capabilities and 
resources and also explored technology and innovation 
projects used internally and those available externally.
Site visits As referenced last year, the Board meeting in September 
2016 took place in Buffalo in the US. The Board members 
took this opportunity to explore the work undertaken by 
the Company in the local area such as the collaboration 
with the Buffalo Niagara Partnership and the Company’s 
role in providing infrastructure for the developments  
in the River Bend area. The visit also allowed the Board  
to interact with various local stakeholders and employees 
and gain further insight in to the day-to-day operations of 
the Company. 
Looking forward. The Board’s focus for next year is expected to include:
• continued regular reviews of safety activities; 
• UK and US operational business overviews; 
• preparation for RIIO T-2;
• continued detailed review of our strategy for growth and its financing; 
• the implications of Brexit on our activities;
• the future of the SO;
• the outcome of the US regulatory rate case filings, including upstate 
New York, Rhode Island and the Massachusetts gas companies; 
• cyber security updates; 
• innovation; 
• the 2017 UK Winter Outlook;
• results and follow-up on the action planning from the Board and 
committee evaluation; 
• updates on UK and US corporate governance and other policy 
developments; and
• results of the 2017 employee engagement survey.

The committee structure, reporting and communication

respective terms of reference, available on our website. 
Committee agendas and schedules of items to be 
discussed at future meetings are prepared in accordance 
with the terms of reference of each committee and take 
account of other topical and ad-hoc matters. 
In addition to the vertical lines of reporting, the committees 
communicate and work together where required. For 
example, the Finance Committee and the Audit Committee 
both review the going concern assumptions and provide 
recommendations to the Board.
At Board committee meetings, items are discussed and,  
as appropriate, endorsed, approved or recommended to 
the Board, by the committee. Following Board committee 
meetings, the chairman of each committee provides the 
Board with a summary of the main decisions and discussion 
points so the non-committee members are kept up to date 
with the work undertaken by each Board committee. 
Below the Board committees are a number of management 
committees, including the Executive Committee. You can 
read more about some of the management committees, 
including the membership and operation of the Executive 
Committee, on page 49. 
Reports from each of the Board committees together with 
details of their activities during the year are set out on the 
following pages.
Corporate Governance 
Board composition
The successful delivery of our strategy depends upon 
attracting and retaining the right talent. This starts with 
having a high-quality Board. Balance is an important 
requirement for the composition of the Board, not only  
in terms of the number of Executive and Non-executive 
Directors, but also in terms of expertise, diversity and 
backgrounds. 
While traditional diversity criteria such as gender and 
ethnicity are important, we also value diversity of skills, 
experience, knowledge and thinking styles. You can  
read about our Board diversity policy in the Nominations 
Committee report on page 48. 
This year we welcomed Nicola Shaw on to the Board as 
Executive Director, UK on 1 July 2016 and Pierre Dufour  
as a Non-executive Director on 16 February 2017 . Steve 
Holliday stepped down from the Board with effect from  
22 July 2016. Ruth Kelly will step down from the Board  
at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM. 
Our Board and its committees 
The Board delegates authority to its Board committees

Board and committee membership and attendance 
The table below sets out the Board and committee 
attendance during the year to 31 March 2017 . Attendance  
is shown as the number of meetings attended out of the 
total number of meetings possible for the individual Director 
during the year. 
If any Directors are unable to attend a meeting, they are 
encouraged to communicate their opinions and comments 
on the matters to be considered via the Chairman of the 
Board or the relevant committee chairman. Instances of 
non-attendance during the year were considered and 
determined as being reasonable in each case due to  
the individual circumstances.
All instances of Board and committee meeting non-
attendances throughout the year were due to ad-hoc 
meetings being arranged at short notice meaning members 
were unable to attend due to prior engagements.
The Board has determined that Mark Williamson, Chairman 
of the Audit Committee, has recent and relevant financial 
experience; is a suitably qualified audit committee financial 
expert within the meaning of the SEC requirements; and is 
independent within the meaning of the New York Stock 
Exchange listing rules.

Directors’ induction programme
Following new appointments to the Board, the Chairman, 
Chief Executive and Group General Counsel & Company 
Secretary arrange a comprehensive induction programme. 
The programme is tailored based on experience and 
background and the requirements of the role. 
Following Nicola Shaw’s appointment to the Board in July 
2016 she has undertaken a thorough tailored induction 
which has included a number of site visits both in the UK 
and the US, along with meetings with all of the Company’s 
Directors and senior executives. 
Pierre Dufour was appointed to the Board in February 2017 
and is undergoing a structured induction which will include 
meetings with senior leaders from across the Company.  
He will also undertake visits to some of our operational sites 
to help build his understanding of the Company. Pierre’s 
induction is ongoing and will be reviewed by the Chairman 
to ensure that it is stretching and appropriate. Consideration 
is given to committee appointments and where relevant, 
tailored training can be undertaken. 
Director development and training 
As our internal and external business environment changes, it 
is important to make sure that Directors’ skills and knowledge 
are refreshed and updated regularly. The Chairman is 
responsible for the ongoing development of all Directors. 
To strengthen the Directors’ knowledge and understanding 
of the Company, Board meetings regularly include updates 
and briefings on specific aspects of the Company’s 
activities. The Board has participated in a cyber training 
session, see page 32 for more details. The Board  
also undertook training on the new EU Market Abuse 
Regulations which came into force in July 2016 to  
ensure that they understood the new obligations  
and reporting requirements. 
Updates on corporate governance and regulatory matters 
are also provided at Board meetings along with details  
of training and development opportunities available to  
our Directors. Additionally, the Non-executive Directors  
are expected to visit at least one operational site annually.  
In September, the Board visited one of our US sites in  
Buffalo, New York to gain an insight into one area of  
our US business operations.
Investor engagement 
We believe it is important to maintain effective channels  
of communication with our debt and equity institutional 
investors and individual shareholders. This helps us to 
understand their views about the Company and allows  
us to make sure they are provided with timely and 
appropriate information on our strategy, performance, 
objectives, financing and other developments. 
Institutional investors 
We carry out a comprehensive engagement programme  
for institutional investors and research analysts, providing 
the opportunity for our current and potential investors to 
meet with executive and operational management.
This includes:
• meetings, presentations and webinars; 
• attendance at investor conferences across the world; 
• holding road shows in major investor centres,  
mainly in the UK, Europe and the US; and 
• offering the opportunity for individual  
stewardship meetings.
In the last year, our engagement programme has focused 
on clarifying our Group growth expectations and updating 
investors on the progress of our rate case filings in the US 
and the proposed sale of the majority interest in our UK Gas

Corporate Governance Board and committee evaluation
This was the second year of our three-year performance 
cycle, as shown in the diagram below. We undertook an 
internal Board performance evaluation, led by Sir Peter, and 
focused on the Company’s culture, as well as the role of the 
Board in shaping, monitoring and overseeing the culture.

review
Board members completed a structured questionnaire with 
a series of open questions designed to assess how the 
Board effectively sets the ‘tone from the top’ and determines 
how effectively this is cascaded throughout the Company. 
The questions asked covered the following areas:
• clarity of the Company’s purpose and values;
• effectiveness of the Board’s oversight, shaping and 
monitoring of the Company’s culture;
• the balance and structure of Board governance;
• the ability of the Board to hold management accountable 
for operating the business day-to-day in alignment with 
the Company’s purpose and values;
• how the right tone in the boardroom can be set to 
reinforce the Company’s purpose and culture and to 
empower Board members to raise concerns; and
• ascertaining how the Company’s reward structure 
encourages behaviours consistent with the  
Company’s culture.
The Chairman then met with each Board member to 
discuss their responses to the questionnaire as well as  
their individual performance throughout the year.
The outcome of the Board evaluation was reported to the 
Board in April. The Board discussed the findings of this 
year’s evaluation and agreed a number of actions for the 
coming year as set out opposite. 
The Board also discussed its performance generally and 
agreed that the Board had worked well together as a unit, 
discharged its duties and responsibilities effectively, and 
worked effectively with the Board committees.
Committee evaluation
An evaluation of committee performance was also conducted 
by the chairman of each of the Board committees. The 
process broadly followed that conducted by the Board with 
each committee using their own set of open questions. 
Actions were identified as appropriate and agreement reached 
that the committees continued to operate effectively. Progress 
against the action plans will be monitored throughout the year 
by the respective committee and the Board.
Actions for 2017/18

Distribution business. We have also been explaining to 
investors how we expect the Company to continue to 
perform against its regulatory contracts in both the UK  
and US.
In September 2016 we arranged a seminar in London to 
provide institutional investors and research analysts with  
an opportunity to meet some of the leaders of businesses 
within our Other Activities such as Property, Grain LNG, 
Interconnectors and Metering, in addition to a presentation 
on US business development. The event was led by  
Andrew Bonfield and designed to provide an understanding 
of the current performance of this portfolio of businesses 
and their future outlook. A copy of the presentation and 
associated materials are available in the Investors section  
of our website. 
In addition to these engagement activities, we will also be 
holding a stewardship meeting in July this year. The event  
is designed to update major investors on our activities over 
the year and future plans. It will also provide the opportunity 
for attendees to ask questions and meet members of  
the Board and for our Non-executive Directors to further 
develop their understanding of our shareholders’ views  
and concerns.
The Board receives regular feedback on investor 
perceptions and opinions about the Company. Specialist 
advisors and the Director of Investor Relations provide 
updates on market sentiment. 
Additionally, each year, the Board receives the results of  
an independent audit of investor perceptions. Interviews  
are carried out with investors to establish their views  
on the performance of the business and management.  
The findings and recommendations of the audit are  
then discussed by the Board. 
Debt investors 
Over the last year senior group treasury representatives 
have met debt investors in Europe, Canada and the US  
to discuss various topics such as our full-year results  
and upcoming US rate case filings. We also met with  
debt investors in London, Edinburgh, Amsterdam and  
Paris in September 2016 to market the bonds issued  
for the new Gas Distribution company.
We also communicated with our debt investors through 
regular announcements and the debt investor section of  
our website which contains bond information, credit ratings 
and materials relating to the subsidiary year-end reports, 
and information about our long-term debt maturity profile  
so investors can see our future refinancing needs. 
Individual shareholders 
Engagement with individual shareholders, who represent 
more than 96% of the total number of shareholders on  
our share register, is led by the Group General Counsel  
& Company Secretary. 
Shareholders are invited to learn more about the Company 
through our shareholder networking programme. The 
programme includes visits to UK operational sites and 
presentations by senior managers and employees over  
two days. UK resident shareholders can apply to take part 
in this programme via the Investors section of our website.

The Chief Executive also continues to review Board pre-read materials to ensure strategic 
themes are clearly articulated.
A review was also undertaken of the format of the Board agenda to identify any areas for 
improvements. Following review, the Board agenda format was confirmed as fit for purpose.
Strategic 
proposals
The Chairman will discuss with the 
Non-executive Directors the strategy 
items on the draft agenda for the  
next following meeting and articulate 
the views from the Non-executive 
Directors as to what is required at  
the Board meeting including any 
questions that need answering.
Responsibility: Chairman
In order to identify key focus areas for strategic discussions, the Non-executive Directors have 
been invited to review the items proposed for discussion at the Board Strategy session to be 
held in July 2017 . As noted above, the Chairman, Chief Executive and Group General Counsel  
& Company Secretary review the Board’s forward business schedule on a bi-annual basis to 
ensure the Board is considering the right strategic topics.
Executive Committee members attend Board dinners in order to achieve alignment between  
the Board and the Executive management team on strategic matters. 
Risk  
and risk 
management
Integrate risk more effectively into 
strategy development and planning.
Responsibility: Chief Executive/
Group General Counsel & Company 
Secretary/Executive Directors
Executive Directors present the risks and mitigations relating to their own areas at Board 
meetings as appropriate.
It is intended that a Company Risk Framework will be finalised and implemented during the 
2017/18 financial year. Additionally, an externally facilitated review of risk appetite is to be 
undertaken during 2017/18 to identify how risk appetite can better inform decision-making  
in the future and how it is integrated into Board and committee reporting.
Board 
composition
Continue to consider the skills  
and capabilities needed on  
the Board for executing the 
Company’s future strategy.
Responsibility: Chairman
The Nominations Committee aims to keep the Board fresh with a diversity of skill sets. 
Therefore, during the year a formal process was undertaken by the Nominations Committee  
to find an appropriate addition to the Board of a new Non-executive Director, to strengthen  
the experience and skills on the Board and its committees. Pierre Dufour was appointed to  
the Board with effect from 16 February 2017 .
A detailed review of the Board skills matrix will be undertaken during the 2017/18 financial year 
to assess the skills and capabilities required on the Board in the future.
People Review whether there is  
enough focus on people  
on the Board agenda.
Responsibility: Chief Executive/
Group General Counsel &  
Company Secretary
The Nominations Committee undertook a review of Executive and senior succession planning 
and talent during the year.
In addition, senior leaders in the Company’s management team have been invited to Board 
dinners, providing the Board with further opportunities to spend more time with the Company’s 
management team.
• Develop a method for the Board to track culture  
within National Grid 
Responsibility: Executive Directors/Human Resources
• Assist with the establishment of a desired culture 
throughout the National Grid businesses 
Responsibility: Executive Directors/Group General 
Counsel & Company Secretary
Individual performance
As noted above, the Chairman met with each director 
individually to discuss their contribution and performance 
over the year. 
As part of our annual evaluation process, Mark Williamson, 
as Senior Independent Director, led a review of the 
Chairman’s performance. The Non-executive Directors, 
with input from the Executive Directors, assessed his ability  
to fulfil his role as Chairman. It was concluded that the 
Chairman showed effective leadership of the Board and  
his actions continued to influence the Board and wider 
organisation. Mark Williamson discussed the feedback  
and development opportunities with the Chairman.
Progress against actions from 2015/16
Progress against the actions from last year’s externally 
facilitated evaluation has been monitored by the Group 
General Counsel & Company Secretary and the Chairman 
throughout the year and an update on progress was 
provided at the April 2017 Board meeting. A commentary  
against each action from last year’s review is set out  
below. Progress against the actions from last year’s  
Board Committee evaluation has also been monitored 
throughout the year.
39 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Corporate Governance In June 2016 and January 2017 , the Committee met in 
addition to its usual meetings to receive in-depth updates 
from the US finance team on progress against the initiatives 
underpinning the US finance team transformation plan and 
the improvements in the US financial controls environment. 
Our US finance team have also demonstrated its ability to 
support the wider business as part of the rate case filings  
for Massachusetts, New York and Long Island, alongside 
business-as-usual activities.
Auditor transition 
In May 2017 , PwC completed their final audit for the Group 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 . We thank PwC for all 
their hard work as our auditors since the inception of 
National Grid plc. 
Deloitte will take office as the Company’s auditors for the 
year ending 31 March 2018, subject to shareholder approval 
at the 2017 AGM. We look forward to working with Deloitte 
and building constructive working relationships. Further 
details of the auditor transition are set out on page 44.
Looking forward
The Committee will be receiving regular updates, as 
appropriate, on the Group finance team’s preparations  
for and the impact of the new accounting standards which  
will become effective in the next couple of years – IFRS 9 
financial instruments, IFRS 15 revenue from contracts  
and IFRS 16 leases. 
The Committee in action
Interim accounts
In order to declare the special dividend following the sale  
of UK Gas Distribution, management was required to 
demonstrate that sufficient realised profits were available 
for distribution as at 31 March 2017 in the books of the 
parent company. As the balance sheet of the Company  
as at 31 March 2016 showed insufficient reserves, a set  
of unaudited interim accounts for National Grid plc were 
prepared on a stand-alone basis for the year to 31 March 
2017 specifically for this purpose, as required by UK 
company law. 
The Committee met in April 2017 to consider the draft 
interim accounts, and received a paper from management 
and advisors summarising the approach to reserves 
management, the level of profits available for distribution 
after these activities, and the key process and assurance 
activities undertaken to ensure that the interim accounts 
were free from material misstatement. Following due 
consideration, the Committee recommended the interim 
accounts for approval by the Board.

The Company confirms that it complied with the provisions 
of the Competition and Markets Authority’s Order for the 
financial year under review.
Audit Committee
Review of the year 
This report provides an insight into the work of the Audit 
Committee over the year in relation to the UK and US 
businesses, the external auditors, and our role overseeing 
the Company’s internal assurance functions, as well as the 
significant issues relating to the financial statements which 
were debated by the Committee during the year. 
UK business review 
A substantial proportion of the Committee’s time has been 
spent in relation to the sale of a majority interest in the UK 
Gas Distribution business. 
The accounting for the transaction is complex and 
judgemental, and it follows that the reporting of the Group’s 
financial performance was more complex than usual,  
with the presentation of the UK Gas Distribution results as 
discontinued operations in the current and prior periods, 
additional subtotals in the income statement, and revised 
and additional disclosure notes, amongst other things. 
The Committee has been focused on the impact on  
financial processes and systems as well as the staff within  
the UK finance function. In November, the Committee 
received a detailed update and briefing on the risks and 
responses identified by the UK finance team in relation  
to the business separation activities required in order  
to prepare the business for the sale. 
The Committee has received regular updates on the 
progress of the sale and has challenged and monitored 
management’s judgements and estimates in relation to  
the financial statements. You can read more about this  
on page 43. 
The Committee met in addition to its usual meetings in  
April to consider the interim accounts of National Grid plc, 
which were required in support of the declaration of the 
special dividend. The Committee’s role in this part of the 
sale of the UK Gas Distribution business is set out in  
the Committee in action box set out above right. 
US business review
We have seen a steady year of progress and improvements 
in the financial control environment in the US. 
Following the transition to a new jurisdictionally focused 
operating model in 2016 and supported by a strengthened 
US finance leadership team, the US business has continued 
to enhance the processes and controls within the financial 
controls environment and has successfully delivered the  
US finance transformation plan.

40 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Corporate Governance Audit Committee
Examples of Committee focus during the year included:
Areas of focus Commentary
Viability statement The viability statement requires the Board to confirm that it has assessed the Company’s principal risks and viability.  
At its September meeting as part of its bi-annual review of risk, the Board considered the Company’s principal risks. 
The impact of these risks over the assessment period was tested to determine whether or not there was a reasonable 
expectation that the Company would be able to continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due during that 
period. This review then informed the wording of the viability statement in the Annual Report and Accounts.
The Committee considered the viability statement to be included in the Annual Report and Accounts at its meetings  
in March and May 2017 and recommended the statement to the Board for approval at its May meeting. You can find 
the viability statement on page 19. 
Fair, balanced and 
understandable
The Committee considered the requirement of the Code to ensure that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable in the context of the applicable accounting standards and confirmed this 
view to the Board. 
Financial reporting The Committee monitors the integrity of the Group’s financial information and other formal documents relating to its 
financial performance and makes appropriate recommendations to the Board before publication. 
An important factor in the integrity of financial statements is making sure that suitable and compliant accounting 
policies are adopted and applied consistently on a year-on-year basis and across the Group. 
In May 2016, the Committee approved a framework for exceptional items which sets out the methodology for 
determining whether items of income and expense should be deemed exceptional. This did not represent a change  
in accounting policy but codified the approach adopted by management in the past. The framework sets out a 
three-stage process: consideration of the nature of the event, financial materiality, and the facts and circumstances. 
This framework was used by management to consider the presentation of exceptional items in relation to the UK  
Gas Distribution business sale transaction costs, environmental provisions and UK deferred tax credit. 
External auditor 
independence and 
performance
Sarbanes-Oxley legislation (SOX) and the FRC’s UK Corporate Governance Code supported by its Guidance on  
Audit Committees set out the requirements and expectations for the role of audit committees in actively monitoring  
and reviewing the external auditors’ independence. 
In May 2016, the Committee considered an assessment by the Corporate Audit team of controls in place to ensure that 
our external auditor, PwC, is independent from National Grid. The controls testing did not find any significant items that 
would impact auditor objectivity and independence. 
The Committee also considered a revised Code for Recruitment of Employees from the External Auditor (Recruitment 
Code) which exists to help maintain the independence of the external audit. The revisions proposed strengthened the 
Recruitment Code by clarifying which roles within the Company could be considered financial reporting oversight  
roles. The proposed changes were consistent with the final draft of the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard 2016 issued  
in April 2016. 
The Committee also considered and approved amendments to the Company’s policy on the provision of non-audit 
services by the auditor to take account of the implementation of the EU Audit Regulation and Directive on non-audit 
services. See page 43 for more details. 
Further details of the transition to Deloitte and the process undertaken to ensure that they were considered to be 
independent from 1 January 2017 are included on page 44. 
Going concern 
statement
At its May meeting, the Committee considered the Group’s short-term liquidity and capital and considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the financial statements. The Board considered and approved  
the Committee’s recommendation at its May meeting. The Company’s going concern statement is set out on  
page 92, note 1A.
Disclosure Committee 
reports
When reviewing the half- and full-year announcements, the Committee considers reports of the Disclosure Committee. 
The Disclosure Committee also reports the results of its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure 
controls to the Audit Committee. See page 49 for more information on the role of the Disclosure Committee.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
2002 testing and 
attestations
The Committee receives regular updates on the status of testing and considers the impact of deficiencies reported in 
the past year. See page 18 for the Company’s statement on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
In September, alongside the SOX compliance update, the Committee received an update on the launch of a SOX 
refresh programme which would review the overall Group SOX approach following significant business change with  
the sale of the UK Gas Distribution business.
The Committee also received updates on the SOX control findings in March and May in support of the year-end 
accounts, as well as an update on the SOX refresh programme. 
41 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Corporate Governance Areas of focus Commentary
Corporate Audit The Committee received regular controls updates from the Corporate Audit team. Management actions on audit 
findings have continued to be a focus at Executive meetings resulting in greater visibility of audit findings, increased 
ownership of actions and greater engagement by senior management. 
In accordance with best practice, the Corporate Audit Charter was reviewed against the Institute of Internal Auditors 
(IIA) international standards and the IIA model charter. No changes to the charter were proposed.
See page 44 for more details on the work of the Corporate Audit team including the outcome of the recent review  
by the IIA. 
Risk management The Committee has been delegated responsibility by the Board for monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of our 
risk management processes. During the year, the Committee received reports to be considered by the Board on risk 
process developments to enable the Committee to keep fully appraised of changes in the risk profile of the Company 
and to allow it to monitor the management of risk throughout the year. 
The Committee continues to monitor the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control processes during 
the year and reports to the Board on the outcome of its annual review which covers all material controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls. 
You can read more about our risk management process and the review of effectiveness on pages 15 to 18. Details  
of our internal control systems, including those relating to the financial reporting process, can be found on pages 18 
and 180. 
Cyber security 
risk management
An update on the status of our cyber security risk management process and cyber security strategy was presented  
to the Committee in September 2016 and March 2017 . The Committee noted that following an in-depth assessment  
of National Grid’s cyber security maturity, a revised cyber security strategy was developed. 
The Committee also noted that during the development of the new strategy, Corporate Audit continued to provide 
assurance in relation to cyber security risk through delivery of a balanced portfolio of planned audits. 
Compliance 
management
The Committee receives bi-annual reports on compliance with external legal obligations and regulatory commitments. 
These reports also updated the Committee on progress against the compliance improvement programme initiated  
in 2015. The Committee noted that significant progress had been made in strengthening the existing control framework 
with increased engagement and responsibility for actions improving our overall compliance performance. 
The Committee also requested that a review of the assurance framework against best practice be undertaken to 
identify if there were additional areas of assurance that needed to be covered. The benchmarking exercise indicated 
that there were no significant areas not covered by the framework and that the approach was consistent with the peer 
group reviewed. Improvements identified would be incorporated into the assurance programme to help strengthen  
our assurance framework. 
Business separation 
compliance
National Grid Gas’s Gas Transportation Licences require business separation between UK Gas Transmission and  
UK Gas Distribution to prevent any unfair advantage being obtained by our UK Gas Distribution business over other 
independent distribution networks. Business separation compliance reports are submitted to the Committee twice  
a year, in May and November. 
The Committee noted that the Business Separation Compliance Officer was actively engaged in the sale of the  
UK Gas Distribution business with regard to the review of business separation licence obligations. 
Business conduct The Committee receives a bi-annual ethics and business conduct report so that it can monitor the management  
and mitigation of business conduct issues as part of the wider control framework. 
The Committee reviews the confidential reporting procedures and whistleblowing procedures annually to make sure 
that complaints are treated confidentially and that a proportionate, independent investigation is carried out in all cases.
The Committee also receives annual reports on the Company’s anti-bribery procedures and reviewed their adequacy. 
Committee 
performance  
evaluation
The Committee received updates on the action plan agreed following the 2015/16 Committee performance evaluation 
at its November 2016 and May 2017 meetings and noted the progress made against the actions identified. 
The 2016/17 Board and committee evaluation was conducted internally, see page 38 for more details. The 
recommended actions for the Audit Committee were considered by the Committee in May and an action plan agreed.
Examples of Committee focus during the year included:
Corporate Governance continued
42 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Corporate Governance Audit Committee
The retained interest
The Committee considered the judgements 
presented by management as regards the  
‘fair value’ of the retained interest, of the UK  
Gas Distribution business. The Committee 
concurred with management that on the basis 
of evidence of recent and historic comparable 
transactions, a discount to the price paid by the 
Consortium for control should be reflected in  
the determination of the fair value of the retained 
interest. Refer to note 15 for further details.
The Committee also considered the  
accounting implications of the Further 
Acquisition Agreement relating to the option  
for the Consortium to acquire a further 14% 
interest in the UK Gas Distribution business, 
and the determination as to whether or not the 
contract contains an embedded derivative.
US financial control environment
The Committee has continued to devote a 
significant amount of time to reviewing 
progress made by management to remediate 
control deficiencies identified during 2015/16,  
in the US financial controls environment. 
The Committee received updates on progress 
made by management against the measures 
taken and timetable to remediate the US 
financial control deficiencies. At year end  
the Committee was pleased to note that the 
majority of the control deficiencies identified 
had been remediated. Management are 
confident that the remaining control 
weaknesses in relation to plant accounting  
will be remediated in 2017/18. 
As part of plant accounting, the Committee 
received regular updates in respect of a  
project to close out aged work orders 
addressing an issue identified during the 
2015/16 external audit. 
The Committee also received updates on the 
status of the US finance organisational design 
programme. Corporate Audit provided support 
during the transition to the new organisational 
design to ensure that the integrity of the US 
control environment was maintained. 
External audit 
The Committee is responsible for overseeing 
relations with the external auditors, including 
the proposed external audit plan, the approval 
of fees, and makes recommendations to the 
Board on their appointment or reappointment. 
Details of total remuneration paid to auditors for 
the year, including audit services, audit-related 
services and other non-audit services, can be 
found in note 3(e) of the consolidated financial 
statements on page 100. 
Auditor appointment 
Consistent with prior years, an annual review 
was conducted by the Committee of the level 
and make-up of the external audit and non-audit 
fees and the effectiveness, independence and 
objectivity of PwC. Following this process, the 
Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity of PwC and 
recommended to the Board their reappointment 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 at the  
2016 AGM. 
Significant issues
The most significant issues the Committee 
considered in relation to the financial 
statements concerned the accounting 
implications of the sale of a majority interest  
in the UK Gas Distribution business and the  
US financial control environment, including 
plant accounting. 
In addition to commentary in these areas,  
the independent auditors’ report (pages 75  
to 82) also includes other areas of focus, 
including the accuracy and valuation of treasury 
derivative transactions, accounting for net 
pension obligations, revenue recognition,  
and valuation of environmental provisions 
which were also considered by the  
Committee during the year.
Accounting for the sale of the UK Gas 
Distribution business
The key accounting implications subject  
to detailed consideration by the Committee 
comprised:
• the point at which the business met the 
criteria to be classified as ‘held for sale’;
• the classification of costs between 
continuing and discontinued operations, 
(including exceptional and financing costs); 
and
• the accounting applied in respect of the 
retained 39% interest in the new separate 
business, including:
 – the classification of the retained interest 
as an associate, reflecting significant 
influence exercised by the Group 
through its equity interest; and
 – the assessment of the fair value of  
the retained interest on acquisition.
‘Held for sale’
IFRS 5 states that an asset is considered  
as held for sale provided two conditions are 
met: it must be available for immediate sale  
in its present condition and its sale must be  
highly probable. 
The Committee challenged management on 
the identification of the point at which the UK 
Gas Distribution business sale transaction 
became highly probable. Having considered 
evidence concerning the receipt and evaluation 
of bids as well as progress on the business 
separation activities, the Committee concurred 
with management’s judgement that the sale 
was not deemed to be highly probable until 
shortly prior to the announcement on 8 
December 2016. The resulting impact on 
depreciation and amortisation is set out in  
note 9. 
Classification of costs
In relation to the classification of costs between 
continuing and discontinued operations, the 
Committee carefully considered management’s 
approach to the contractual and other 
arrangements put in place at the point of the 
business separation for the purposes of 
determining an appropriate allocation of costs 
throughout 2016/17 and prior periods. The 
Committee concurred with management’s 
analysis, and in particular the judgements 
described in note 9 concerning interest costs 
(including liability costs).
Following the audit tender, the Committee has 
recommended to the Board the appointment  
of Deloitte as auditors for the year ending  
31 March 2018. A resolution to appoint  
Deloitte and giving authority to the Directors  
to determine their remuneration will be 
submitted to shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Auditor independence and objectivity 
The independence of the external auditors  
is essential to the provision of an objective 
opinion on the true and fair view presented in 
the financial statements. Auditor independence 
and objectivity is safeguarded by a number  
of control measures, including: 
• limiting the nature and value of non-audit 
services performed by the external auditors; 
• ensuring that employees of the external 
auditors who have worked on the audit in 
the past one year (two years for a partner  
of the audit team) are not appointed to roles 
with financial reporting oversight within the 
Company in line with our internal code; 
• monitoring the changes in legislation related 
to auditor objectivity and independence to 
help ensure we remain compliant; 
• providing a business conduct helpline that 
employees can use to report any concerns, 
including those relating to the relationships 
between Company personnel and the 
external auditor; 
• the rotation of the lead engagement  
partner at least every five years (a new  
lead engagement partner was appointed  
for the 2015/16 financial year); 
• PwC’s internal independence rules and 
processes, which have been designed to 
exceed professional standards and focus 
on both personal independence and scope 
of services; 
• independent reporting lines from PwC to 
the Committee and the opportunity to meet 
with the Committee privately; and 
• an annual review by the Committee of the 
structures, policies and practices in place to 
make sure the external auditors’ objectivity 
and independence is maintained. 
During the year, the Committee considered  
and approved changes to the Company’s 
policy on the provision of non-audit services  
by the auditor to take account of the 
implementation of the EU Audit Regulation  
and Directive on non-audit services. The key 
changes made were to update the list of 
prohibited services, principally in respect of tax, 
and the introduction of a cap on the financial 
value of non-audit services to 70% of the 
average annual audit fees paid in the last three 
financial years. The cap will be implemented 
once we have three years of history of fees 
charged by Deloitte, and so will be effective  
for the financial year ending in March 2021.
43 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Corporate Governance Audit quality 
To maintain audit quality and provide comfort 
on the integrity of financial reporting, the 
Committee reviews and challenges the 
proposed external audit plan, including its 
scope and materiality prior to approval, to  
make sure that PwC has identified all key  
risks and developed robust audit procedures 
and communication plans. 
The Committee also considers PwC’s 
response to accounting, financial control and 
audit issues as they arise, and meets with them 
at least annually without management present, 
providing the external auditors with the 
opportunity to raise any matters in confidence. 
External audit transition arrangements
As described above, subject to shareholder 
approval of their appointment at the 2017 AGM, 
Deloitte will succeed PwC as the Company’s 
auditor for the year ending 31 March 2018. 
Auditor independence
The Company and Deloitte planned for  
the firm to be independent in line with SEC 
requirements with effect from 1 January 2017 . 
This date was chosen as the most appropriate 
date for Deloitte to start to ‘shadow’ the 
activities of PwC in the 2016/17 year-end audit. 
In order for Deloitte to be considered 
independent with effect from 1 January 2017 , 
non-audit services provided by the firm were 
curtailed in a staged and orderly fashion over 
the period between November 2015 and 
December 2016. Regular updates were 
provided to the Audit Committee on the status 
of ongoing non-audit services throughout this 
period and all services ongoing as at 1 January 
2017 were re-approved by the Committee as  
at that date. With effect from this date, all 
non-audit services are subject to the same 
protocols and policies as those applied in 
respect of PwC.
In addition to the SEC requirements,  
Deloitte became subject to EU independence 
requirements with effect from 1 April 2017 , 
being the first day of the year ending  
31 March 2018, adding certain further 
restrictions on non-audit services  
(principally taxation).
Other audit transition activities
The Committee welcomed Deloitte LLP  
to the January, March, April and May 2017 
Committee meetings to shadow PwC as  
part of the transition process. Deloitte were 
also granted access to management and  
key documents in the UK and US to assist  
in their transition activities.
Non-audit services provided by the  
external auditors
In accordance with our policy, non-audit 
services provided by the external auditors 
above a threshold of £50,000 require  
approval in advance by the Committee. 
The Committee has delegated approval of 
services under this threshold to the Finance 
Director. A list of all approved non-audit work 
requests is presented to the Committee 
quarterly, as well as annually in aggregate  
to ensure the Committee is aware of all 
non-audit services provided.
Additionally, the Committee receives quarterly 
reports from management on non-audit 
services and other consultants’ fees to  
monitor the types of services being provided 
and fees incurred. 
Approval for the provision of non-audit services 
is given on the basis the service will not 
compromise independence and is a natural 
extension of the audit, or if there are overriding 
business or efficiency reasons making the 
external auditors most suited to provide the 
service. Certain services are prohibited from 
being performed by the external auditors, as 
required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. 
Total non-audit services provided by PwC 
during the year ended 31 March 2017 were 
£17 .3 million (2016: £8.9 million), representing 
87% (2016: 63%) of total audit and audit-related 
fees (see note 3(e)). £10 million of the non-audit 
fees related to work performed by PwC relating 
to the disposal of the UK Gas Distribution 
business, including a vendor due diligence 
assignment, and work on the separation  
of the business and its support functions.
Both these projects were discussed by the 
Committee and approved in advance by the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee prior to  
work commencing. The Committee concluded 
that the appointment of PwC would allow the 
Group to realise significant benefit through the 
utilisation of PwC’s accumulated knowledge 
concerning the key financial reporting and IT 
systems, as well as their knowledge of the Gas 
Distribution business and the UK operations 
more generally.
Total audit and audit-related fees include the 
statutory fee and fees paid to PwC for other 
services that the external auditors are required 
to perform, such as regulatory audits and  
SOX attestation. Non-audit fees represent all 
other services provided by PwC not included  
in the above. 
Non-audit services provided by PwC in the 
year included tax compliance services in 
territories other than the US (£0.4 million), the 
significant majority of which related to the UK. 
The Committee considered that tax 
compliance services were most efficiently 
provided by the external auditors, as much of 
the information used in preparing computations 
and returns was derived from audited financial 
information. In order to maintain the external 
auditors’ independence and objectivity, 
management reviewed and considered PwC’s 
findings and PwC did not make any decisions 
on behalf of management.
Non-audit services provided by Deloitte 
As set out above, Deloitte became subject  
to the Company’s policy on the provision  
of non-audit services with effect from  
1 January 2017 . 
Internal (corporate) audit 
The corporate audit function provides 
independent, objective assurance to the Audit, 
Safety, Environment and Health and Executive 
Committees on whether our existing control 
and governance frameworks are operating 
effectively in order to meet our strategic 
objectives. Assurance work is conducted and 
managed in accordance with the IIA 
international standards for the Professional 
Practice of Internal Auditing and Code of 
Ethics. Following its most recent review, 
Corporate Audit was given the highest rating – 
Generally Conforms by the IIA on Standards 
and Code of Ethics.
To keep the Committee informed of trends 
identified from the assurance work and to 
update on progress against the corporate audit 
plan, the Head of Corporate Audit reports to 
the Committee at least twice each year. These 
reports present information on specific audits, 
as appropriate, summarise common control 
themes arising from the work of the team  
and update on progress with implementing 
management actions. 
In order to meet the objectives set out in the 
Corporate Audit Charter, audits of varying 
types and scopes are conducted as part of  
the annual corporate audit plan. The audit plan 
is based on a combination of risk-based and 
cyclical reviews, together with a small amount 
of work that is mandated, typically by US 
regulators. The audit plan is agile and regularly 
reviewed to prioritise audits relevant to the 
needs of and to reflect evolving risks and 
changes to the business. The audit plan is  
now aligned between General Audit, Safety, 
Environment and Health and Information 
Systems audits allowing us to manage global 
and integrated audit opportunities. The audit 
plan was also reviewed and updated to  
reflect the audits attributed to the UK Gas 
Distribution business. 
Inputs to the audit plan include principal risks, 
risk registers, corporate priorities, external 
research of emerging risks and trends, and 
discussions with senior management to make 
sure the plan aligns with the Committee and 
Company’s view of risk. The audit plan is 
considered and approved by the Committee 
annually and progress against the plan is 
monitored throughout the year. 
The Committee is responsible for the 
appointment and removal of the Head  
of Corporate Audit. The Committee met  
privately with the Head of Corporate Audit  
during the year.

44 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Corporate Governance Finance Committee
Therese Esperdy
Committee chairman
Looking forward to 2017/18, we will continue to focus on the 
financing strategy for the reshaped Group following the sale 
of the majority interest in the UK Gas Distribution business. 
This, together with funding the ongoing capex programme  
in our US business remain the major focus areas for the 
treasury team. 
We will also assess, with our tax team, the potential impact 
of anticipated US tax policy changes, as more details 
continue to emerge from the new administration in the  
US following the Presidential election. 
Examples of other key matters the Committee 
considered during the year included:
 
• funding requirements and financing for the  
business plan; 
• setting and reviewing treasury policies; 
• counterparty risk policy;
• foreign exchange and interest rate risk management;
• treasury performance updates; 
• UK and US tax updates; 
• update on US energy procurement activities and 
electricity and gas trading activities in the UK; 
• the triennial valuation of the National Grid Electricity 
Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme;
• the draft going concern statement for the half- and 
full-year results prior to consideration by the Board; and
• update on US post-retirement employee benefits plans.
The Committee in action – 
the sale of the UK Gas Distribution business
2016/17 saw a range of work streams across the 
financing and related aspects of the transaction.  
The Committee reviewed the planning for these, 
assessing various different options before overseeing  
the execution and approving related policy changes.
The Committee oversaw activities across a range  
of workstreams including:
• restructuring the existing UK debt portfolio;
• financing the new standalone UK Gas Distribution 
business prior to sale;
• sectionalisation of the National Grid UK  
Pension Scheme;
• establishing a new treasury team and banking  
group and implementing associated systems  
and committed lending facilities;
• establishing initial credit ratings for the new business 
and the retained Group;
• liaison with HMRC around the detailed transaction 
steps; and
• options for implementing a structure to enable 
additional debt leverage through the sale process.
On completion of the sale, the Committee reviewed  
the proposals for investing the proceeds of the sale (in 
excess of £5 billion) ensuring the Group’s counterparty 
risk policies were appropriately managed.
Therese Esperdy
Committee chairman
Finance Committee
Review of the year
The financing and other related aspects of the Company’s 
sale of a majority interest in the UK Gas Distribution 
business remained a key area of focus for the Committee 
throughout 2016/17 . The Committee also considered the 
impact of the sale on our retained business, including 
financing, insurance arrangements, liquidity management 
and pension funding. 
The Committee oversaw several major aspects of the Gas 
Distribution sale process, including the sectionalisation of 
the National Grid UK Pension Scheme. This was a complex 
project that ran alongside the sale process, ensuring the 
continued protection of all scheme members’ benefits.  
See the Committee in action box opposite for more  
details of the Committee’s involvement.
During 2016/17 , the Committee was briefed on funding 
activities in our US business, specifically the long-term  
bond issuance programme for our downstate New York  
gas businesses and our Massachusetts electricity  
operations business. The year saw the initial debt financing  
of the Company’s New York Transco joint venture. The 
completion of our first two Export Credit arrangements  
in relation to our new joint venture for our Norwegian 
interconnector represented another major achievement  
for the treasury team.
During the year, the Committee monitored the execution  
of management’s readiness plans in relation to the  
potential short-term market impacts of the Brexit 
referendum. The eventual market movements were  
well within our contingency planning, although the 
ever-changing macroeconomic and political environment 
remains a key focus for the Committee.
The Committee assessed the appropriateness of National 
Grid’s balance sheet hedging policy to determine whether 
the current policy continued to effectively manage the 
foreign exchange translation risk associated with our US 
investments. Following review, the Committee approved 
changes to the policy and agreed an implementation plan 
for the agreed policy change.
We continued to keep the Company’s insurance strategy 
under review. Specific focus areas during 2016/17  
included the impact of the UK Gas Distribution business 
sale on our ongoing captive insurance programme together  
with a review of management’s proposals to consider  
the placement of cyber insurance across National Grid’s 
operations. Additionally, the Committee considered the 
Company’s approach to the insuring of construction  
risks of interconnector projects, a particularly bespoke 
insurance market.

Corporate Governance Paul Golby
Committee chairman
across the UK and US gas and electricity businesses, 
focusing in particular on asset data risk and its ongoing 
review of asset data records. 
We have also continued to monitor the Company’s process 
safety management system. We received updates on the 
measures being taken to address levels of risk for major 
hazard assets, including key US LNG plants. The 
Committee also received updates on the Company’s US 
gas pipeline safety compliance and its interface with the 
NYPSC on the subject of new gas pipeline safety rules. 
In terms of the environment, we have continued to  
monitor our strategy and approach to sustainability, as well 
as the Company’s external reporting of its environmental 
performance, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In 
particular, we reviewed the impact of the sale of the UK Gas 
Distribution business on the Company’s greenhouse gas 
emissions and its ability to meet its target of reducing 
emissions by 80% by 2050 against a revised 1990 baseline. 
Examples of other matters the Committee  
reviewed during the year included:
• ongoing monitoring of safety performance and 
significant incidents in the UK and US; 
• the expected impact of the UK Gas Distribution  
business sale on the Company’s safety and 
environmental performance; 
• compliance and risk reporting for safety, environment 
and health matters;
• the Company’s approach to electromagnetic fields and 
its alignment with scientific research on the subject; 
• sickness absence levels and trends for both UK and US 
businesses; and
• employee assistance programmes for mental well-being 
and their take up as well as soft tissue injury prevention 
programmes. 
The Committee in action – 
safety processes and procedures 
In its monitoring of major safety incidents and work on 
process safety management systems, the Committee has 
spent time looking at the processes and procedures that 
are in place and how these are implemented and applied 
in order to promote a strong safety culture across the 
whole of the Company. 
When significant incidents occur, the Committee closely 
monitors management’s analysis of the causes, as well  
as reviewing the steps taken by the Company to promote 
awareness by both employees and contractors and to 
address the risk of recurrence of incidents, including safety 
‘stand downs’, briefings and training.
It is essential that all employees and contractors should  
be able to understand and apply instructions as a matter 
of routine. Where processes and procedures become  
too long and complex, there may be a risk that they are 
misapplied, circumvented or ignored. In other cases, there 
may be a lack of risk and control awareness because 
processes and procedures are inadequately designed or 
controlled. The Company’s internal audit function, and its 
safety specialists, report regularly to the Committee on 
their findings and on work being undertaken to address 
these issues.
Paul Golby
Committee chairman
Safety, Environment and  
Health Committee
Review of the year
In February, we welcomed Pierre Dufour to the Safety, 
Environment and Health Committee. He brings considerable 
experience as an engineer and in safety, industrial risk 
management and operations. Last month Andrew Bonfield 
stepped down from the Committee, having been a member 
for three years. His contribution to the Committee, as well as 
his chairmanship of the Engineering Assurance Committee 
(EAC), has been extensive.
Over the year, the Committee has seen the Company’s 
safety performance remain in line with last year with a  
Group employee lost time injury frequency rate of 0.10. 
However, this good performance must be viewed in  
the context of the death in the UK last November of an 
employee working in our Electricity Transmission business, 
as referred to in the Chief Executive’s review on page 6.  
The Committee has spent time with the business seeking  
to understand the circumstances and causes of this fatality 
as well as the actions taken by the Company to ensure 
lessons are learnt. It will continue to receive updates as 
investigations proceed. 
Road traffic collisions have reduced in both the UK and US 
following an increased programme of training for employees, 
although the level is still above target in the US. Cable strikes 
(a UK Gas Distribution measure) have reduced. 
The US business is currently focusing on switching  
errors, which remain at an unsatisfactory level. An external 
consultant is currently reviewing relevant incidents from  
a human factors perspective and will be advising on  
ways to improve our training, processes and procedures  
in this respect. 
More widely, the Committee has spent considerable time 
reviewing the safety culture of the Company. While this is 
generally very good, in some parts of the business the 
analysis of significant incidents has shown instances of 
processes not being followed or inappropriate behaviours. 
The Committee monitors the steps taken by the Company 
following significant incidents, including looking at its 
processes and procedures and how they are being applied 
(see the Committee in action box opposite).
The Committee continues to receive reports from the EAC. 
In particular, we reviewed the progress made in succession 
planning for the Company’s engineering employee 
population as well as the career progression and additional 
specialist qualification options and incentives available for 
engineers within the Company. We were pleased to note the 
appointment of chief engineers for both gas and electricity, 
with Group-wide remits. The EAC also reported to the 
Committee on peer reviews and sharing of best practice

Sir Peter Gershon
Committee chairman
The Committee in action – Non-executive search 
and appointment process 
During the year a formal process was undertaken by  
the Committee to find an appropriate new Non-executive 
Director, to strengthen the experience and skills on the 
Board and its Committees. 
• The Nominations Committee appointed The Zygos 
Partnership as the search consultancy. A Non-
executive Director profile was reviewed and agreed  
by the Committee.
• Zygos conducted initial searches and produced  
a potential list of candidates which was reduced  
to a shortlist against the agreed profile.
• Zygos narrowed its shortlist and interviews were 
undertaken with the Chairman, Chief Executive  
and other members of the Board. 
• References for the potential candidates were circulated 
to the Committee and a meeting was held in October 
2016 where the Chairman invited feedback from  
the Committee on the search and interview process. 
• The Committee agreed a preferred candidate  
and made a recommendation to the Board in  
February 2017 .
• The Board approved the recommendation and  
Pierre Dufour was appointed to the Board with  
effect from 16 February 2017 .
Search and appointment process to the
Executive Committee
The Committee was also involved in the recruitment process 
for the newly created Executive Committee position to lead 
the new business, National Grid Ventures. The search and 
appointment process for this position was as follows:
• the Nominations Committee appointed Heidrick and 
Struggles as the search consultancy. With input from the 
Committee a role and person specification was agreed; 
• Heidrick and Struggles conducted initial searches for 
potential candidates, with both internal and external 
candidates being put forward for the role; 
• a series of interviews were undertaken by the Chairman, 
Chief Executive and other members of the Board; 
• the Committee considered the outcomes from  
the interviews and selected candidates for further 
consideration; 
• final interviews with the candidates were carried  
out by John Pettigrew and members of the Executive 
Committee and Board; 
• the Committee recommended Badar Khan for 
appointment to the Executive Committee; and 
• the Board approved the appointment and Badar Khan 
joined the Company as a member of the Executive 
Committee on 1 April 2017 .
Examples of other matters the Committee 
considered during the year included: 
• review of the Chairman’s performance, led by  
Mark Williamson, the Senior Independent Director; 
• review of Director independence and potential conflicts; 
and
• review of Executive Committee succession. 
Sir Peter Gershon
Committee Chairman
Nominations Committee
Review of the year
Once again succession planning has been the main area  
of focus for the Committee during the year. It is important  
for the Board to anticipate and prepare for the future and to 
ensure that the skills, experience and knowledge at director 
and senior management level reflect the changing demands 
of the business. The process of building a strong and 
effective Board also requires a good balance of continuity 
and refreshment and the Committee has borne this in mind 
in its deliberations throughout the year. 
Succession planning
We recognise that an active Nominations Committee is  
key to promoting effective board succession and we are 
committed to continuing to regularly review succession 
planning policy, taking into account the FRC’s guidance  
to ensure that our policy is aligned to Company strategy, 
both current and in the future.
Following a thorough and rigorous process, Pierre Dufour 
was appointed as a Non-executive Director to the Board  
on 16 February 2017 and Badar Khan was appointed to  
the Executive Committee on 1 April 2017; see opposite for 
more details on these search and appointment processes.
Composition 
Balance and fit in terms of skills, knowledge and experience 
are important considerations in recruitment to the Board. 
Therefore, part of the selection process for Board 
appointments is for the Committee to review the existing 
skills and experience of the Board and consider the current 
composition against the needs of the business and the 
requirements of the new position. External benchmarking  
of skills and a review of potential external candidates is  
also undertaken by external search and assessment 
consultancies to make sure that the Committee is fully 
briefed when making its considerations. 
The Committee also takes into account the need to make 
sure there is appropriate diversity on the Board, including 
diversity in thinking styles. The Committee has considered 
the external reviews on diversity published during the year, 
namely the Parker Review and the Hampton-Alexander 
Review. Further details on the Company’s approach to 
diversity are set out overleaf. 
Board and committee membership 
Following the changes in Board membership, the 
composition of the committees was also reviewed. As  
a result, our new Non-executive Director, Pierre Dufour 
joined the Safety, Environment and Health Committee, 
Remuneration Committee and Nominations Committee 
upon appointment. Following Pierre’s appointment, Andrew 
Bonfield stepped down from the Safety, Environment and 
Health Committee on 21 April 2017 and Paul Golby stepped 
down from the Remuneration Committee on 16 May 2017 .
47 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Corporate Governance Board diversity 
National Grid supports the creation of an inclusive and 
diverse culture which we believe supports the attraction  
and retention of talented people, improves effectiveness, 
delivers superior performance and enhances the success  
of the Company. 
Following the publication of the Parker Review ‘Beyond One 
by ‘21’’ and the Hampton-Alexander Report the Committee 
considered the recommendations of these reports and 
approved updates to the Board diversity policy and the 
associated objectives. 
We have previously reported against eight objectives,  
set out below, to measure our progress against our Board 
diversity policy. At its April 2017 meeting the Committee 
reviewed these objectives and agreed that the majority of 
these should no longer be objectives but instead be the 
minimum standard required to support our Board diversity 
policy. As a result, only one of the original eight objectives 
was retained and updated and a new objective was added 
to address the recommendations of the Parker Review and 
the Hampton-Alexander Report, as set out below. 
The Board diversity policy reflects all of the previous 
objectives and the Committee will continue to follow the 
requirements of the old objectives including only engaging 
executive search firms who have signed up to the Voluntary 
Code of Conduct on Gender Diversity, adopting best 
practice as appropriate, reviewing progress against  
the objectives and the policy annually and reporting  
on progress in this report. 
Our Board diversity policy continues to promote an inclusive 
and diverse culture and reaffirms our aspiration to meet  
and exceed the recommended voluntary target of 33%  
of Board positions being held by women by 2020. This 
objective, as set out below, has been updated following the 
recommendations of the Hampton-Alexander Report, to 
extend this voluntary target of 33% women by 2020 to the 
Executive Committee and direct reports to this committee. 
The Parker Review, published in November 2016, 
recommended every FTSE 100 board should have at  
least one director from a non-white ethnic minority by  
2021. The Committee has reflected this recommendation  
in a new objective as set out below. 
Examples of the initiatives to promote and support  
inclusion and diversity throughout our Company are  
set out on page 30. 
Objectives Progress
Current
The Board aspires to meet the target of 33% of Board  
and Committee positions, and direct reports to the

our Board and 22% women on our Executive Committee 
and 30% women direct reports to the Executive Committee. 
The number of women in senior management positions  
and throughout the organisation is set out on page 31.
The Board aspires to meet the Parker Review target  
for FTSE 100 boards to have at least one director from  
a non-white ethnic minority by 2021. 
Objective met. We currently have one Director from a 
non-white ethnic minority on the Board.

have signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct  
on Gender Diversity. 
Objective met. Heidrick and Struggles and The Zygos 
Partnership are signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct 
on Gender Diversity. 
Where appropriate, we will assist with the development

and other senior management. 
Objective met. See page 30 for further details. 
Where appropriate, we will continue to adopt best  
practice in response to the Davies Review. 
Objective met. Ongoing as appropriate.

We will continue to make key diversity data, both about the 
Board and our wider employee population, available in the 
Annual Report and Accounts.
Objective met. Ongoing.
Corporate Governance continued
48 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Corporate Governance Management committees
The nine Committee members have a broad range of  
skills and expertise, which are updated through training  
and development. Some members also hold external 
non-executive directorships, giving them valuable board 
experience. The Committee officially met 12 times this  
year, but the members interact much more regularly.  
Those members of the Committee who are not Directors 
regularly attend Board and committee meetings for specific 
agenda items. This means that knowledge is shared and  
all members are kept up to date with business activities  
and developments.
Disclosure Committee 
The role of the Disclosure Committee is to assist the  
Chief Executive and the Finance Director in fulfilling their 
responsibility for overseeing the accuracy and timeliness  
of disclosures made – whether in connection with our 
presentations to analysts, financial reporting obligations,  
or other material stock exchange announcements,  
including the disclosure of price sensitive information. 
This year the Committee met to consider the 
announcements of the full- and half-year results and 
reported on relevant matters to the Audit Committee.  
It also met in December to consider the announcement  
of the preferred bidder for the sale of a majority interest  
in the UK Gas Distribution business and again at the end  
of March to review the announcement of the completion  
of the sale and the option for the sale of a further 14%  
equity interest in the business.
The Committee reports the results of its evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls to the 
Audit Committee. 
The Committee is chaired by the Finance Director and  
its members are the Group General Counsel & Company 
Secretary, the Group Tax & Treasury Director, the Group 
Financial Controller, the Director of Investor Relations, the 
Head of Corporate Audit and the Deputy Group General 
Counsel, with other attendees as appropriate.
Management committees
To help make sure we allocate time and expertise 
appropriately, the Company has a number of management 
committees, which include the Executive Committee, and 
Disclosure Committee. These committees provide reports, 
where relevant, to the appointing committee in line with  
our governance framework on the responsibilities they  
have been delegated. See page 36 for management 
committee reporting lines. 
Executive Committee 
Led by the Chief Executive, the Executive Committee 
oversees the safety, operational and financial performance 
of the Company. It is responsible for making day-to-day 
management and operational decisions it considers 
necessary to safeguard the interests of the Company and  
to further the strategy, business objectives and targets 
established by the Board. It approves expenditure and  
other financial commitments within its authority levels  
and discusses, formulates and approves proposals  
to be considered by the Board.
The committee in action –  
National Grid Smart (NGS)
Following the decision last year to invest in the NGS 
business, the Committee reviewed the investment 
opportunities of the business, and considered a number  
of matters impacting the opportunities, including the 
Government’s support for the smart metering roll-out  
in the UK, the associated roll-out challenges faced by the 
industry and the alignment of the NGS business to wider 
distributed energy opportunities.
The Committee challenged the NGS team on the  
business mobilisation progress, the strength of the 
customer pipeline, the service proposition, rental pricing 
and the operational capability required to make the 
business a success.
Acknowledging the competitive nature of the market,  
the Committee endorsed a governance framework that 
would enable NGS to respond quickly to future contracting 
opportunities, manage the performance of the business, 
and allow the Committee to monitor the performance of 
NGS as appropriate.

Corporate Governance Statement of compliance with the UK  
Corporate Governance Code
The UK Listing Rules require that listed 
companies must include in their annual  
report a statement of whether the Company 
has complied with all the relevant provisions  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the Code). The Code was published in 
September 2014 and updated in 2016 to  
reflect forthcoming legislation on audit 
committees and auditor appointments,  
and is available in full at www.frc.org.uk. 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , the Board 
considers that it has complied in full with the 
provisions of the 2014 Code. Our statement  
of compliance opposite explains the main 
aspects of the Company’s governance 
structure to give a greater understanding of  
how the Company has applied the principles 
and complied with the provisions in the Code.  
The Corporate Governance report also explains 
compliance with the Disclosure Guidance  
and Transparency Sourcebook. The index  
on page 53 sets out where to find each of  
the disclosures required in the Directors’  
Report in respect of Listing Rule 9.8.4. 
 
A. Leadership
A.1 The role of the Board
Our Board is collectively responsible for the 
effective oversight of the Company and its 
businesses. It also determines the strategic 
direction, business plan, objectives, principal 
risks, viability of the Company and governance 
structure that will help achieve the long-term 
success of the Company and deliver 
sustainable shareholder value.
The Board sets the risk appetite and principal 
risks for the Company and takes the lead in 
areas such as safeguarding the reputation of 
the Company and its financial policy, as well  
as making sure we maintain a sound system  
of internal control and risk management (see 
pages 15 to 18). 
There is a clear schedule of matters reserved 
for the Board and a schedule of delegation, 
which were both reviewed and updated in 
January 2017 . The schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board is available on our 
website, together with other governance 
documentation.
A.2 A clear division of responsibilities
The Board supports the separation of the roles 
of the Chairman and Chief Executive. The key 
responsibilities are clearly documented and 
reviewed when appropriate. The Chairman 
manages and leads the Board. The Chief 
Executive is responsible for the executive 
leadership and day-to-day management of  
the Company and the Group’s businesses,  
to ensure the delivery of the strategy agreed  
by the Board.
A.3 Role of the Chairman
The Chairman, who was independent on 
appointment, is responsible for the leadership 
and management of the Board and its 
governance. He makes sure the Board is 
effective in its role by promoting a culture of 
openness and debate, facilitating the effective 
contribution of all Directors and helping to 
maintain constructive relations between 
Executive and Non-executive Directors.  
The Chairman sets the Board’s agenda  
making sure consideration is given to the  
main challenges and opportunities facing the 
Company, and adequate time is available to 
discuss all items, including strategic issues.
A.4 Role of the Non-executive 
Directors
Independent of management, our 
Non-executive Directors bring diverse  
skills and experience, vital to constructive 
challenge and debate. Exclusively,  
they form the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees, and their  
views are actively sought when  
developing proposals on strategy.
Our Senior Independent Director acts  
as a sounding board for the Chairman  
and serves as an intermediary for the  
other Directors, as well as shareholders 
when required. 
Around each of the nine scheduled Board 
meetings, the Chairman held meetings  
with the Non-executive Directors without  
the Executive Directors present. These 
meetings were not held around the two 
ad-hoc Board meetings in September  
and December to consider the bids  
in relation to the sale of the UK Gas 
Distribution business.

manages and leads the Board. The Chief 
Executive is responsible for the executive 
leadership and day-to-day management of  
the Company and the Group’s businesses,  
to ensure the delivery of the strategy agreed  
by the Board.
A.3 Role of the Chairman
The Chairman, who was independent on 
appointment, is responsible for the leadership 
and management of the Board and its 
governance. He makes sure the Board is 
effective in its role by promoting a culture of 
openness and debate, facilitating the effective 
contribution of all Directors and helping to 
maintain constructive relations between 
Executive and Non-executive Directors.  
The Chairman sets the Board’s agenda  
making sure consideration is given to the  
main challenges and opportunities facing the 
Company, and adequate time is available to 
discuss all items, including strategic issues.
A.4 Role of the Non-executive 
Directors
Independent of management, our 
Non-executive Directors bring diverse  
skills and experience, vital to constructive 
challenge and debate. Exclusively,  
they form the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees, and their  
views are actively sought when  
developing proposals on strategy.
Our Senior Independent Director acts  
as a sounding board for the Chairman  
and serves as an intermediary for the  
other Directors, as well as shareholders 
when required. 
Around each of the nine scheduled Board 
meetings, the Chairman held meetings  
with the Non-executive Directors without  
the Executive Directors present. These 
meetings were not held around the two 
ad-hoc Board meetings in September  
and December to consider the bids  
in relation to the sale of the UK Gas 
Distribution business.
Statement of compliance
B. Effectiveness
B.1 The composition of the Board
The Board believes it operates effectively  
with an appropriate balance of independent 
Non-executive and Executive Directors who 
have the right balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the 
Company. Details of our Board, their individual 
biographies and committee membership  
are set out on pages 34 and 35. Board and 
committee attendance during the year to  
31 March 2017 is set out on page 37 . The 
independence of the Non-executive Directors 
is considered at least annually along with their 
character, judgement, commitment and 
performance on the Board and relevant 
committees. The Board took into consideration 
the Code and indicators of potential non-
independence, including length of service.  
At year end, all of the Non-executive Directors, 
with the exception of the Chairman, whose 
independence is only determined on 
appointment, have been determined by  
the Board to be independent. 
B.2 Appointments to the Board
The Nominations Committee, which comprises 
the Chairman and Non-executive Directors, 
leads the process for Board appointments and 
makes recommendations to the Board. Further 
details of appointment processes for Nicola 
Shaw and Pierre Dufour, succession planning 
and the role of the Nominations Committee 
can be found on page 47 . 
The Zygos Partnership and Heidrick and 
Struggles provided external search consultancy 
services in relation to the above appointments. 
Neither have any other connection to the 
Company other than providing these external 
search consultancy services.
B.3 Time commitment 
Non-executive Directors are advised of the 
time commitment expected from them on 
appointment. External commitments, which 
may impact existing time commitments,  
must be agreed with the Chairman. Details  
of external appointments are set out in the 
biographies on pages 34 and 35. As part  
of the evaluation of the Chairman, the 
Non-executive Directors, with input from  
the Executive Directors, assessed his ability  
to fulfil his role as Chairman, taking into 
account other significant appointments.
With the agreement of the Board, Executive 
Directors gain experience of other companies’ 
operations, governance frameworks and 
boardroom dynamics through non-executive 
appointments. The fees for these positions are 
retained by the individual. For further details 
about the Directors’ service contracts and 
letters of appointment, see page 61 of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
B.4 Development 
All new Directors are provided with a full 
induction programme when they are appointed 
to the Board. Details of Director induction and 
development can be found on page 37 .
B.5 Information and support 
The Group General Counsel & Company 
Secretary makes sure that appropriate and 
timely information is provided to the Board and 
its committees and is responsible for advising 
and supporting the Chairman and the Board 
on all governance matters. All Directors have 
access to the Group General Counsel & 
Company Secretary and may take 
independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense in conducting their duties. 
To support discussion and decision making, 
Board and committee members receive 
papers sufficiently in advance of meetings so 
that they can prepare for and consider agenda 
items. Additionally, the Chairman holds a short 
meeting with the Non-executive Directors 
before each Board meeting to discuss the 
focus of the upcoming meeting as well as 
afterwards to share feedback from the 
meeting. Similarly, the Chief Executive holds  
a short meeting with the Executive Directors 
and the Group General Counsel & Company 
Secretary after each meeting and shares  
the feedback from these meetings with the 
Chairman. A clear set of guidelines are in  
place to assist the Executive Directors and 
management on the content and presentation 
of papers to the Board and committees. A 
further refresh of the Board paper process took 
place this year. See page 39 for more details.
B.6 Evaluation 
See pages 38 and 39 for more information  
on our Board evaluation. During the year,  
the Chairman met each Director individually 
to discuss their contribution, performance 
over the year and training and development 
needs. Following these meetings, Sir Peter 
confirmed to the Nominations Committee 
that he considered that each Director 
demonstrated commitment to the role and 
their performance continued to be effective. 
At a private meeting of the Non-executive 
Directors, Mark Williamson, as Senior 
Independent Director, led a review of the 
Chairman’s performance. The Non-executive 
Directors, with input from the Executive 
Directors, assessed his ability to fulfil his  
role as Chairman and considered the 
arrangements he has in place, given he  
was also chairman of a FTSE 250 company 
during the year and the Aircraft Carrier 
Alliance Management Board and a Trustee  
of The Sutton Trust. They concluded that  
Sir Peter’s performance continued to  
be effective.
B.7 Election/re-election
Each Director is subject to election at  
the first AGM following their appointment, 
and re-election at each subsequent AGM. 
Following recommendations from the 
Nominations Committee the Board considers 
all Directors continue to be effective, 
committed to their roles and have sufficient 
time available to perform their duties. 
Therefore, in accordance with the Code, 
Pierre Dufour will seek election and all  
other Directors (except Ruth Kelly) will  
seek re-election at the 2017 AGM as set  
out in the Notice of Meeting.

C.1 Financial and business reporting
The requirement for Directors to state  
that they consider the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable remains a key 
consideration in the drafting and review 
process. The coordination and review of the 
Annual Report and Accounts is conducted  
in parallel with the formal audit process 
undertaken by the external auditors and  
the review by the Board and its committees  
(of relevant sections).
The drafting and assurance process  
supports the Audit Committee’s and Board’s 
assessment of the overall fairness, balance 
and clarity of the Annual Report and Accounts 
and the statement of Directors’ responsibilities  
as set out on page 74. The independent 
auditors’ report is on pages 75 to 82 and the 
Company’s business model is on page 14.
C.2 Internal control and risk 
management
The Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Company including those that would threaten 
the business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. Further details can be 
found on pages 16 and 17 .
The Board also sets the Company’s  
risk appetite, internal controls and risk 
management processes. The Board 
undertakes a review of their effectiveness 
annually. Further details are set out  
on pages 15 to 18.
The activities of the Audit Committee, which 
assists the Board with its responsibilities in 
relation to risk and assurance, are set out  
on pages 40 to 44.
C.3 Audit Committee and auditors
The Audit Committee report on pages 40  
to 44 sets out details of how the Committee 
has discharged its duties during the year, 
matters reviewed by the Committee and  
how it ensures the auditors’ objectivity, 
effectiveness and continued independence.
D.1 The level and components 
of remuneration
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for recommending to the Board the 
remuneration policy for Executive Directors  
and other members of the Executive 
Committee and for the Chairman, and for 
implementing this policy. The aim is to align 
remuneration policy to Company strategy  
and key business objectives and make sure  
it reflects our shareholders’, customers’ and 
regulators’ interests.
The Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 71 
outlines the activities of the Committee during 
the year and sets out the proposed Directors’ 
remuneration policy which will be presented  
to shareholders for approval at the 2017  
AGM. The new resolution to approve the 
remuneration policy is set out in the Notice  
of Meeting for the 2017 AGM.
D.2 Procedure
For further information on the work of the 
Remuneration Committee and Directors’ 
remuneration packages see the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 71.  
The Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on our website.
E.1 Dialogue with shareholders
The Board as a whole is responsible for 
making sure that satisfactory dialogue with 
shareholders takes place. We believe that 
effective channels of communication with  
the Company’s debt and equity institutional 
investors and individual shareholders are  
very important. More information about our 
approach to relations with shareholders  
can be found on page 37 .
E.2 Constructive use of 
General Meetings
The AGM provides a key opportunity for  
the Board to communicate with and meet 
shareholders. Shareholders are able to learn 
more about the Company through exhibits  
and can ask questions directly of the Board. 
Company representatives and our Registrar 
are also on hand to answer any questions 
shareholders might have.
Our AGM will be held on Monday 31 July 2017 
at The International Convention Centre in 
Birmingham and broadcast via our website. 
The Notice of Meeting for the 2017 AGM, 
available on our website, sets out in full the 
resolutions for consideration by shareholders, 
together with explanatory notes and further 
information on the Directors standing for 
election and re-election.
We will also be holding a General Meeting  
on 19 May 2017 to seek shareholder  
approval for a proposed share consolidation  
in connection with the return of cash as a  
result of the sale of a majority interest in our  
UK Gas Distribution business.
In addition, at the General Meeting, 
shareholder approval will in addition be sought 
to renew the annual authority to enable the 
Company to make market purchases of its 
own shares, as well as to allot ordinary shares 
and to disapply pre-emption rights, to cover 
the period between the date of the General 
Meeting and the 2017 AGM.

Corporate Governance Jonathan Dawson
Committee chairman
Review of remuneration policy
The Committee held a number of discussions last  
Autumn to determine whether any material changes to the 
remuneration policy would be appropriate for the future. 
Discussions covered recent trends in remuneration strategy 
adopted by other major UK corporates, an appraisal of 
developments in other major jurisdictions, data comparing 
National Grid’s remuneration policy and outturns against 
peer group companies, and the pay and conditions for 
employees below Board level. The main questions we 
considered were:
• Is the current split between short-term and  
long-term incentive pay appropriate?
• Are we incentivising behaviours that support  
National Grid’s strategy and values?
• Are we paying executives fairly for performance  
and is this appropriate in the context of the wider 
employee population?
• Is the overall amount paid to senior management  
aligned with shareholder value creation?
The conclusion we reached was that the overall structure 
which we initiated three years ago remains appropriate for 
National Grid. We felt that to make any significant changes 
to the policy – particularly given that the first LTPP awarded 
under the 2014 policy had yet to vest – was premature for  
a long-term business. We also felt that the division between 
short-term and long-term pay gave proper focus and weight 
to generating long-term returns for shareholders. 
There is no single approach to executive pay that is definitively 
‘right’ for all companies. What we did was to appraise the 
way National Grid creates value for its shareholders over time, 
and fulfils its national and societal obligations, recognising 
also that we are in a competitive market for senior executive 
talent. Against this backdrop, we believe the overall structure 
described above remains fair. 
We are proposing some minor modifications to the metrics  
(but not the quantum) in respect of both the APP and LTPP for 
the implementation of the policy in 2017 /18. More specifically, 
for the APP we will sharpen the focus on annual regional 
performance for the UK and US Executive Directors, with  
half of the weighting of the financial performance being on 
regional RoE and half on regional Value Added. There will  
be no change to the financial performance metrics for either 
the Chief Executive or the Finance Director. The LTPP will  
then focus solely on long-term Group performance for all 
Executive Directors with a 50% weighting on Group RoE  
and a 50% weighting on Group Value Growth. These changes 
should enhance the visibility for executives between their 
annual performance and short-term incentive outcome,  
while reinforcing executives’ collective incentive on sustaining 
long-term Group performance. No changes are being 
proposed to the maximum level of awards in respect  
of either the APP or the LTPP . 
Page 70 provides more detail on the implementation  
of our policy related to incentive plans for 2017/18.
We also looked at pension provisions as part of our policy 
review, including in relation to other employees of the 
Company. The annual contribution to a Defined Contribution 
plan (DC) is 30% of base salary for UK-based Directors and 
certain other senior UK-based employees. In the US the 
contribution rate is up to 13% of base salary plus APP award 
for US-based Directors and certain other senior US-based 
employees. Pension contributions are tiered by managerial 
grade down to 12% of base salary in the UK, and in the  
US 4-8% of base salary plus APP award (depending on  
age and years of service). To highlight the flexibility on  
any pension arrangements for new UK-based Directors,  
we have modified the wording in the policy related to  
UK DC pension contributions to ‘up to’ 30%. 
Annual statement from the 
Remuneration Committee chairman
Introduction
Three years ago, at our 2014 AGM, shareholders approved  
a new three-year remuneration policy for National Grid, with 
96% of the votes in favour. At our 2015 and 2016 AGMs 
shareholders supported our execution of the policy with 97% 
of the votes in favour each year. This year we are seeking your 
approval of our remuneration policy for a further three years. 
We have reviewed the remuneration policy reflecting on  
the wider environment as well as the strategic review of our 
business, leading to an evolution of National Grid’s purpose, 
vision, values and strategy. In this context, we consider that 
the existing framework will continue to provide executives 
with an appropriate opportunity to earn remuneration in line 
with National Grid’s overall performance and strategy. We 
are therefore proposing that the 2014 policy is renewed 
without any changes either to the structure, or to the 
maximum amounts for the APP and LTPP. 
The key elements of our remuneration approach are:
• significant weighting towards the Long Term Performance 
Plan (LTPP) versus the Annual Performance Plan (APP);
• the bulk of senior executive remuneration is paid in 
National Grid shares, with all of the LTPP paid only in 
shares, and half of the APP paid in shares;
• very high levels of personal shareholding required to be 
held by senior executives – specifically, 500% of pre-tax 
salary for the Chief Executive and 400% for other 
Executive Directors;
• a three-year performance period for measuring  
potential awards under the LTPP , coupled with a  
holding period of a further two years, irrespective  
of whether the mandatory personal shareholding  
target has been attained; 
• performance metrics for the LTPP which are Return 
on Equity (measuring management’s performance in 
generating profit from the business) and Value Growth 
(measuring management’s creation of shareholder  
value over the longer term); and
• malus and clawback provisions applicable to both  
the APP and LTPP .
We think that the best way to make sure management  
and other shareholders share the same interest comes  
from requiring executives to have a very substantial personal 
shareholding in National Grid. We want executives to view 
their remuneration from employment at National Grid as  
a mix of annual earnings, together with both the growth  
of their shareholdings in National Grid and the value of 
dividends received. As a result, we consider that the 
remuneration policy currently in place demonstrates close 
alignment between management and other shareholders, 
and a proper focus on generating long-term value.
54 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance continued At a glance
2013 LTPP
Three-quarters of the LTPP that was awarded in 2013 
(before the present policy came into force) had a vesting 
date of July 2016 and the remaining quarter is due to vest in 
July 2017 . The performance periods for both portions have 
ended, and vesting outcomes ranged from 77% to 90%.
2014 LTPP
The LTPP that was awarded in 2014 according to the 
remuneration policy adopted at the 2014 AGM is due to vest 
in full in July 2017 . The performance period has ended and 
the vesting outcomes ranged from 67% to 91%. This vesting 
range reflects the Committee’s decision to include, in the 
Value Growth outcome, a portion of the value added from the 
sale of a majority interest in the UK Gas Distribution business. 
The Committee believes this adjustment properly reflects 
performance during the year and the benefit to shareholders.
Reflecting the final year of the transitional phase, the single 
total figure of remuneration table for 2016/17 discloses  
both the 2013 and 2014 LTPP awards in full, although no 
Executive Director received more than one LTPP grant in 
any year. We have illustrated the impact of the transitional 
phase graphically on page 65. Next year the disclosure of 
LTPP awards for 2017/18 will be simpler as the number in 
the single total figure of remuneration table will incorporate 
only the amounts for the 2015 LTPP whose performance 
period will have just ended.
Executive Director shareholdings
In 2014, we introduced high levels of shareholding 
requirement for our Executive Directors in order to align 
them further to shareholders. As at 31 March 2017 ,  
Andrew Bonfield exceeded this shareholding requirement.  
As John Pettigrew, Dean Seavers and Nicola Shaw were 
appointed to the Board relatively recently, they have not  
yet met this shareholding requirement and therefore  
under our rules will not be given permission to sell shares 
(other than to pay income tax on receipt of the shares  
or in exceptional circumstances).
Annual salary review
As I reported last year, when John Pettigrew and Nicola 
Shaw were appointed to their respective positions, the 
Committee decided not to award them salaries at our 
assessment of then current market levels, but instead,  
and subject to their individual performance, we would 
gradually phase over time increases to salary in excess  
of increases awarded to other company employees.  
This approach is consistent with that used for the wider 
managerial population, where employees whose salaries 
are relatively low compared to the market receive 
significantly larger salary increases than budget  
when justified by individual performance. 
The Committee therefore considered John Pettigrew’s  
and Nicola Shaw’s performance during the year to 
determine whether performance in their respective roles 
merited awarding base salary increases above the general 
level within the Company. In John Pettigrew’s case the 
Committee concluded that he had made a very strong  
start in establishing himself as Chief Executive, notably  
with regard to evolving National Grid’s purpose, vision  
and strategy; delivering a strong set of Group financial 
results; establishing National Grid Ventures as a new 
business; agreeing with BEIS and Ofgem a sound basis  
for the redefined Electricity System Operator (ESO); 
achieving an excellent outcome to the 2016/17 employee 
survey; achieving good rate case outcomes; and securing  
a very good price for the sale of a majority interest in the  
UK Gas Distribution business (and associated return  
of capital to shareholders). 
Performance for the year 
APP
National Grid had another successful year in 2016/17 .  
At £4.7 billion, this year’s total adjusted operating profit  
was 14% higher than in 2015/16; earnings per share was  
73 pence. During the year the Company made significant 
capital investment in its networks of some £4.5 billion, split 
equally between the UK and the US. In addition, a majority 
interest in the UK Gas Distribution business was sold to  
a consortium of investors for a price of £13.8 billion. As 
already announced, we will be returning the majority of  
the net proceeds to shareholders, and a special dividend  
of some £3.2 billion is being paid to shareholders on  
2 June 2017 . Additionally, a further £835 million is being 
returned to shareholders via share buybacks this year.
When assessing the results of the APP for the Executive 
Directors, one of the performance measures, Earnings per 
share (EPS), was adjusted down as in other years to adjust 
for the impact of timing, scrip dividend uptake and currency 
adjustments. This year we also removed a 2 pence benefit 
arising from a one-off gain from the cessation of depreciation 
of the UK Gas Distribution assets since December. No 
adjustments were made to Group, US or UK RoE outturns. 
Based on National Grid’s financial performance, and  
taking account of performance against individual  
objectives, the APP payments to Executive Directors  
on the Board at 31 March 2017 would have been between 
96% and 104% of salary. However, following the fatal 
incident in November 2016 at the Company’s electricity  
sub-station at East Claydon in Buckinghamshire, UK,  
the Committee considered carefully whether it would be 
appropriate to exercise its discretion to reduce short-term 
incentive levels for senior executives. The Committee 
decided to reduce the overall APP payout by 10% for the 
four Executive Directors at that time, resulting in APP awards 
of 86% to 94% of salary. This is in addition to a zero score 
for individual objectives relating to UK safety, which were 
applicable to John Pettigrew and Nicola Shaw this year. 
Similar reductions in APP have been made to other 
members of the Group Executive Committee, UK Executive 
Committee, and relevant line management. The Committee 
considers that this approach to allocating short-term 
incentive reductions – which is fully supported by senior 
management – serves to emphasise the collective interest 
and importance of safety at National Grid.
Details of the APP payouts are presented on page 64, 
including that for Steve Holliday, who was an Executive 
Director from 1 April until 22 July. He received an APP 
payment for that time period, amounting to 81% of his  
prorated salary.
Looking ahead to the 2017/18 APP , and following the  
sale of a majority interest in the UK Gas Distribution 
business, the UK RoE metric for the 2017/18 APP for the 
Executive Director, UK will be specific to the wholly-owned 
regulated businesses in the UK. The Executive Director,  
UK also has an individual objective to manage the 39% 
retained interest in the UK Gas Distribution business as  
a member of its board.
LTPP
As I reported in my statement last year, our remuneration 
has been in a transitional phase since the approval of our 
current remuneration policy in 2014. At that time the APP 
opportunity was lowered, the LTPP opportunity was 
increased and the LTPP performance period was simplified. 
This led to the vesting of the final quarter of the 2013 award 
made under the previous policy as well as the 2014 award 
under the current policy in July 2017 , with both performance 
periods ending 31 March 2017 .

Performance
A comparison of the total 2016/17 single figure of remuneration to the maximum remuneration if variable pay had vested in full is set out below for  
the four Executive Directors in office for the full year. Due to the transition in vesting schedules, both the 2013 and 2014 LTPPs have been included.

John Pettigrew 5,143 4,636
Dean Seavers 4,196 3,165
Nicola Shaw 1,362 1,254
Regarding Nicola Shaw, the Committee considered that she had  
also made a very strong start in her role as Executive Director, UK, 
demonstrated in particular by effective leadership both with employees 
(as evidenced by strong employee survey results) and key external 
stakeholders; delivering strong results for the UK business; making  
a major contribution to the redefinition of the ESO; supporting the 
successful sale of a majority interest in the UK Gas Distribution business; 
and contributing to a fair outcome from the Mid-Period Review with 
Ofgem for National Grid and its customers.
The Committee also took account of pay ratios and National Grid’s 
investors’ experience and concluded that it was appropriate to award 
John Pettigrew and Nicola Shaw a salary increase of 9% comprising the 
UK managerial budgeted increase of 2.6% plus a further 6.4%. Salary 
increases to Andrew Bonfield and Dean Seavers, whose salaries are 
closer to market levels, are in line with UK and US managerial budgets,  
at 2.6% and 2.5%, respectively. We intend to apply the same approach 
next year, once again subject to individual performance.
Disclosure enhancements
In its review of the remuneration policy, the Committee took note of 
evolving best practice regarding detailed disclosure of APP targets. 
Accordingly, full details of the retrospective threshold, target and stretch 
performance levels for the financial metrics within the APP in respect  
of the year ended 31 March 2017 are set out on page 64. These 
disclosures complement our current threshold, target and stretch 
performance level disclosures in respect of the LTPP .
Committee membership
Pierre Dufour joined the Remuneration Committee in February 2017 ,  
and Paul Golby stepped down from the Committee in May 2017 . 
Conclusion
The Committee has given very careful thought to the remuneration 
structure for senior executives at National Grid. We believe that the 
arrangements set up three years ago, focussed on mainly share-based 
incentives, long-term performance and substantial personal shareholdings 
in National Grid, remain appropriate and fair. We therefore propose to 
make no changes either to the structure or to the maximum amounts 
for the APP and LTPP. As I have described above, we propose to make 
some minor adjustments to some of the metrics and between the split of 
group and regional performance across the APP and LTPP . We believe 
these changes will improve alignment and transparency. 
For the 2016/17 financial year, the Committee believes that it has correctly 
implemented the approved policy and that it has appropriately and 
reasonably exercised its discretion as discussed above. Overall the 
Committee believes that the remuneration earned last year by senior 
executives continues to reflect their performance, the Company’s 
performance, and the value generated for National Grid’s shareholders.
This year there are two separate remuneration votes – to approve a 
binding three-year policy, and to approve the remuneration report for 
2016/17 . On behalf of the Committee I commend this report to you  
and ask for your support for both resolutions at the AGM.

Corporate Governance The following tables provide details of the policy we intend to apply, subject to shareholder approval, for the three years from the date of the 2017 
AGM. Following approval it will be displayed on the Company’s website. 
There may be circumstances from time to time when the Committee will consider it appropriate to apply some judgement and exercise discretion  
in respect of the approved policy. This ability to apply discretion is highlighted where relevant in the policy, and the use of discretion will always be  
in the spirit of the approved policy.
The Committee will honour any commitments made to Directors before the policy outlined in this report comes into effect.
Our peer group
The Committee reviews its remuneration policy against appropriate peer groups annually to make sure we remain competitive in the relevant 
markets. The primary focus for reward market comparisons is the FTSE 11–40 for UK-based Executive Directors and general industry and energy 
services companies with similar levels of revenue for US-based Executive Directors. These peer groups are considered appropriate for a large, 
complex, international and predominantly regulated business.

Salary
 Purpose and link to strategy: to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre individuals, while not overpaying.
Operation Maximum levels
Performance metrics, weighting 
and time period applicable
Salaries are targeted broadly at mid-market level.
They are generally reviewed annually. Salary reviews take  
into account:
• business and individual contribution;
• the individual’s skills and experience;
• scope of the role, including any changes in responsibility; and
• market data in the relevant comparator group.
No prescribed maximum  
annual increase.
Any increases are generally aligned  
to salary increases received by other 
Company employees and to market 
movement. Increases in excess of  
this may be made at the Committee’s 
discretion in circumstances such as  
a significant change in responsibility, 
progression in the role and alignment 
to market level.
Not applicable.
Benefits

• opportunity to purchase additional benefits under  
flexible benefits schemes available to all employees; and
• opportunity to participate in the following HMRC (UK) or Internal 
Revenue Service (US) tax-advantaged all-employee share plans:
Sharesave: UK employees may make monthly contributions 
from net salary for a period of three or five years. The savings 
can be used to purchase shares at a discounted price, set at  
the launch of each plan period.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP): UK employees may use gross  
salary to purchase shares. These shares are placed in trust.
Incentive Thrift Plans (401(k) plans): US employees may 
participate in these tax-advantaged savings plans. They  
are DC pension plans in which employees can invest their 
own and Company contributions. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) (423(b) plan): eligible  
US employees may purchase ADSs on a monthly basis at a 
discounted price.
Other benefits may be offered at the discretion of the Committee.
Benefits have no predetermined 
maximum, as the cost of providing 
these varies from year to year.

Corporate Governance continued Directors’ remuneration policy
Pension 
 Purpose and link to strategy: to reward sustained contribution and assist attraction and retention.
Operation Maximum levels
Performance metrics, weighting 
and time period applicable
Pension for an Executive Director will reflect whether they were 
internally promoted or externally appointed.
If internally promoted:
• retention of existing DB benefits without enhancement, with 
capping of pensionable pay increases following promotion  
to the Board; or
• retention of existing UK DC benefits with discretion to enhance 
contribution rate to up to 30%; or
• cash in lieu; or
• retention of existing US DC benefits plus 401(k) plan match, 
provided through 401(k) plan and non-qualified plans.
If externally appointed:
• UK DC benefits or equivalent cash in lieu; or 
• US DC benefits plus 401(k) plan match.
In line with market practice, pensionable pay for UK-based 
Executive Directors includes salary only and for US-based 
Executive Directors it includes salary and APP award.
UK DB: a maximum pension on 
retirement, at age 60, of two thirds 
final capped pensionable pay or up  
to one sixtieth accrual. On death in 
service, a lump sum of four times 
pensionable pay and a two thirds 
dependant’s pension is provided.
UK DC: annual contributions of  
up to 30% of salary. Life assurance 
provision of four times pensionable 
salary and a dependant’s pension 
equal to one third of the Director’s 
salary are provided on death  
in service.
Cash in lieu: annual payments of up  
to 30% of salary. Life assurance and 
dependant’s pension in line with UK 
DC (or UK DB where the Director  
was previously a member of a UK  
DB scheme).
US DB: an Executive Supplemental 
Retirement Plan provides for an 
unreduced pension benefit at age 62. 
For retirements at age 62 with 35 
years of service, the pension benefit 
would be approximately two thirds  
of pensionable pay. Upon death in 
service, the spouse would receive 
50% of the pension benefit (100%  
if the participant died while an active 
employee after the age of 55).
US DC: annual contributions of up  
to 9% of base salary plus APP with 
additional 401(k) plan match of up  
to 4%.
Not applicable.
Annual Performance Plan 
Purpose and link to strategy: to incentivise and reward the achievement of annual financial and strategic business targets and the delivery  
of annual individual objectives.
Operation Maximum levels
Performance metrics, weighting 
and time period applicable
Performance metrics and targets are agreed at the start of each 
financial year and are aligned with strategic business priorities. 
Targets are set with reference to the budget. Awards are paid  
in June.
50% of awards are paid in shares, which (after any sales to pay 
associated income tax) must be retained until the shareholding 
requirement is met, and in any event for two years after receipt. 
Awards are subject to clawback and malus provisions.
The maximum award is 125%  
of salary.
A majority of the APP is based on 
performance against corporate 
financial measures, with the remainder 
based on performance against 
individual objectives. Individual 
objectives are role-specific.
The Committee may use its discretion 
to set measures that it considers 
appropriate in each financial year  
and reduce the amount payable, 
taking account of significant safety  
or customer service standard 
incidents, environmental and 
governance issues.
The payout levels at threshold, target 
and stretch performance levels are 
0%, 50% and 100%, respectively.

Corporate Governance Long Term Performance Plan 
Purpose and link to strategy: to drive long-term performance, aligning Executive Director incentives to key strategic objectives  
and shareholder interests.
Operation Maximum levels
Performance metrics, weighting 
and time period applicable
Awards of shares may be granted each year, with vesting subject  
to long-term performance conditions.
The performance metrics have been chosen as the Committee 
believes they reflect the creation of long-term value within  
the business. Targets are set each year with reference to the 
business plan.
Participants may receive ordinary dividend equivalents  
on vested shares at the discretion of the Committee. 
Awards are subject to clawback and malus provisions. 
Notwithstanding the level of award achieved against the 
performance conditions, the Committee may use its discretion  
to reduce the amount vesting, and in particular will take  
account of compliance with the dividend policy.
Participants must retain vested shares (after any sales to pay tax) 
until the shareholding requirement is met, and in any event for a 
further two years after vesting.
The maximum award for the Chief 
Executive is 350% of salary and it  
is 300% of salary for the other 
Executive Directors.
For awards between 2014 and 2016, 
the performance measures were:
• Value Growth and Group RoE  
(for the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director); and
• Value Growth, Group RoE and UK 
or US RoE (for the UK and US 
Executive Directors respectively).
For awards from 2017 , the performance 
measures are Value Growth and Group 
RoE for all Executive Directors. 
All are measured over a  
three-year period.
The weightings of these measures 
may vary year to year, but would 
always remain such that the Value 
Growth metric would never fall below  
a 25% weighting and never rise above 
a 75% weighting. 
Only 20% of the award vests  
at threshold.
Approved policy table – Non-executive Directors (NEDs)
Fees for NEDs 
 Purpose and link to strategy: to attract NEDs who have a broad range of experience and skills to oversee the implementation of our strategy.
Operation Maximum levels
Performance metrics, weighting 
and time period applicable
NED fees (excluding those of the Chairman) are set by the Executive 
Committee in conjunction with the Chairman; the Chairman’s fees 
are set by the Committee.
Fee structure:
• Chairman fee;
• basic fee, which differs for UK- and US-based NEDs;
• committee membership fee; 
• committee chair fee; and
• Senior Independent Director fee.
Fees are reviewed every year taking into account those in 
companies of similar scale and complexity.
NEDs do not participate in incentive, pension or benefit plans. 
However, they are eligible for reimbursement for all company-related 
travel expenses. In instances where these costs are treated by 
HMRC as taxable benefits, the Company also meets the associated 
tax cost to the Non-executive Directors through a PAYE settlement 
agreement with HMRC.
Additionally, the Chairman is covered by the Company’s private 
medical and personal accident insurance plans and receives a fully 
expensed car or cash alternative to a car, and the use of a car and 
driver, when required.
NEDs who also sit on National Grid subsidiary boards may  
receive additional fees related to service on those boards.
There is no provision for termination payments. NEDs stand  
for re-election every year.
There are no maximum fee levels.
The benefits provided to the 
Chairman are not subject to a 
predetermined maximum cost,  
as the cost of providing these  
varies from year to year.

Directors’ remuneration policy continued
60 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance continued Directors’ remuneration policy
Shareholding requirement 
The requirement of Executive Directors to build up and 
hold a relatively high value of National Grid shares ensures 
they share a significant level of risk with shareholders and 
aims to align their interests.
Executive Directors are required to build up and retain 
shares in the Company. The level of holding required  
is 500% of salary for the Chief Executive and 400%  
of salary for the other Executive Directors.
Unless the shareholding requirement is met, Executive 
Directors will not be permitted to sell shares, other  
than to pay income tax liabilities on shares just vested  
or in exceptional circumstances approved by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees
The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is 
designed with regard to the policy for employees across the 
Company as a whole. However, there are some differences 
in the structure of remuneration policy for the senior 
executives. In general, these differences arise from the 
development of remuneration arrangements that are market 
competitive for our various employee categories. They also 
reflect the fact that, in the case of the Executive Directors,  
a greater emphasis tends to be placed on performance-
related pay in the market, in particular long-term 
performance-related pay. 
All employees are entitled to base salary, benefits and 
pension contributions. Many employees are eligible for an 
APP award based on Company and individual performance. 
Eligibility and the maximum opportunity available is based 
on market practice for the employee’s job band. In addition, 
around 380 senior management employees are awarded 
LTPPs annually.
The Company has a number of all-employee share plans 
that provide employees with the opportunity to become, 
and to think like, a shareholder. These plans include 
Sharesave and the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in the UK and 
the 401(k) and 423(b) plans in the US. Further information  
is provided on page 58.
Consideration of remuneration policy elsewhere in 
the Company 
In setting the remuneration policy the Committee considers 
the remuneration packages offered to employees across  
the Company. As a point of principle, salaries, benefits, 
pensions and other elements of remuneration are assessed 
regularly to ensure they remain competitive in the markets in 
which we operate. In undertaking such assessment our aim 
is to be at mid-market level for all job bands, including those 
subject to union negotiation.
As would be expected, we have differences in pay and 
benefits across the business which reflect individual 
responsibility and there are elements of remuneration  
policy which apply to all, for example, flexible benefits  
and share plans.
When considering annual salary increases, the Committee 
reviews the proposals for salary increases for the employee 
population generally, as it does for any other changes to 
remuneration being considered. 
The Company issues an employee engagement survey 
each year which includes questions on remuneration. It 
does not specifically invite employees to comment on the 
Directors’ remuneration policy but any comments made  
by employees are noted. 
Directors’ remuneration policy continued
Policy on recruitment remuneration
Salaries for new Executive Directors appointed to the Board 
will be set in accordance with the terms of the approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment, and 
in particular will take account of the appointee’s skills and 
experience as well as the scope and market rate for the role.
Where appropriate, salaries may be set below market  
level initially, with the Committee retaining discretion  
to award increases in salary in excess of those of the  
wider workforce and inflation to bring salary to a market  
level over time, where this is justified by individual and  
Company performance.
Benefits consistent with those offered to other Executive 
Directors under the approved remuneration policy in force  
at the time of appointment will be offered, taking account of 
local market practice. The Committee may also agree that 
the Company will meet certain costs associated with the 
recruitment, for example legal fees, and the Committee  
may agree to meet certain relocation expenses or provide  
tax equalisation as appropriate.
Pensions for new Executive Directors appointed to  
the Board will be set in accordance with the terms of  
the approved remuneration policy in force at the time  
of appointment.
Ongoing incentive pay (APP and LTPP) for new Executive 
Directors will be in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.  
This means the maximum APP award in any year would  
be 125% of salary and the maximum LTPP award would  
be 300% of salary (350% of salary for the Chief Executive).
For an externally appointed Executive Director, the 
Company may offer additional cash or share-based 
payments that it considers necessary to buy out current 
entitlements from the former employer that will be lost  
on recruitment to National Grid. Any such arrangements 
would reflect the delivery mechanisms, time horizons  
and levels of conditionality of the remuneration lost.
In order to facilitate buy-out arrangements as described 
above, existing incentive arrangements will be used to the 
extent possible, although awards may also be granted 
outside of these shareholder-approved schemes if 
necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
For an internally appointed Executive Director, any 
outstanding variable pay element awarded in respect  
of the prior role will continue on its original terms.
Fees for a new Chairman or Non-executive Director will  
be set in line with the approved policy in force at the time  
of appointment.
Service contracts and policy on payment  
for loss of office 
In line with our policy, all Executive Directors have service 
contracts which are terminable by either party with 12 
months’ notice. 
The contracts contain provisions for payment in lieu of 
notice, at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company. 
Such contractual payments are limited to payment of salary 
only for the remainder of the notice period. In the UK such 
payments would be phased on a monthly basis, over a 
period not greater than 12 months, and the Executive 
Director would be expected to mitigate any losses where 
employment is taken up during the notice period. In the US, 
for tax purposes the policy is to make any payment in lieu of 
61 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Corporate Governance notice as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event 
within two and a half months of the later of 31 December 
and 31 March immediately following the notice date. 
In the event of a UK Director being made redundant, 
statutory compensation would apply and the relevant 
pension plan rules may result in the early payment of  
an unreduced pension.
On termination of employment, no APP award would 
generally be payable. However, the Committee has the 
discretion to deem an individual to be a ‘good leaver’,  
in which case an APP award would be payable on the 
termination date, based on performance during the financial 
year up to termination. Examples of circumstances in which 
a Director would be treated as a ‘good leaver’ include 
redundancy, retirement, illness, injury, disability and death. 
Any APP award would be prorated and would be subject to 
performance achieved against the objectives for that year.
On termination of employment, outstanding awards under 
the share plans will be treated in accordance with the 
relevant plan rules approved by shareholders. Share awards 
would normally lapse. ‘Good leaver’ provisions apply at the 
Committee’s discretion and in specified circumstances, 
including redundancy, retirement, illness, injury, disability 
and death, where awards will be released to the departing 
Executive Director or, in the case of death, to their estate. 
Long-term share plan awards held by ‘good leavers’ may 
vest subject to performance measured at the normal vesting 
date and are prorated. Such awards would vest at the same 
time as for other participants, apart from circumstances  
in which the award recipient has died, in which case the 
awards vest as soon as practicable (based on a forecast  
of performance).
The Chairman’s appointment is subject to six months’ 
notice by either party; for the other Non-executive Directors, 
notice is one month. No compensation is payable to 
Non-executive Directors if they are required to stand  
down or are not re-elected. 
Copies of Directors’ service contracts and letters of 
appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office. 
External appointments
The Executive Directors may, with the approval of the  
Board, accept one external appointment as a non-executive 
director of another company and retain any fees received  
for the appointment. Experience as a board member of 
another company is considered to be valuable personal 
development, that in turn is of benefit to the Company.
Total remuneration opportunity
The total remuneration for each of the Executive Directors that could result from the remuneration policy in 2017 under three different performance

Review of 2017/18 objectives for Executive Committee
Notes: 
Salary: Base salaries were last increased on 1 June 2016. At this time Andrew Bonfield and Dean Seavers received salary increases of 2.0% and 2.5% respectively, in line with the average 
salary increases given to other managerial employees of the Company in the UK and US respectively. Dean Seavers’ salary has been converted at $1.2767:£1 for 2016/17 ($1.4744:£1 for 
2015/16). Steve Holliday did not receive a salary increase due to his planned retirement on 22 July 2016, and his salary was only paid to this date. John Pettigrew and Nicola Shaw were  
newly appointed as Chief Executive and Executive Director, UK respectively. Nicola Shaw’s base salary was paid from her start date of 1 July 2016.
APP: Steve Holliday’s APP award is based on his prorated salary for the time on the Board in the 2016/17 financial year before he stepped down on his retirement in July 2016. Following  
a fatality in the UK that occurred in November 2016, the APP awards have been reduced by 10% for the Executive Directors at that time.
Benefits in kind: Benefits in kind include private medical insurance, life assurance and for UK-based Executive Directors, either a fully expensed car or a cash alternative to a car and  
the use of a car and driver when required. For John Pettigrew, this amount includes a reimbursement for costs relating to his relocation to London on appointment as Chief Executive.
Other: For Nicola Shaw, Other includes a £485,000 cash payment to compensate her for the forfeiture of short-term and long-term incentive cash awards at her former employer which  
were due to vest in June 2016.
LTPP: Three quarters of the 2013 LTPP award vested in July 2016, and the remaining quarter is due to vest in July 2017. Additionally, the entire 2014 LTPP award is due to vest in July 2017.
The above value for 2016/17 therefore includes all of these amounts, and separate columns have been provided to delineate the two awards. No Executive Director received two LTPP
awards in the same year. For amounts vesting on 1 July 2016, the share price on that date of 1,105.5 pence ($74.36 per ADS) has been applied. For amounts due to vest on 1 July 2017,  
the average share price over the three months from 1 January 2017 to 31 March 2017 of 962.75 pence ($59.84 per ADS) has been applied. The 2015/16 LTPP amount has been restated  
to reflect the actual amounts that vested on 1 July 2016 for RoE, rather than the estimate shown in last year’s annual report. Due to a higher share price at vesting of 1,105.5 pence ($74.36  
per ADS) versus the estimate of 958 pence ($69.23 per ADS), the actual value at vesting was £38,425, £60,700, and £18,882 higher than the estimate for Andrew Bonfield, Steve Holliday  
and John Pettigrew respectively. The remaining 25% portion of Steve Holliday’s 2013 LTPP award (with expected vesting of £0.3 million) and the full 2014 LTPP award (with expected  
vesting of £2.2 million) will not vest until 1 July 2017, approximately one year after he stepped down from the Board. Therefore the vested amounts will be disclosed in the Payments  
to Past Directors section in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts.
Total: The Total remuneration excluding the 2013 LTPP would have been £4.0 million, £0.9 million and £3.9 million for Andrew Bonfield, Steve Holliday and John Pettigrew respectively.  
As a result, the Total for all Executive Directors would have been £13.3 million.

Performance against targets for APP 2016/17 (audited information)
APP awards are earned by reference to the financial year and paid in June. 50% of awards are paid in shares which (after any sales to pay income tax) 
must be retained until the shareholding requirement is met, and in any event for two years after receipt. In relation to both the financial measures and 
individual objectives, threshold, target and stretch performance levels are pre-determined by the Committee and pay out at 0%, 50% and 100% 
respectively and on a straight-line basis in between threshold and target performance and target and stretch performance. The individual objectives  
of the Executive Directors reflect the primary focus areas within the Company’s overall strategic priorities:
• safety;
• business growth in the UK and US;
• operational excellence and improvement in overall Company performance and service to customers and communities;
• the talent pipeline and employee engagement;
• stakeholder engagement, sustainability and the environment; and
• successful completion of the sale of a majority of the UK Gas Distribution business. 
 
The outcomes of APP awards earned in 2016/17 for the four Executive Directors at 31 March and prior to the 10% reduction (described in the note 
below), are shown in the tables below:

Notes:
Overall: Group RoE pertains to the Chief Executive and Finance Director, while UK RoE and US RoE 
pertain to the Executive Director, UK and Executive Director, US respectively. RoE in some form 
comprises 35% of the total maximum opportunity. 
Adjusted EPS: Adjusted EPS actual is reduced by 7.9 pence to account for the impact of timing, scrip 
dividend uptake, currency adjustments and certain actuarial assumptions on pensions, and to remove 
the benefit of ceasing to depreciate UK Gas Distribution business assets since December 2016.
Steve Holliday’s APP award for 2016/17 was based on his prorated salary from 1 April until 22 July and reflected target financial performance and 
stretch individual performance based on an assessment of his performance against the objective of completing a successful transition between 
himself and the newly appointed Chief Executive, John Pettigrew. 
Following the fatal incident at the Company’s electricity sub-station in November at East Claydon, Buckinghamshire, UK, the APP awards for the four 
Executive Directors on the Board at that time were reduced by 10%. The impact of the reduction is shown in the bar charts below.

2016/17 LTPP performance (audited information)
The LTPP value included in the 2016/17 single total figure relates to vesting of the conditional LTPP awards granted in both 2013 and 2014. This arises 
from the change to the performance periods as part of the policy implemented in 2014. A visual illustration of this transition is presented below.  
No Executive Director received more than one LTPP grant in any year.

The 2013 award is determined based on differing performance periods and vesting dates:
• performance over the three years ending 31 March 2016 for the EPS measure (50% weighting) which vested on 1 July 2016;
• performance over the three years ending 30 June 2016 for the TSR measure (25% weighting) which vested on 1 July 2016; and
• performance over the four years ending 31 March 2017 for the UK RoE and US RoE measures (25% weighting overall, split by  
Executive Director as shown below) which will vest on 1 July 2017 . 
The performance achieved against the 2013 LTPP award performance targets, including the expected vesting percentage for the RoE measures, was:

For Steve Holliday, all values reflect the TSR and EPS portions of the award (75% of the total) which vested while he was on the Board. The 25% RoE 
portion which is due to vest in July 2017 will be included in the ‘Payments to Past Directors’ section in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.  
Dean Seavers and Nicola Shaw were both appointed since the 2013 LTPP was awarded and therefore did not receive any awards under the 2013 LTPP .
65 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Corporate Governance No further awards will be made under this LTPP structure, the 2014 structure described below having been adopted at the 2014 AGM.
2014 LTPP
The 2014 award is determined by performance over the three years ending 31 March 2017 of RoE (50% weighting) and Value Growth (50% weighting) 
which will vest on 1 July 2017 . For the UK and US Executive Directors at that time, the RoE component is split equally between Group RoE and UK  
and US RoE respectively. For the Chief Executive at that time and the Finance Director, the entire RoE component is based on Group RoE.

The amounts expected to vest under the 2014 LTPP for the performance period ended on 31 March 2017 and included in the 2016/17 single total 
figure are shown in the table below. The valuation is based on the average share price over the three months from 1 January 2017 to 31 March 2017

Dean Seavers (ADSs) 40,966 67.44% 27,629 4,397 1,501
Nicola Shaw was appointed in July 2016 and therefore did not receive any share awards under the 2014 LTPP . 
Last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report covering remuneration for 2015/16 included an estimated vesting of the US and UK RoE portions of  
the 2012 LTPP award. These awards vested on 1 July 2016 and the performance achieved against the performance targets was the same as the 
expected vesting disclosed in the 2015/16 report. As a result of the actual achievement against the performance targets being the same as estimated, 
the vesting percentage and number of awards vesting are the same as disclosed in the 2015/16 report. However, the actual number of dividend 
equivalent shares varied as did the total value of awards vesting due to share price changes between the estimate and the actual date of vesting of  
the RoE portion. Specifically, the actual price on 1 July 2016 was 1,105.5 pence ($74.36 per ADS) rather than the estimate of 958 pence ($69.23 per 
ADS) disclosed in the 2015/16 report based on the average price from 1 January 2016 to 31 March 2016. As a result, the actual numbers of dividend 
equivalent shares granted for the 2012 LTPP were 23,001, 36,343, and 6,749 and the total values of awards that vested were £1,383,119, £2,185,387 
and £424,568 for Andrew Bonfield, Steve Holliday and John Pettigrew, respectively.
Total pension benefits (audited information)
The table below provides details of the Executive Directors’ pension benefits. Andrew Bonfield, John Pettigrew and Nicola Shaw received a cash 
allowance in lieu of participation in a pension arrangement. Dean Seavers participated in Defined Contribution pension arrangements in the US.  
Steve Holliday participated in a Defined Benefit pension arrangement, under a salary sacrifice scheme in which the individual’s salary is reduced  
by the employee pension contribution. An equivalent contribution is paid by the employer to the pension arrangement. There are no additional  
benefits on early retirement.

Notes:
Steve Holliday: In addition to the pension shown above, there was an accrued lump sum entitlement of £129,000. The increase to the lump sum over the year, net of inflation, was £647.  
The increase to the pension over the year, net of inflation, was £14,349. The total accrued pension and lump sum was split between two pension arrangements. A transfer payment from  
one of the pension arrangements was made in July 2016, leaving a remaining pension of £521,709 pa and a lump sum of £6,717. This pension and lump sum entered payment on the  
normal retirement date listed above.
John Pettigrew: John Pettigrew opted out of a DB pension arrangement on 31 March 2016 with a deferred pension and lump sum payable from a normal retirement date of 26 October 2031. 
There was no increase to these benefits over the period, net of inflation.
Annual report on remuneration continued
66 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance continued Annual report on remuneration
Dean Seavers: The average exchange rate for 2016/17 was $1.2767:£1. Through his participation in the 401(k) plan in the US (a DC arrangement) the Company made contributions worth 
£21,197. The Company also made contributions worth £123,983 to the Non-Qualified Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan which pays the portion of core contributions that cannot be  
paid under the qualified plan due to IRS limitations. The plan provides a supplemental top-up benefit through additional company contributions to yield an overall company contribution of  
9% of pensionable pay, including both the qualified and non-qualified plan benefits. The retirement date shown reflects the typical retirement age in the US. The 401(k) plan does not have  
a retirement age. Benefits can be taken without penalty on leaving the Company from age 55 (subject to vesting requirements) or can be rolled over into another qualifying plan.
BIS calculation: In accordance with BIS methodology, the pension benefit for Andrew Bonfield, John Pettigrew, Nicola Shaw and Dean Seavers is calculated as the aggregate of contributions 
made to a DC-type pension plan and cash in lieu of contributions to a DC-type pension plan. In accordance with BIS disclosure regulations, the pension benefit for Steve Holliday is calculated 
as the increase in accrued DB-type pension over the year multiplied by 20 plus the increase in the lump sum, less the reduction in salary due to salary sacrifice. Each element is calculated 
separately and rounded to produce the numbers in the table on the previous page.

Sir Peter Gershon: Other emoluments comprise private medical insurance, cash in lieu of a car and the use of a car and driver when required.
In accordance with the Company’s expenses policies, Non-executive Directors receive reimbursement for their reasonable expenses for attending 
Board meetings. In instances where these costs are treated by HMRC as taxable benefits, the Company also meets the associated tax cost to the 
Non-executive Directors through a PAYE settlement agreement with HMRC.
The total emoluments paid to Executive and Non-executive Directors in the year was £19.5 million (2015/16: £12.8 million), though this figure includes 
two years’ worth of LTPPs to the Executive Directors for 2016/17 . Excluding the 2013 LTPP , the total emoluments would be £14.5 million.
LTPP (conditional award) granted during the financial year (audited information)
The face value of the awards is calculated using the volume weighted average share price at the date of grant. For Andrew Bonfield, John Pettigrew 
and Dean Seavers this is 28 June 2016 at a price of £10.21 per share and $69.1825 per ADS. For Nicola Shaw this is 12 July 2016 at a price of

Steve Holliday stepped down from the Board and retired from the Company on 22 July 2016. 
Since his departure was due to retirement, which qualifies as ‘good leaver’ status, he is eligible to receive a prorated number of shares under the 
outstanding LTPPs. Awards for 261,506 remain outstanding after the prorating calculation for time served during the respective performance periods. 
Awards remain subject to performance conditions, measured at the normal performance measurement date. The prorated number of shares he  
is due to receive under the remaining portion of the 2013 LTPP and the full 2014 LTPP on 1 July 2017 will be disclosed in the ‘Payments to past

the Company on 31 March 2015. Both Mr Winser and Mr King held awards over shares and ADSs, respectively, that were prorated according to their 
departure date. The vesting of all these awards will occur at the normal vesting dates subject to satisfaction of their specified performance conditions at 
that time. Portions of these awards vested in July 2016 and pertain to the RoE portion of the 2012 LTPP and the TSR and EPS portions of the 2013 LTPP .

Shareholder dilution
Where shares may be issued or treasury shares reissued to satisfy incentives, the aggregate dilution resulting from executive share-based incentives 
will not exceed 5% in any 10 year period. Dilution resulting from all incentives, including all-employee incentives, will not exceed 10% in any 10 year 
period. The Committee reviews dilution against these limits regularly and under these limits the Company, as at 31 March 2017 , had headroom of 
4.08% and 7 .98% respectively.
Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited information)
The Executive Directors are required to build up and hold a shareholding from vested share plan awards. Deferred share plan awards are not taken 
into account for these purposes until the end of the deferral period. Shares are valued for these purposes at the 31 March 2017 price, which was 
1,012.51 pence per share ($63.39 per ADS). 
The following table shows how each Executive Director complies with the shareholding requirement and also the number of shares owned by the 
Non-executive Directors, including connected persons (as Non-executive Directors do not have a shareholding requirement). 
The shareholding is as at 31 March 2017 and the salary used to calculate the value of the shareholding is the gross annual salary as at 31 March 2017 . 
Andrew Bonfield has met the shareholding requirement. As John Pettigrew, Dean Seavers and Nicola Shaw were relatively new in post, they have not 
yet met the requirement, but are expected to do so in 2020, 2020 and 2023 respectively, and will not be allowed to sell shares until this requirement is 
met. Non-executive Directors do not have a shareholding requirement.
The normal vesting dates for the conditional share awards subject to performance conditions are 1 July 2017 , 1 July 2017 , 1 July 2018, and 1 July 
2019 for the LTPP 2013, LTPP 2014, LTPP 2015 and LTPP 2016 respectively. In each of April and May 2017 a further 15 shares were purchased on 
behalf of John Pettigrew. In April 2017 a further 15 shares were purchased on behalf of Andrew Bonfield and 14 shares in May 2017 . The shares were 
purchased via the Share Incentive Plan (an HMRC approved all-employee share plan), thereby increasing their beneficial interests. There have been  
no other changes in Directors’ shareholdings between 1 April 2017 and 17 May 2017 .

Notes: 
Overall: 2014 DSP relates to the Deferred Share Plan under which 50% of APP awards were deferred into shares. This plan was discontinued from the 2014/15 APP in lieu of 50% payment  
via shares with a two-year holding period.

Annual report on remuneration
Relative importance of spend on pay
This chart shows the relative importance of spend on pay compared  
with other costs and disbursements (dividends, tax, net interest and 
capital expenditure). Given the capital-intensive nature of our business 
and the scale of our operations, these costs were chosen as the most 
relevant for comparison purposes. All amounts exclude exceptional  
items and remeasurements, and amounts relating to the UK Gas 
Distribution business.
Chief Executive’s pay in the last eight financial years
Steve Holliday was the Chief Executive throughout the seven-year period from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2016. John Pettigrew became Chief Executive 
on 1 April 2016. His outcomes have been shown for the year 2016/17 in two ways, one to reflect the full total single figure of remuneration which 
includes the vesting outcomes of both the 2013 and 2014 LTPP awards, and the other to reflect the total single figure of remuneration using just  
the 2014 LTPP award to reflect his annualised total remuneration.

100.00% 65.15% 49.50% 25.15% 76.20% 55.81% 63.45% 90.41%
Total single figure of remuneration: The figure for 2016/17 includes both the 2013 and 2014 LTPP awards due to the transition from a four-year to a three-year period before all portions  
vest between the 2013 and 2014 LTPP grants, resulting in a one-time overlapping of vesting periods. 
Total single figure of remuneration – including only 2014 LTPP: The total single figure of remuneration is restated for 2016/17 to include only the 2014 LTPP award in order to capture one 
year’s worth of remuneration for comparison purposes.
PSP/LTPP: This vesting proportion for 2016/17 reflects combined vesting outcomes for the 2013 (90.00%) and 2014 (90.58%) LTPP awards. 
Percentage change in Chief Executive’s remuneration
The table below shows how the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s salary, benefits and APP between 2015/16 and 2016/17 compares with 
the percentage change in the average of each of those components of remuneration for non-union employees. The Committee views this group as 
the most appropriate comparator group, as it excludes employees represented by trade unions, whose pay and benefits are negotiated with each 
individual union.

Non-union employees (increase per employee) 3% 1% 6%
Chief Executive: John Pettigrew succeeded Steve Holliday as Chief Executive on 1 April 2016 and therefore the table compares Steve Holliday’s pay from 2015/16 with John Pettigrew’s pay  
in 2016/17. Taxable benefits for John Pettigrew in 2016/17 include a one-time relocation benefit.
Non-union employees: Pay data for US employees has been converted at $1.2767:£1 for 2016/17 ($1.4744:£1 for 2015/16).
Performance graph and table 
This chart shows National Grid plc’s eight-year annual total shareholder  
return (TSR) performance against the FTSE 100 Index since 31 March 
2009. The FTSE 100 Index has been chosen because it is the widely 
recognised performance benchmark for large companies in the UK.
The TSR level shown at 31 March each year is the average of the  
closing daily TSR levels for the 30-day period up to and including  
that date. It assumes dividends are reinvested.

Advisors to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee received advice during 2016/17 from independent remuneration consultants New Bridge Street (NBS), a trading name of Aon Hewitt 
Ltd (part of Aon plc). NBS was selected as our advisor by the Committee from 1 August 2013 following a competitive tendering process.
Work undertaken by NBS included updating the Committee on trends in compensation and governance matters, advising the Committee in 
connection with benchmarking of the total reward packages for the Executive Directors and other senior employees, and facilitating the development 
of the proposed 2017 remuneration policy. NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and has signed up to that group’s Code of 
Conduct. The Committee is satisfied that any potential conflicts were appropriately managed. NBS does not provide any other advice or services  
to the Company. In the year to 31 March 2017 the Committee paid a total of £148,313 to NBS, with fees being charged on a time incurred basis. 
The Committee also received specialist advice from the following organisations:
• Alithos Limited: provision of TSR calculations for the LTPP (£3,125 paid in 2016/17);
• Linklaters LLP: advice relating to share schemes and to Directors’ service contracts as well as providing other legal advice to the Company 
(£31,067 paid in 2016/17); and
• Willis Towers Watson: advice relating to the market assessments of the total reward packages for the Executive Committee, inclusive of the 
Executive Directors (£107 ,040 paid in 2016/17).
The Committee reviews the objectivity and independence of the advice it receives from its advisors each year. It is satisfied that they all provided 
credible and professional advice.
The Committee considers the views of the Chairman on the performance and remuneration of the Chief Executive; and of the Chief Executive on the 
performance and remuneration of the other members of the Executive Committee. The Committee is also supported by the Group General Counsel  
& Company Secretary who acts as Secretary to the Committee, the Group HR Director, the Group Head of Reward & Performance and the Acting 
Group Head of Pensions. No other advisors have provided significant services to the Committee in the year.

Financial Statements contents Throughout these financial statements we have provided explanations of the disclosures and why they are important to the understanding 
of our financial performance and position. In places we have also highlighted ‘Our strategy in action’, drawing out the key elements of our 
business model (set out in the Strategic Report on page 14), and showing how the disclosures reflect this strategy.
Audit opinions
We have two audit opinions on our financial statements, reflecting 
our listing on both the London Stock Exchange and the New York 
Stock Exchange. Due to the different reporting requirements for 
each listing, our auditors are required to confirm compliance with 
each set of standards in a prescribed format. The audit opinion  
as required under our UK listing (starting on page 75) continues  
to provide more detail as to how our auditors have planned and 
conducted their audit, as well as their views on significant matters 
they have noted and that were discussed by the Audit Committee.
Notes
Notes to the financial statements provide additional information 
required by statute, accounting standards or other regulations to 
assist in a more detailed understanding of the primary financial 
statements. In many notes we have included an accounting  
policy that describes how the transactions or balance in that  
note have been measured, recognised and disclosed. The basis  
of preparation section (note 1) provides details of accounting 
policies that apply to transactions and balances in general.  
There are also additional specific disclosure requirements  
due to our US listing which are included in the notes.
Unaudited commentary
We have presented with the financial statements certain  
analysis as part of the Strategic Report of our Annual Report  
and Accounts. This approach provides a clearer narrative,  
a logical flow of information and reduces duplication. We have 
created a combined financial review, including a commentary  
on items within the primary statements, on pages 84 to 91.  
Unless otherwise indicated, all analysis provided in the financial 
statements is on a statutory IFRS basis. All information in ruled 
boxes styled in the same manner as this one does not form  
part of the audited financial statements. This has been further 
highlighted by including the word ‘unaudited’ at the start of  
each box header. Unaudited commentary boxes appear on  
pages 85 to 87, 89, 91, 97 to 98, 108 to 109, 111, 115 and 128.
Financial Statements
73 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements
Introduction to the Financial Statements The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts, including the consolidated financial statements and the 
Company financial statements, the Directors’ Report, including the 
Remuneration Report and the Strategic Report, in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
UK Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union, and the Company financial statements and 
the Remuneration Report in accordance with United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising Financial Reporting Standard 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101), and applicable law – 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors 
have also elected to comply with IFRS, issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company on a consolidated and individual basis and of the profit or 
loss of the Company on a consolidated basis for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state that the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS 
as issued by the IASB and IFRS adopted by the European Union 
and, with regard to the Company financial statements, that 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the consolidated financial statements and Company 
financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company, on a consolidated 
and individual basis, will continue in business, in which case there 
should be supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company on a consolidated and individual 
basis, and to enable them to ensure that the consolidated financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. The Directors are also responsible for ensuring 
that the Company financial statements and the Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors in office 
at the date of the approval of this Report are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware and each 
Director has taken all reasonable steps to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of that information.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 34 and 35, confirms that:
• to the best of their knowledge, the consolidated financial 
statements and the Company financial statements, which have

Our opinion
In our opinion:
• National Grid plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) give a true and fair view 
of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the 12 month 
period (the ‘period’) then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (UK GAAP); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the Group, in addition to applying IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also 
applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion, the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts, comprise the financial statements and notes on pages 84 to 171 
with the exception of the unaudited commentary sections. Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, 
rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and applicable law. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Company financial 
statements is United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (UK GAAP), and applicable law.

Highlights of what we reported to the Audit Committee
• the disposal of the UK Gas Distribution business on 31 March 2017 has had a number of significant 
accounting and control implications for National Grid, and was a major driver of our audit effort this year;
• while areas for improvement remain, in particular Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE), there has 
been progress on improving the US financial control environment;
• although they contain significant judgements, estimates for pensions and environmental provisions  
fall within what we consider to be an acceptable range. The significant increase in US environmental 
provisions and the sectionalisation of the UK pension scheme this year meant there was increased 
risk in these two areas; and
• with respect to revenue, capital expenditures, and treasury we completed our work in accordance 
with our audit plan and had no specific matters of concern to report.
Our audit team
In identifying our audit team for National Grid we focused on continuity and relevant industry experience. The disposal of the UK Gas 
Distribution business necessitated additional senior team members for the corporate centre and UK audits, with a new separate team 
for the audit of UK Gas Distribution following separation from the UK business in September 2017. 
This is my fifth and final year working on the National Grid audit and second as Senior Statutory Auditor. I have also been the Senior Statutory 
Auditor for three other large LSE Listed companies. With regards to the components, our US lead partner has had four years of involvement and 
our UK lead partner has two years of involvement on the National Grid audit. The UK and US lead partners and I all have significant electricity 
and gas utility audit experience, averaging 15 years each. Our core audit team, excluding specialists who support us in treasury, accounting 
technical, IT, tax, pensions, and valuations comprises approximately 74 people. At manager grade and above we have continuity from the prior 
year of 79% and an average of three years’ experience on the National Grid audit and six years of electricity and gas utility audit experience.
Context for our audit
Our recurring areas of focus largely reflect National Grid’s key activities of network investment and the associated financing, where it seeks to 
maximise returns allowable under the regulatory frameworks in the UK and US, as well as fulfilling their social and environmental responsibilities 
and remunerating their staff. 
The most notable development during the year was the completion, on 31 March 2017, of the partial disposal of the UK Gas Distribution 
business. This was a complex transaction with significant accounting and control implications for the Group. 
Financial Statements
75 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements
Independent auditors’ report
to the Members of National Grid plc How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group 
operates. The UK Electricity Transmission, UK Gas Transmission, UK Gas Distribution and US Regulated businesses required an audit of their 
complete financial information due to their size. In respect of the UK Gas Distribution business, as a result of the hive out into a separate legal 
entity on 1 October 2016, we have determined that it is appropriate to treat it as two separate components for the 2016/17 audit. This is 
consistent with the way in which we will perform stand-alone audits of UK Gas Distribution and the way in which its results will be reported 
within the Group consolidation.
The Group has a number of separate operations in the US and UK and each of these operations maintain their own accounting records  
and report to the Group through an integrated consolidation system. For this reason we used component auditors within PwC UK and PwC  
US who are familiar with the local laws and regulations to perform this audit work. We ensured our involvement in the work of our component 
auditors was sufficient to allow us to conclude on our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. Given our audit areas of focus,  
the Group team visited both the UK and US component teams on a number of occasions for meetings with our team and local National Grid 
management.
The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and corporate activities including tax, treasury related activities and UK pensions 
were audited by the Group team using specialists where appropriate. The charts on the following page illustrate the in scope coverage 
obtained from the territories and functions where we performed our audit work.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on 
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial 
statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Area Commentary
Overall Group materiality
£175m (2016: £157m)
£175 million (2016: £157 million) is 5% of profit before tax, exceptional items and 
remeasurements (‘adjusted profit before tax’). While the benchmark has not changed,  
this is higher than the level we set for last year reflecting the increased profitability of  
the Group during the period.
Rationale for benchmark applied
5% of total profit before tax, exceptional 
items and remeasurements
We have chosen total adjusted profit before tax because it is the consistent year-on-year 
measure of performance used by management and excludes the non-recurring disproportionate 
impact of exceptional items and remeasurements. We also considered this measure to be 
suitable having compared it to other benchmarks: our materiality is 6.0% of total statutory 
profit before tax, 0.3% of total assets and 0.9% of net assets.
Given the disposal of the UK Gas Distribution business, we considered whether a change 
to materiality was required in order to reflect only continuing operations. As the transaction 
completed on the final day of the year, we did not consider this appropriate as in total income 
statement terms there has been no change in the Group comparing 2016/17 and 2015/16.
Component performance materiality In planning our audit we allocate a specific performance materiality to each of our component 
audit teams. This is used to determine the extent of our audit procedures at a component level 
for the purposes of reporting on the National Grid Group financial statements. These are 
summarised below:

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus and what we reported to the Audit Committee
Accounting for the disposal of the UK Gas Distribution 
business
National Grid’s disposal of a 61% majority stake in the UK Gas 
Distribution business on 31 March 2017 was a significant transaction 
for the Group.
The key financial reporting implications of the disposal included 
the following:
• accounting for the legal separation of the UK Gas Distribution 
business, including a Group and Gas Distribution re-financing 
exercise and an assessment of any tax implications;
• sectionalisation of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme  
prior to sale;
• calculation of the net gain on sale of £5.3 billion, including 
consideration of costs associated with the transaction;
• loss of control and deconsolidation of UK Gas Distribution 
under IFRS 10;
• classification of the retained interest as an investment in associate, 
and the determination of the investment fair value and provisional 
purchase price allocation;
• the design, implementation and operation of internal controls 
specific to the key steps of the transaction; and
• disclosure within the financial statements, including presenting 
the results of the UK Gas Distribution business as ‘discontinued’ 
and key judgements applied to the restatement of comparative 
information. 
Change in level of risk year-on-year: Increased
Because of the completion of the transaction in the current period.
The disposal had a significant impact on our audit for 2016/17. To 
address this area of focus, our procedures included, among others:
• testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
controls over the separation of the UK Gas Distribution business;
• testing of controls and underlying transaction data relating to the 
UK Gas Distribution business for the period up until disposal and 
assessment of the approach taken by management to restate 
prior periods to separately present the UK Gas Distribution 
business as a discontinued operation;
• validating the accuracy of the net gain on sale of £5.3 billion 
presented within discontinued operations;
• involvement of our tax specialists to assess the tax implications 
of the disposal;
• consideration of the classification as an associate and valuation 
of the retained investment in the UK Gas Distribution business 
as an associate, including involving our valuation specialists; and
• assessing the adequacy of the Group’s financial statement 
disclosures relating to discontinued operations, exceptional items, 
and investments in joint ventures and associates.
We noted no material issues arising from this testing.
Financial Statements
77 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus and what we reported to the Audit Committee
Accuracy of capital expenditures
A key focus for National Grid is network investment with total 
capital expenditures across the Group of £4.3 billion during 2016/17 
(2015/16: £3.9 billion).
Depending upon its nature, expenditure may be capitalised as PPE 
or expensed in the year the cost is incurred. In making this decision 
the Directors have to consider whether the expenditure will generate 
future economic benefits which necessarily involves judgement, for 
example in determining whether activities or items are adding value 
or maintaining existing assets.
Specifically in relation to the US, following matters arising last year, 
management have implemented new review controls in order to 
reduce the risk of misstatement, however there is a continuing risk 
that the controls over:
• the classification of costs between PPE and expenses 
in relation to small value work orders; and
• the transfer of assets under construction to assets in service
may not have been working effectively throughout the period. 
In addition, there are complex adjustments required to translate 
local PPE accounting records prepared under generally accepted 
accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP) to comply 
with IFRS.
Change in level of risk year-on-year: No change
Due to the volume and complexity of transactions.
We assessed whether the Group’s accounting policies in relation to 
the capitalisation of expenditures complied with IFRSs, and tested 
the implementation of those policies through a combination of 
controls testing, including IT General Controls over the PPE 
accounting systems, and substantive testing of the supporting 
documentation behind the costs and we found no material issues 
that would impact our audit approach.
In the US, we performed additional testing to ensure the 
completeness and accuracy of capitalisation. Our procedures 
included stratification of the work orders into populations with 
similar risks, such as low value and aged, with testing designed 
to provide a high level of assurance.
With respect to the IFRS adjustments to US GAAP reporting, we 
tested the analysis to underlying accounting records, recalculations 
and supporting documentation. Our testing of plant capitalisation and 
IFRS adjustments to plant identified potential misstatements which 
were reported to the Audit Committee but which were considered 
immaterial for adjustment.
In the UK, we focused our testing on the capital expenditures that 
had the most significant value with a particular focus on Electricity 
Transmission which is the largest area of UK capital expenditures. 
As part of our testing, we inspected contracts and underlying invoices, 
to ensure the classification between capital and operating expenditure 
was appropriate. We reviewed the ageing of the assets under 
construction balance for indicators of impairment and key judgements 
associated with the PPE balance. Our approach is supported by 
comfort obtained from our testing of the key controls within the 
PPE process, which included reconciliations and controls over 
classification. We found one classification adjustment between 
PPE categories which was adjusted by management.
Accuracy and valuation of treasury derivative transactions
In order to fund its activities, at 31 March 2017 National Grid had 
total borrowings of £28.6 billion, of which £6.8 billion is denominated 
in currencies other than Sterling or US Dollars, which exposes the 
Group to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group has a significant treasury operation with sophisticated 
risk management activities and uses financial instruments including 
complex derivatives to manage the foreign exchange and interest 
rate risks, primarily interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest 
rate swaps.
The valuation of a number of the derivative contracts entered into 
by National Grid is a complex and judgemental area and includes 
key assumptions over estimates of future interest and exchange  
rates, and determination of appropriate discount rates to apply 
to future cash flows.
Change in level of risk year-on-year: Increased
There was a significant increase in transactional activity as a 
result of the refinancing exercise related to the disposal of the 
UK Gas Distribution business, which increased the level of risk.
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of IT General 
Controls including user access, change management and 
segregation of duties within the treasury management system and 
we found no material issues that would impact our audit approach.
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls that 
relate to recording and valuing derivative transactions in the treasury 
management system. We also tested the accuracy and completeness 
of the information held within the system by agreeing to third-party 
confirmations and found no differences when compared to the 
system data.
We tested the models and key assumptions used by management 
to value complex derivatives which were agreed as appropriate. 
Where management entered into new significant contracts in the 
year, we tested the contracts and assumptions used to assess 
whether the accounting treatment adopted is in accordance with 
IAS 39.
In respect of the refinancing exercise undertaken as part of the 
disposal of the UK Gas Distribution business, we substantively tested 
to third-party documentation the transactions undertaken, including 
the buyback, novation and new issuance of debt, and changes in the 
associated hedges. We also audited related accounting judgements 
including the discontinuance of hedge relationships and valuation. 
We challenged management as to the treatment of the £1.3 billion 
related costs as part of the net gain on sale, and from reviewing 
minutes of meetings, financial strategy papers and presentations  
we found no evidence to suggest these costs were not related to  
the transaction. We had no material issues arising from this work.

Independent auditors’ report

Accounting for net pension obligations
National Grid provides defined pension and other post-employment 
benefits to employees in the UK and US through a number of 
schemes. At 31 March 2017, National Grid’s gross defined benefit 
obligation is £26.3 billion which is offset by scheme assets of  
£24.4 billion which are significant in the context of both the overall 
balance sheet and the results of the Group.
The valuation of the pension liability requires significant levels 
of judgement and technical expertise in choosing appropriate 
assumptions. Changes to the key assumptions including salary 
increases, inflation, discount rates, and mortality can have a  
material impact on the calculation of the liability.
Also, the pension plan assets include a number of investments for 
which there is no observable input to the fair value (i.e. no quoted 
market price); the valuation technique used to measure the fair 
value of these assets involves a number of subjective judgements.
Change in level of risk year-on-year: Increased
The significance of a number of inputs to the valuation coupled  
with the sectionalisation of the pension scheme means there is 
increased risk around the Group’s pension accounting in 2016/17.
We have tested the significant judgements made by National  
Grid’s third-party actuaries and assessed their independence  
and competence as set out below and we found no material  
issues that would impact our audit approach.
We agreed the discount and inflation rates used in the valuation 
of the pension liability to our internally developed benchmarks.  
We compared the assumptions around salary increases and  
mortality to national and industry averages. All of the assumptions 
used fell within our acceptable range.
We obtained details of the measurement of fair value for assets 
with unobservable inputs. Such assets were typically private equity 
or real estate fund investments for which we obtained audited 
financial statements in support of the measurement of net asset 
value. We found no material issues from this testing.
The major accounting impact of sectionalisation of the National  
Grid UK Pension Scheme is on the individual subsidiaries within  
the National Grid Group. For Group purposes, the key consequence  
of sectionalisation was the need to determine the value of the section 
disposed of with the UK Gas Distribution business. In this regard,  
we confirmed that the assets and liabilities had been split in 
accordance with the Deed of Sectionalisation, by obtaining evidence 
of the Trustees’ expert independent verification of these splits. In 
addition, we reviewed the accounting for one-off payments to the 
scheme. We had no material issues arising from this work.
Valuation of environmental provisions
Over time National Grid has acquired, owned and operated a 
number of businesses that have created an environmental impact 
that will require remediation. This is particularly significant in the US 
partly as a result of National Grid’s exposure to certain ‘Superfund’ 
sites. At 31 March 2017 the total liability in respect of environmental 
provisions is £1.7 billion, of which £1.5 billion relates to the US.
Environmental provisions require significant judgement in 
determining the form of remediation and the timing and value of 
projected cash flows associated with it, including the impact of 
regulation, accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, 
transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and 
changes in the discount rate.
Change in level of risk year-on-year: Increased
The level of risk has increased due to the increase in US provisions 
during the period.
In the US and UK, National Grid uses external and internal experts 
to help determine the total expenditure required to remediate sites. 
As part of the audit we obtained and inspected these experts’ reports 
and assessed their independence and competence and we found 
no material issues that would impact our audit approach.
For all material sites and a sample of other sites, we corroborated 
information on the nature of each of these sites to National Grid’s 
underlying site usage records. In addition, to assess the reliability 
of the experts’ estimates, we compared previous estimates against 
actual spend for sites which have been remediated, without 
material issue.
In the US, due to the individually significant sites, we utilised our own 
environmental specialists to review management key assumptions 
underlying the calculations. Where possible we confirmed other 
inputs into the calculations by reference to publicly available 
information and noted no exceptions. 
We inspected responses to our confirmation requests from 
National Grid’s legal advisors in order to identify any issues related 
to the valuation of the Group’s exposure to environmental 
remediation costs and noted no issues.
In order to assess the reasonableness of management’s discount 
rate assumptions we compared these to our internally developed 
benchmarks, including performing sensitivity analysis. Following 
discussion with management the rates were adjusted with no 
material impact on the financial statements.
Financial Statements
79 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus and what we reported to the Audit Committee
US financial controls
National Grid’s US business is going through a continuing programme 
of process and control improvements. In this period of change there 
is higher risk of error in the financial information reported by the 
US Regulated business.
Change in level of risk year-on-year: Decreased
We are seeing progress on control remediation and additional 
focus on the control environment. We have considered the control 
implications of US plant accounting separately within the accuracy 
of capital expenditures area of focus.
Whilst there has been progress on remediation, US financial control 
continues to be an area of focus for the Audit Committee and our 
audit team. Our audit response is summarised below.
We performed additional testing of key account reconciliations 
across a number of different general ledger accounts, ensuring 
that significant reconciling items were supported with sufficient 
and appropriate documentation. Management continue to operate 
their additional control of preparing an aggregation of unreconciled 
items across all accounts in order to assess the potential impact 
of adjusting for these items. We tested this aggregation to ensure 
it was complete and accurate by agreeing these items to the 
underlying account reconciliations and vice versa. The net impact 
on the income statement if all unsupported reconciling items were 
to be resolved was below our reporting level for the Audit Committee.
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of journal review 
controls and found nothing that would cause us to believe these 
controls were not working as intended. We also tested manual 
journal entries based on a risk assessment of value and nature, 
with no matters requiring reporting to the Audit Committee arising.
Revenue recognition
During 2016/17 National Grid has recognised revenue of £15.0 billion; 
£14.3 billion of which is related to the regulated segments in the UK  
and US.
In the UK, National Grid’s revenue is derived from a number of 
price controls imposed by the UK regulator, Ofgem, which combined 
with the application of IFRS means that revenue recognition involves 
limited judgement. The majority of revenue is derived from a small 
number of customers who settle within agreed terms.
In the US, different services and locations are regulated by different 
authorities and are subject to numerous price controls. Unlike the 
UK, revenue is earned through the transportation and supply of gas 
and electricity to end customers, which does involve judgement 
as a result of the estimate of accrued income for services delivered 
but not yet billed to these customers. This is determined using  
a long-established methodology within the Group.
As such, revenue recognition is not an area of significant risk for 
our audit but does require significant time and resource to audit 
due to the magnitude.
Change in level of risk year-on-year: No change
In the UK, we have tested the design and operating effectiveness of 
key controls in relation to the recognition of revenue, with particular 
focus on controls over the setting of prices compared to those 
allowed by the Ofgem price controls and we found no material 
issues that would impact our audit approach.
We have tested the revenue recognised to amounts invoiced to 
customers and the subsequent receipt of payment from those 
customers, with no material exceptions noted.
In the US, in respect of transmission and other non-utility revenues, 
we selected and tested individual transactions to ensure they were 
appropriately recorded as revenue in the correct period. We inspected 
proof of cash payment or confirmed amounts with customers where 
it was possible to do so. We also inspected regulator-approved 
tariffs to test that amounts charged were consistent with such tariffs. 
We found no material issues arising from our work.
For utility revenues, we selected samples of rate classes to test 
that customer rates were properly updated in the billing systems, 
and that rate types were assigned to customers consistent with 
the type of customer and (where appropriate) the volume of usage. 
We also selected samples of customer bills and tested that such 
bills were paid by customers and were consistent with the regulator-
approved rate plans. For those bills selected that were outstanding 
at the end of the year, we confirmed a sample of balances with 
customers, and tested amounts to subsequent cash receipts 
where no confirmation was received.
With respect to unbilled revenue we tested management’s 
assumptions in relation to consumption by reference to historical 
data as well as specific current year factors, including weather 
patterns. In so doing, we did not note any significant issues  
which would impact the Group financial statements.
Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 92, in relation to going concern. We have nothing 
to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, 
and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit 
we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• the information in the Annual Report and Accounts is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group and Company 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
• the statement given by the Directors on page 74, in accordance 
with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’), that they consider the Annual Report and Accounts 
taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for members to assess the 
Group’s and Company’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
of the Group and Company acquired in the course of performing 
our audit.
• the section of the Annual Report and Accounts on pages 36 to 44, 
as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work  
of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report.
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group 
and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we 
have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 52 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, that 
they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts that  
describe those risks and explain how they are being managed  
or mitigated; or
• the Directors’ explanation on page 52 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to 
how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to  
be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in 
relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of 
making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment  
with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether  
the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by  
us in the course of performing our audit. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you  
if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ Remuneration Report – Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you  
if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration  
specified by law are not made. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions 
of the Code. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review.

81 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 74, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the  
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs  
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and  
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to  
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the  
Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates  
made by the Directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other  
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to  
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain 
audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent  
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With 
respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required  
by applicable legal requirements.

Independent auditors’ report
to the Members of National Grid plc continued Audit opinion for Form 20-F
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statement of financial 
position and the related consolidated income statement, consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated cash flow 
statement and consolidated statement of changes in equity, present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National Grid plc 
and its subsidiaries at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, and  
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended 31 March 2017 in conformity  
with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board and in conformity with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material 
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
31 March 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s 
management is responsible for these financial statements, for 
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for 
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial 
reporting, included in the Additional Information section appearing 
on page 180 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements 
and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based 
on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with 
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform  
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective 
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material 
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, 
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles  
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating 
the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal 
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding 
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that 
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures 
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe  
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors 
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to  
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes  
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies  
or procedures may deteriorate.

84 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements
Consolidated income statement
for the years ended 31 March Unaudited commentary on the consolidated income statement
The consolidated income statement shows income earned and 
expenditure for the year, with the difference being the overall 
profit for the year.
As a result of the sale of a 61% controlling interest in UK Gas 
Distribution, we are required to report our earnings for the 
Group excluding UK Gas Distribution (‘continuing operations’) 
separately from the results of that business, which we report 
within ‘discontinued operations’. Further information is included 
in note 9.
The commentary below relates to continuing operations only.
Revenue
Revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased by  
£1,823 million to £15,035 million. This increase was driven by  
higher revenues in both our UK and US Regulated businesses.  
US Regulated revenues were £1,438 million higher year-on-year 
including favourable impact from foreign exchange, increased 
regulatory revenue allowances and favourable timing of recoveries. 
UK regulated revenues increased by £495 million, including 
increased regulatory allowances, timing over-recoveries and 
increased system balancing revenues. Revenue from Other activities 
decreased, including lower interconnector and metering income.
Operating costs
Operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2017 of  
£11,827 million were £1,840 million higher than the prior year.  
This increase in costs included a £576 million increase in exceptional 
items and remeasurements, which is discussed below. Excluding 
exceptional items and remeasurements, operating costs were 
£1,264 million higher, principally due to the impact of foreign 
exchange rates alongside increased balancing services costs  
in the UK and higher depreciation as a result of newly 
commissioned assets.
Net finance costs
For the year ended 31 March 2017, net finance costs before 
exceptional items and remeasurements were £173 million higher 
than 2015/16 at £1,029 million, mainly as a result of the impact  
of the stronger US dollar, higher UK RPI inflation and increased 
levels of average net debt in continuing operations. 
Tax
The tax charge on profits before exceptional items and 
remeasurements was £62 million higher than 2015/16. This was 
mainly a result of increased taxable profits in the year. The effective 
tax rate for the year decreased to 23.7% (2015/16: 25.0%) reflecting 
settlements relating to prior years partially offset by an increased 
proportion of profits before tax being generated in the US. 
Exceptional items and remeasurements
Operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2017 included  
a £68 million gain on remeasurements of commodity contracts, 
together with £633 million exceptional costs associated with 
environmental charges and gas holder decommissioning.  
In the previous year, operating costs included a net £11 million  
gain on remeasurements of commodity contracts.
Finance costs for the year ended 31 March 2017 included a  
loss of £58 million on financial remeasurements, relating to net 
losses on derivative financial instruments. For the previous year 
ended 31 March 2016, we incurred a loss of £99 million on financial 
remeasurements. Exceptional tax for 2016/17 was a credit of  
£292 million which represents tax credits on the exceptional items 
and remeasurements above, together with a deferred tax credit on 
the recalculation of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction 
in the UK tax rate applicable from April 2020 from 18% to 17%.
Adjusted earnings and EPS from continuing operations
Adjusted earnings and EPS, which exclude exceptional items 
and remeasurements, are provided to reflect results of the Group 
on a ‘business performance’ basis, described further in note 4.

Unaudited commentary on consolidated statement of comprehensive income
The consolidated statement of comprehensive income records certain items as prescribed by the accounting rules. For us, the majority 
of the income or expense included here relates to movements in actuarial assumptions on defined benefit pension schemes and the 
associated tax impact. These items are not part of profit for the year, yet are important to allow the reader to gain a more comprehensive 
picture of our performance as a whole.
Remeasurement gains/(losses) of pension assets and post-retirement benefit obligations 
We had a net gain after tax of £146 million (2015/16: net gain of £315 million; 2014/15: net loss of £462 million) on our pension and other 
post-retirement benefit schemes which is due to changes in key assumptions made in the valuation calculation of pension liabilities and 
differences between the expected and actual pension asset returns.
Exchange adjustments
Adjustments are made when we translate the results and net assets of our companies operating outside the UK, as well as debt and 
derivative transactions designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign currency operations. The net movement for the year resulted 
in a gain of £346 million (2015/16: £69 million gain; 2014/15: £175 million gain).
Net gains/(losses) in respect of cash flow hedges
The value of derivatives held to hedge cash flows is impacted by changes in expected interest rates and exchange rates. The net gain 
for the year was £70 million (2015/16: £88 million gain; 2014/15: £86 million loss).

Unaudited commentary on consolidated statement of changes in equity
The consolidated statement of changes in equity shows additions and reductions to equity. For us, the main items are profit earned  
and dividends paid in the year.
Dividends
The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 29.10 pence per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 44.27 pence per share,  
a 2.1% increase on 2015/16. The Directors intend to target increasing the annual dividend per share by at least the rate of RPI inflation 
for the foreseeable future.

Consolidated statement of financial position
as at 31 March Unaudited commentary on consolidated statement of financial position
The consolidated statement of financial position shows all of 
the Group’s assets and liabilities at the year end. As a capital-
intensive business, we have significant amounts of physical 
assets and corresponding borrowings.
As at 31 March 2017, the Group’s statement of financial position 
no longer includes the assets and liabilities of UK Gas Distribution 
(see note 9). The disposal of these assets and liabilities is referred 
to as ‘disposals’ in the commentaries below.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and intangibles increased by £817 million to £7,019 million 
as at 31 March 2017. This increase primarily relates to foreign 
exchange movements of £843 million and software additions  
of £234 million, partially offset by software amortisation of  
£164 million and disposals of £89 million.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment decreased by £3,539 million to 
£39,825 million as at 31 March 2017. This was principally due to 
capital expenditure of £4,089 million on the renewal and extension 
of our regulated networks and foreign exchange movements of 
£2,669 million, offset by depreciation of £1,535 million in the year 
and disposals of £8,700 million. See page 22 for further details  
of our capital expenditure.
Investments and other non-current assets
Investments in joint ventures and associates, financial and other 
investments and other non-current assets have increased by  
£2,343 million to £3,304 million. This is primarily due to our  
39% retained interest in UK Gas Distribution of £1,611 million 
(classified as an associate) and the related shareholder loan  
of £429 million, an increase in investments in joint ventures  
of £137 million, together with an increase in other investments  
of £95 million and foreign exchange movements of £115 million, 
offset by disposals of £44 million.
Inventories and current intangible assets, trade and  
other receivables and current tax assets
Inventories and current intangible assets, and trade and other 
receivables and current tax assets have increased by £593 million  
to £3,502 million as at 31 March 2017. This is primarily due to  
a net increase in trade and other receivables of £617 million 
(including a foreign exchange movement of £252 million) less 
disposals of £230 million and a £240 million increase in tax 
receivables. The increase in trade and other receivables reflects  
the colder winter, higher gas costs and BSIS cost recoveries.  
This is partly offset by a decrease in inventories and current 
intangible assets of £34 million.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables have increased by £153 million  
to £3,438 million, primarily due to a foreign exchange impact  
of £220 million and movements in the US related to colder  
weather and increased level of accruals offset by disposals  
of £423 million.
Current tax balances
Net current tax liability has changed by £385 million to a net  
current tax asset of £210 million. This is primarily due to a number  
of prior year settlements, reclassification from deferred tax of US  
net operating losses to offset against US current tax liabilities  
and cash payments exceeding tax liabilities following the  
additional costs incurred in relation to the disposal of the  
UK Gas Distribution business.
Deferred tax balances
Deferred tax balances have decreased by £155 million to  
£4,479 million as at 31 March 2017. This is primarily due to  
the disposal of the UK Gas Distribution business offset by  
the deferred tax charge on actuarial gains in reserves and  
foreign exchange movements.
Provisions and other non-current liabilities
Provisions (both current and non-current) and other non-current 
liabilities increased by £245 million to £4,035 million as at  
31 March 2017.
Total provisions increased by £869 million in the year. The 
underlying movements include additions of £633 million, primarily 
relating to an exceptional increase to the provision for estimated 
environmental restoration and remediation costs and other 
increases of £382 million as shown in note 24, together with foreign 
exchange movements of £188 million, offset by utilisation of  
£227 million in relation to all classes of provisions and disposals  
of £94 million. Other non-current liabilities reduced, principally  
due to £910 million of deferred income within UK Gas Distribution.
Net debt
Net debt is the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents, current 
financial and other investments, borrowings, and derivative financial 
assets and liabilities. See further analysis with the consolidated  
cash flow statement on page 90.
Net pension and other post-retirement obligations

Plan liabilities (15,645) (10,663) (26,308)
(156) (1,777) (1,933)
The principal movements in net obligations during the year include 
net actuarial gains of £348 million and employer contributions of 
£1,073 million. Net actuarial gains include gains of £3,334 million 
arising on plan assets resulting from actual asset returns being 
greater than assumed returns which is based upon the discount 
rate at the start of the year. This is partially offset by actuarial losses 
on plan liabilities of £2,986 million arising as a consequence of  
a decrease in the real discount rate giving an actuarial loss of 
£3,431 million in the UK and an increase in the nominal discount 
rate resulting in actuarial gains of £445 million in the US.
Further information on our pension and other post-retirement 
obligations can be found in note 23 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Off balance sheet items
There were no significant off balance sheet items other than the 
contractual obligations shown in note 30(b) to the consolidated 
financial statements, and the commitments and contingencies 
discussed in note 28.
Through the ordinary course of our operations, we are party to 
various litigation, claims and investigations. We do not expect 
the ultimate resolution of any of these proceedings to have a 
material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows 
or financial position.

Cash generated from operations (£m)
Cash flows from our operations are largely stable when viewed 
over the longer term. Our electricity and gas transmission 
operations in the UK are subject to multi-year rate agreements  
with regulators. In the UK, we have largely stable cash flows. 
However, in the US our short-term cash flows are dependent  
on the price of gas and electricity and the timing of customer 
payments. The regulatory mechanisms for recovering costs  
from customers can result in significant cash flow swings from  
year to year. Changes in volumes in the US, for example as a 
consequence of abnormally mild or extreme weather can affect 
revenues, and hence cash flows, particularly in the winter months.
For the year ended 31 March 2017, cash flow from continuing 
operations decreased by £70 million to £4,452 million. Cash inflows 
due to changes in working capital decreased by £265 million over 
the prior year, principally in the US due to the collection of high 
winter 2015 billings last year. The outflow of £768 million from 
changes in pensions and other post-retirement obligations was 
£475 million higher than 2015/16 due to higher levels of 
contributions into the UK and US schemes.
Cash flow from discontinued operations decreased by £151 million  
to £987 million mainly due to £139 million of exceptional  
transaction costs incurred in relation to the disposal of the  
UK Gas Distribution business.
Net capital investment 
Net capital investment for continuing operations in the year of 
£3,638 million was £475 million higher than the prior year. This  
was a result of higher spend in our US Regulated business and 
favourable exchange rates of £280 million, partially offset by lower 
spend in UK Electricity Transmission. Further details of our capital 
investment can be seen on page 22. Net capital investment  
for discontinued operations of £605 million was £28 million  
higher than 2015/16.
Net interest paid (including exceptional interest)
Net interest paid for continuing operations was £788 million,  
£100 million higher than 2015/16 primarily due to the impact  
of exchange rates on our US dollar denominated finance costs.  
Net interest paid and exceptional finance costs for discontinued 
operations in 2016/17 were £1,167 million, £1,044 million higher  
than 2015/16 primarily due to £1,052 million of debt buyback costs  
incurred as part of the Group’s liability management programme  
in relation to the disposal of the UK Gas Distribution business.
Tax paid
Tax paid for continuing operations in the year to 31 March 2017 
was £132 million, £98 million lower than the prior year. This was 
primarily due to lower taxable profits as a result of costs incurred  
in relation to the disposal of the UK Gas Distribution business.
Dividends paid
Dividends paid in the year ended 31 March 2017 amounted to 
£1,463 million. This was £126 million higher than 2015/16, reflecting 
the increase in the final dividend paid in August 2016, together with 
a lower average scrip dividend take-up in the year.
Disposal of UK Gas Distribution
This reflects the cash proceeds received of £5,454 million and  
the £5,890 million of net debt deconsolidated on disposal of UK  
Gas Distribution (see note 27).
Other cash movements
Other cash flows principally arise from movements in treasury 
shares, including the cost of repurchasing shares as part  
of the scrip buyback programme of £189 million (2015/16:  
£267 million), partly offset by dividends from joint ventures  
and associates of £99 million, £27 million higher than 2015/16.
Non-cash movements
The non-cash movements are predominantly due to the strengthening 
of the US dollar against sterling, resulting in movements in foreign 
exchange arising on net debt held in US dollars. In the year, the dollar 
strengthened from $1.44 at 31 March 2016 to $1.25 at 31 March 2017 . 
Other non-cash movements primarily arise from changes in fair values 
of financial assets and liabilities and interest accretions and accruals.

Financial Statements
91 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 1. Basis of preparation and recent accounting developments
Accounting policies describe our approach to recognising and measuring transactions and balances in the year. Accounting policies 
applicable across the financial statements are shown below. Accounting policies that are specific to a component of the financial 
statements have been incorporated into the relevant note.
This section also shows areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty in these financial statements. In addition, 
we summarise new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations and whether these are effective in 2018 
or later years, explaining how significant changes are expected to affect our reported results.
National Grid’s principal activities involve the transmission and 
distribution of electricity and gas in Great Britain and northeastern 
US. The Company is a public limited liability company incorporated 
and domiciled in England and Wales, with its registered office at 
1–3 Strand, London WC2N 5EH.
The Company has its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange 
and is also quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. 
These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue 
by the Board on 17 May 2017.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related 
interpretations as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the EU. 
They are prepared on the basis of all IFRS accounting standards and 
interpretations that are mandatory for periods ended 31 March 2017 
and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS and Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation. The comparative financial information has also been 
prepared on this basis.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis, except for the recording of pension assets and 
liabilities, the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and certain 
commodity contracts and investments classified as available-for-sale.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, which is also the functional currency of the Company.
The financial information relating to prior years has been re-presented 
as a result of the disposal of the UK Gas Distribution business, as 
described in C below. The notes to the financial statements have 
been prepared on a continuing basis unless otherwise stated.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the 
reporting period (see accounting policy E).
A. Going concern
The Directors considered it appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on a going concern basis. The going concern basis 
presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in 
operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least 
one year from the date the financial statements are signed.
B. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with a 
share of the results, assets and liabilities of jointly controlled entities 
(joint ventures) and associates using the equity method of accounting, 
where the investment is carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes 
in the share of net assets of the joint venture or associate, less any 
provision for impairment.
A subsidiary is defined as an entity controlled by the Company. 
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to affect the 
returns of an entity to which it is exposed or to which it has rights.
Losses in excess of the consolidated interest in joint ventures and 
associates are not recognised, except where the Company or its 
subsidiaries have made a commitment to make good those losses.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting 
policies used in the individual financial statements of the Company, 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates into line with those used 
by the Company in its consolidated financial statements under IFRS. 
Intercompany transactions are eliminated.
The results of subsidiaries (other than relating to UK Gas Distribution 
as described in C below), joint ventures and associates acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective 
date of disposal, as appropriate.
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method, where 
the purchase price is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed on a fair value basis and the remainder recognised 
as goodwill.
C. Disposal of UK Gas Distribution
As described further in note 9, on 8 December 2016, the Group 
entered into a sale and purchase agreement to dispose of a 61% 
controlling stake in the UK Gas Distribution business. The disposal 
completed on 31 March 2017 and the Group has retained a 39% 
interest in the business. As a result all assets and liabilities of 
UK Gas Distribution were deemed to be disposed and a 39% 
interest reacquired. The 39% retained interest is classified as an 
associate on the basis that the Group retains significant influence 
over the business through its retained stake. The Group has the 
ability to appoint 4 of the 12 directors to the Board of 
Quadgas HoldCo Limited. 
In addition, the Group entered into a ‘Further Acquisition Agreement’ 
over a further 14% interest. Refer to note 9 for further details.
The Group classified UK Gas Distribution as held for sale as of 
8 December 2016, when it became highly probable that the value 
of the business to the Group would be recovered through sale 
rather than continuing ownership. As UK Gas Distribution represents 
a separate major line of business, the business is classified as a 
discontinued operation in the consolidated income statement. This 
has resulted in the re-presentation of comparative financial information 
in the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, as well as earnings per share (EPS) split 
between continuing and discontinued operations.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
– analysis of items in the primary statements 1. Basis of preparation and recent accounting developments continued
D. Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of  
the Company or subsidiary concerned are recorded at the rates  
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each 
reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at closing exchange rates. 
Non-monetary assets are not retranslated unless they are carried 
at fair value.
Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets 
and liabilities are included in the income statement, except where 
the adoption of hedge accounting requires inclusion in other 
comprehensive income – note 16.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of operations that have a 
functional currency different from the Company’s functional currency 
of pounds sterling, principally our US operations that have a functional 
currency of US dollars, are translated at exchange rates prevailing  
at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated  
at the average exchange rates for the period where these do not  
differ materially from rates at the date of the transaction. Exchange 
differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the 
consolidated translation reserve within other equity reserves – note 26.
E. Areas of judgement and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, 
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the 
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Information about such judgements and estimations is contained 
in the notes to the financial statements, and the key areas are 
summarised below.
Areas of judgement that have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements are as follows:
• Concerning the sale of UK Gas Distribution – note 9:
 – the date from which the business was classified as held 
for sale;
 – the classification of the retained interest in the business, 
and the fair value attributable to it;
 – the accounting implications of the Further Acquisition 
Agreement (FAA) and the embedded put/call options;
 – the allocation of financing costs between the continuing 
Group and discontinued operations; and
 – the identification and classification of costs associated 
with the disposal.
• Categorisation of certain items as exceptional items and  
the definition of adjusted earnings – notes 4 and 7;
• Energy purchase contracts as being for normal purchase,  
sale or usage – note 28; and
• Recognition of surpluses in respect of defined benefit pension 
schemes – note 23.
IFRS provides certain options available within accounting standards. 
Choices we have made, and continue to make, include the following:
• Presentational formats: we use the nature of expense method for 
our income statement and aggregate our statement of financial 
position to net assets and total equity. In the income statement, 
we present subtotals of total operating profit, profit before tax 
and profit from continuing operations, together with additional 
subtotals excluding exceptional items and remeasurements. 
Exceptional items and remeasurements are presented  
separately on the face of the income statement.
• Customer contributions: contributions received prior to 1 July 
2009 towards capital expenditure are recorded as deferred 
income and amortised in line with the depreciation on the 
associated asset.
• Financial instruments: we normally opt to apply hedge accounting 
in most circumstances where this is permitted. For net investment 
hedges, we have chosen to use the spot rate method, rather than 
the alternative forward rate method.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty that have significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets  
and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
• review of residual lives, carrying values and impairment charges 
for other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
– notes 11 and 12;
• estimation of liabilities for pensions and other post-retirement 
benefits – note 23;
• valuation of financial instruments and derivatives – notes 16 
and 30; and
• environmental and decommissioning provisions – note 24.
Concerning the sale of UK Gas Distribution, the principal estimate 
concerns the fair value of the retained interest, which is described 
further in note 9.
In order to illustrate the impact that changes in assumptions could 
have on our results and financial position, we have included sensitivity 
analyses in note 33.
New IFRS accounting standards effective for the year ended 
31 March 2017
The Group has adopted the following amendments to standards:
• Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle;
• Amendments to IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’;
• Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’;
• Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’; and
• Amendments to IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’.
The adoption of these amendments has had no material impact 
on the Group’s results or financial statement disclosures.
Financial Statements
93 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 1. Basis of preparation and recent accounting developments continued
New IFRS accounting standards and interpretations  
not yet adopted
The Group enters into a significant number of transactions that  
fall within the scope of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 
‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’.  
We are assessing the likely impact of these standards on the  
Group’s financial statements.
i) IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (IFRS 9) is effective for National Grid 
in the year ending 31 March 2019. The changes to IFRS 9 principally 
impact the accounting for the classification of financial instruments, 
impairment of financial instruments and hedge accounting. The  
key change influences the future assessment of impairments using  
an ‘expected loss’ method rather than the current ‘incurred loss’ 
method; this will result in impairments typically being recorded earlier. 
To date we have not identified any significant changes to the 
accounting for financial liabilities, the impact on accounting  
for financial assets and derivatives is anticipated to be limited. 
We are currently evaluating the impact of the hedge accounting 
guidance in the new standard. It is possible that changes  
in requirements will allow the opportunity to apply hedge  
accounting in a wider range of scenarios.
ii) IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (IFRS 15)  
is effective for National Grid in the year ending 31 March 2019.  
The new standard provides enhanced detail and a five step  
revenue recognition approach to reflect the transfer of goods  
and services to customers. 
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue 
related to the transfer of promised goods or services when control 
of the goods or services passes to customers. The amount of 
revenue recognised should reflect the consideration to which  
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods  
or services.
This differs from the principle under the current revenue standard 
that requires an assessment of when risks and rewards of goods 
and services are transferred rather than control of those goods 
or services.
Detailed reviews of revenue arrangements in the UK and US  
are under way and will continue into 2017/18 as we finalise our 
assessment of the impact of the new standard. Based on work  
to date we have identified four key areas that require further  
analysis to determine the impact on the Group:
• whether we act as principal or as agent for revenues collected 
on behalf of the Scottish and Offshore transmission operators. 
This is a gross versus net presentational issue that does not 
have an impact on earnings; 
• the timing of recognition of customer contributions for 
connections in the UK and US. In our electricity business in the 
UK we currently recognise customer contributions over time as 
we have an ongoing licence condition to maintain that connection 
over its life. In our gas business in the UK, we recognise customer 
contributions when the connection is completed (the licence 
conditions do not require connections to be maintained over the 
life of the connection and therefore do not have deferred revenue 
for connections). In the US, revenue for customer contributions 
is recognised once work on connections is completed. IFRS 15 
requires revenue to be recognised as control over the distinct 
and separable service is transferred to our customers. We are 
assessing whether this has an impact on the timing of our 
revenue recognition; 
• the timing of recognition of revenue in our metering business; and 
• accounting for certain trade receivables in the US where there is 
historical evidence of irrecoverability.
We plan to apply IFRS 15 using the modified retrospective approach, 
whereby comparatives will not be restated on adoption of the new 
standard but instead a cumulative adjustment will be reflected in 
retained earnings.
iii) IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (IFRS 16) is effective for National Grid in the year 
ending 31 March 2020, subject to EU endorsement. The Group 
enters into a significant number of operating lease transactions  
as well as certain power purchase arrangements. Under IFRS 16,  
our operating leases will be accounted for on the balance sheet  
as ‘right-of-use’ assets. This treatment will increase both our assets 
and liabilities and subsequently, an increase to finance costs and 
depreciation and a reduction in rental costs. The outcome of our 
conclusions will have an impact on how we account for our operating 
leases and power purchase arrangements. We are also performing 
an assessment of our revenue and service contracts to determine 
whether we have the right to use assets under those contracts 
and whether they fall within the scope of IFRS 16. We plan  
to apply IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach,  
whereby comparatives will not be restated on adoption of the  
new standard but instead a cumulative adjustment will be  
reflected in retained earnings.
iv) Other
In addition, the following new accounting standards and amendments 
to existing standards have been issued but are not yet effective or 
have not yet been endorsed by the EU:
• Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’;
• Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payments’;
• Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’;
• Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle;
• IFRIC 22 ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance 
Consideration’;
• Amendments to IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’.
Effective dates remain subject to the EU endorsement process.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the above standards, 
but they are not expected to have a material impact. The Group has 
not early adopted any other standard, amendment or interpretation 
that was issued but is not yet effective.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
– analysis of items in the primary statements continued
94 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 2. Segmental analysis
This note sets out the financial performance for the year split into the different parts of the business (operating segments). We monitor 
and manage the performance of these operating segments on a day-to-day basis.
Our strategy in action
We own a portfolio of businesses that range from businesses with high levels of investment and growth (such as UK Electricity Transmission) 
to cash generative developed assets with lower investment requirements (such as National Grid Metering, included within Other activities).
We generate the majority of our revenue from our regulated operating segments in the UK and US. We work with our regulators to 
obtain agreements that balance the risks we face with the opportunity to deliver reasonable returns for our investors. When investing 
in Other activities we aim to leverage our core capabilities to deliver higher returns for investors.
Our regulated businesses earn revenue for the transmission, distribution and generation services they have provided during the year. 
In any one year, the revenue recognised may differ from that allowed under our regulatory agreements and any such timing differences 
are adjusted through future prices. Our Other activities earn revenue in line with their contractual terms.
Revenue primarily represents the sales value derived from the generation, transmission and distribution of energy, together with the sales 
value derived from the provision of other services to customers. It excludes value added (sales) tax and intra-group sales.
Revenue includes an assessment of unbilled energy and transportation services supplied to customers between the date of the last meter 
reading and the year-end. This is estimated based on historical consumption and weather patterns.
Where revenue exceeds the maximum amount permitted by a regulatory agreement, adjustments will be made to future prices to reflect this 
over-recovery. No liability is recognised, as such an adjustment relates to the provision of future services. Similarly no asset is recognised 
where a regulatory agreement permits adjustments to be made to future prices in respect of an under-recovery. As part of our regulatory 
agreements we are entitled to recover certain costs directly from customers (pass-through costs). These amounts are included in the  
overall calculation of revenue as stipulated by regulatory agreements and explained further on pages 174 to 179.
We present revenue and the results of the business analysed by operating segment, based on the information the Board of Directors uses 
internally for the purposes of evaluating the performance of operating segments and determining resource allocation between operating 
segments. The Board of Directors is National Grid’s chief operating decision-making body (as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’) and 
assesses the earnings performance of operations on the basis of operating profit before exceptional items and remeasurements (see note 4).
There has been no change to the way in which our businesses have reported internally during the year. However, for the purposes of this note, 
the reporting structure for the year ended 31 March 2017 has been updated to show the UK Gas Distribution segment within discontinued 
operations together with the results of our interest in Xoserve Limited, which was previously included within Other activities. Discontinued 
operations are solely within the UK geographical area. National Grid Ventures formed on 1 April 2017 and the impact of this change will  
be reflected in 2017/18.
The following table describes the main activities for each operating segment:
UK Electricity Transmission High voltage electricity transmission networks in Great Britain.
UK Gas Transmission The gas transmission network in Great Britain and UK LNG storage activities.
US Regulated Gas distribution networks, electricity distribution networks and high voltage electricity transmission 
networks in New York and New England and electricity generation facilities in New York.
Other activities primarily relate to non-regulated businesses and other commercial operations not included within the above segments, including: 
UK gas metering activities; the Great Britain-France Interconnector; UK property management; a UK LNG import terminal; US LNG operations; 
US unregulated transmission pipelines; together with corporate activities.
Sales between operating segments are priced considering the regulatory and legal requirements to which the businesses are subject. 
The analysis of revenue by geographical area is on the basis of destination. There are no material sales between the UK and US 
geographical areas.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
– analysis of items in the primary statements continued
96 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements Unaudited commentary on the results of our principal operations by segment – continuing operations
As a business, we have three measures of operating profit (from 
continuing operations) that are used on a regular basis and disclosed 
in this Annual Report. The disposal of UK Gas Distribution is analysed 
separately in note 9.
Statutory operating profit: This is operating profit as calculated 
under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Statutory 
operating profit by segment is shown in note 2 on page 96.
Adjusted operating profit: Adjusted operating profit (business 
performance) excludes items that if included could distort 
understanding of our performance for the year and the comparability 
between periods. Further details of items that are excluded in 
adjusted operating profit are shown in note 4 on page 101.
Regulated financial performance: This is particularly relevant  
for our UK operations and is a measure of operating profit that 
reflects the impact of the businesses’ regulatory arrangements 
when presenting financial performance.
Reconciliations between statutory and adjusted operating profit 
can be found on page 194. Reconciliations between adjusted 
operating profit and regulated financial performance for UK 
Electricity Transmission and UK Gas Transmission can be  
found on page 98.
Commentary on segmental adjusted operating profit results 
– continuing operations
We have summarised the results of our principal operating 
segments here by segment to provide direct reference to the 
results as disclosed in note 2. This analysis has been prepared 
based on adjusted operating profit (operating profit before 
exceptional items and remeasurements) as set out in note 2(b).
UK Electricity Transmission
For the year ended 31 March 2017, revenue in the UK Electricity 
Transmission segment increased by £462 million to £4,439 million 
and adjusted operating profit increased by £199 million to  
£1,372 million.
The revenue growth of £462 million principally reflected the recovery 
of higher pass-through costs such as system balancing costs, 
increased regulated revenue allowances and the impact of higher 
volumes. Net revenue after deducting pass-through costs was  
£199 million higher. Regulated controllable costs were £25 million  
lower reflecting reduced environmental costs. Depreciation and 
amortisation was £31 million higher, reflecting the continued  
capital investment programme. Other costs were £6 million  
lower than prior year including lower asset disposal costs.
Capital expenditure decreased by £57 million compared with  
last year to £1,027 million.
UK Gas Transmission
Revenue in the UK Gas Transmission segment increased by  
£33 million to £1,080 million and adjusted operating profit  
increased by £25 million to £511 million.
After deducting pass-through costs, net revenue was £31 million 
higher than prior year, including increased regulated revenue 
allowances in the year and higher volumes than expected, partly 
offset by lower LNG storage revenues following a site closure. 
Regulated controllable costs were £2 million higher than last year, 
with lower LNG storage costs offset by costs resulting from an 
increase in the number of employees to support higher levels of 
asset health investment. Depreciation and amortisation costs were 
£8 million higher, reflecting ongoing investment. Other operating 
costs were £4 million lower than last year.
Capital expenditure increased to £214 million, £28 million higher 
than last year.
US Regulated
Revenue in our US Regulated business increased by £1,438 million 
to £8,931 million and adjusted operating profit increased by  
£528 million to £1,713 million.
The stronger US dollar increased revenue and operating profit in 
the year by £1,160 million and £184 million respectively. Excluding 
the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, revenue increased 
by £278 million. Increased revenue allowances under new rate 
cases, the benefit of capex trackers and over-recovery of allowed 
revenues due to cold weather were partly offset by lower 
commodity cost recoveries. Overall pass-through costs reduced  
by £231 million (excluding the impact of foreign exchange) resulting 
in an increase in net regulated revenue of £509 million at constant 
currency. Regulated controllable costs increased by £152 million  
at constant currency, partly as a result of increased information 
systems costs, write-offs of prior years’ capital costs and higher 
costs of health care and other benefits. These were partly offset  
by a £32 million decrease in bad debt costs. Depreciation and 
amortisation was £24 million higher this year at constant currency 
as a result of ongoing investment in our networks. Other operating 
costs were £21 million higher at constant currency, reflecting 
increased operating taxes and cost of removal of existing assets.
Our capital expenditure in the US continued to increase with  
£2,247 million of expenditure in the year, £391 million more than  
in 2015/16. At constant currency, this represented a £104 million 
increase in investment driven by higher investment in new and 
replacement gas mains.
Other activities
Revenue in Other activities decreased by £111 million to  
£713 million and adjusted operating profit decreased by  
£193 million to £177 million.
In the US, adjusted operating profit was £80 million lower (including 
£3 million of foreign exchange benefit) partly reflecting higher  
US project development costs. In addition, 2015/16 included a  
£49 million gain on disposal of the Iroquois pipeline. In the UK, 
adjusted operating profit was £113 million lower including lower 
auction revenues from the French Interconnector and increased 
business change costs. Capital expenditure in our Other activities 
was £46 million higher than last year at £247 million.
Financial Statements
97 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements Unaudited commentary on the results of our principal operations by segment – continuing operations continued
Commentary on UK regulated financial performance
The regulated financial performance calculation provides a 
measure of the performance of the regulated operations before 
the impacts of interest and taxation. It adjusts reported operating 
profit under IFRS to reflect the impact of the businesses’ 
regulatory arrangements when presenting financial performance.
Adjustments in calculating regulatory financial performance
The principal adjustments from reported operating profit to UK 
regulated financial performance are:
Movement in regulatory ‘IOUs’: Revenue related to performance 
in one year may be recovered in later years. Revenue may be 
recovered in one year but may be required to be returned to 
customers in future years. IFRS recognises these revenues when  
they flow through invoices to customers and not in the period to 
which they relate.
Performance RAV: UK performance efficiencies are in part 
remunerated by the creation of additional RAV which is expected 
to result in future earnings under regulatory arrangements. 
Pension adjustment: Cash payments against pension deficits 
in the UK are recoverable under regulatory contracts. 
3% RAV indexation: Future UK revenue allowances are expected 
to be set using an asset base adjusted for inflation. These will be 
billed in future periods and recognised under IFRS at that time. A 3% 
RPI inflation assumption is used, reflecting the long-run expectation.
Deferred taxation adjustment: Future UK revenues are expected 
to recover cash taxation costs, including the unwinding of deferred 
taxation balances created in the current year.
Regulatory depreciation: UK regulated revenues include an 
allowance for a return of regulatory capital in accordance with 
regulatory assumed asset lives. This return does not form part 
of regulatory profit.
Fast/slow money adjustment: The regulatory remuneration of 
costs incurred is split between in-year revenue allowances and the 
creation of additional RAV. This does not align with the classification 
of costs as operating costs and fixed asset additions under IFRS 
accounting principles.
UK Electricity Transmission
Regulated financial performance for UK Electricity Transmission 
decreased by 1% to £1,184 million from £1,195 million, principally 
reflecting the lower achieved operational return, driven by lower 
totex outperformance.

2015: £0.2 million).
The Audit Committee considers and makes recommendations to the Board, to be put to shareholders for approval at each AGM, in relation 
to the appointment, re-appointment, removal and oversight of the Company’s independent auditors. The Board of Directors, in accordance 
with a resolution approved at the 2016 AGM, is authorised to agree the auditors’ remuneration. The Audit Committee considers and approves 
the audit fees on behalf of the Board in accordance with the Competition and Market Authority Audit Order 2014. The Board of Directors will 
seek to renew this authority at the 2017 AGM. Details of our policies and procedures in relation to non-audit services to be provided by the 
independent auditors are set out within page 44 of the Corporate Governance Report.
Certain services are prohibited from being performed by the external auditors under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Of the above services,

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
– analysis of items in the primary statements continued
100 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 4. Exceptional items and remeasurements
To monitor our financial performance, we use a profit measure that excludes certain income and expenses. We call that measure 
‘business performance’ or ‘adjusted profit’. We exclude items from business performance because, if included, these items could 
distort understanding of our performance for the year and the comparability between periods. This note analyses these items, which 
are included in our results for the year but are excluded from business performance.
Our financial performance is analysed into two components: business performance, which excludes exceptional items and remeasurements; 
and exceptional items and remeasurements. Business performance is used by management to monitor financial performance as it is considered 
that it improves the comparability of our reported financial performance from year to year. Business performance subtotals are presented on 
the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements.
Management utilises an exceptional items framework that has been discussed and approved by the Group Audit Committee. This follows 
a three-step process which considers the nature of the event, the financial materiality involved and any particular facts and circumstances. 
In considering the nature of the event, management focuses on whether the event is within the Group’s control and how frequently such 
an event typically occurs. In determining the facts and circumstances management considers factors such as ensuring consistent treatment 
between favourable and unfavourable transactions, precedent for similar items, number of periods over which costs will be spread or gains 
earned and the commercial context for the particular transaction.
Items of income or expense that are considered by management for designation as exceptional items include such items as significant 
restructurings, write-downs or impairments of non-current assets, significant changes in environmental or decommissioning provisions, 
integration of acquired businesses, gains or losses on disposals of businesses or investments and significant debt redemption costs as 
a consequence of transactions such as significant disposals or issues of equity.
Costs arising from restructuring programmes include redundancy costs. Redundancy costs are charged to the income statement in the year in 
which a commitment is made to incur the costs and the main features of the restructuring plan have been announced to affected employees.
Remeasurements comprise gains or losses recorded in the income statement arising from changes in the fair value of commodity contracts 
and of derivative financial instruments to the extent that hedge accounting is not achieved or is not effective. These fair values increase or 
decrease because of changes in commodity and financial indices and prices over which we have no control.

Financial Statements
101 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 4. Exceptional items and remeasurements continued
Further detail of operating exceptional items specific to 2016/17
In the US, the Group’s most significant environmental liabilities relate to former manufacturing gas plant (MGP) facilities formerly owned or 
operated by the Company. The sites are subject to both state and federal law in the US. Environmental reserves are re-evaluated at each 
reporting period. The expenditure is expected to be largely recoverable from rate payers but under IFRS, no asset can be recorded for this. 
During the second half of 2016/17, the Group updated its assessment of the gross remediation costs at three key sites in New York, resulting 
in an increase of £481 million on an undiscounted basis.
The charge booked reflects the Group’s best estimate of future cash outflow, based on notices received from state and federal authorities, and 
plans developed in response, supported by external consultants where appropriate. In some cases, judgement is also required regarding the 
Group’s share of the estimated cost, principally at sites where other parties are also potentially liable but where no cost sharing agreement exists.
A provision of £107 million has been made for the demolition of certain non-operational gas holders in the UK. Following the disposal of UK 
Gas Distribution, the land on which the gas holders are sited was transferred to the Group’s UK property division. The Group’s property 
division maximises our return from our land portfolio and therefore a constructive obligation exists to demolish the gas holders.
Also included within the above are charges relating to the impact of a change in the real discount rate from 2% to 1% on our provisions.
Remeasurements
Commodity contracts represent mark-to-market movements on certain physical and financial commodity contract obligations in the US. 
These contracts primarily relate to the forward purchase of energy for supply to customers, or to the economic hedging thereof, that are 
required to be measured at fair value and that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Under the existing rate plans in the US, commodity 
costs are recoverable from customers although the timing of recovery may differ from the pattern of costs incurred.
Net losses or gains on derivative financial instruments comprise losses or gains arising on derivative financial instruments reported in the  
income statement. These exclude gains and losses for which hedge accounting has been effective, which have been recognised directly  
in other comprehensive income or which are offset by adjustments to the carrying value of debt.
Items included within tax
The Finance Act 2016 which was enacted on 15 September 2016 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from 
1 April 2020. Deferred tax balances have been calculated at this rate. 
Deferred taxes at the reporting date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements, 
resulting in a deferred tax credit. This credit is presented as exceptional, reflecting its nature.

102 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 5. Finance income and costs
This note details the interest income generated by our financial assets and interest expense incurred on our financial liabilities. It also 
includes the expected return on our pensions and other post-retirement assets, which is offset by the interest payable on pensions and 
other post-retirement obligations and presented on a net basis. In reporting business performance, we adjust net financing costs to exclude 
any net gains or losses on derivative financial instruments included in remeasurements. In addition, significant debt redemption costs are 
typically treated as exceptional (note 4).

2.  Interest on funding attributable to assets in the course of construction in the current year was capitalised at a rate of 3.4% (2016: 3.3%; 2015: 3.8%). In the UK, capitalised interest  
qualifies for a current year tax deduction with tax relief claimed of £18 million (2016: £19 million; 2015: £24 million). In the US, capitalised interest is added to the cost of plant and qualifies  
for tax depreciation allowances.
3.  Includes a net foreign exchange loss on financing activities of £264 million (2016: £407 million loss; 2015: £636 million gain) offset by foreign exchange gains and losses on derivative  
financial instruments measured at fair value.
4.  Includes a net loss on instruments designated as fair value hedges of £27 million (2016: £34 million gain; 2015: £219 million gain) and a net gain of £60 million (2016: £5 million gain;  
2015: £162 million loss) arising from fair value adjustments to the carrying value of debt. 
Financial Statements
103 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 6. Tax
Tax is payable in the territories where we operate, mainly the UK and the US. This note gives further details of the total tax charge and tax 
liabilities, including current and deferred tax. The current tax charge is the tax payable on this year’s taxable profits. Deferred tax is an 
accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences in the accounting and tax bases of profit.
The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, according 
to the accounting treatment of the related transaction. The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and 
tax laws used to compute the amounts are those that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement, and management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions 
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet liability method and is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. However, deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction (other than a business combination) that affects neither the accounting nor the taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities 
except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based 
on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are 
reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Company and its subsidiaries intend to settle their current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.

2. Prior year adjustment is primarily due to agreement of prior period tax returns.
3. The post exceptional adjustments primarily represent the impact of the Group’s net investment hedging following significant currency fluctuations in the dollar.
4. Other primarily comprises of the benefit due to enhanced deduction available for land remediation expenditure and the presentation of the tax on joint ventures and associates.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Finance Act 2016 which was enacted on 15 September 2016 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from  
1 April 2020. Deferred tax balances have been calculated at this rate.
Continuing focus on tax reform during 2016/17, specifically the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s)  
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project to address mismatches in international rules resulted in draft legislation on areas such  
as interest deductibility being issued during the year. We will continue to monitor developments and assess the potential impact for  
National Grid of these and any further initiatives.
While the UK remains part of the EU, the evolution of the application of EU tax competition regulations continues to create uncertainty  
over tax legislation and at this stage it is not possible to quantify any potential impact on the financial statements.
As the Group’s presence is mainly in the UK and US, we do not envisage a significant impact on the Group following the UK government’s 
decision to invoke Article 50 to leave the EU. 
In the US, there is a possibility of ‘Tax Reform’ which, if enacted, will likely include substantial changes to the federal taxation system. 
The changes under consideration include a significant reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate, deductibility of capital expenditures 
and elimination of many established business tax deductions. The Company continues to monitor various legislative proposals and 
developments impacting corporate taxation.

1.  Exchange adjustments and other comprises of foreign exchange arising on translation of the US dollar deferred tax balances together with a reclassification of £143 million being the opening 
deferred tax balance in respect of US net operating losses to offset against US current tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the 
balances net. The deferred tax balances (after offset) for statement of financial position purposes consist solely of deferred tax liabilities 
of £4,479 million (2016: £4,634 million). Deferred tax asset of £798 million (2016: £667 million) has been recognised in respect of net  
operating losses.
Deferred tax assets in respect of capital losses, trading losses and non-trade deficits have not been recognised as their future recovery 
is uncertain or not currently anticipated. The deferred tax assets not recognised are as follows:

1. Comparative amounts have been re-presented to reflect the classification of the UK Gas Distribution business as a discontinued operation.
The capital losses and non-trade deficits that arise in the UK are available to carry forward indefinitely. However, the capital losses can only 
be offset against specific types of future capital gains and non-trade deficits against specific future non-trade profits. The trading losses arising 
in the US can be carried forward for up to 20 years.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised at the reporting date is approximately £1,101 million (2016: £502 million). 
No liability is recognised in respect of the differences because the Company and its subsidiaries are in a position to control the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, as a result  
of UK tax legislation, which largely exempts overseas dividends received, the temporary differences are unlikely to lead to additional tax.

Tax strategy
National Grid manages its tax affairs in a proactive and responsible 
way in order to comply with all relevant legislation and minimise 
reputational risk. As a regulated public utility we are very conscious 
of the need to manage our tax affairs responsibly in the eyes of our 
stakeholders. We have a good working relationship with all relevant 
tax authorities and actively engage with them in order to ensure 
that they are fully aware of our view of the tax implications of our 
business initiatives. Management responsibility and oversight for 
our tax strategy, which is approved by the Finance Committee, rests 
with the Finance Director and the Group Tax and Treasury Director 
who monitor our tax activities and report to the Finance Committee.
Total UK tax contribution (continuing and discontinued 
operations combined)
This year we have again disclosed additional information in 
respect of our total UK tax contribution for consistency and to aid 
transparency in an area in which there remains significant public 
interest. As was the case in prior years, the total amount of taxes 
we pay and collect in the UK year-on-year is significantly more than 
just the corporation tax which we pay on our UK profits. Within the 
total, we again include other taxes paid such as business rates 
and taxes on employment together with employee taxes and 
other indirect taxes.
The most significant amounts making up the 2016/17 total tax 
contribution are shown in the charts below:
For 2016/17 our total tax contribution to the UK Exchequer was  
£1.5 billion (2015/16: £1.6 billion). Taxes borne in 2016/17 were  
£644 million, a decrease of 8.4% on taxes borne in 2015/16 of  
£703 million primarily due to lower corporation tax payments in  
the current year. The main reason for this is the impact of our debt 
redemption costs during the year ended 31 March 2017, which 
reduced corporation tax instalment payments due for that year.  
Our taxes collected were £887 million, a reduction of 1.3% on 
2015/16 of £899 million. We anticipate our total tax contribution  
to fall next year following the sale of the UK Gas Distribution 
business on 31 March 2017.
Our 2015/16 total tax contribution of £1.6 billion resulted in National 
Grid being the 15th highest contributor of UK taxes based on the 
results of the Hundred Group’s 2016 Total Tax Contribution Survey, 
a position commensurate with the size of our business and 
capitalisation relative to other contributors to the Survey. In 2015, 
we were in 13th position. In 2016 we ranked 9th in respect of 
taxes borne; in 2015, we were in 7th position.
National Grid’s contribution to the UK economy is again broader 
than just the taxes it pays over to and collects on behalf of HMRC. 
The Hundred Group’s 2016 Total Tax Contribution Survey ranks 
National Grid in 3rd place in respect of UK capital expenditure on 
fixed assets, up from 5th place in 2015. National Grid’s economic 
contribution also supports a significant number of UK jobs in our 
supply chain.

Tax transparency
The UK tax charge for the year disclosed in the financial statements 
in accordance with accounting standards and the UK corporation 
tax paid during the year will differ. For transparency we have 
included a reconciliation below of the tax charge per the income 
statement to the UK corporation tax paid in 2016/17.
The tax charge for the Group from continuing operations as reported 
in the income statement is £374 million (2015/16: £427 million
1
).  
The UK tax charge is £151 million (2015/16: £178 million
1
) and UK 
corporation tax paid was £129 million (2015/16: £223 million

Tax losses
We have total unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of  
losses of £375 million (2015/16: £237 million) of which £362 million 
(2015/16: £232 million) are capital losses in the UK as set out on 
page 107. These losses arose as a result of the disposal of certain 
businesses or assets and may be available to offset against future 
capital gains in the UK.
Development of future tax policy
We believe that the continued development of a coherent and 
transparent tax policy in the UK is critical to help drive growth 
in the economy.
We continue to contribute to research into the structure of 
business tax and its economic impact by contributing to the 
funding of the Oxford University Centre for Business Tax at 
the Saïd Business School.
We are a member of a number of industry groups which participate 
in the development of future tax policy, including the Hundred 
Group, which represents the views of Finance Directors of FTSE 
100 companies and several other large UK companies. Our Finance 
Director is Chairman of the Hundred Group. This helps to ensure 
that we are engaged at the earliest opportunity on tax issues which 
affect our business. In the current year we have reviewed and 
responded to a number of HMRC consultations, the subject matter 
of which directly impacts taxes borne or collected by our business, 
with the aim of openly contributing to the debate and development 
of UK tax legislation. We undertake similar activities in the US, 
where the Company is an active member in the Edison Electric 
Institute, the American Gas Association and the Organization  
for International Investment.
Financial Statements
109 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 7. Earnings per share (EPS)
EPS is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each ordinary share. Basic EPS is calculated on profit for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. Diluted EPS shows what the impact would be if all 
outstanding share options were exercised and treated as ordinary shares at year end. The weighted average number of shares is increased 
by additional shares issued as scrip dividends and reduced by shares repurchased by the Company during the year.
Adjusted earnings and EPS, which exclude exceptional items and remeasurements, are provided to reflect the business performance subtotals 
used by the Company. We have included reconciliations from this additional EPS measure to earnings for both basic and diluted EPS to provide 
additional detail for these items. For further details of exceptional items and remeasurements, see note 4.

110 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 8. Dividends
Dividends represent the return of profits to shareholders. Dividends are paid as an amount per ordinary share held. We retain part of the 
profits generated in the year to meet future growth plans and pay out the remainder in accordance with our dividend policy.
Interim dividends are recognised when they become payable to the Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are recognised when they are 
approved by shareholders.

Following completion of the sale of the majority interest in UK Gas Distribution, on 19 April 2017, the Directors declared that an aggregate 
of approximately £3.2 billion would be returned to shareholders through a special dividend of 84.375p per existing ordinary share ($5.4224 per 
existing American Depositary Share). The special dividend is to be paid to those shareholders on the register of members at 19 May 2017.
The Directors are proposing a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 of 29.10p per share that will absorb approximately £1 billion 
of shareholders’ equity (assuming all amounts are settled in cash). It will be paid on 16 August 2017 to shareholders who are on the register 
of members at 2 June 2017 (subject to Shareholders’ approval at the AGM). A scrip dividend will be offered as an alternative.
Unaudited commentary on dividends
Following the announcement of our dividend policy in March 2013, 
the Board remains confident that National Grid is able to support a 
dividend per share growing at least in line with RPI inflation for the 
foreseeable future, while continuing to invest as required in our 
regulated assets.
In August 2014 we began a share buyback programme that will 
allow us to offer the scrip dividend option for both the full-year and 
interim dividend. The buyback programme is designed to balance 
shareholders’ appetite for the scrip dividend option with our desire 
to operate an efficient balance sheet with appropriate leverage.
Financial Statements
111 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 9. Discontinued operations
As a result of the sale of a 61% controlling interest in UK Gas Distribution, we are required to report our earnings for the Group excluding 
UK Gas Distribution (‘continuing operations’) separately from the results of that business, which we report within ‘discontinued operations’.
The gain recognised by the Group on sale is analysed in the detail of the note below. All costs associated with the transaction, including 
those associated with separation and setting up UK Gas Distribution are shown as a deduction from the proceeds received.
Our results and cash flows of significant assets or businesses sold during the year are shown separately from our continuing operations. 
Assets and businesses are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts are recovered through sale rather than through continuing 
use. It only meets the held for sale condition when the assets are ready for immediate sale in their present condition, management is 
committed to the sale and it is highly probable that the sale will complete within one year. Depreciation ceases on assets and businesses when 
they are classified as held for sale and the assets and businesses are impaired if the proceeds less sale costs fall short of the carrying value.
Disposal of UK Gas Distribution
On 8 December 2016 the Group entered into a sale agreement with a consortium of long term infrastructure investors, to dispose of a 61% 
equity interest in the UK Gas Distribution business, principally comprising the Group’s equity and debt interests in National Grid Gas 
Distribution Limited together with certain other assets (principally property and a 45% interest in Xoserve Limited). The Consortium comprises 
Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA), Allianz Capital Partners, Hermes Investment Management, CIC Capital Corporation, Qatar 
Investment Authority, Dalmore Capital and Amber Infrastructure Limited/International Public Partnerships. 
The transaction was contingent on merger clearance from the European Commission, which was received on 16 March 2017, and the 
transaction completed on 31 March 2017. The Group sold its 100% equity interest in UK Gas Distribution to Quadgas HoldCo Limited, a newly 
incorporated UK limited company 61% owned by Quadgas Investments Bidco Limited and 39% by the Group’s subsidiary National Grid 
Holdings One plc. In exchange, the Group received cash consideration of £3,679 million and has recognised a shareholder loan receivable  
of £429 million and a 39% equity interest in Quadgas HoldCo Limited.
In addition, as part of the disposal process, a newly incorporated financing subsidiary of Quadgas HoldCo Limited raised £1,775 million of long  
term debt, secured against the shares in National Grid Gas Distribution Limited, and remitted cash received from this transaction to the Group. 
This amount has been treated as part of the net cash proceeds from the transaction totalling £5,454 million.
The final amount of consideration remains subject to completion adjustments which may result in a further gain/loss on disposal within 
discontinued operations to be reported in 2017/18.
On 31 March 2017, the Group also entered into a Further Acquisition Agreement (FAA) with the Consortium over a 14% interest (relating to both 
our equity and the shareholder loan interests), which includes the pricing mechanism, based on the price paid for the initial 61% interest, and 
an annualised escalation factor. The FAA contains put and call options for both the Group and the Consortium that can be exercised in the 
period between 1 March 2019 and 31 October 2019. 
The FAA is a derivative, and the assumptions which will be used to determine fair value are specific to the contract and not readily observable 
in active markets. Accordingly, it is classified under IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ as a level 3 financial instrument. As the FAA was 
entered into on an arm’s length basis at the balance sheet date its fair value is nil because the exercise price reflects fair value on 31 March 
2017. At future reporting dates, this derivative financial instrument may either be in an asset or a liability position, depending principally on 
business performance against the Consortium’s expectations and movements in interest rates that could impact the annualised escalation 
factor. 
The UK Gas Distribution business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at 8 December 2016, and depreciation and amortisation 
(circa £25 million per month) on tangible and intangible fixed assets ceased from this date. The disposal of UK Gas Distribution resulted in a  
£5.3 billion gain on disposal.
The business represents a reportable segment and a separate major line of business and accordingly has been presented as a discontinued 
operation in the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated cash flow statement. 
The segmental analysis in note 2 has also been re-presented.
In anticipation of the disposal, a process to separate the business from the other UK operations was undertaken. This involved separation 
activities in relation to finance, pensions, human resources, IT, treasury and operational management. These processes took place in the year 
leading up to the sale announcement and physical separation of the businesses occurred in early 2017. The UK Gas Distribution business was 
hived out from National Grid Gas plc into a newly incorporated statutory entity on 1 October 2016.
With respect to treasury activities, a Group-wide financing exercise was undertaken in order to: a) ensure that the proportion of debt to equity 
financing in National Grid Gas Distribution Limited was in line with the requirements of its regulatory licence and the financing structure of the 
business more generally; and b) to optimise the mix of debt in the continuing businesses. The financing exercise involved the buyback of debt 
and derivatives in both of the Group’s UK regulated subsidiaries (National Grid Gas plc and National Grid Electricity Transmission plc) as well 
as the novation of certain instruments to National Grid Gas Distribution Limited, and the issue of new debt by National Grid Gas Distribution 
Limited whilst under the Group’s control prior to the sale completion. Since all these activities formed part of a single exercise, which would 
not have been undertaken in the absence of the sale, all costs have been allocated to discontinued operations.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
– analysis of items in the primary statements continued
112 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 9. Discontinued operations continued
The presentation of the 2016/17 income statement is required to be split between continuing and discontinued operations and to re-present 
results for previous periods in a comparable manner:
• Revenues, operating expenses and operating profits: Discontinued results are closely aligned to the previously disclosed UK Gas 
Distribution segment, with the results of Xoserve Limited re-allocated from within Other activities.
• Interest costs: Since UK Gas Distribution was not independently financed prior to its sale it is necessary to allocate the Group’s overall 
financing cost between continuing and discontinued operations. In doing so, the Group has presented the results of the continuing business 
on a basis consistent with how it expects to finance the Group in future periods, to aid comparability in future periods. Interest costs 
associated with debt and derivatives which remain in the Group as at 31 March 2017 have been attributed to the continuing Group in full. 
Interest cost relating to instruments bought back in the period since the disposal process started, debt novated across, and debt and 
derivatives issued by UK Gas Distribution as part of the financing exercise have been included within discontinued operations. The interest 
costs in the comparative periods for discontinued operations only includes interest that relates to the debt bought back in 2016/17 and the 
debt novated into UK Gas Distribution in 2016/17.
• Tax: Tax follows the amount of revenues, operating costs and interest allocated to discontinued operations. Tax on exceptional items and 
remeasurements includes an allocation of tax credits arising from the change in tax rates.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
– analysis of items in the primary statements continued
114 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 9. Discontinued operations continued
Costs included in the gain on disposal total £1,837 million. These include the direct costs of selling UK Gas Distribution (‘transaction costs’),  
the costs for activities undertaken to prepare and structure the disposal (‘business set-up costs’) and business restructuring costs:
• £1,334 million of these costs relate to the financing exercise undertaken to ensure an appropriate amount of debt was placed in UK Gas 
Distribution. This includes the costs associated with buybacks of debt from the continuing Group, losses on loans novated at fair value 
from the continuing Group to UK Gas Distribution as well as losses from closing out derivatives previously designated as cash flow hedges.
• On 8 December 2016, we announced that a voluntary distribution of £150 million would be made for the benefit of energy consumers on the 
successful sale of UK Gas Distribution. This is a constructive obligation that was triggered on sale of UK Gas Distribution and is included 
within transaction costs. 
• Transaction costs also include professional services fees for the various accounting, legal and consulting work associated with the activities 
to prepare and structure the disposal of UK Gas Distribution.
• Business restructuring costs principally includes severance costs and costs associated with onerous contracts as a result of the disposal 
of UK Gas Distribution.
The gain on sale is subject to the substantial shareholder exemption. A tax credit on the gain on disposal arises principally from costs 
associated with the financing exercise.
Unaudited commentary on the results of discontinued operations
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations comprise primarily the UK Gas Distribution 
and Xoserve businesses. Adjusted operating profit for discontinued 
operations increased by £12 million to £894 million. Operating  
profit from Xoserve decreased by £8 million, reflecting system 
implementation costs. In UK Gas Distribution, adjusted operating 
profit was £20 million higher. Revenue was £36 million lower.  
This primarily reflects the non-recurrence of last year’s revenue  
over-recovery compared to allowance. Pass-through costs were  
£2 million lower and regulated controllable costs were £13 million 
higher including costs resulting from an increase in the number of 
employees. Depreciation and amortisation costs were £84 million 
lower reflecting the cessation of depreciation from 8 December 
2016, being the point at which the business was determined to  
be held for sale. Other costs were £17 million higher this year.
UK Gas Distribution
Regulated financial performance for UK Gas Distribution increased 
to £864 million from £819 million, up 5%. This reflects an increase  
in achieved operational return on equity year-on-year, driven by 
improved totex performance.

Financial Statements
115 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 10. Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of what we paid to acquire businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the acquisition date. 
We assess whether goodwill is recoverable each year by performing an impairment review.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is not amortised, but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes  
in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not  
subsequently reversed.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity  
and translated at the closing exchange rate.
Impairment
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and this allocation is made to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from 
the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Impairments of goodwill are calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the estimated recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit to which that goodwill has been allocated. Recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell and estimated value-in-use at the date the impairment review is undertaken.
Value-in-use represents the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Impairments are recognised in the income statement and are disclosed separately.

Exchange adjustments 170
Net book value at 31 March 2016 5,315

Net book value at 31 March 2017 6,096
The cost of goodwill at 31 March 2017 was £6,112 million (2016: £5,327 million) with an accumulated impairment charge of £16 million  
(2016: £12 million).
The amounts disclosed above as at 31 March 2017 include balances relating to the following cash-generating units: New York £3,512 million 
(2016: £3,061 million); Massachusetts £1,313 million (2016: £1,145 million); Rhode Island £488 million (2016: £426 million); and Federal  
£783 million (2016: £683 million).
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and the recoverability of goodwill has been assessed by comparing the carrying amount of our 
operations described above (our cash-generating units) with the expected recoverable amount on a value-in-use basis. In each assessment, 
the value-in-use has been calculated based on five-year plan projections that incorporate our best estimates of future cash flows, customer 
rates, costs (including changes in commodity prices), future prices and growth. Such projections reflect our current regulatory rate plans  
taking into account regulatory arrangements to allow for future rate plan filings and recovery of investment. Our plans have proved to be  
reliable guides in the past and the Directors believe the estimates are appropriate.
The future economic growth rate used to extrapolate projections beyond five years has been maintained at 2% (2016: 2%). The growth rate  
has been determined having regard to data on projected growth in US real gross domestic product (GDP). Based on our business’ place in  
the underlying US economy, it is appropriate for the terminal growth rate to be based upon the overall growth in real GDP and, given the nature 
of our operations, to extend over a long period of time. Cash flow projections have been discounted to reflect the time value of money, using 
a pre-tax discount rate of 9% (2016: 8%). The discount rate represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital of these operations.
While it is possible that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable change would 
result in an impairment of goodwill, in view of the long-term nature of the key assumptions and the margin by which the estimated fair value 
exceeds the carrying amount.

116 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 11. Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets include software which is written down (amortised) over the length of period we expect to receive a benefit from 
the asset.
Identifiable intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. Other intangible assets 
are tested for impairment only if there is an indication that the carrying value of the assets may have been impaired. Impairments of assets 
are calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the recoverable amount, if lower. Where such an asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which that asset belongs 
is estimated. Impairments are recognised in the income statement and are disclosed separately. Any assets which suffered impairment in a 
previous period are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Internally generated intangible assets, such as software, are recognised only if: an asset is created that can be identified; it is probable that 
the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Where no internally 
generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recorded as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. Amortisation periods for categories 
of intangible assets are:

Financial Statements
117 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 12. Property, plant and equipment
The following note shows the physical assets controlled by us. The cost of these assets primarily represents the amount initially paid for 
them. A depreciation expense is charged to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced value of the asset over 
time. Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of years we expect the asset to be used (useful economic life) and charging the 
cost of the asset to the income statement equally over this period.
Our strategy in action
We operate an energy networks business and therefore have a significant physical asset base. We continue to invest in our networks to 
maintain reliability, create new customer connections and ensure our networks are flexible and resilient. Our business plan envisages these 
additional investments will be funded through a mixture of cash generated from operations and the issue of new debt.
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Cost includes the purchase price of the asset, any payroll and finance costs incurred which are directly attributable to the construction of 
property, plant and equipment as well as the cost of any associated asset retirement obligations.
Property, plant and equipment includes assets in which the Company’s interest comprises legally protected statutory or contractual rights 
of use. Additions represent the purchase or construction of new assets, including capital expenditure for safety and environmental assets, 
and extensions to, enhancements to, or replacement of existing assets.
Contributions received prior to 1 July 2009 towards the cost of property, plant and equipment are included in trade and other payables as 
deferred income and credited on a straight-line basis to the income statement over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets to which 
they relate.
Contributions received post 1 July 2009 are recognised in revenue immediately, except where the contributions are consideration for a future 
service, in which case they are recognised initially as deferred income and revenue is subsequently recognised over the period in which the 
service is provided.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated, on a straight-line basis, at rates estimated to write off their book values over 
their estimated useful economic lives. In assessing estimated useful economic lives, consideration is given to any contractual arrangements 
and operational requirements relating to particular assets. The assessments of estimated useful economic lives and residual values of assets 
are performed annually. Unless otherwise determined by operational requirements, the depreciation periods for the principal categories of 
property, plant and equipment are, in general, as shown in the table below:
Years
Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 65
Plant and machinery:
Electricity transmission plant 15 to 60
Electricity distribution plant 15 to 60
Electricity generation plant 20 to 40
Interconnector plant 15 to 60
Gas plant – mains, services and regulating equipment 30 to 100
Gas plant – storage 15 to 21
Gas plant – meters 10 to 33
Motor vehicles and office equipment up to 10
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within operating profit 
in the income statement.
Items within property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment only if there is some indication that the carrying value of the assets may 
have been impaired.
Impairments of assets are calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the recoverable amount, if lower. Where 
such an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which that asset belongs is estimated.
Impairments are recognised in the income statement and if material are disclosed separately.
Any assets which suffered impairment in a previous period are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

119 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 14. Financial and other investments
Financial and other investments include three main categories. Assets classified as available-for-sale typically represent investments in 
short-term money funds and quoted investments in equities or bonds of other companies. The second category comprises long-term loans 
to our associates and joint ventures. The third category is other loans and receivables which includes bank deposits with a maturity of 
greater than three months, and cash balances that cannot be readily used in operations, principally collateral pledged for certain borrowings.
Financial assets, liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into, 
and recognised on trade date. Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified 
in any other categories.
Available-for-sale financial investments are recognised at fair value plus directly related incremental transaction costs, and are subsequently 
carried at fair value in the statement of financial position. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income, until the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired. At this time the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period. Investment income is recognised using the effective interest 
method and taken through interest income in the income statement.
Loans receivable and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Interest income, together with gains and losses when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, are recognised in the 
income statement.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair values of financial assets measured at fair value that are quoted in active markets are based on bid 
prices. When independent prices are not available, fair values are determined by using valuation techniques that are consistent with techniques 
commonly used by the relevant market. The techniques use observable market data.

4. Refers to collateral placed with counterparties with whom we have entered into a credit support annex to the ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) Master Agreement.
Available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value. The carrying value of loans and receivables is approximate to their fair value, due to 
short-dated maturities or transactions entered into on 31 March 2017 at market terms. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting 
date is the fair value of the financial investments. For further information on our credit risk, refer to note 30(a). None of the financial investments 
are past due or impaired.
Unaudited commentary on financial and other investments
Current available-for-sale investments at 31 March 2017 were £5,481 million higher than at 31 March 2016, primarily reflecting the proceeds 
received on 31 March 2017 relating to the sale of the UK Gas Distribution business.

Investments in joint ventures and associates represent businesses we do not control, but instead exercise joint control or significant influence.
A joint venture is an arrangement established to engage in economic activity, which the Company jointly controls with other parties and has 
rights to the net assets of the arrangement. An associate is an entity which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, but over which the 
Company has significant influence.

On 10 January 2017 the Group announced it had entered into an arrangement with San Francisco-based Sunrun Neptune Investor 2016 LLC,  
a leading US provider of residential solar energy systems to provide investment capital. In the period to 31 March 2017, the Group invested  
£41 million alongside Sunrun into a newly incorporated partnership vehicle. The investment is classified as an associate as the Group has  
significant influence over the activities of the partnership vehicle.
The joint ventures and associates have no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed, and the Group has no significant 
contingent liabilities in relation to its interest in the joint ventures and associates. The Group has capital commitments of £235 million  
(2016: £305 million) in relation to joint ventures.
Outstanding balances with joint ventures and associates are shown in note 29.
At 31 March 2017, the Group had one material joint venture, in respect of its 50% equity stake in BritNed Development Limited, and one 
material associate in respect of its 39% equity stake in Quadgas HoldCo Limited. 
BritNed Development Limited (joint venture)
BritNed Development Limited is a joint venture with transmission system operator TenneT and operates the subsea electricity link between 
Great Britain and the Netherlands, commissioned in 2011.
BritNed Development Limited has a reporting period end of 31 December with monthly management reporting information provided to 
National Grid. Summarised financial information of this joint venture, as at 31 March, together with the carrying amount of the investment

Quadgas HoldCo Limited (associate)
As set out in note 9, on disposal of the Group’s interest in the UK Gas Distribution business, the Group retains an equity interest in UK Gas 
Distribution through its parent, Quadgas HoldCo Limited and a shareholder loan asset of £0.4 billion (see note 14).
The Group has the power to appoint 4 of the 12 members of the board of Quadgas HoldCo Limited, which confers significant influence,  
but not joint control. In general, the key strategic, operational and financial decisions can be effected by a simple majority of votes. However, 
in certain limited circumstances, certain decisions require the consent of both parties. While these circumstances are not expected to occur 
regularly, given the rights conferred, and in view of the Group’s equity stake, the investment has been accounted for as an equity investment 
in an associate.
The Group is required to recognise its 39% interest in Quadgas HoldCo Limited initially at fair value, being the market price of the investment 
as at 31 March 2017. As described in note 9, a Further Acquisition Agreement (FAA) was signed concerning a 14% interest in Quadgas HoldCo 
Limited structured as a put/call option. National Grid can deliver a sell notice to sell the shares in Quadgas HoldCo Limited with at least six 
months’ notice, for closing between 1 March 2019 and 30 June 2019. The Consortium can deliver, a purchase notice to acquire the shares  
in Quadgas HoldCo Limited from 1 July 2019 to 31 October 2019. Since the FAA contains derivative features in the form of put/call options,  
it is required to be accounted for at fair value through profit and loss. On the basis that no premium was paid or received for entering into this 
arrangement, and further that, for the reasons set out in note 9, the arrangement was on market terms at 31 March 2017, the fair value of the 
contract is considered to be zero at year end.
Quadgas HoldCo Limited is an unlisted entity, and so no quoted price exists. The fair value has been determined with reference to the  
equity value of the business implicit in the sale transaction, adjusted to reflect a deduction for the estimated premium paid for control by  
the Consortium. In assigning value to the retained interests, the Group has valued 14% of its 39% interest based on the price implied by  
the FAA. The deduction for control premium has been applied to the residual 25% interest.
The Group is required to complete a purchase price allocation exercise for its interest in Quadgas HoldCo Limited. However, this is not required 
to be finalised until 31 March 2018. In view of the limited time elapsed since 31 March 2017, amounts disclosed below remain provisional.
Summarised financial information of this associate (reflecting provisional fair values) together with the carrying amount of the investment in the 
consolidated financial statements is as follows:

no profit or loss impact noted for the current financial year outside of the amounts disclosed as discontinued operations.

122 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 16. Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of an underlying item such as interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, credit spreads, commodities, equity or other indices. In accordance with Board approved policies, derivatives are transacted to 
manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rate and foreign exchange rate on borrowings and other contractual cash flows. Specifically, 
we use derivatives to manage these risks from our financing portfolio to optimise the overall cost of accessing the debt capital markets. 
These derivatives are analysed below. We also use derivatives to manage our operational market risks from commodities. The commodity 
derivative contracts are detailed in note 30(e).
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date. 
Changes in fair values are recorded in the period they arise, in either the income statement or other comprehensive income depending 
on the applicable accounting standards. Where the fair value of a derivative is positive it is carried as a derivative asset, and where negative 
as a derivative liability.
We calculate fair value of the financial derivatives by discounting all future cash flows using the market yield curve at the reporting date. 
The market yield curve for each currency is obtained from external sources for interest and foreign exchange rates. In the absence of 
sufficient market data, fair values would be based on the quoted market price of similar derivatives. Analysis of these derivatives and the 
various methods used to calculate their respective fair values is detailed below and in note 30.
For each class of derivative instrument type the total fair value amounts are as follows:

Financial Statements
123 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 16. Derivative financial instruments continued
Where possible, derivatives held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39. Derivatives may qualify  
as hedges for accounting purposes if they are fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Our use of derivatives may  
entail a derivative transaction qualifying for one or more hedge type designations under IAS 39.
Hedge accounting allows derivatives to be designated as a hedge of another non-derivative financial instrument, to mitigate the impact 
of potential volatility in the income statement of changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments. To qualify for hedge accounting, 
documentation is prepared specifying the hedging strategy, the component transactions and methodology used for effectiveness 
measurement. National Grid uses three hedge accounting methods, which are described as follows:
Fair value hedges
Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of 
fixed-rate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates. For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair 
value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item in relation to the risk being hedged are offset in the income statement to the 
extent the fair value hedge is effective. Adjustments made to the carrying amount of the hedged item for fair value hedges will be amortised 
over the remaining life, in line with the hedged item.
2017
£m
2016
£m
Cross-currency interest rate/interest rate swaps 548 482
Cash flow hedges
Exposure arises from the variability in future interest and currency cash flows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates or 
are in a foreign currency. Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are maintained, and designated as cash flow hedges, where they qualify, to 
manage this exposure. Fair value changes on designated cash flow hedges are initially recognised directly in the cash flow hedge reserve, as 
gains or losses recognised in equity, and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts are transferred 
from equity and recognised in the income statement as the income or expense is recognised on the hedged item.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash flows. Where these contracts qualify 
for hedge accounting they are designated as cash flow hedges. On recognition of the underlying transaction in the financial statements, 
the associated hedge gains and losses, deferred in equity, are transferred and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is transferred to the 
income statement.
Where a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability results from a forecast transaction or firm commitment being hedged, the amounts 
deferred in equity are included in the initial measurement of that non-monetary asset or liability.

Net investment hedges
Borrowings, cross-currency swaps and forward currency contracts are used in the management of the foreign exchange exposure arising 
from the investment in non-sterling denominated subsidiaries. Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting they are designated as 
net investment hedges.

Cross-currency interest rate swaps (544) (199)

The cross-currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are hedge accounted using the spot to spot method. The foreign exchange 
gain or loss on retranslation of the borrowings and the spot to spot movements on the cross-currency swaps and forward currency contracts 
are transferred to equity to offset gains or losses on translation of the net investment in the non-sterling denominated subsidiaries, with any 
ineffective portion recognised immediately in the income statement.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
– analysis of items in the primary statements continued
124 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 16. Derivative financial instruments continued
Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship
Our policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes. However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39 some 
derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate. 
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in remeasurements within 
the income statement.

Discontinuation of hedge accounting
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gains or losses relating to cash flow hedges recognised in equity are initially retained in equity 
and subsequently recognised in the income statement in the same periods in which the previously hedged item affects profit or loss, unless 
the hedged item is no longer expected to occur and then the amounts would be recognised immediately. Amounts deferred in equity with 
respect to net investment hedges are subsequently recognised in the income statement in the event of the disposal of the overseas 
operations concerned. For fair value hedges, the cumulative adjustment recorded to the carrying value of the hedged item at the date 
hedge accounting is discontinued is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Embedded derivatives
No adjustment is made with respect to derivative clauses embedded in financial instruments or other contracts that are defined as closely 
related to those instruments or contracts. Consequently these embedded derivatives are not accounted for separately from the debt 
instrument. Where there are embedded derivatives in host contracts not closely related, the embedded derivative is separately accounted 
for as a derivative financial instrument.
17. Inventories and current intangible assets
Inventories represent assets that we intend to use in order to generate revenue in the short term, either by selling the asset itself (for 
example fuel stocks) or by using it to fulfil a service to a customer or to maintain our network (consumables).
Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Where applicable, cost comprises direct materials and direct labour costs as well as those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition.
Emission allowances, principally relating to the emissions of carbon dioxide in the UK and sulphur and nitrous oxides in the US, are recorded 
as intangible assets within current assets and are initially recorded at cost and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Where emission allowances are granted by relevant authorities, cost is deemed to be equal to the fair value at the date of allocation. Receipts 
of such grants are treated as deferred income, which is recognised in the income statement as the related charges for emissions are 
recognised or on impairment of the related intangible asset. A provision is recorded in respect of the obligation to deliver emission allowances 
and emission charges are recognised in the income statement in the period in which emissions are made.

Financial Statements
125 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 18. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are amounts which are due from our customers for services (and commodities in the US) we have provided. 
Other receivables also include prepayments made by us, for example, property lease rentals paid in advance.
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and other than in respect of commodity contract assets, subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, less any appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Commodity contract assets are recorded 
at fair value. A provision is established for irrecoverable amounts when there is objective evidence that amounts due under the original 
payment terms will not be collected.

126 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 19. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances, together with short-term investments with an original maturity of less than three months 
that are readily convertible to cash.
Net cash and cash equivalents reflected in the cash flow statement are net of bank overdrafts, which are reported in borrowings. The carrying 
amounts of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts approximate their fair values.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits are made for periods varying between one 
day and three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
Net cash and cash equivalents held in currencies other than sterling have been converted into sterling at year-end exchange rates. For further 
information on currency exposures, refer to note 30(d).

insurance companies. £940 million (2016: £1 million) comprises short-term money fund deposits.
20. Borrowings
We borrow money primarily in the form of bonds and bank loans. These are for a fixed term and may have fixed or floating interest rates 
or are linked to RPI. As indicated in note 16, we use derivatives to manage risks associated with interest rates and foreign exchange.
Our strategy in action
Our price controls and rate plans require us to fund our networks within a certain ratio of debt to equity and, as a result, we have issued 
a significant amount of debt. As we continue to invest in our networks, the value of debt is expected to increase over time. To maintain a 
strong balance sheet and to allow us to access capital markets at commercially acceptable interest rates, we balance the amount of debt 
we issue with the value of our assets, and take account of certain other metrics used by credit rating agencies.
Borrowings, which include interest-bearing and inflation linked debt and overdrafts, are recorded at their initial fair value which normally reflects 
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs less any repayments. Subsequently these are stated at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest method. Any difference between the proceeds after direct issue costs and the redemption value is recognised over the term of the 
borrowing in the income statement using the effective interest method.

£19,692 million (2016: £18,180 million), calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The notional amount outstanding of the 
debt portfolio at 31 March 2017 was £28,310 million (2016: £27,836 million).
The assets of the Colonial Gas Company and the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation and certain gas distribution assets of the Narragansett 
Electric Company are subject to liens and other charges and are provided as collateral over borrowings totalling £440 million at 31 March 2017 
(2016: £385 million).
Collateral is placed with or received from any counterparty where we have entered into a credit support annex to the ISDA Master Agreement 
once the current mark-to-market valuation of the trades between the parties exceeds an agreed threshold. Included in current bank loans is 
£709 million (2016: £610 million) in respect of cash received under collateral agreements. For further details of our borrowing facilities, refer  
to note 31. For further details of our bonds in issue, please refer to the debt investor section of our website.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments on inception. 
The corresponding liability is recognised as a finance lease obligation within borrowings. Rental payments are apportioned between finance 
costs and reduction in the finance lease obligation, so as to achieve a constant rate of interest.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life and the lease term.

finance leases and other debt had increased by £294 million. We expect to repay £5,496 million of our total borrowings in the next 12 
months including commercial paper, collateral and interest, and to fund this repayment through the capital and money markets and surplus 
cash. The average long-term debt maturity of the portfolio is 11 years (2016: 12 years). Further information on our bonds can be found in

23. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
Substantially all our employees are members of either DB (defined benefit) or DC (defined contribution) pension plans. The principal UK 
plans are the National Grid UK Pension Scheme, the National Grid Electricity Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme and the 
National Grid YouPlan. In the US, we have a number of plans and also provide healthcare and life insurance benefits to eligible retired 
US employees.
The fair value of associated plan assets and present value of DB obligations are updated annually in accordance with IAS 19 (revised).
We separately present our UK and US pension plans to show geographical split. Below we provide a more detailed analysis of the 
amounts recorded in the primary financial statements and the actuarial assumptions used to value the obligations.
When deciding on these assumptions we take independent actuarial advice. Comparatively small changes in the assumptions applied 
may have a significant effect on the overall deficit or surplus of a DB pension plan.
For DC pension plans, National Grid pays contributions into separate funds on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations 
to employees. The risks associated with this type of plan are assumed by the member.
For DB pension plans, members receive benefits on retirement, the value of which is dependent on factors such as salary and length 
of pensionable service. National Grid underwrites both financial and demographic risks associated with this type of plan.
The cost of providing benefits in a DB plan is determined using the projected unit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out 
at each reporting date by a qualified actuary. This valuation method is an accrued benefits valuation method that makes allowance 
for projected earnings.
Financial Statements
129 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 23. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued
National Grid’s obligation in respect of DB pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by projecting the estimated amount of future 
benefit payments that employees have earned for their pensionable service in the current and prior periods. These future benefit payments 
are discounted to determine the present value of the liabilities and the fair value of plan assets and any unrecognised past service cost is 
then deducted. The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high-quality corporate bonds.
National Grid takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of any key assumptions applied which include 
life expectancy of members, expected salary and pension increases, and inflation. Comparatively small changes in the assumptions used  
may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the income statement and the statement of other comprehensive income and  
the net liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
Remeasurements of net retirement obligations are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of other 
comprehensive income.
Risks
The DB pension obligations and other post-retirement benefit liabilities are exposed to the primary risks outlined below.
Liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds prevailing in the US and UK debt 
markets and will fluctuate as yields change. Plan funds are invested in a variety of asset classes, principally: equities, government securities, 
corporate bonds and property. Consequently, actual returns will differ from the underlying discount rate adopted and therefore have an 
impact on the net balance sheet liability.
Changes in inflation will affect both current and future pension payments and are partially mitigated through investment in inflation matching 
assets and hedging instruments.
Longevity is also a key driver of liabilities and changes in expected mortality will have a direct impact on liabilities. The liabilities are, 
in aggregate, relatively mature which serves to mitigate this risk to some extent.
Each plan’s investment strategy seeks to balance the level of investment return sought with the aim of reducing volatility and risk. 
In undertaking this approach reference is made both to the maturity of the liabilities and the funding level of that plan. A number of 
further strategies are employed to manage underlying risks, including liability matching asset strategies, diversification of asset portfolios, 
interest rate hedging and management of foreign exchange exposure.
UK pension plans
National Grid’s DB pension arrangements are funded with assets held in separate trustee administered funds. The arrangements are managed  
by trustee companies with boards consisting of company and member appointed directors. The directors are required to manage the 
arrangements in accordance with local regulations and the arrangements’ governing documents, acting on behalf of their beneficiaries.
The arrangements are subject to independent actuarial funding valuations at least every three years and following consultation and agreement 
with us, the qualified actuary certifies the employers’ contribution, which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees 
and proceeds from the plans’ assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable.

National Grid UK Pension Scheme
Following the actuarial valuation at 31 March 2013, deficit contributions were paid to the National Grid UK Pension Scheme of £99 million  
in 2014/15, £100 million in 2015/16 and £101 million in 2016/17.
The last full actuarial valuation for the National Grid UK Pension Scheme was carried out at 30 September 2015. Based on long-term financial 
assumptions, the contribution rate agreed to meet future benefit accrual was 36% of pensionable earnings (currently 31% by employers and 5% 
by employees). In addition, National Grid makes payments to the scheme to cover administration costs and the Pension Protection Fund levy. 
With effect from 1 January 2017, sectionalisation of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme was carried out in anticipation of the disposal of 
UK Gas Distribution. The National Grid UK Pension Scheme was split into three sections, each of which are legally and actuarially separate. 
Section A and Section B are supported by companies within the National Grid Group and Section C is supported by Cadent Gas Limited 
(previously National Grid Gas Distribution Limited). The disposal of UK Gas Distribution completed on 31 March 2017 and the figures shown in 
these financial statements cover all three sections for amounts recognised in the income statement and the statement of other comprehensive 
income. At the reporting date the fair value of plan assets of £6,993 million and fair value of plan obligations of £6,957 million, as calculated on 
an IAS 19 basis, had been transferred as they form part of the net assets of UK Gas Distribution sold in the gain on sale calculation in note 9. 
The first actuarial valuation for Section A and Section B will be carried out at 31 March 2017 and these valuation processes have commenced.
Section A
National Grid and the Trustees have agreed on a schedule of contributions, under which payments of £212 million were made in 2016/17 after 
sectionalisation with effect from 1 January 2017. National Grid has established a security arrangement with a charge in favour of the Trustees. 
This amount may change over time or following changes to National Grid plc’s credit rating. At 31 March 2017 the value of this was required 
to be £315 million. This was provided via £227 million in letters of credit with the remainder in surety bonds. The assets held as security will be 
paid to Section A in the event that National Grid plc or National Grid UK Limited is subject to an insolvency event, if National Grid fails to make 
the required contributions in relation to Section A, or if National Grid’s credit rating by two out of three specified agencies falls below certain 
agreed levels for a period of 40 days. The assets held as security will be released back to National Grid if the scheme moves into surplus.  
In addition, National Grid will make a payment of £72 million (increased in line with RPI) into Section A if National Grid plc’s credit rating by  
two out of three specified agencies falls below certain agreed levels for a period of 40 days.
Section B
National Grid and the Trustees have agreed on a schedule of contributions, under which payments of £30 million plus an adjustment for RPI will  
be made in 2017/18 and will thereafter rise in line with RPI. National Grid has established a security arrangement with a charge in favour of the 
Trustees. This amount may change over time or following changes to National Grid Gas plc’s credit rating. At 31 March 2017 the value of this 
was required to be £192 million. This was provided via £200 million in letters of credit. The assets held as security will be paid to Section B in 
the event that National Grid Gas plc (NGG) is subject to an insolvency event, if NGG is given notice of less than 12 months that Ofgem intends 
to revoke its licence under the Gas Act 1986, if National Grid fails to make the required contributions in relation to Section B, if NGG’s credit 
rating by two out of three specified agencies falls below certain agreed levels for a period of 40 days, or if NGG grants any charges over its 
assets other than where agreed with the Trustees. The assets held as security will be released back to National Grid if the scheme moves into 
surplus. In addition, National Grid will make a payment of £65 million (increased in line with RPI) into Section B if NGG’s credit rating by two out 
of three specified agencies falls below certain agreed levels for a period of 40 days.
The scheme ceased to allow new hires to join from 1 April 2002. A DC section of the scheme was offered for employees joining after this 
date, which has since been replaced by The National Grid YouPlan (YouPlan) (see below).
National Grid Electricity Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme
The last full actuarial valuation for the NGEG was carried out at 31 March 2016. This showed that, based on long-term financial assumptions, 
the contribution rate required to meet future benefit accrual was 40.7% of pensionable earnings (currently an average of 33.7% by employers 
and an average of 7% by employees). The next actuarial valuation is required with an effective date no later than 31 March 2019.
Following the 2016 valuation, National Grid and the Trustees agreed on a recovery plan that would see the funding deficit repaid by 31 March 
2027. Under the schedule of contributions, payments of £48 million were made in 2016/17, and will rise in line with RPI until 2026/27. As part of 
the agreement, National Grid has established security arrangements with a charge in favour of the Trustees. At 31 March 2017 the value of this 
was required to be £212 million. This was provided via £212 million in letters of credit. The assets held as security will be paid to the scheme in 
the event that National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (NGET) is subject to an insolvency event, if NGET fails to make the required 
contributions in relation to the scheme, or if NGET ceases to hold a licence granted under the Electricity Act 1989. The assets held as security 
will be released back to National Grid if the scheme moves into surplus. National Grid has also agreed to make a payment in respect of the 
deficit up to a maximum of £500 million should certain triggers be breached; namely if NGET ceases to hold the licence granted under the 
Electricity Act 1989 or NGET’s credit rating by two out of three specified agencies falls below certain agreed levels for a period of 40 days. 
The scheme closed to new members from 1 April 2006.
The National Grid YouPlan
The YouPlan is a DC scheme that was launched in 2013 and under the rules of the plan, National Grid double matches contributions to 
YouPlan up to a maximum of 6% of employee salary. YouPlan is the qualifying scheme used for automatic enrolment and new hires are 
enrolled into YouPlan.
Financial Statements
131 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 23. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued
US pension plans
National Grid sponsors numerous non-contributory DB pension plans. The DB plans provide retirement benefits to vested union employees, 
as well as vested non-union employees hired before 1 January 2011. Benefits under these plans generally reflect age, years of service and 
compensation and are paid in the form of an annuity or lump sum. An independent actuary performs valuations annually. The Company funds 
the DB plans by contributing no less than the minimum amount required, but no more than the maximum tax deductible amount allowed 
under US Internal Revenue Service regulations. The range of contributions determined under these regulations can vary significantly depending 
upon the funded status of the plans. At present, there is some flexibility in the amount that is contributed on an annual basis. In general, the 
Company’s policy for funding the US pension plans is to contribute the amounts collected in rates and capitalised in the rate base during the 
year, to the extent that the funding is no less than the minimum amount required. The assets of the plans are held in trusts and administered 
by fiduciary committees comprised of appointed employees of the Company.
National Grid also has multiple DC pension plans, primarily comprised of employee savings and Company matching contributions. Non-union 
employees hired after 1 January 2011, as well as new hires in the majority of represented union employees, receive a core contribution into the 
DC plan, irrespective of the employee’s contribution into the plan.
US retiree healthcare and life insurance plans
National Grid provides healthcare and life insurance benefits to eligible retired US employees. Eligibility is based on certain age and length 
of service requirements and in most cases retirees contribute to the cost of their healthcare coverage. In the US, there is no governmental 
requirement to pre-fund post-retirement healthcare and life insurance plans. However, in general, the Company’s policy for funding the 
US retiree healthcare and life insurance plans is to contribute amounts collected in rates and capitalised in the rate base during the year.

 • US pensions at 31 March 2017: 38% active members (2016: 39%; 2015: 38%); 9% deferred members (2016: 9%; 2015: 9%); 53% pensioner members (2016: 52%; 2015: 53%)
 •  US other post-retirement benefits at 31 March 2017: 39% active members (2016: 41%; 2015: 38%); 0% deferred members (2016: 0%; 2015: 0%); 61% pensioner members 
(2016: 59%; 2015: 62%)
These figures reflect legal and actuarial advice that we have taken regarding recognition of surpluses under IFRIC 14 in both the UK and US.

1.  The discount rates for pension liabilities have been determined by reference to appropriate yields on high-quality corporate bonds prevailing in the UK and US debt markets at the 
reporting date.
2.  A promotional scale has also been used where appropriate. The UK assumption stated is that relating to service prior to 1 April 2014. The UK assumption for the rate of increase in 
salaries for service after this date is 2.2% (2016: 2.1%).
3.  This is the key assumption that determines assumed increases in pensions in payment and deferment in the UK only. The assumptions for the UK were 3.2% (2016: 2.9%; 2015: 2.9%) 
for increases in pensions in payment and 3.2% (2016: 2.9%; 2015: 2.9%) for increases in pensions in deferment.

Financial Statements
137 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 24. Provisions
We make provisions when an obligation exists, resulting from a past event and it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it, but the 
exact amount of cash required can only be estimated.
The main estimates relate to environmental remediation and decommissioning costs for various sites we own or have owned and other 
provisions, including restructuring plans and lease contracts we have entered into that are now loss making. The evaluation of the likelihood 
of the contingent events has required best judgement by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss. Should 
circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, the likelihood could alter.
Our strategy in action
We are committed to the protection and enhancement of the environment. However, we have acquired, owned and operated a number 
of businesses which have, during the course of their operations, created an environmental impact. Therefore we have a provision that 
reflects the expected cost to remediate these sites. Current operations will seldom result in new sites with significant expected costs 
being added to the provision.
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the reporting date, as a result of a past event, where the amount 
of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable.
Provision is made for decommissioning and environmental costs, based on future estimated expenditures, discounted to present values. 
An initial estimate of decommissioning and environmental costs attributable to property, plant and equipment is recorded as part of the 
original cost of the related property, plant and equipment.
Changes in the provision arising from revised estimates or discount rates or changes in the expected timing of expenditures that relate 
to property, plant and equipment are recorded as adjustments to their carrying value and depreciated prospectively over their remaining 
estimated useful economic lives; otherwise such changes are recognised in the income statement.
The unwinding of the discount is included within the income statement as a financing charge.

Environmental provision
The environmental provision represents the estimated restoration and remediation costs relating to a number of sites owned and managed 
by subsidiary undertakings, together with certain US sites that National Grid no longer owns. The environmental provision is as follows:
2017 2016
Discounted

US sites 1,479 1,619 1% 889 1,031 2%
1,721 1,889 1,169 1,379
The remediation expenditure in the UK relates to old gas manufacturing sites and also to electricity transmission sites. Cash flows are 
expected to be incurred between 2017 and 2077. A number of estimation uncertainties affect the calculation of the provision, including the 
impact of regulation, accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and 
changes in the real discount rate. This provision incorporates our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties, but future changes 
in any of the assumptions could materially impact the calculation of the provision. The undiscounted amount is the undiscounted best estimate 
of the liability having regard to these uncertainties.
The remediation expenditure in the US is expected to be incurred between 2017 and 2071. The increase in the US provision principally relates 
to the reduction in real discount rate and expected expenditure in relation to three industrial sites located on or near waterways in New York 
that are subject to both state and federal law in the US. Refer to note 4 for further details. The uncertainties regarding the calculation of this 
provision are similar to those considered in respect of UK sites. This expenditure is expected to be largely recoverable from ratepayers under 
the terms of various rate agreements in the US.
Decommissioning provision
The decommissioning provision represents £78 million (2016: £66 million) of expenditure relating to asset retirement obligations estimated to  
be incurred until 2095, and £107 million (2016: £nil) of expenditure relating to the demolition of gas holders estimated to be incurred until 2026. 
It also includes the net present value of the estimated expenditure (discounted at a real rate of 1%) expected to be incurred until 2033 in respect 
of the decommissioning of certain US nuclear generating units that National Grid no longer owns. A pre-existing decommissioning provision  
formed part of the net assets sold as part of the UK Gas Distribution transaction.
Restructuring provision
The restructuring provision principally relates to business reorganisation costs in the UK and is expected to be incurred until 2023.
Other provisions
Included within other provisions at 31 March 2017 are the following amounts in respect of the disposal of UK Gas Distribution:
• £150 million voluntary distribution to be made for the benefit of energy customers on the successful sale of UK Gas Distribution.  
We anticipate this expenditure being incurred over three years; and
• £143 million in respect of business set up costs and business restructuring costs (as disclosed in note 9). We expect the majority  
of this provision to be utilised within one year.
Other provisions also include:
• Amounts provided in respect of onerous lease commitments and rates payable on surplus properties of £84 million (2016: £100 million)  
with expenditure expected to be incurred until 2039;
• £166 million (2016: £190 million) of estimated liabilities in respect of past events insured by insurance subsidiary undertakings, including 
employer liability claims. In accordance with insurance industry practice, these estimates are based on experience from previous years  
and there is, therefore, no identifiable payment date; and
• £13 million (2016: £13 million) in respect of obligations associated with investments in joint ventures and associates.
Financial Statements
139 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 25. Share capital
Ordinary share capital represents the total number of shares issued which are publicly traded. We also disclose the number of treasury 
shares the Company holds, which are shares that the Company has bought itself, predominantly to actively manage share issuances under 
the scrip dividend scheme and to satisfy employee share option plan liabilities.
Share capital is accounted for as an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that includes a residual interest in the consolidated 
assets of the Company after deducting all its liabilities and is recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, with an amount equal 
to the nominal amount of the shares issued included in the share capital account and the balance recorded in the share premium account.

1.  The issue of shares under the scrip dividend scheme is considered to be a bonus issue under the terms of the Companies Act 2006 and the nominal value of the shares is charged 
to the share premium account.
The share capital of the Company consists of ordinary shares of 11
17
⁄
43
 pence nominal value each including ADSs. The ordinary shares and 
ADSs allow holders to receive dividends and vote at general meetings of the Company. The Company holds treasury shares but may not 
exercise any rights over these shares including the entitlement to vote or receive dividends. There are no restrictions on the transfer or sale 
of ordinary shares.
On 19 April 2017, the Company announced that its Board had approved a special interim dividend of 84.375 pence per existing ordinary  
share ($5.4224 per existing ADS) following completion of the sale of the majority interest in UK Gas Distribution. In order to maintain the 
comparability of the Company’s share price before and after the special dividend, the Company plans to undertake a share consolidation. 
The share consolidation will replace every 12 existing ordinary shares with 11 new ordinary shares. The Company has published a notice 
of general meeting and explanatory circular to shareholders regarding the share consolidation and related resolutions which will be subject 
to shareholder approval at the General Meeting of the Company being held on 19 May 2017.
In line with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has amended its Articles of Association and ceased to have authorised 
share capital.
Treasury shares
At 31 March 2017, the Company held 193 million (2016: 179 million) of its own shares. The market value of these shares as at 31 March 2017 
was £1,958 million (2016: £1,767 million).
The Company made the following transactions in respect of its own shares during the year ended 31 March 2017:
1. During the year, the Company, as part of management of the dilutive effect of share issuances under the scrip dividend scheme, 
repurchased 20 million (2016: 31 million) ordinary shares for aggregate consideration of £189 million (2016: £267 million), including 
transaction costs. The shares repurchased have a nominal value of £2 million (2016: £4 million) and represented approximately 1%  
(2016: 1%) of the ordinary shares in issue as at 31 March 2017.
2. During the year, 3 million (2016: 2 million) treasury shares were gifted to National Grid Employee Share Trusts and 3 million (2016: 3 million) 
treasury shares were re-issued in relation to employee share schemes, in total representing approximately 0.2% (2016: 0.1%) of the ordinary 
shares in issue as at 31 March 2017. The nominal value of these shares was £1 million (2016: £1 million) and the total proceeds received 
were £18 million (2016: £16 million).
3. During the year the Company made payments totalling £6 million (2016: £6 million) to National Grid Employee Share Trusts, outside of its 
share repurchase programme, to enable the trustees to make purchases of National Grid plc shares in order to satisfy the requirements  
of employee share option and reward plans.
The maximum number of shares held during the year was 194 million ordinary shares (2016: 179 million) representing approximately  
4.9% (2016: 4.6%) of the ordinary shares in issue as at 31 March 2017 and having a nominal value of £22 million (2016: £20 million).

140 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 26. Other equity reserves
Other equity reserves are different categories of equity as required by accounting standards and represent the impact of a number of our 
historical transactions.
Other equity reserves comprise the translation reserve (see accounting policy D in note 1), cash flow hedge reserve (see note 16), available-for-
sale reserve (see note 14), the capital redemption reserve and the merger reserve. The merger reserve arose as a result of the application of 
merger accounting principles under the then prevailing UK GAAP, which under IFRS 1 was retained for mergers that occurred prior to the IFRS 
transition date. Under merger accounting principles, the difference between the carrying amount of the capital structure of the acquiring vehicle 
and that of the acquired business was treated as a merger difference and included within reserves.
As the amounts included in other equity reserves are not attributable to any of the other classes of equity presented, they have been disclosed 
as a separate classification of equity.

The merger reserve represents the difference between the carrying value of subsidiary undertaking investments and their respective capital 
structures following the Lattice demerger from BG Group plc and the 1999 Lattice refinancing.
The cash flow hedge reserve will be transferred to the income statement until the committed future cash flows from borrowings and capital 
projects (as described in note 16) are paid. The amount due to be released from reserves to the income statement next year is a gain of  
£22 million (pre-tax). The remainder will be released based on the maturity profile of borrowings due after more than one year and on the  
stage of completion of existing capital projects.
Financial Statements
141 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 27. Net debt
Net debt represents the amount of borrowings and overdrafts less cash, financial investments and related derivatives.
Funding and liquidity risk management is carried out by the treasury function under policies and guidelines approved by the Finance 
Committee of the Board. The Finance Committee is responsible for the regular review and monitoring of treasury activity and for the  
approval of specific transactions, the authority for which fall outside the delegation of authority to management.
The primary objective of the treasury function is to manage our funding and liquidity requirements. A secondary objective is to manage the 
associated financial risks, in the form of interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, to within pre-authorised parameters. Details of the main 
risks arising from our financing and commodity hedging activities can be found in the risk factors discussion starting on page 180 and in 
note 30 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 145 to 152.
Investment of surplus funds, usually in short-term fixed deposits or placements with money market funds that invest in highly liquid instruments 
of high credit quality, is subject to our counterparty risk management policy.

Financial Statements
143 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements This section includes information that is important to enable a full understanding of our financial position, particularly areas 
of potential uncertainty that could affect us in the future.
We also include specific disclosures for British Transco Finance Inc., Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation and National Grid 
Gas plc in accordance with various rules including Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X (a US SEC requirement), as they have issued 
public debt securities which have been guaranteed by National Grid plc and one of its subsidiary companies, National Grid 
Gas plc. Additional disclosures have also been included in respect of the two guarantor companies. These disclosures are 
in lieu of publishing separate financial statements for these companies. See note 34 for further information.
28. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments are those amounts that we are contractually required to pay in the future as long as the other party meets its obligations. 
These commitments primarily relate to operating lease rentals, energy purchase agreements and contracts for the repurchase of network 
assets which, in many cases, extend over a long period of time. We also disclose any contingencies, which include guarantees that 
companies have given, where we pledge assets against current obligations that will remain for a specific period.

1.  Energy purchase commitments relate to contractual commitments to purchase electricity or gas that are used to satisfy physical delivery requirements to our customers or for energy that 
we use ourselves (i.e. normal purchase, sale or usage) and hence are accounted for as ordinary purchase contracts. Details of commodity contracts that do not meet the normal purchase, 
sale or usage criteria, and hence are accounted for as derivative contracts, are shown in note 30(e).
The total of future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases is £15 million (2016: £21 million).
Through the ordinary course of our operations, we are party to various litigation, claims and investigations. We do not expect the ultimate 
resolution of any of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

30. Financial risk management
Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks including currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk, capital risk 
and liquidity risk. Our risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
volatility of financial performance from these risks. We use financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, to manage risks 
of this type.
This note describes our approach to managing risk, including an analysis of assets and liabilities by currency type and an analysis of interest 
rate category for our net debt. We are required by accounting standards to also include a number of specific disclosures (such as a maturity 
analysis of contractual undiscounted cash flows) and have included these requirements below.
Risk management related to financing activities is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Finance 
Committee of the Board. The objective of the treasury department is to manage funding and liquidity requirements, including managing 
associated financial risks, to within acceptable boundaries. The Finance Committee provides written principles for overall risk management, 
as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, use of derivative 
financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
We have exposure to the following risks, which are described in more detail below:
• credit risk;
• liquidity risk;
• interest rate risk;
• currency risk;
• commodity risk; and
• capital risk.
Financial Statements
145 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 30. Financial risk management continued
(a) Credit risk
We are exposed to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties’ default on their commitments including failure to pay or make a delivery on a 
contract. This risk is inherent in our commercial business activities. We are exposed to credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents, derivative 
financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including 
outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Treasury credit risk
Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative financial instruments. As at 31 March 2017, the 
following limits were in place for investments held with banks and financial institutions:
Maximum limit
£m
Long-term limit
£m
Triple ‘A’ G8 sovereign entities (AAA) Unlimited Unlimited
Triple ‘A’ vehicles (AAA) 326 277
Triple ‘A’ range institutions and non G8 sovereign entities (AAA) 1,113 to 1,680 560 to 878
Double ‘A+’ G8 sovereign entities (AA+) 1,680 878
Double ‘A’ range institutions (AA) 665 to 837 338 to 418
Single ‘A’ range institutions (A) 229 to 326 116 to 167
As at 31 March 2016 and 2017, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties. In accordance with our treasury policies, 
counterparty credit exposure utilisations are monitored daily against the counterparty credit limits. Counterparty credit ratings and market 
conditions are reviewed continually with limits being revised and utilisation adjusted, if appropriate. Management does not expect any 
significant losses from non performance by these counterparties.
Commodity credit risk
The credit policy for US-based commodity transactions is owned by the Finance Committee to the Board, which establishes controls and 
procedures to determine, monitor and minimise the credit exposure to counterparties. Authority to administer the policy has been delegated 
to the Energy Procurement Risk Management Committee by the Board and the Executive Committee.
Wholesale and retail credit risk
Our principal commercial exposure in the UK is governed by the credit rules within the regulated codes: Uniform Network Code and 
Connection and Use of System Code. These set out the level of credit relative to the RAV for each credit rating. In the US, we are required 
to supply electricity and gas under state regulations. Our credit policies and practices are designed to limit credit exposure by collecting 
security deposits prior to providing utility services, or after utility service has commenced if certain applicable regulatory requirements are 
met. Collection activities are managed on a daily basis. Sales to retail customers are usually settled in cash, cheques, electronic bank 
payments or by using major credit cards. We are committed to measuring, monitoring, minimising and recording counterparty credit risk 
in our wholesale business. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored and collateral is collected against these accounts when 
necessary. Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 18.

Offsetting financial assets and liabilities
The following tables set out our financial assets and liabilities which are subject to offset and to enforceable master netting arrangements 
or similar agreements. The tables show the amounts which are offset and reported net in the statement of financial position. Amounts which 
cannot be offset under IFRS, but which could be settled net under terms of master netting agreements if certain conditions arise, and with 
collateral received or pledged, are shown to present National Grid’s net exposure.
Financial assets and liabilities on different transactions are only reported net if the transactions are with the same counterparty, a legal right 
of offset exists and the cash flows are intended to be settled on a net basis.
Amounts which do not meet the criteria for offsetting on the statement of financial position but could be settled net in certain circumstances 
principally relate to derivative transactions under ISDA agreements where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the 
event of default of the other party.
Commodity contracts that have not been offset on the balance sheet may be settled net in certain circumstances under ISDA or NAESB 
(North American Energy Standards Board) agreements.
National Grid has similar arrangements in relation to bank account balances and bank overdrafts; and trade payables and trade receivables 
which are subject to general terms and conditions. However, these balances are immaterial.

(b) Liquidity risk
Our policy is to determine our liquidity requirements by the use of both short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts. These forecasts are 
supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding requirements for at least a 24 month period and maintain 
adequate liquidity for a continuous 12 month period.
We believe our contractual obligations, including those shown in commitments and contingencies in note 28 can be met from existing cash 
and investments, operating cash flows and other financings that we reasonably expect to be able to secure in the future, together with the 
use of committed facilities if required.
Our debt agreements and banking facilities contain covenants, including those relating to the periodic and timely provision of financial 
information by the issuing entity and financial covenants such as restrictions on the level of subsidiary indebtedness. Failure to comply 
with these covenants, or to obtain waivers of those requirements, could in some cases trigger a right, at the lender’s discretion, to require 
repayment of some of our debt and may restrict our ability to draw upon our facilities or access the capital markets.

1.  The interest on borrowings is calculated based on borrowings held at 31 March without taking account of future issues. Floating rate interest is estimated using a forward interest rate curve 
as at 31 March. Payments are included on the basis of the earliest date on which the Company can be required to settle.
(c) Interest rate risk
National Grid’s interest rate risk arises from our long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose National Grid to cash 
flow interest rate risk, partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose National Grid to fair value 
interest rate risk.
Our interest rate risk management policy is to seek to minimise total financing costs (being interest costs and changes in the market value 
of debt) subject to constraints. We do this by using fixed and floating rate debt and derivative financial instruments including interest rate 
swaps, swaptions and forward rate agreements.
We hold some borrowings on issue that are inflation linked. We believe that these provide a partial economic offset to the inflation risk 
associated with our UK inflation linked revenues.
The table in note 20 sets out the carrying amount, by contractual maturity, of borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking 
into account interest rate swaps.

(d) Currency risk
National Grid operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with 
respect to the dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, and investments 
in foreign operations.
Our policy for managing foreign exchange transaction risk is to hedge contractually committed foreign currency cash flows over a prescribed 
minimum size. Where foreign currency cash flow forecasts are less certain, our policy is to hedge a proportion of such cash flows based on 
the probability of those cash flows occurring. Instruments used to manage foreign exchange transaction risk include foreign exchange forward 
contracts and foreign exchange swaps.
Our policy for managing foreign exchange translation risk relating to our net investment in foreign operations is to maintain a percentage of 
net debt and foreign exchange forwards so as to provide an economic offset. The primary managed foreign exchange exposure arises from the 
dollar denominated assets and liabilities held by our US operations, with a further small euro exposure in respect of a joint venture investment.
During 2017 and 2016, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows:

exposure to currency risk on these balances.

149 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 30. Financial risk management continued
(e) Commodity risk
We purchase electricity and gas to supply our customers in the US and to meet our own energy needs. Substantially all our costs of 
purchasing electricity and gas for supply to customers are recoverable at an amount equal to cost. The timing of recovery of these costs 
can vary between financial periods leading to an under- or over-recovery within any particular year that can lead to large fluctuations in the 
income statement. We follow approved policies to manage price and supply risks for our commodity activities.
Our energy procurement risk management policy and delegations of authority govern our US commodity trading activities for energy 
transactions. The purpose of this policy is to ensure we transact within pre-defined risk parameters and only in the physical and financial 
markets where we or our customers have a physical market requirement. In addition, state regulators require National Grid to manage 
commodity risk and cost volatility prudently through diversified pricing strategies. In some jurisdictions we are required to file a plan outlining 
our strategy to be approved by regulators. In certain cases we might receive guidance with regard to specific hedging limits.
Energy purchase contracts for the forward purchase of electricity or gas that are used to satisfy physical delivery requirements to customers 
or for energy that the Company uses itself meet the normal purchase, sale or usage exemption of IAS 39. They are, therefore, not recognised 
in the financial statements until they are realised. Disclosure of commitments under such contracts is made in note 28.
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase of commodities, some of which do not meet the own use exemption for accounting purposes 
and hence are accounted for as derivatives. We also enter into derivative financial instruments linked to commodity prices, including index-
linked futures, swaps and options contracts. These derivative financial instruments are used to manage market price volatility and are carried 
at fair value on the statement of financial position, with the mark-to-market changes reflected through earnings.
The fair value of our commodity contracts by type can be analysed as follows:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
– supplementary information continued 30. Financial risk management continued
(f) Capital risk management
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, and 
net debt (note 27). National Grid’s objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern; to remain 
within regulatory constraints of our regulated operating companies; and to maintain an efficient mix of debt and equity funding thus achieving 
an optimal capital structure and cost of capital. We regularly review and manage the capital structure as appropriate in order to achieve 
these objectives.
Maintaining appropriate credit ratings for our regulated companies is an important aspect of our capital risk management strategy and balance 
sheet efficiency. As noted on page 22, we monitor our balance sheet efficiency using several metrics including our retained cash flow/net debt 
and interest cover. Interest cover for the year ended 31 March 2017 was 5.0 (2016: 5.5). Our long-term target range for interest cover is greater 
than 3.0, which we believe is consistent with single A range long-term senior unsecured debt credit ratings within our main UK operating 
companies, NGET and NGG, based on guidance from the rating agencies.
In addition, we monitor the RAV gearing within each of NGET and the regulated transmission businesses within NGG. This is calculated as net 
debt expressed as a percentage of RAV, and indicates the level of debt employed to fund our UK regulated businesses. It is compared with the 
level of RAV gearing indicated by Ofgem as being appropriate for these businesses, at around 60 to 65%.
The majority of our regulated operating companies in the US and the UK (and one intermediate UK holding company), are subject to certain 
restrictions on the payment of dividends by administrative order, contract and/or licence. The types of restrictions that a company may have 
that would prevent a dividend being declared or paid unless they are met include:
• dividends must be approved in advance by the relevant US state regulatory commission;
• the subsidiary must have at least two recognised rating agency credit ratings of at least investment grade;
• dividends must be limited to cumulative retained earnings, including pre-acquisition retained earnings;
• National Grid plc must maintain an investment grade credit rating and if that rating is the lowest investment grade bond rating it cannot 
have a negative watch/review for downgrade notice by a credit rating agency;
• the subsidiary must not carry on any activities other than those permitted by the licences;
• the subsidiary must not create any cross-default obligations or give or receive any intra-group cross-subsidies; and
• the percentage of equity compared with total capital of the subsidiary must remain above certain levels.
There is a further restriction relating only to the Narragansett Electric Company, which is required to maintain its consolidated net worth 
above certain levels.
These restrictions are subject to alteration in the US as and when a new rate case or rate plan is agreed with the relevant regulatory bodies 
for each operating company and in the UK through the normal licence review process.
As most of our business is regulated, at 31 March 2017 the majority of our net assets are subject to some of the restrictions noted above. 
These restrictions are not considered to be significantly onerous, nor do we currently expect they will prevent the planned payment of 
dividends in future in line with our dividend policy.
Some of our regulatory and bank loan agreements additionally impose lower limits for the long-term credit ratings that certain companies 
within the Group must hold. All the above requirements are monitored on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance. The Company has 
complied with all externally imposed capital requirements to which it is subject.
(g) Fair value analysis
Included in the statement of financial position are financial instruments which have been measured at fair value. These fair values can be 
categorised into hierarchy levels that are representative of the inputs used in measuring the fair value. The best evidence of fair value is a 
quoted price in an actively traded market. In the event that the market for a financial instrument is not active, a valuation technique is used.

observable market data.
Level 3: Financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are based on unobservable market data.
Financial Statements
151 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 30. Financial risk management continued
(g) Fair value analysis continued
Our level 3 derivative financial instruments include cross-currency swaps, inflation linked swaps and equity options, all of which are traded 
on illiquid markets. In valuing these instruments an external valuation is obtained to support each reported fair value. We have reclassified 
sterling RPI swaps from level 2 into level 3 due to the long-dated and increased illiquid nature of these instruments, which has been driven 
by the lack of market participants for trades with this particular risk profile.
Our level 3 commodity contracts primarily consist of our forward purchases of electricity and gas where pricing inputs are unobservable, 
as well as other complex transactions. Complex transactions can introduce the need for internally developed models based on reasonable 
assumptions. Industry standard valuation techniques such as the Black-Scholes pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation are used for 
valuing such instruments. Level 3 is also applied in cases when optionality is present or where an extrapolated forward curve is considered 
unobservable. All published forward curves are verified to market data; if forward curves differ from market data by 5% or more they are 
considered unobservable.
During the year to 31 March 2017, the Group made level 3 investments worth £46 million, consisting of a £41 million joint venture arrangement 
with Sunrun Neptune Investor 2016 LLC, accounted at fair value (note 15), and £5 million Series B preferred stocks in Enbala Holdings, Inc., 
accounted as available-for-sale. The Group is also party to the Further Acquisition Agreement which contains put/call options over 14%  
of the loan and equity it holds in Quadgas HoldCo Limited. The fair value of the options is considered to be zero at year end (notes 9 and 15).
The changes in value of our level 3 derivative financial instruments are as follows:

1. Level 3 commodity price sensitivity is included within the sensitivity analysis disclosed in note 33.
2. Volumes were flexed using maximum and minimum historical averages, or by >10% where historical averages were not available.
3. A reasonably possible change in assumption of other level 3 derivative financial instruments is unlikely to result in a material change in fair values.
4. The risk free rate and cost of debt were flexed in assessing the cost of carry for the Further Acquisition Agreement valuation sensitivity.
The impacts disclosed above were considered on a contract by contract basis with the most significant unobservable inputs identified. 
The level 3 investments were acquired in a recent period on market terms and sensitivity is considered insignificant at 31 March 2017.

– supplementary information continued 31. Borrowing facilities
To support our long-term liquidity requirements and provide backup to commercial paper and other borrowings, we agree loan facilities with 
financial institutions over and above the value of borrowings that may be required. These facilities have never been drawn, and our undrawn 
amounts are listed below.
At 31 March 2017, we had bilateral committed credit facilities of £4,938 million (2016: £2,808 million). In addition, we had committed credit 
facilities from syndicates of banks of £338 million at 31 March 2017 (2016: £295 million). All committed credit facilities were undrawn in 2017 
and 2016. An analysis of the maturity of these undrawn committed facilities is shown below:

Of the unused facilities at 31 March 2017, £4,938 million (2016: £2,808 million) was held as backup to commercial paper and similar 
borrowings, while £338 million (2016: £295 million) is available as backup to specific US borrowings.
In addition to the above, the Group has Export Credit Agreements (ECAs) totalling £600 million, of which £562 million is undrawn.
Further information on our bonds can be found on the debt investor section of our website.
Financial Statements
153 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements 32. Subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates
While we present consolidated results in these financial statements as if we were one company, our legal structure is such that there are 
a number of different operating and holding companies that contribute to the overall result. This structure has evolved through acquisitions 
as well as regulatory requirements to have certain activities within separate legal entities.
Subsidiary undertakings
A list of the Group’s subsidiaries as at 31 March 2017 is given below. The entire share capital of subsidiaries is held within the Group except 
where the Group’s ownership percentages are shown. These percentages give the Group’s ultimate interest and therefore allow for the 
situation where subsidiaries are owned by partly-owned intermediate subsidiaries. Where subsidiaries have different classes of shares, this is 
largely for historical reasons and the effective percentage holdings given represent both the Group’s voting rights and equity holding. Shares  
in National Grid (US) Holdings Limited, National Grid Holdings One plc and NGG Finance plc are held directly by National Grid plc. All other 
holdings in subsidiaries are owned by other subsidiaries within the Group. All subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group’s financial statements.
Principal Group companies are identified in bold. These companies are incorporated and principally operate in the countries under which 
they are shown.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
– supplementary information continued 33. Sensitivities on areas of estimation and uncertainty
In order to give a clearer picture of the impact on our results or financial position of potential changes in significant estimates and 
assumptions, the following sensitivities are presented. These sensitivities are hypothetical, as they are based on assumptions and 
conditions prevailing at the year end, and should be used with caution. The effects provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual 
effects that would be experienced because our actual exposures are constantly changing.
The sensitivities in the tables below show the potential impact in the income statement (and consequential impact on net assets) for a range 
of different variables each of which have been considered in isolation (i.e. with all other variables remaining constant). There are a number of 
these sensitivities which are mutually exclusive and therefore if one were to happen, another would not, meaning a total showing how sensitive 
our results are to these external factors is not meaningful.
We are further required to show additional sensitivity analysis for changes in interest and exchange rates and these are shown separately 
in the subsequent table due to the additional assumptions that are made in order to produce meaningful sensitivity disclosures.
The sensitivities included in the tables below all have an equal and opposite effect if the sensitivity increases or decreases by the same 
amount unless otherwise stated. For example, a 10% increase in unbilled revenue at 31 March 2017 would result in an increase in the 
income statement of £58 million and a 10% decrease in unbilled revenue would have the equal but opposite effect.

1. The effect of a 10% change in fair value assumes no hedge accounting.
2. The changes shown are a change in the annual pension or other post-retirement benefit service charge and change in the defined benefit obligations.
3.  A change in the discount rate is likely to occur as a result of changes in bond yields and as such would be expected to be offset to a significant degree by a change in the value of the bond 
assets held by the plans.
4. The projected impact resulting from a change in RPI reflects the underlying effect on pensions in payment, pensions in deferment and resultant increases in salary assumptions.
5. This change has been applied to both the pre 1 April 2014 and post 1 April 2014 rate of increase in salary assumption.
6. Represents potential impact on fair values of commodity contracts only.

1. Excludes sensitivities to LPI curve. Further details on sensitivities are provided in note 30(g).
2.  The other equity reserves impact does not reflect the exchange translation in our US subsidiaries’ net assets. It is estimated this would change by £988 million (2016: £788 million)  
in the opposite direction if the dollar exchange rate changed by 10%.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits assumptions
Sensitivities have been prepared to show how the DB obligations and annual service costs could potentially be impacted by changes in the 
relevant actuarial assumption that were reasonably possible as at 31 March 2017. In preparing sensitivities the potential impact has been 
calculated by applying the change to each assumption in isolation and assuming all other assumptions remain unchanged. This is with the 
exception of RPI in the UK where the corresponding change to increases to pensions in payment, increases to pensions in deferment and 
increases in salary is recognised.
Financial instruments assumptions
Our financial instruments are sensitive to changes in market variables, being UK and US interest rates, the UK RPI and the dollar to sterling 
exchange rate. The changes in market variables impact the valuation of our borrowings, deposits, derivative financial instruments and 
commodity contracts. The analysis illustrates the sensitivity of our financial instruments to the changes in market variables.
The following main assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis for continuing operations:
• the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial 
instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2017 and 2016 
respectively;
• the statement of financial position sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments, 
as debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move;
• the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and 
derivative instruments;
• changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates of designated cash flow hedges are assumed to be recorded 
fully within equity; and
• changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in interest rates 
are recorded in the income statement as they are designated using the spot rather than the forward translation method. The impact of 
movements in the dollar to sterling exchange rate are recorded directly in equity.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
– supplementary information continued 34. Additional disclosures in respect of guaranteed securities
We have three debt issuances (including preferred shares) that are listed on a US national securities exchange and are guaranteed by 
other companies in the Group. These guarantors commit to honour any liabilities should the company issuing the debt have any financial 
difficulties. In order to provide debt holders with information on the financial stability of the companies providing the guarantees, we are 
required to disclose individual financial information for these companies. We have chosen to include this information in the Group financial 
statements rather than submitting separate stand-alone financial statements.
The following condensed consolidating financial information, comprising statements of comprehensive income, statements of financial position 
and cash flow statements, is given in respect of National Grid Gas plc (subsidiary guarantor), which became joint full and unconditional guarantor 
on 11 May 2004 with National Grid plc (parent guarantor) of the 6.625% Guaranteed Notes due 2018 issued in June 1998 by British Transco 
Finance Inc., then known as British Gas Finance Inc. (issuer of notes). Condensed consolidating financial information is also provided in respect 
of Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation as a result of National Grid plc’s guarantee, dated 29 October 2007, of Niagara Mohawk’s 3.6% and 
3.9% issued preferred shares. National Grid Gas plc, British Transco Finance Inc., and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation are 100% owned 
and National Grid plc’s guarantee of Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation’s preferred shares is full and unconditional pursuant to Rule 3-10(i)(8)
(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-X. The guarantees of National Grid Gas plc and National Grid plc are joint and several.
The following financial information for National Grid plc, National Grid Gas plc, British Transco Finance Inc., and Niagara Mohawk Power 
Corporation on a condensed consolidating basis is intended to provide investors with meaningful and comparable financial information and 
is provided pursuant to various rules including Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X in lieu of the separate financial statements of each subsidiary 
issuer of public debt securities.
This financial information should be read in conjunction with the other disclosures in these financial statements.
Summary statements of comprehensive income are presented, on a consolidated basis, for the three years ended 31 March 2017. Summary 
statements of comprehensive income of National Grid plc and National Grid Gas plc are presented under IFRS measurement principles, 
as modified by the inclusion of the results of subsidiary undertakings on the basis of equity accounting principles.
The summary statements of financial position of National Grid plc and National Grid Gas plc include the investments in subsidiaries recorded 
on the basis of equity accounting principles for the purposes of presenting condensed consolidating financial information under IFRS. 
The summary statements of financial position present these investments within non-current financial and other investments.

Financial Statements
165 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements We are required to include the stand-alone balance sheet of our ultimate parent Company, National Grid plc, under the Companies Act 
2006. This is because the publicly traded shares are actually those of National Grid plc (the Company) and the following disclosures provide 
additional information to shareholders. 
A. Basis of preparation 
National Grid plc is the parent company of the National Grid Group 
which is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity 
and gas in Great Britain and northeastern US. The Company is 
a public limited company, limited by shares. The Company is 
incorporated and domiciled in England, with its registered office 
at 1–3 Strand, London, WC2N 5EH. 
The financial statements of National Grid plc for the year ended 
31 March 2017 were approved by the Board of Directors on 
17 May 2017. The Company meets the definition of a qualifying 
entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly these individual 
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in 
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101). In preparing these financial 
statements the Company applies the recognition and measurement 
requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the EU, but makes amendments where necessary 
in order to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
and sets out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure 
exemptions has been taken.
These individual financial statements of the Company have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting and financial 
reporting standards and the Companies Act 2006. They have been 
prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of 
financial instruments, and are presented in pounds sterling, which 
is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Company operates. The 2016 comparative financial information 
has also been prepared on this basis.
These individual financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis, which presumes that the Company has 
adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors 
intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial 
statements are signed. As the Company is part of a larger group it 
participates in the Group’s centralised treasury arrangements and 
so shares banking arrangements with its subsidiaries. The Company 
is expected to continue to generate positive cash flows or be in 
a position to obtain finance via intercompany loans to continue to 
operate for the foreseeable future. 
The Directors are not aware of any material uncertainties related 
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Thus they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
annual financial statements. 
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account 
or statement of comprehensive income as permitted by section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006. 
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have 
been applied in the preparation of these financial statements 
of the Company in accordance with FRS 101:
• a cash flow statement and related notes;
• disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly 
owned subsidiaries;
• disclosures in respect of capital management; and
• the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
As the consolidated financial statements of National Grid plc, 
which are available from the registered office, include the equivalent 
disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under 
FRS 101 in respect of certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 
‘Fair value measurement’ and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 
‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’. The Company intends to apply 
the above exemptions in the financial statements for the year ending 
31 March 2018.
There are no critical areas of judgement that are considered to 
have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements. Key sources of estimation uncertainty that have 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
the valuation of financial instruments and derivatives. 
The balance sheet has been prepared in accordance with the 
Company’s accounting policies approved by the Board and 
described below: 
B. Fixed asset investments 
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provisions 
for impairment. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. Impairments are calculated such that the 
carrying value of the fixed asset investment is the lower of its cost 
or recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of its 
net realisable value and its value-in-use. 
C. Tax 
Current tax for the current and prior periods is provided at the 
amount expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and 
tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences which 
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, 
or the right to pay less tax, at a future date, at tax rates expected 
to apply when the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates 
and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided for using the 
balance sheet liability method and is recognised on temporary 
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded 
as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are not discounted. 
166 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Financial Statements
Company accounting policies D. Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the 
Company are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the 
dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at closing exchange rates. Gains and losses arising on 
retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the 
profit and loss account. 
E. Financial instruments 
The Company’s accounting policies are the same as the Group’s 
accounting policies under IFRS, namely IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Presentation’, IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. 
The Company applies these policies only in respect of the financial 
instruments that it has, namely investments, derivative financial 
instruments, debtors, cash at bank and in hand, borrowings 
and creditors.
The policies are set out in notes 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21 to the 
consolidated financial statements. The Company is taking the 
exemption for financial instruments disclosures, because IFRS 7 
disclosures are given in notes 30 and 33 to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
F. Hedge accounting 
The Company applies the same accounting policy as the Group 
in respect of fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. This policy 
is set out in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
G. Parent Company guarantees 
The Company has guaranteed the repayment of the principal 
sum, any associated premium and interest on specific loans 
due by certain subsidiary undertakings primarily to third parties. 
In the event of default or non performance by the subsidiary, the 
Company recognises such guarantees as insurance contracts, 
at fair value with a corresponding increase in the carrying value 
of the investment. 
H. Share awards to employees of subsidiary undertakings 
The issuance by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries of 
a grant over the Company’s options represents additional capital 
contributions by the Company to its subsidiaries. An additional 
investment in subsidiaries results in a corresponding increase in 
shareholders’ equity. The additional capital contribution is based 
on the fair value of the option at the date of grant, allocated over 
the underlying grant’s vesting period. Where payments are 
subsequently received from subsidiaries, these are accounted 
for as a return of a capital contribution and credited against 
the Company’s investments in subsidiaries. The Company has 
no employees. 
I. Dividends 
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid to the 
Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are recognised when 
they are approved by shareholders. 
J. Directors’ remuneration 
Full details of Directors’ remuneration are disclosed on pages 
54 to 71.

Additional information UK Regulation 
Our licences are established under the Gas Act 1986 and Electricity Act 
1989, as amended (the Acts). They require us to develop, maintain and 
operate economic and efficient networks and to facilitate competition in 
the supply of gas and electricity in Great Britain (GB). They also give us 
statutory powers. These include the right to bury our pipes or cables 
under public highways and the ability to use compulsory powers to 
purchase land so we can conduct our business.
Our networks are regulated by Ofgem, which has established price 
control mechanisms that set the amount of revenue our regulated 
businesses can earn. Price control regulation is designed to make sure 
our interests, as a monopoly, are balanced with those of our customers. 
Ofgem allows us to charge reasonable, but not excessive, prices. This 
gives us a future level of revenue that is sufficient to meet our statutory 
duties and licence obligations, and make a reasonable return on our 
investment.
The price control includes a number of mechanisms designed to  
help achieve its objectives. These include financial incentives that 
encourage us to:
• efficiently deliver by investment and maintenance the network outputs 
that customers and stakeholders require, including reliable supplies, 
new connections and infrastructure capacity; 
• innovate in order to continuously improve the services we give our 
customers, stakeholders and communities; and
• efficiently balance the transmission networks to support the 
wholesale markets. 
As announced on 31 March 2017 , a majority interest in the UK Gas 
Distribution business was sold to a consortium of investors. The 
Consortium comprises Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets,  
Allianz Capital Partners, Hermes Investment Management, CIC Capital 
Corporation, Qatar Investment Authority, Dalmore Capital and Amber 
Infrastructure Limited/International Public Partnerships. National Grid  
has retained a 39% equity interest in the new separate Gas Distribution 
business and will account for the interest as an equity investment in  
an associate going forward. 
The UK Electricity Transmission (UK ET), UK Gas Transmission (UK GT) 
and UK Gas Distribution (UK GD)
†
 businesses operate under eight 
separate price controls in the UK. These comprise two for our UK ET 
operations, one covering our role as transmission owner (TO) and the 
other for our role as system operator (SO); two for our UK GT operations, 
again one as TO and one as SO; and one for each of our four regional 
gas distribution networks. While each of the eight price controls  
may have differing terms, they are based on a consistent regulatory 
framework.
There is no impact on the price controls following the sale of a majority 
interest of the UK Gas Distribution business. The eight price controls, as 
mentioned above, remain in force. National Grid will carry on operating 
within four of the price controls (National Grid Electricity Transmission  
plc and National Grid Gas plc), and the UK Gas Distribution business  
has responsibility for operating within the price controls relating to its  
four gas distribution networks.
In addition to the eight price controls, there is also a tariff cap price 
control applied to certain elements of domestic metering and daily  
meter reading activities carried out by National Grid Metering.
Interconnectors derive their revenues from sales of capacity to  
users who wish to move power between market areas with different 
prices. These sales revenues are called congestion revenues because 
market price differences result from the congestion on the finite 
interconnector capacity, which limits full price convergence. European 
legislation governs how congestion revenues may be used and how 
interconnection capacity is allocated. It requires all interconnection 
capacity to be allocated to the market through auctions.
There is a range of different regulatory models available for 
interconnector projects. These involve various levels of regulatory 
intervention ranging from fully merchant (the project is fully reliant on 
sales of interconnector capacity) to cap and floor (where sales revenues 
above the cap are returned to transmission system users and revenues 
below the floor are topped up by transmission system users, thus 
reducing the overall project risk).
The cap and floor regime is now the regulated route for interconnector 
investment in GB, which sits alongside the exemption route (whereby 
project developers apply for exemptions from aspects of European 
legislation). 
RIIO price controls 
Our regulatory framework is called RIIO (revenue = incentives + 
innovation + outputs) and lasts for eight years. The building blocks  
of the RIIO price control are broadly similar to the historical price controls 
used in the UK. However, there are some significant differences in the 
mechanics of the calculations. 
How is revenue calculated? 
Under RIIO the outputs we deliver are clearly articulated and are integrally 
linked to the calculation of our allowed revenue. These outputs have 
been determined through an extensive consultation process, which has 
given stakeholders a greater opportunity to influence the decisions. 
There are six output categories: 
Safety: ensuring the provision of a safe energy network. 
Reliability (and availability): promoting networks capable of delivering 
long-term reliability, as well as minimising the number and duration of 
interruptions experienced over the price control period, and ensuring 
adaptation to climate change. 
Environmental impact: encouraging companies to play their role in 
achieving broader environmental objectives – specifically, facilitating the 
reduction of carbon emissions – as well as minimising their own carbon 
footprint. 
Customer and stakeholder satisfaction: maintaining high levels  
of customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement, and improving 
service levels. 
Customer connections: encouraging networks to connect customers 
quickly and efficiently. 
Social obligations (UK GD only): extending the gas network to 
communities that are fuel poor where it is efficient to do so, and 
introducing measures to address carbon monoxide poisoning. 
Within each of these output categories are a number of primary and 
secondary deliverables, reflecting what our stakeholders want us to 
deliver over the remaining price control period. The nature and number  
of these deliverables varies according to the output category, with some 
being linked directly to our allowed revenue, some linked to legislation, 
and others having only a reputational impact. 
Ofgem, using information we have submitted, along with independent 
assessments, determines the efficient level of expected costs necessary 
to deliver them. Under RIIO this is known as totex, which is a component 
of total allowable expenditure, and is the sum of what was defined in 
previous price controls as operating expenditure (opex), capital 
expenditure (capex) and, in UK GD price controls, mains replacement 
expenditure (repex).
A number of assumptions are necessary in setting these outputs,  
such as certain prices or the volumes of work that will be needed. 
Consequently, there are a number of uncertainty mechanisms within  
the RIIO framework that can result in adjustments to totex if actual  
prices or volumes differ from the assumptions. These mechanisms 
protect us and our customers from windfall gains and losses.
Where we under- or over-spend the allowed totex for reasons that are 
not covered by uncertainty mechanisms, there is a sharing factor. This 
means the under- or over-spend is shared between us and customers 
through an adjustment to allowed revenues in future years. This sharing 
factor provides an incentive for us to provide the outputs efficiently, as  
we are able to keep a portion of savings we make, with the remainder 
benefiting our customers.
174 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Additional Information
†
 This was a National Grid business until 31 March 2017.
The business in detail continued This sharing factor is one of the ways that RIIO has given innovation  
more prominence. Innovation includes traditional areas such as new 
technologies, as well as the broader challenge of finding new ways of 
working to deliver outputs more efficiently. This broader challenge has  
an impact on everyone in our business.
Allowed revenue to fund totex costs is split between fast and slow  
money – a concept under RIIO, based on a specified percentage that  
is fixed for the duration of the price control (except for UK GD’s repex  
which changes on a linear scale across the price control). Fast money 
represents the amount of totex we are able to recover in the next 
available year. Slow money is added to our RAV – effectively the 
regulatory IOU. For more details on the sharing factors under RIIO, 
please see the table below.
In addition to fast money, in each year we are allowed to recover  
a portion of the RAV (regulatory depreciation) and a return on the 
outstanding RAV balance.
The asset life for regulatory depreciation in electricity transmission  
spans 45 years across the RIIO period. This is also the case for the  
asset life depreciation for UK GD. We are also allowed to collect 
additional revenues related to non-controllable costs and incentives. 
The incentive mechanisms can increase or decrease our allowed 
revenue and result from our performance against various measures 
related to our outputs. RIIO has incentive mechanisms that encourage  
us to align our objectives with those of our customers and other 
stakeholders. For example, performance against our customer 
satisfaction targets can have a positive or negative effect of up to 1%  
of allowed annual revenues. Most of our incentives affect our revenues 
two years after the year of performance.
During the eight year period of the price control our regulator included  
a provision for a potential mid-period review, with scope driven by: 
• changes to outputs that can be justified by clear changes in 
government policy; and 
• the introduction of new outputs that are needed to meet the needs  
of consumers and other network users.
The mid-period review focused on three specific areas, all of which relate 
to National Grid’s transmission outputs (both gas and electricity).
Under the RIIO controls, we are required to deliver agreed outputs for 
consumers and are funded to cover the costs of delivering these. The 
eight year price control includes a number of uncertainty mechanisms  
to take account of the fact that some outputs and funding cannot be  
set with certainty at the start of the period. One of these uncertainty 
mechanisms is the review of outputs. In May 2016, Ofgem decided  
to launch a mid-period review focusing on the transmission outputs.

Additional information US Regulation
Regulators 
In the US, public utilities’ retail transactions are regulated by state  
utility commissions. The commissions serve as economic regulators, 
approving cost recovery and authorised rates of return. The state 
commissions establish the retail rates to recover the cost of transmission 
and distribution services, and focus on services and costs within their 
jurisdictions. They also serve the public interest by making sure utilities 
provide safe and reliable service at just and reasonable prices. The 
commissions establish service standards and approve public utility 
mergers and acquisitions.
Utilities are regulated at the federal level (FERC) for wholesale 
transactions, such as interstate transmission and wholesale electricity 
sales, including rates for these services. FERC also regulates public  
utility holding companies and centralised service companies, including 
those of our US businesses.
Regulatory process 
The US regulatory regime is premised on allowing the utility the 
opportunity to recover its cost of service and earn a reasonable return on 
its investments as determined by the commission. Utilities submit formal 
rate filings (‘rate cases’) to the relevant state regulator when additional 
revenues are necessary to provide safe, reliable service to customers. 
Utilities can be compelled to file a rate case due to complaints filed with 
the commission or at the commission’s own discretion.
The rate case is typically litigated with parties representing customers 
and other interests. In the states in which we operate, it can take nine to 
thirteen months for the commission to render a final decision. The utility 
is required to prove that the requested rate change is prudent and 
reasonable, and the requested rate plan can span multiple years. Unlike 
the state processes, the federal regulator has no specified timeline for 
adjudicating a rate case, but typically makes a final decision retroactive 
when the case is completed.
Gas and electricity rates are established from a revenue requirement,  
or cost of service, equal to the utility’s total cost of providing distribution 
or delivery service to its customers, as approved by the commission in 
the rate case. This revenue requirement includes operating expenses, 
depreciation, taxes and a fair and reasonable return on shareholder 
capital invested in certain components of the utility’s regulated asset 
base, typically referred to as its rate base.
The final revenue requirement and rates for service are approved in  
the rate case decision. The revenue requirement is derived from a 
comprehensive study of the utility’s total costs during a recent 12 month 
period of operations, referred to as a test year. Each commission has its 
own rules and standards for adjustments to the test year and may 
include forecasted capital investments and operating costs.

Our rate plans
Each operating company has a set of rates for service. We have three 
electric distribution operations (upstate New York, Massachusetts and 
Rhode Island) and six gas distribution networks (upstate New York,  
New York City, Long Island, Massachusetts (two) and Rhode Island).
Our operating companies have revenue decoupling mechanisms that 
de-link the companies’ revenues from the quantity of energy delivered 
and billed to customers. These mechanisms remove the natural 
disincentive utility companies have for promoting and encouraging 
customer participation in energy efficiency programmes that lower 
energy end use and thus distribution volumes.
Our rate plans are designed to a specific allowed RoE, by reference to an 
allowed operating expense level and rate base. Some rate plans include 
earnings sharing mechanisms that allow us to retain a proportion of the 
earnings above our allowed RoE, achieved through improving efficiency, 
with the balance benefiting customers.
In addition, our performance under certain rate plans is subject to service 
performance targets. We may be subject to monetary penalties in cases 
where we do not meet those targets.
One measure used to monitor the performance of our regulated 
businesses is a comparison of achieved RoE to allowed RoE. However, 
this measure cannot be used in isolation, as there are a number of 
factors that may prevent us from achieving the allowed RoE. These 
factors include financial market conditions, regulatory lag and decisions 
by the regulator preventing cost recovery in rates from customers.
We work to increase achieved RoE through: productivity improvements; 
positive performance against incentives or earned savings mechanisms 
such as energy efficiency programmes, where available; and filing a new 
rate case when achieved returns are lower than the Company could 
reasonably expect to attain through a new rate case.
Features of our rate plans 
We bill our customers for their use of electricity and gas services. 
Customer bills typically comprise a commodity charge, covering the  
cost of the electricity or gas delivered, and charges covering our delivery 
service. With the exception of residential gas customers in Rhode Island, 
our customers are allowed to select an unregulated competitive supplier 
for the commodity component of electricity and gas utility services. 
A substantial proportion of our costs, in particular electricity and gas 
commodity purchases, are pass-through costs, meaning they are  
fully recoverable from our customers. These pass-through costs are 
recovered through separate charges to customers that are designed to 
recover those costs with no profit. Rates are adjusted from time to time 
to make sure that any over- or under-recovery of these costs is returned 
to, or recovered from, our customers.
Our FERC-regulated transmission companies use formula rates (instead 
of rate cases) to set rates annually to recover their cost of service. 
Through the use of annual true-ups, formula rates recover our actual 
costs incurred and the allowed RoE based on the actual transmission 
rate base each year. The Company must make annual formula rate filings 
documenting the revenue requirement, which customers can review  
and challenge.
Revenue for our wholesale transmission businesses in New England  
and New York is collected from wholesale transmission customers, who 
are typically other utilities and include our own New England electricity 
distribution businesses. With the exception of upstate New York, which 
continues to combine retail transmission and distribution rates to 
end-use customers, these wholesale transmission costs are incurred  
by distribution utilities on behalf of their customers and are fully recovered 
as a pass-through from end-use customers as approved by each  
state commission.
Our Long Island generation plants sell capacity to LIPA under 15-year 
and 25-year power supply agreements, and within wholesale tariffs 
approved by FERC. Through the use of cost based formula rates, these 
long-term contracts provide a similar economic effect to cost of service 
rate regulation.
US regulatory filings 
The objectives of our rate case filings are to make sure we have the right 
cost of service, with the ability to earn a fair and reasonable rate of return 
while providing safe, reliable and economical service to our customers.  
In order to achieve these objectives and to reduce regulatory lag, we 
176 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Additional Information

have been requesting structural changes, such as revenue decoupling 
mechanisms, capital trackers, commodity-related bad debt true-ups  
and pension and other post-employment benefit true-ups, separately 
from base rates. These terms are explained below the table on page 179.
Below, we summarise significant developments in rate filings and the 
regulatory environment during the year. Following the final stabilisation 
upgrade to our new financial systems and the availability of 12 months  
of historical ‘test year’ data from those financial systems, we concluded  
a first round of full rate case filings in fiscal year 2017 , with a final rate case 
decision for Massachusetts Electric in September 2016, and followed by 
approval of three-year rate plans for KEDNY and KEDLI in December 
2016. We expect to make a number of additional such filings over the 
next two years to update the capital investment allowances and rate 
bases across many of our other businesses, including for upstate New 
York, Rhode Island and the Massachusetts gas companies in 2017–
2018. These filings are expected to capture the benefit of recent 
increased investments in asset replacement and network reliability, and 
reflect long-term growth in costs, including property tax and healthcare 
costs. Along with a clear focus on productivity, the filings are key to 
improving achieved returns in the Company’s US distribution activities.
Massachusetts 
Massachusetts electric rate case
Subsequent to the Company’s November 2015 general rate case filing, 
on 30 September 2016, MADPU issued a final order approving an overall 
increase in distribution revenue of approximately $101 million based upon 
an authorised return on equity of 9.9% and an authorised equity ratio  
of 50.70%. The order also allows for amortisation and recovery over five 
years of the $40.6 million of protected customer accounts receivable 
outstanding for more than 360 days. Storm recovery allowed in base 
rates increased from $4.3 million to $10.5 million. The order allows for  
an increase in annual capital investment recovery from $170 million to 
$249 million and the inclusion of property taxes related to these 
incremental capital additions.
Boston and Colonial rate cases
The Company plans to file a rate case for Boston Gas and Colonial Gas 
with MADPU in 2017 with new rates expected to come into effect in 
2018. The Massachusetts Gas rate case, the first rate case for Boston 
Gas and Colonial Gas since 2010, will update the gas companies’ 
allowed revenues to more closely reflect their cost of service and bring 
their earned RoEs closer to the allowed RoE.
Gas system enhancement programmes
On the gas side, on 5 May 2017 , MADPU approved our recovery  
of approximately $50.6 million, related to $241 million of anticipated 
investments in 2017 under this accelerated pipe replacement program, 
through rates effective May 2016 through April 2018. However, due to  
the application of the GSEP revenue cap, we are required to defer from 
recovery an additional $5.5 million of the 2017 revenue requirement until 
such time that we have room under the GSEP revenue cap to recover  
the deferred amount or in the next rate case that covers the period  
of investment.
Grid modernisation and smart energy solutions
In response to a 2014 regulatory requirement, the Company filed a 
Massachusetts electricity grid modernisation plan on 19 August 2015 
that proposed multiple investment options that would further MADPU’s 
goals of reducing the effect of outages, optimising demand, integrating 
distributed resources, and improving workforce and asset management. 
The Company presented a range of investment options for MADPU to 
consider, with investment levels over five years ranging from $238.6 
million to $792.9 million. MADPU established criteria that, if met, would 
allow the capital costs from the plan to be recovered through a separate 
capital recovery mechanism. MADPU initiated its review of the 
Company’s plan in April 2016 and hearings are scheduled for May 2017 . 
The Company also has been operating a Smart Energy Solutions Pilot 
with approximately 15,000 customers in Worcester, Massachusetts, 
since 1 January 2015. The Pilot has allowed the Company to deploy,  
test and learn from technologies similar to those proposed in the  
grid modernisation plan, including smart meters, demand response,  
an integrated communication system, and advanced distribution 
automation. The Pilot was scheduled to end on 31 December 2016, but 
the Company has received preliminary approval to continue operating 
the Pilot, and has proposed to continue the Pilot until 31 December 2018. 
This proposal is under review by MADPU.
Omnibus energy and solar legislation
In April 2016, Massachusetts solar legislation increased the amount of 
solar generation that a distribution company can own from 25 MWs to 35 
MWs, subject to receipt of MADPU prior approval by 31 December 2016 
and provided projects are constructed prior to 31 December 2017 . 
MADPU approved the Company’s proposal to own an additional 14 
MWs on 30 December 2016. The solar legislation also increased the  
cap on net metered solar installations and allows electricity distribution 
companies to submit proposals for a monthly minimum reliability 
contribution to be included on electric bills for accounts that receive  
net metering credits subject to MADPU review and approval. The 
purpose of the monthly minimum reliability contribution is to ensure  
that customers contribute to the fixed costs of ensuring the reliability, 
proper maintenance and safety of the electric distribution system.
In August 2016, Massachusetts omnibus energy legislation, among other 
new policies, allowed for state mandated energy storage deployment  
targets (to be adopted by 1 July 2017) and established requirements  
for electricity distribution companies to jointly and competitively solicit 
long-term contracting proposals for clean energy generation equal to 
approximately 9,450,000 MWh per year by 31 December 2022 and 
proposals for offshore wind projects equal to approximately 1,600 MW  
of aggregate nameplate capacity by 30 June 2027 . The first solicitations 
must be no later than 1 April 2017 and 30 June 2017 , respectively, and 
any contracts must be approved by MADPU. Electricity distributors are 
entitled to cost recovery of payments under the contracts and may seek 
approval for annual remuneration equal to as much as 2.75% of the 
annual payments made under those contracts. The Act also directs  
MADPU to open an investigation to establish specific criteria to identify 
Grade 3 gas leaks on the gas distribution system that have a significant 
environmental impact, to establish a plan to have gas companies repair 
these leaks and to provide for recovery of leak repair expenses as part  
of the gas system enhancement programmes.

On 28 April 2017 , the Company filed a one-year rate plan (but submitted 
two additional years of data to facilitate a multi-year settlement) for our 
upstate New York electricity and gas businesses, to increase electricity 
and gas delivery revenue by $326 million and $81 million, respectively,  
in the 12 months ending 31 March 2019 (fiscal year 2019). Additionally, 
the Company included a proposal to amortise a portion of its deferred 
liabilities to offset the Company’s need for rate relief. The filing is based 
on an RoE of 9.79% for the one-year rate filing, and includes annual 
reconciliation mechanisms for certain non-controllable costs.
The filing, which is expected to take 11 months to review and to conclude 
in March 2018, includes investments of $652 million and $171 million of 
core investment in the electricity and gas businesses, respectively, in 
fiscal year 2019 to modernise our infrastructure and improve safety and 
reliability of our networks. New York rate cases often led to multi-year 
rate plan settlements, which the Company will pursue through 
negotiations in this case. 
Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) 
In April 2014, NYPSC instituted the REV proceeding, which envisions a 
new role for utilities as distributed system platform (DSP) providers who 
create markets for distributed energy resources (DER) and more fully 
integrate DER in distribution system operations and planning. The REV 
proceeding’s objectives include: enhanced customer energy choices 
and control; improved electricity system efficiency, reliability, and 
resiliency; and cleaner, more diverse electricity generation. 
NYPSC issued an order on 19 May 2016 addressing ratemaking and 
utility revenue model policy framework issues under REV, including 
ratemaking reform, earnings opportunities (platform service revenues 
and earning adjustment mechanisms or EAMs), competitive market-
based earnings, customer data access, non-wires alternative solutions  
to displace traditional capital investment, standby service tariff 
enhancements, opt-in rate design (time-of-use rates, Smart Home rate 
pilots), enhancements to large customer demand charges, scorecard 
metrics, and mass market rate design. The Company’s initial Distributed 
177 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Additional information System Implementation Plan (DSIP) was filed with NYPSC on  
30 June 2016 and identified incremental investments in utility 
infrastructure necessary for developing DSP capabilities, market 
enablement and operations, advanced metering functionality, grid 
modernisation, and cyber security and privacy measures within the first 
five years. The DSIP is required to be updated and filed with NYPSC 
every two years. The Company rate plan filed in April 2017 incorporated 
investments related to advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), grid 
modernisation, cyber security, and new electricity and gas products  
and services. This rate plan also includes a proposal of outcome-based 
EAM to target energy and system efficiency, carbon reductions, and 
customer engagement. 
Clean Energy Standard (CES)
NYPSC issued an order on 1 August 2016 adopting a CES, consistent 
with the State Energy Plan, that 50% of New York’s electricity is to be 
generated by renewable sources by 2030 as part of a strategy to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. In particular, the CES 
established: obligations on load serving entities (LSEs) to financially 
support new renewable generation resources to serve their retail 
customers through Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and to financially 
support existing at-risk nuclear generators through the purchase of  
zero emissions credits (ZECs). The first REC and ZEC compliance years 
under the CES begin 1 January 2017 and 1 April 2017 , respectively.
KEDNY and KEDLI rate cases 
On 29 January 2016, KEDNY and KEDLI filed base rate cases with 
NYPSC. On 16 December 2016, NYPSC issued an order adopting the 
terms of a Joint Proposal, establishing a three-year rate plan negotiated 
for KEDNY and KEDLI (calendar years 2017–2019). KEDNY’s revenues 
under the Joint Proposal will increase by $272 million in 2017 . For 2018 
and 2019, incremental revenue increases will be $41 million and  
$49 million, respectively. KEDLI’s revenues under the Joint Proposal  
will increase by $112 million in 2017 . For 2018 and 2019, incremental 
revenue increases will be $20 million and $27 million, respectively. The 
revenue increases are based on a RoE of 9.0% and a 48% equity ratio.  
In addition to the revenue increases, the rate plans include funding for 
380 new positions and maintain tracker and true-up mechanisms for 
property taxes, commodity-related bad debt, and pension/OPEBs, 
reconciling mechanisms for city/state construction-related costs and  
Site Investigation Remediation (SIR) recovery surcharge/tracker 
mechanisms, a gas safety and reliability surcharge to recover the  
costs of incremental leak-prone pipe replacement and leak repairs,  
and incentive opportunities.
Rhode Island 
Rhode Island electricity and gas infrastructure, safety and 
reliability (ISR) plans 
State law provides our Rhode Island electricity and gas operating 
divisions with rate mechanisms that allow for the recovery of capital 
investment, including a return, and certain expenses outside base rate 
proceedings through the submission of annual electricity and gas  
ISR plans.
RIPUC approved the fiscal year 2018 gas and electric ISR plans on  
17 February 2017 and 9 March 2017 , respectively. The electric ISR  
plan encompasses a $100.6 million spending programme for capital 
investment, $9.6 million for cost of removal, and $10.5 million for 
operating and maintenance expenses for vegetation management  
and inspection and maintenance. The gas ISR plan encompasses  
$101.8 million for capital investment and incremental operation and 
maintenance expense.
Rhode Island combined gas and electricity rate case
The Company anticipates filing a combined Rhode Island electricity and 
gas rate case in late 2017/early 2018, with new rates effective in 2018. 
The rate case provides an opportunity to recalibrate base rates to reflect 
changes in costs since the last rate case which was effective in February 
2013. Rhode Island regulation also allows for proforma and normalising 
adjustments to test year data that include forecasts for costs expected  
in a future rate year.
Changing distribution system and modernisation of rates 
Numerous grid modernisation efforts are on-going in Rhode Island, 
including Docket 4600, Systems Integration Rhode Island (SIRI) and  
the Power Sector Transformation Initiative. In March 2016, RIPUC 
opened Docket 4600 to explore and understand the changing 
distribution system and related rate-setting processes through a 
stakeholder process. National Grid has been a participant in the Docket 
4600 stakeholder process which will conclude in Spring 2017 with a  
set of recommendations. In December 2016, the National Governors 
Association selected Rhode Island as one of four states to participate in 
a 16-month collaborative effort with state agencies and key stakeholders, 
including the Company, to develop a state action plan for modernising 
the electric power sector and integrating clean energy. This effort, 
referred to as the Power Sector Transformation Initiative, builds off of  
the SIRI collaborative effort that began in 2014 and resulted in a vision 
document released in January 2016.
FERC 
Complaints on New England transmission allowed RoE 
In September 2011, December 2012, July 2014, and April 2016, a series 
of four complaints were filed with FERC against certain transmission 
owners, including our New England electricity transmission business,  
to lower the base RoE, which FERC had authorised at 11.14% prior to  
the first complaint. FERC issued orders resolving only the first complaint, 
with the last order in March 2015, lowering the base RoE to 10.57%. A 
number of parties, including the Company, appealed FERC’s order on 
the first complaint to US federal court. On 14 April 2017 , the court 
vacated FERC’s order and remanded the first complaint back to FERC, 
requiring FERC to reconsider the methodology it adopted in its order. It  
is too early to determine when or how FERC will decide the four pending 
RoE complaints against the Company in light of the court’s decision.
National Grid LNG LLC 
On 1 April 2016, the Company filed an application seeking FERC 
approval of a planned $180 million liquefaction facility at the Providence, 
Rhode Island, LNG plant. We are currently awaiting a FERC order on our 
application. The target in-service date is December 2018. Rates for the 
new liquefaction service will be cost-based formula rates charged to 
customers who opt to take the liquefaction service. 
New England gas and electricity interdependency 
New England’s gas and electricity systems have become increasingly 
interdependent as the region’s reliance on gas-fired electricity generation 
has grown without commensurate pipeline infrastructure expansion, 
driving significant increases in the region’s wholesale and retail electricity 
costs and electricity reliability concerns. To address this challenge, New 
England’s governors are pursuing strategic infrastructure investments 
focused on expanding the region’s energy portfolio.
In January and June 2016, our Massachusetts and Rhode Island  
electric utilities, respectively, filed long-term contracts with the Access 
Northeast gas pipeline for state regulatory approvals. The Company has 
an equity stake in the pipeline. The Company subsequently withdrew  
its Massachusetts filing after an August 2016 Massachusetts Supreme 
Judicial Court decision that prohibited MADPU from approving such 
contracts, and on 13 January 2017 , the Company withdrew its 
application before RIPUC for approval of a contract with the pipeline.

Additional information Disclosure controls 
Working with management, including the Chief Executive and Finance 
Director, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation 
of our disclosure controls and procedures as at 31 March 2017 . Our 
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable 
assurance of achieving their objectives. However, the effectiveness  
of any system of disclosure controls and procedures has limitations, 
including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or 
overriding of the controls and procedures.
Even effective disclosure controls and procedures provide only 
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on the 
evaluation, the Chief Executive and Finance Director concluded that the 
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable 
assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that 
we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, 
summarised and reported as and when required and that such 
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, 
including the Chief Executive and Finance Director, as appropriate,  
to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
Internal control over financial reporting 
Our management, including the Chief Executive and Finance Director, 
has carried out an evaluation of our internal control over financial 
reporting pursuant to the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
sourcebook and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. As 
required by Section 404, management is responsible for establishing  
and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial 
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the 
Exchange Act).
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,  
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  
may deteriorate.
Management evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting was based on the revised Internal 
Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this 
evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial 
reporting was effective as at 31 March 2017 .
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , which has audited our consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 , has also audited 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Their 
attestation report can be found on page 83.
During the year, there were no changes in our internal control over 
financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably  
likely to materially affect it.
Risk factors 
Management of our risks is an important part of our internal control environment, as we describe on pages 15 to 18. In addition to the principal risks 
listed we face a number of inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and 
reputation, as well as the value and liquidity of our securities. 
Any investment decision regarding our securities and any forward-looking statements made by us should be considered in the light of these risk 
factors and the cautionary statement set out on the inside back cover. An overview of the key inherent risks we face is provided below.
Risk factors
Potentially harmful activities
Aspects of the work we do could potentially harm employees, 
contractors, members of the public or the environment. 
Potentially hazardous activities that arise in connection with our 
business include the generation, transmission and distribution of 
electricity and the storage, transmission and distribution of gas.
Electricity and gas utilities also typically use and generate hazardous 
and potentially hazardous products and by-products. In addition, there 
may be other aspects of our operations that are not currently regarded 
or proved to have adverse effects but could become so, such as the 
effects of electric and magnetic fields.
A significant safety or environmental incident, or the failure of our  
safety processes or of our occupational health plans, as well as the 
breach of our regulatory or contractual obligations or our climate 
change targets, could materially adversely affect our results of 
operations and our reputation.
Safety is a fundamental priority for us and we commit significant 
resources and expenditure to process safety and to monitoring 
personal safety, occupational health and environmental performance, 
and to meeting our obligations under negotiated settlements.
We are subject to laws and regulations in the UK and US governing 
health and safety matters to protect the public and our employees  
and contractors, who could potentially be harmed by these activities as 
well as laws and regulations relating to pollution, the protection of the 
environment, and the use and disposal of hazardous substances and 
waste materials.
These expose us to costs and liabilities relating to our operations and 
properties, including those inherited from predecessor bodies, whether 
currently or formerly owned by us, and sites used for the disposal of 
our waste.
The cost of future environmental remediation obligations is often 
inherently difficult to estimate and uncertainties can include the extent 
of contamination, the appropriate corrective actions and our share  
of the liability. We are increasingly subject to regulation in relation to 
climate change and are affected by requirements to reduce our own 
carbon emissions as well as to enable reduction in energy use by our 
customers.
If more onerous requirements are imposed or our ability to recover 
these costs under regulatory frameworks changes, this could have  
a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, results of 
operations and financial position.

Internal control and risk factors Internal control and risk factors
Infrastructure and IT systems
We may suffer a major network failure or interruption, or may not be 
able to carry out critical operations due to the failure of infrastructure, 
data or technology or a lack of supply. 
Operational performance could be materially adversely affected by  
a failure to maintain the health of our assets or networks, inadequate 
forecasting of demand, inadequate record keeping or control of data  
or failure of information systems and supporting technology. 
This in turn could cause us to fail to meet agreed standards of service, 
incentive and reliability targets, or be in breach of a licence, approval, 
regulatory requirement or contractual obligation. Even incidents that do 
not amount to a breach could result in adverse regulatory and financial 
consequences, as well as harming our reputation.
Where demand for electricity or gas exceeds supply and our balancing 
mechanisms are not able to mitigate this fully, a lack of supply to 
consumers may damage our reputation.
In addition to these risks, we may be affected by other potential events 
that are largely outside our control, such as the impact of weather 
(including as a result of climate change and major storms), unlawful  
or unintentional acts of third parties, insufficient or unreliable supply  
or force majeure. 
Weather conditions can affect financial performance and severe 
weather that causes outages or damages infrastructure together with 
our actual or perceived response could materially adversely affect 
operational and potentially business performance and our reputation.
Malicious attack, sabotage or other intentional acts, including breaches 
of our cyber security, may also damage our assets (which include 
critical national infrastructure) or otherwise significantly affect corporate 
activities and, as a consequence, have a material adverse impact on 
our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Unauthorised access to, or deliberate breaches of, our IT systems  
may also lead to manipulation of our proprietary business data or 
customer information.
Unauthorised access to private customer information may make  
us liable for a violation of data privacy regulations. Even where we 
establish business continuity controls and security against threats 
against our systems, these may not be sufficient.
Law and regulation
Changes in law or regulation or decisions by governmental bodies or 
regulators could materially adversely affect us. 
Most of our businesses are utilities or networks subject to regulation  
by governments and other authorities. Changes in law or regulation or 
regulatory policy and precedent, (including any changes arising as a 
result of the UK’s exit from the European Union), including decisions of 
governmental bodies or regulators, in the countries or states in which 
we operate could materially adversely affect us. 
If we fail to engage in the energy policy debate, we may not be able to 
influence future energy policy and deliver our strategy. 
Decisions or rulings concerning, for example:
(i)  whether licences, approvals or agreements to operate or supply 
are granted, amended or renewed, whether consents for 
construction projects are granted in a timely manner or whether 
there has been any breach of the terms of a licence, approval or 
regulatory requirement; and
(ii)  timely recovery of incurred expenditure or obligations, the ability 
to pass through commodity costs, a decoupling of energy usage 
and revenue, and other decisions relating to the impact of general 
economic conditions on us, our markets and customers, 
implications of climate change and of advancing energy
           technologies, whether aspects of our activities are contestable, 
the level of permitted revenues and dividend distributions for  
our businesses and in relation to proposed business 
development activities, 
could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations,  
cash flows, the financial condition of our businesses and the ability  
to develop those businesses in the future.
The remediation plans in place or being implemented to address 
control weaknesses in our US business may not operate as expected, 
as a result of which we may be unable to provide timely regulatory 
reporting, which may include the provision of financial statements.  
This could result in the imposition of regulatory fines, penalties and 
other sanctions, which could impact our operations, our reputation  
and our relationship with our regulators and other stakeholders.
For further information see pages 174 to 179, which explain our 
regulatory environment in detail.
Business performance
Current and future business performance may not meet our 
expectations or those of our regulators and shareholders. 
Earnings maintenance and growth from our regulated gas and 
electricity businesses will be affected by our ability to meet or exceed 
efficiency targets and service quality standards set by, or agreed with, 
our regulators. 
If we do not meet these targets and standards, or if we are not  
able to deliver the US rate plans strategy successfully, we may  
not achieve the expected benefits, our business may be materially 
adversely affected and our performance, results of operations and 
reputation may be materially harmed and we may be in breach  
of regulatory or contractual obligations.
181 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Additional information Growth and business development activity
Failure to respond to external market developments and execute our 
growth strategy may negatively affect our performance. Conversely, 
new businesses or activities that we undertake alone or with partners 
may not deliver target outcomes and may expose us to additional 
operational and financial risk. 
Failure to grow our core business sufficiently and have viable options 
for new future business over the longer term or failure to respond to the 
threats and opportunities presented by emerging technology (including 
for the purposes of adapting our networks to meet the challenges of 
increasing distributed energy resources) could negatively affect the 
Group’s credibility and reputation and jeopardise the achievement of 
intended financial returns.
Our business development activities and the delivery of our growth 
ambition, include acquisitions, disposals, joint ventures, partnering  
and organic investment opportunities such as development activities 
relating to changes to the energy mix and the integration of distributed 
energy resources and other advanced technologies. These are subject 
to a wide range of both external uncertainties (including the availability
of potential investment targets and attractive financing and the  
impact of competition for onshore transmission in both the UK and  
US) and internal uncertainties (including actual performance of our 
existing operating companies and our business planning model 
assumptions and ability to integrate acquired businesses effectively).  
As a result, we may suffer unanticipated costs and liabilities and  
other unanticipated effects.
We may also be liable for the past acts, omissions or liabilities of 
companies or businesses we have acquired, which may be unforeseen 
or greater than anticipated. In the case of joint ventures, we may have 
limited control over operations and our joint venture partners may have 
interests that diverge from our own. 
The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse 
impact on our results of operations or financial condition, and could 
also impact our ability to enter into other transactions.
Cost escalation
Changes in foreign currency rates, interest rates or commodity prices 
could materially impact earnings or our financial condition. 
We have significant operations in the US and so are subject to the 
exchange rate risks normally associated with non UK operations, 
including the need to translate US assets and liabilities, and income 
and expenses, into sterling, our primary reporting currency.
In addition, our results of operations and net debt position may be 
affected because a significant proportion of our borrowings, derivative 
financial instruments and commodity contracts are affected by
changes in interest rates, commodity price indices and exchange rates, 
in particular the dollar to sterling exchange rate.
Furthermore, our cash flow may be materially affected as a result of 
settling hedging arrangements entered into to manage our exchange 
rate, interest rate and commodity price exposure, or by cash collateral 
movements relating to derivative market values, which also depend  
on the sterling exchange rate into euro and other currencies.
We may be required to make significant contributions to fund pension 
and other post-retirement benefits. 
We participate in a number of pension schemes that together cover 
substantially all our employees. In both the UK and US, the principal 
schemes are DB schemes where the scheme assets are held 
independently of our own financial resources.
In the US, we also have other post-retirement benefit schemes. 
Estimates of the amount and timing of future funding for the UK and  
US schemes are based on actuarial assumptions and other factors, 
including: the actual and projected market performance of the scheme 
assets; future long-term bond yields; average life expectancies; and 
relevant legal requirements.
Actual performance of scheme assets may be affected by volatility  
in debt and equity markets. 
Changes in these assumptions or other factors may require us to make 
additional contributions to these pension schemes which, to the extent 
they are not recoverable under our price controls or state rate plans, 
could materially adversely affect the results of our operations and 
financial condition.
182 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Additional Information
Internal control and risk factors continued Internal control and risk factors
Financing and liquidity
An inability to access capital markets at commercially  
acceptable interest rates could affect how we maintain and  
grow our businesses. 
Our businesses are financed through cash generated from our ongoing 
operations, bank lending facilities and the capital markets, particularly 
the long-term debt capital markets. 
Some of the debt we issue is rated by credit rating agencies and 
changes to these ratings may affect both our borrowing capacity  
and borrowing costs. In addition, restrictions imposed by regulators 
may also limit how we service the financial requirements of our  
current businesses or the financing of newly acquired or developing 
businesses.
Financial markets can be subject to periods of volatility and shortages 
of liquidity, for example as a result of unexpected political or economic 
events. If we were unable to access the capital markets or other 
sources of finance at competitive rates for a prolonged period, our  
cost of financing may increase, the discretionary and uncommitted 
elements of our proposed capital investment programme may need  
to be reconsidered and the manner in which we implement our  
strategy may need to be reassessed. 
Such events could have a material adverse impact on our business, 
results of operations and prospects.
Some of our regulatory agreements impose lower limits for the 
long-term senior unsecured debt credit ratings that certain companies 
within the Group must hold or the amount of equity within their  
capital structures.
One of the principal limits requires National Grid plc to hold an 
investment grade long-term senior unsecured debt credit rating.  
In addition, some of our regulatory arrangements impose restrictions 
on the way we can operate. 
These include regulatory requirements for us to maintain adequate 
financial resources within certain parts of our operating businesses and 
may restrict the ability of National Grid plc and some of our subsidiaries 
to engage in certain transactions, including paying dividends, lending 
cash and levying charges. 
The inability to meet such requirements or the occurrence of any such 
restrictions may have a material adverse impact on our business and 
financial condition.
The remediation plans in place or being implemented to address 
control weaknesses in our US business may not operate as expected, 
as a result of which we may be unable to provide accurate financial 
information to our debt investors in a timely manner. 
Our debt agreements and banking facilities contain covenants, 
including those relating to the periodic and timely provision of financial 
information by the issuing entity and financial covenants, such as 
restrictions on the level of subsidiary indebtedness. 
Failure to comply with these covenants, or to obtain waivers of those 
requirements, could in some cases trigger a right, at the lender’s 
discretion, to require repayment of some of our debt and may restrict 
our ability to draw upon our facilities or access the capital markets.
Customers and counterparties
Customers and counterparties may not perform their obligations. 
Our operations are exposed to the risk that customers, suppliers, 
banks and other financial institutions and others with whom we  
do business will not satisfy their obligations, which could materially 
adversely affect our financial position.
This risk is significant where our subsidiaries have concentrations of 
receivables from gas and electricity utilities and their affiliates, such  
as from our current PSEG-LI transition services agreement, as well as 
industrial customers and other purchasers, and may also arise where 
customers are unable to pay us as a result of increasing commodity 
prices or adverse economic conditions. 
To the extent that counterparties are contracted with for physical 
commodities (gas and electricity) and they experience events that 
impact their own ability to deliver, we may suffer supply interruption  
as described in Infrastructure and IT systems on page 181.
There is also a risk to us where we invest excess cash or enter into 
derivatives and other financial contracts with banks or other financial 
institutions. Banks who provide us with credit facilities may also fail to 
perform under those contracts.
Employees and others
We may fail to attract, develop and retain employees with the 
competencies, including leadership and business capabilities,  
values and behaviours required to deliver our strategy and vision  
and ensure they are engaged to act in our best interests. 
Our ability to implement our strategy depends on the capabilities  
and performance of our employees and leadership at all levels of the 
business. Our ability to implement our strategy and vision may be 
negatively affected by the loss of key personnel or an inability to attract, 
integrate, engage and retain appropriately qualified personnel, or if 
significant disputes arise with our employees.
As a result, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
There is a risk that an employee or someone acting on our behalf may 
breach our internal controls or internal governance framework or may 
contravene applicable laws and regulations. This could have an impact 
on the results of our operations, our reputation and our relationship with 
our regulators and other stakeholders.

Additional information Articles of Association 
The following description is a summary of the material terms of our 
Articles and applicable English law. It is a summary only and is qualified 
in its entirety by reference to the Articles. 
Summary 
The Articles set out the Company’s internal regulations. Copies are 
available on our website and upon request. Amendments to the Articles 
have to be approved by at least 75% of those voting at a general meeting 
of the Company. Subject to company law and the Articles, the Directors 
may exercise all the powers of the Company. They may delegate 
authorities to committees and day-to-day management and decision-
making to individual Executive Directors. The committee structure is set 
out on page 36.
General 
The Company is incorporated under the name National Grid plc and  
is registered in England and Wales with registered number 4031152. 
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s objects are unrestricted. 
Directors 
Under the Articles, a Director must disclose any personal interest in  
a matter and may not vote in respect of that matter, subject to certain 
limited exceptions. As permitted under the Companies Act 2006, the 
Articles allow non conflicted Directors to authorise a conflict or potential 
conflict for a particular matter. In doing so, the non conflicted Directors 
must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to 
promote the success of the Company for the benefit of the shareholders 
as a whole.
The Directors (other than a Director acting in an executive capacity)  
are paid fees for their services. In total, these fees must not exceed 
£2,000,000 per year or any higher sum decided by an ordinary resolution 
at a general meeting of shareholders. In addition, special pay may be 
awarded to a Director who acts in an executive capacity, serves on a 
committee, performs services which the Directors consider to extend 
beyond the ordinary duties of a director, devotes special attention to the 
business of National Grid, or goes or lives abroad on the Company’s 
behalf. Directors may also receive reimbursement for expenses properly 
incurred, and may be awarded pensions and other benefits. The 
compensation awarded to the Executive Directors is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. Further details of Directors’ remuneration  
are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report (see pages 54 to 71).
The Directors may exercise all the powers of National Grid to borrow 
money. However, the aggregate principal amount of all the Group’s 
borrowings outstanding at any time must not exceed £35 billion or any 
other amount approved by shareholders by an ordinary resolution at  
a general meeting.
Directors can be appointed or removed by the Board or shareholders  
at a general meeting. Directors must stand for election at the first AGM 
following their appointment to the Board. Each Director must retire  
at least every three years, although they will be eligible for re-election.  
In accordance with best practice introduced by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all Directors wishing to continue in office currently 
offer themselves for re-election annually. No person is disqualified from 
being a Director or is required to vacate that office by reason of attaining 
a maximum age.
A Director is not required to hold shares in National Grid in order to 
qualify as a Director.
Rights, preferences and restrictions 
(i) Dividend rights 
National Grid may not pay any dividend otherwise than out of profits 
available for distribution under the Companies Act 2006 and other 
applicable provisions of English law. In addition, as a public company, 
National Grid may only make a distribution if, at the time of the 
distribution, the amount of its net assets is not less than the aggregate  
of its called up share capital and undistributable reserves (as defined in 
the Companies Act 2006) and to the extent that the distribution does not 
reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate. Ordinary 
shareholders and ADS holders receive dividends.
Subject to these points, shareholders may, by ordinary resolution, 
declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the 
shareholders, but not exceeding the amount recommended by the 
Board. The Board may pay interim dividends if it considers that National 
Grid’s financial position justifies the payment. Any dividend or interest 
unclaimed for 12 years from the date when it was declared or became 
due for payment will be forfeited and revert to National Grid.
(ii) Voting rights 
Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares and to any 
other provisions of the Articles, at any general meeting on a show of 
hands, every shareholder who is present in person will have one vote  
and on a poll, every shareholder will have one vote for every share they 
hold. On a show of hands or poll, shareholders may cast votes either 
personally or by proxy. A proxy need not be a shareholder. Under the 
Articles, all substantive resolutions at a general meeting must be  
decided on a poll. Ordinary shareholders and ADS holders can vote  
at general meetings. 
(iii) Liquidation rights 
In a winding up, a liquidator may (in each case with the sanction of a 
special resolution passed by the shareholders and any other sanction 
required under English law): (a) divide among the shareholders the  
whole or any part of National Grid’s assets (whether the assets are of  
the same kind or not); the liquidator may, for this purpose, value any 
assets and determine how the division should be carried out as between 
shareholders or different classes of shareholders, or (b) transfer any  
part of the assets to trustees on trust for the benefit of the shareholders 
as the liquidator determines. In neither case will a shareholder be 
compelled to accept assets upon which there is a liability. 
(iv) Restrictions 
There are no restrictions on the transfer or sale of ordinary shares. Some 
of the Company’s employee share plans, details of which are contained 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, include restrictions on the transfer 
of shares while the shares are subject to the plan. Where, under an 
employee share plan operated by the Company, participants are the 
beneficial owners of the shares but not the registered owner, the voting 
rights may be exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the 
participant. Treasury shares do not attract a vote or dividends. 
Variation of rights 
Subject to applicable provisions of English law, the rights attached to  
any class of shares of National Grid may be varied or cancelled. This 
must be with the written consent of the holders of three quarters in 
nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction  
of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of  
the shares of that class.
184 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Additional Information
Shareholder information Shareholder information
General meetings 
AGMs must be convened each year within six months of the Company’s 
accounting reference date upon 21 clear days’ advance written notice. 
Under the Articles, any other general meeting may be convened provided 
at least 14 clear days’ written notice is given, subject to annual approval 
of shareholders. In certain limited circumstances, the Company can 
convene a general meeting by shorter notice. The notice must specify, 
among other things, the nature of the business to be transacted, the 
place, the date and the time of the meeting. 
Rights of non residents 
There are no restrictions under the Articles that would limit the rights  
of persons not resident in the UK to vote in relation to ordinary shares. 
Disclosure of interests
Under the Companies Act 2006, National Grid may, by written notice, 
require a person whom it has reasonable cause to believe to be or to 
have been, in the last three years, interested in its shares to provide 
additional information relating to that interest. Under the Articles, failure  
to provide such information may result in a shareholder losing their  
rights to attend, vote or exercise any other right in relation to 
shareholders’ meetings.
Under the UK Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
sourcebook, there is also an obligation on a person who acquires  
or ceases to have a notifiable interest in shares in National Grid to  
notify the Company of that fact. The disclosure threshold is 3% and 
disclosure is required each time the person’s direct and indirect  
holdings reach, exceed or fall below each 1% threshold thereafter.
The UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers imposes strict disclosure 
requirements with regard to dealings in the securities of an offeror or 
offeree company, and also on their respective associates, during the 
course of an offer period. Other regulators in the UK, US and elsewhere 
may have, or assert, notification or approval rights over acquisitions or 
transfers of shares.
Depositary payments to the Company
The Depositary reimburses the Company for certain expenses it  
incurs in relation to the ADS programme. The Depositary also pays the 
standard out-of-pocket maintenance costs for the ADSs, which consist 
of the expenses for the mailing of annual and interim financial reports, 
printing and distributing dividend cheques, electronic filing of US federal 
tax information, mailing required tax forms, stationery, postage, facsimile 
and telephone calls. It also reimburses the Company for certain investor 
relationship programmes or special investor relations promotional 
activities. There are limits on the amount of expenses for which the 
Depositary will reimburse the Company, but the amount of 
reimbursement is not necessarily tied to the amount of fees the 
Depositary collects from investors. 
For the period 19 May 2016 to 17 May 2017 , the Company received a 
total of $2,126,791.80 in reimbursements from the Depositary consisting 
of $1,420,248.93 and $706,542.87 received in November 2016 and 
March 2017 respectively. Fees that are charged on cash dividends will  
be apportioned between the Depositary and the Company, see below.
Any questions from ADS holders should be directed to The Bank of  
New York Mellon at the contact details on page 207 .
Description of securities other than equity securities: 
depositary fees and charges
The Bank of New York Mellon, as the Depositary, collects fees, by 
deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a portion 
of distributable property, for: 
• delivery and surrender of ADSs directly from investors depositing 
shares or surrendering ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal or from 
intermediaries acting for them; and
• making distributions to investors (including, it is expected,  
cash dividends).
The Depositary may generally refuse to provide fee attracting services 
until its fees for those services are paid.
Persons depositing or 
withdrawing shares must pay: For
$5.00 per 100 ADSs (or portion  
of 100 ADSs)
Issuance of ADSs, including issuances 
resulting from a distribution of shares

securities that are distributed by the 
Depositary to ADS holders.
Registration or transfer fees Transfer and registration of shares on 
our share register to or from the name  
of the Depositary or its agent when they 
deposit or withdraw shares.

The Company’s Deposit Agreement under which the ADSs are issued 
allows a fee of up to $0.05 per ADS to be charged for any cash 
distribution made to ADS holders, including cash dividends. ADS holders 
who receive cash in relation to the 2016/17 final dividend will be charged 
a fee of $0.02 per ADS by the Depositary prior to distribution of the cash 
dividend.

Material interests in shares
As at 31 March 2017 , National Grid had been notified of the following 
holdings in voting rights of 3% or more in the issued share capital of the 
Company: 
Number of ordinary shares % of voting rights
1
Black Rock, Inc. 226,594,591 6.01
The Capital Group 
Companies, Inc. 145,094,617 3.88
Competrol International 
Investments Limited 137,164,285 3.65
1.  This number is calculated in relation to the issued share capital at the time the holding  
was disclosed.
As at 17 May 2017 , no further notifications have been received.
The rights attached to ordinary shares are detailed on page 184.  
All ordinary shares and all major shareholders have the same voting 
rights. The Company is not, to the best of its knowledge, directly or 
indirectly controlled. 
Share capital
As at 17 May 2017 , the share capital of the Company consists of  
ordinary shares of 11
17
∕ 43 pence nominal value each and ADSs, which 
represent five ordinary shares each. Subject to shareholder approval  
of the proposed share consolidation, at the General Meeting of the 
Company to be held on 19 May 2017 , the nominal value of the 
Company’s ordinary shares will be 12
204
/ 473 pence with effect from  
22 May 2017 .
Authority to purchase shares
Shareholder approval was given at the 2016 AGM to purchase up to  
10% of the Company’s share capital (being 374,682,662 ordinary shares). 
The Directors intend to seek shareholder approval to renew this authority 
at the 2017 AGM. 
In addition, the authority to purchase shares from the 2016 AGM is 
proposed for renewal at a General Meeting of the Company to be held 
on 19 May 2017 to cover the period between the date of the General 
Meeting and the 2017 AGM. The renewed authority is required due to  
the change to the nominal value of the ordinary shares that would result  
from the share consolidation proposed at the same General Meeting. 
In some circumstances, the Company may find it advantageous to  
have the authority to purchase its own shares in the market, where the 
Directors believe this would be in the interests of shareholders generally. 
The Directors believe that it is an important part of the financial 
management of the Company to have the flexibility to repurchase issued 
shares in order to manage its capital base, including actively managing 
share issuances from the operation of the scrip dividend scheme. It is 
expected that repurchases to manage share issuances under the scrip 
dividend scheme will not exceed 2.5% of the issued share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) per annum. 
As explained in the Notice of General Meeting issued on 19 April 2017 ,  
it is intended that part of the proceeds from the sale of a majority interest 
in the Company’s UK Gas Distribution business will be returned to 
shareholders by way of purchase of the Company’s shares. Subject to 
shareholder approval at the General Meeting to be held on 19 May 2017 
and the 2017 AGM, the Company and the Directors therefore intend  
to use this authority in this context to return approximately £835 million  
to shareholders by way of on-market purchases of the Company’s 
ordinary shares.
When purchasing shares, the Company has, and will continue to,  
take into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other 
investment and financing opportunities and the overall financial  
position of the Company.
During the year the Company purchased ordinary shares in the capital  
of the Company as part of the management of the dilutive effect of share 
issuances under the scrip dividend scheme.

1.  Announced: 23 February 2016 and Expired: 14 April 2016 (Authority for no. of shares: 
3,357,000 of which 657,000 during the financial year ended 31 March 2017).
2.  Announced: 24 November 2016 and Expired: 21 January 2017 (Authority for no. shares: 
15,447,044 ordinary shares).
3.  Announced: 6 February 2017 and Expired: 14 February 2017 (Authority for no. shares: 
3,498,317 ordinary shares).
No purchases were made in the United States or in respect of the Company’s ADSs.
As at the date of this report, the Company held 188,996,970 ordinary 
shares as treasury shares, representing 4.79% of the Company’s called 
up share capital.
186 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Additional Information
Shareholder information continued Shareholder information
Authority to allot shares 
Shareholder approval was given at the 2016 AGM to allot shares of  
up to one third of the Company’s share capital. The Directors are  
seeking this same level of authority this year. The Directors consider  
that the Company will have sufficient flexibility with this level of authority 
to respond to market developments. This authority is in line with  
investor guidelines.
The Directors currently have no intention of issuing new shares, or  
of granting rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares, 
except in relation to, or in connection with, the operation and 
management of the Company’s scrip dividend scheme and the exercise 
of options under the Company’s share plans. No issue of shares will be 
made which would effectively alter control of the Company without the 
sanction of shareholders in general meeting.
The Company expects to actively manage the dilutive effect of share 
issuance arising from the operation of the scrip dividend scheme. In 
some circumstances, additional shares may be allotted to the market for 
this purpose under the authority provided by this resolution. Under these 
unlikely circumstances, it is expected that the associated allotment of 
new shares (or rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares) 
will not exceed 1% of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) 
per year. 
Dividend waivers 
The trustees of the National Grid Employees Share Trust, which are 
independent of the Company, waived the right to dividends paid during 
the year, and have agreed to waive the right to future dividends, in 
relation to the ordinary shares and ADSs held by the trust. 
Under the Company’s ADS programme, the right to dividends in relation 
to the ordinary shares underlying the ADSs was waived during the year 
by the Depositary, under an arrangement whereby the Company pays 
the monies to satisfy any dividends separately to the Depositary for 
distribution to ADS holders entitled to the dividend. This arrangement  
is expected to continue for future dividends.
Share price
National Grid ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange 
under the symbol NG and the ADSs are listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange under the symbol NGG.

below) of owning ADSs and ordinary shares. A US Holder is beneficial 
owner of ADSs or ordinary shares that:
• is for US federal income tax purposes (i) an individual citizen or 
resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organised 
under the laws of the United States, any State thereof, (iii) an estate 
the income of which is subject to US federal income tax without 
regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States  
is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the 
trust and one or more US persons have the authority to control all 
substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has elected to be treated 
as a domestic trust for US federal income tax purposes;
• is not resident or ordinarily resident in the UK for  
UK tax purposes; and
• does not hold ADSs or ordinary shares in connection with the 
conduct of a business or the performance of services in the UK  
or otherwise in connection with a branch, agency or permanent 
establishment in the UK.

Additional information This discussion is not a comprehensive description of all the US federal 
income tax and UK tax considerations that may be relevant to any 
particular investor (including consequences under the US alternative 
minimum tax or net investment income tax) and does not address state, 
local, or other tax laws. National Grid has assumed that shareholders, 
including US Holders, are familiar with the tax rules applicable to 
investments in securities generally and with any special rules to which 
they may be subject. This discussion deals only with US Holders who 
hold ADSs or ordinary shares as capital assets. It does not address the 
tax treatment of investors who are subject to special rules, such as: 
• financial institutions; 
• insurance companies;
• dealers in securities or currencies;
• investors who elect mark-to-market treatment;
• entities treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities and 
their partners;
• individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts;
• tax-exempt organisations;
• investors who own (directly or indirectly) 10% or more of our voting 
stock;
• investors who hold ADSs or ordinary shares as a position in a 
straddle, hedging transaction or conversion transaction; 
• persons that have ceased to be US citizens or lawful permanent 
residents of the US; and 
• investors whose functional currency is not the US dollar. 
The statements regarding US and UK tax laws and administrative 
practices set forth below are based on laws, treaties, judicial decisions 
and regulatory interpretations in effect on the date of this document. 
These laws and practices are subject to change without notice, 
potentially with retroactive effect. In addition, the statements set forth 
below are based on the representations of the Depositary and assume 
that each party to the Deposit Agreement will perform its obligations 
thereunder in accordance with its terms. 
US Holders of ADSs generally will be treated as the owners of the 
ordinary shares represented by those ADSs for US federal income  
tax purposes. For the purposes of the Tax Convention, the Estate Tax 
Convention and UK tax considerations, this discussion assumes that a 
US Holder of ADSs will be treated as the owner of the ordinary shares 
represented by those ADSs. HMRC has stated that it will continue to 
apply its long-standing practice of treating a holder of ADSs as holding 
the beneficial interest in the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs; 
however, we note that this is an area of some uncertainty and may be 
subject to change.
US Holders should consult their own advisors regarding the tax 
consequences of buying, owning and disposing of ADSs or ordinary 
shares in light of their particular circumstances, including the effect  
of any state, local, or other tax laws.
Taxation of dividends 
The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid  
to US Holders. 
US Holders should assume that any cash distribution paid by us with 
respect to ADSs or ordinary shares will be reported as dividend income. 
While dividend income received from non-US corporations is generally 
taxable to a non-corporate US Holder as ordinary income for US federal 
income tax purposes, dividend income received by a non-corporate US 
Holder from us generally will be taxable at the same favourable rates 
applicable to long-term capital gains provided (i) either (a) we are eligible 
for the benefits of the Tax Convention or (b) ADSs or ordinary shares  
are treated as ‘readily tradable’ on an established securities market in  
the United States and (ii) we are not, for our taxable year during which  
the dividend is paid or the prior year, a passive foreign investment 
company for US federal income tax purposes (a PFIC), and certain other 
requirements are met. We (1) expect that our shares will be treated as 
‘readily tradable’ on an established securities market in the United States 
as a result of the trading of ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange and 
(2) believe we are eligible for the benefits of the Tax Convention. 
Based on our audited financial statements and the nature of our business 
activities, we believe that we were not treated as a PFIC for US federal 
income tax purposes with respect to our taxable year ending 31 March 
2017 . In addition, based on our current expectations regarding the value 
and nature of our assets, the sources and nature of our income, and the 
nature of our business activities, we do not anticipate becoming a PFIC  
in the foreseeable future.
Dividends received by corporate US Holders with respect to ADSs or 
ordinary shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
generally allowed to corporations.
Taxation of capital gains 
US Holders will not be subject to UK taxation on any capital gain realised 
on the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares.
Provided that we are not a PFIC for any taxable year during which  
a US Holder holds their ADSs or ordinary shares, upon a sale or other 
disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares, a US Holder generally will 
recognise capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the US 
dollar value of the amount realised on the sale or other disposition and 
the US Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs or ordinary shares.  
Such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss  
if the ADSs or ordinary shares were held for more than one year. For 
non-corporate US Holders, long-term capital gain is generally taxed at  
a lower rate than ordinary income. A US Holder’s ability to deduct capital 
losses is subject to significant limitations.

Shareholder information continued Shareholder information
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT)
Transfers of ordinary shares – SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the 
amount or value of the consideration will generally be payable on any 
agreement to transfer ordinary shares that is not completed using a  
duly stamped instrument of transfer (such as a stock transfer form).
Where an instrument of transfer is executed and duly stamped before  
the expiry of the six year period beginning with the date on which the 
agreement is made, the SDRT liability will be cancelled. If a claim is  
made within the specified period, any SDRT which has been paid will be 
refunded. SDRT is due whether or not the agreement or transfer is made 
or carried out in the UK and whether or not any party to that agreement 
or transfer is a UK resident.
Purchases of ordinary shares completed using a stock transfer  
form will generally result in a UK stamp duty liability at the rate of  
0.5% (rounded up to the nearest £5) of the amount or value of the 
consideration. Paperless transfers under the CREST paperless 
settlement system will generally be liable to SDRT at the rate of 0.5%, 
and not stamp duty. SDRT is generally the liability of the purchaser  
and UK stamp duty is usually paid by the purchaser or transferee.
Transfers of ADSs – No UK stamp duty will be payable on the 
acquisition or transfer of existing ADSs or beneficial ownership of ADSs, 
provided that any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer 
is executed outside the UK and remains at all times outside the UK.
An agreement for the transfer of ADSs in the form of ADRs will not result 
in a SDRT liability. A charge to stamp duty or SDRT may arise on the 
transfer of ordinary shares to the Depositary or The Bank of New York 
Mellon as agent of the Depositary (the Custodian).
The rate of stamp duty or SDRT will generally be 1.5% of the value of the 
consideration or, in some circumstances, the value of the ordinary shares 
concerned. However, there is no 1.5% SDRT charge on the issue of 
ordinary shares (or, where it is integral to the raising of new capital, the 
transfer of ordinary shares) to the Depositary or the Custodian. 
The Depositary will generally be liable for the stamp duty or SDRT. Under 
the terms of the Deposit Agreement, the Depositary will charge any tax 
payable by the Depositary or the Custodian (or their nominees) on the 
deposit of ordinary shares to the party to whom the ADSs are delivered 
against such deposits. If the stamp duty is not a multiple of £5, the duty 
will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of £5.
US information reporting and backup withholding tax 
Dividend payments made to US Holders and proceeds paid from the 
sale, exchange, redemption or disposal of ADSs or ordinary shares to  
US Holders may be subject to information reporting to the US Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS). Such payments may be subject to backup 
withholding taxes if the US Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer 
identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to comply 
with applicable certification requirements.
US Holders should consult their tax advisors about these rules and any 
other reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or disposition 
of ADSs or ordinary shares, including reporting requirements related to 
the holding of certain foreign financial assets.
UK inheritance tax
An individual who is domiciled in the US for the purposes of the Estate 
Tax Convention and who is not a UK national for the purposes of the 
Estate Tax Convention will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax 
in respect of (i) the ADSs or ordinary shares on the individual’s death or 
(ii) a gift of the ADSs or ordinary shares during the individual’s lifetime. 
This is not the case where the ADSs or ordinary shares are part of the 
business property of the individual’s permanent establishment in the  
UK or relate to a fixed base in the UK of an individual who performs 
independent personal services.
Special rules apply to ADSs or ordinary shares held in trust. In the 
exceptional case where the ADSs or shares are subject both to UK 
inheritance tax and to US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax 
Convention generally provides for the tax paid in the UK to be credited 
against tax paid in the US.
Capital gains tax (CGT) for UK resident shareholders
You can find CGT information relating to National Grid shares for UK 
resident shareholders on our website under: Investors, Shareholder 
centre, More information and help. Share prices on specific dates are 
also available on our website.
189 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Additional information All-employee share plans
The Company has a number of all-employee share plans as described 
below, which operated during the year. These allow UK- or US-based 
employees to participate in either HMRC (UK) or IRS (US) approved plans 
and to become shareholders in National Grid.
Sharesave
Employees resident in the UK are eligible to participate in the Sharesave 
plan. Under this plan, participants may contribute between £5 and £500 
in total each month, for a fixed period of three years, five years or both. 
Contributions are taken from net salary.
SIP
Employees resident in the UK are eligible to participate in the SIP . 
Contributions up to £150 are deducted from participants’ gross salary 
and used to purchase ordinary shares in National Grid each month.  
The shares are placed in trust. 
US Incentive Thrift Plans
Employees of National Grid’s US companies are eligible to participate  
in the Thrift Plans, which are tax-advantaged savings plans (commonly 
referred to as 401(k) plans). They are DC pension plans that give 
participants the opportunity to invest up to applicable federal salary 
limits. The federal limits for calendar year 2016 are: for pre-tax 
contributions, a maximum of 50% of salary limited to $18,000 for those 
under the age of 50 and $24,000 for those age 50 and above; for 
post-tax contributions, up to 15% of salary. The total amount of 
employee contributions (pre-tax and post-tax) may not exceed 50% of 
compensation, and are further subject to the combined federal annual 
contribution limit of $53,000. For calendar year 2017 , participants may 
invest up to the applicable federal salary limits: for pre-tax contributions, 
a maximum of 50% of salary limited to $18,000 for those under the  
age of 50 and $24,000 for those age 50 and above; for post-tax 
contributions, up to 15% of salary. The total amount of employee 
contributions (pre-tax and post-tax) may not exceed 50% of 
compensation, and are further subject to the combined federal annual 
contribution limit of $54,000.
ESPP
Employees of National Grid’s US companies are eligible to participate in 
the ESPP (commonly referred to as a 423(b) plan). Eligible employees 
have the opportunity to purchase ADSs on a monthly basis at a 15% 
discounted price. Under the plan, employees may contribute up to 20% 
of base pay each year, up to a maximum annual contribution of $18,888 
to purchase ADSs in National Grid.
Change of control provisions
No compensation would be paid for loss of office of Directors on a 
change of control of the Company. As at 31 March 2017 , the Company 
had undrawn borrowing facilities of £3.7 billion available to it with a 
number of banks and a further £2.1 billion of drawn bank loans which,  
on a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, may 
alter or terminate. All of the Company’s share plans contain provisions 
relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options would 
normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to 
the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time. In the event 
of a change of control of the Company, a number of governmental and 
regulatory consents or approvals are likely to be required, arising from 
laws or regulations of the UK, US or the EU. Such consents or approvals 
may also be required for acquisitions of equity securities that do not 
amount to a change of control.
No other agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change  
of control of the Company following a takeover bid are considered to be 
significant in terms of their potential impact on the business as a whole.
Code of Ethics
In accordance with US legal requirements, the Board has adopted a 
Code of Ethics for senior financial professionals. This code is available  
on our website (where any amendments or waivers will also be posted) 
under: About us, Corporate governance, Code of Ethics. There were  
no amendments to, or waivers of, our Code of Ethics during the year.
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Board has a policy and 
procedure in place for the disclosure and authorisation (if appropriate) of 
actual and potential conflicts of interest. The Board continues to monitor 
and note possible conflicts of interest that each Director may have. The 
Directors are regularly reminded of their continuing obligations in relation 
to conflicts, and are required annually to review and confirm their external 
interests. During the year ended 31 March 2017 , no actual or potential 
conflicts of interest were identified, which required approval by the Board. 
The Board has also considered and noted a number of situations in 
relation to which no actual conflict of interest was identified.
Corporate governance practices: differences from  
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards
The Company is listed on the NYSE and is therefore required to disclose 
differences in its corporate governance practices adopted as a UK listed 
company, compared with those of a US company.
The corporate governance practices of the Company are primarily based 
on the requirements of the Code but substantially conform to those 
required of US companies listed on the NYSE. The following is a 
summary of the significant ways in which the Company’s corporate 
governance practices differ from those followed by US companies  
under Section 303A Corporate Governance Standards of the NYSE.
• The NYSE rules and the Code apply different tests for the 
independence of Board members.
• The NYSE rules require a separate nominating/corporate governance 
committee composed entirely of independent Directors. There is no 
requirement for a separate corporate governance committee in the 
UK. Under the Company’s corporate governance policies, all 
Directors on the Board discuss and decide upon governance issues, 
and the Nominations Committee makes recommendations to the 
Board with regard to certain of the responsibilities of a corporate 
governance committee.
• The NYSE rules require listed companies to adopt and disclose 
corporate governance guidelines. While the Company reports 
compliance with the Code in each Annual Report and Accounts,  
the UK requirements do not require the Company to adopt and 
disclose separate corporate governance guidelines.
• The NYSE rules require a separate audit committee composed of  
at least three independent members. While the Company’s Audit 
Committee exceeds the NYSE’s minimum independent Non-
executive Director membership requirements, it should be noted that 
the quorum for a meeting of the Audit Committee, of two independent 
Non-executive Directors, is less than the minimum membership 
requirements under the NYSE rules.
• The NYSE rules require a compensation committee composed 
entirely of independent Directors, and prescribe criteria to evaluate 
the independence of the committee’s members and its ability to 
engage external compensation advisors. While the Code prescribes 
different independence criteria, the Non-executive Directors on the 
Remuneration Committee have each been deemed independent  
by the Board under the NYSE rules. Although the evaluation criteria 
for appointment of external advisors differ under the Code, the 
Remuneration Committee is solely responsible for appointment, 
retention and termination of such advisors.

Other disclosures Other disclosures
Directors’ indemnity
The Company has arranged, in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 and the Articles, qualifying third-party indemnities against financial 
exposure that Directors may incur in the course of their professional 
duties. Equivalent qualifying third-party indemnities were, and remain,  
in force for the benefit of those directors who stood down from the Board 
in prior financial years for matters arising when they were directors of the 
Company. Alongside these indemnities, the Company places Directors’ 
and Officers’ liability insurance cover for each director. 
Employees
We negotiate with recognised unions. It is our policy to maintain well 
developed communications and consultation programmes and there 
have been no material disruptions to our operations from labour disputes 
during the past five years. National Grid believes that it can conduct its 
relationships with trade unions and employees in a satisfactory manner. 
Human Rights
Respect for human rights is incorporated into our employment practices 
and our values, which are integral to our ethical business conduct guide 
– the way in which we conduct ourselves allows us to build trust with the 
people we work with. We earn this trust by doing things in the right way, 
building our reputation as an ethical company that our stakeholders want 
to do business with, and that our employees want to work for. Although 
we do not have specific policies relating to human rights, slavery or 
human trafficking, our procurement policies integrate sustainability into 
the way we do business throughout our supply chain, so that we create 
value, preserve natural resources and respect the interests of the 
communities we serve and from which we procure goods and services. 
Through our Global Supplier Code of Conduct (GSCoC), we expect our 
suppliers to keep to all laws relating to their business, as well as adhere 
to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the Ethical 
Trading Initiative Base Code, the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and for 
our UK suppliers, the requirements of the Living Wage Foundation.

On 8 December 2016, we agreed to sell a 61% equity interest in our UK 
Gas Distribution business to the Consortium pursuant to the terms of  
an acquisition agreement of that date. The sale of the 61% interest 
completed on 31 March 2017 . National Grid and the Consortium have 
also entered into an agreement for the potential future sale and purchase 
of an additional 14% equity interest in the UK Gas Distribution business.
In addition, each of our Executive Directors has a Service Agreement  
and each Non-executive Director has a Letter of Appointment. Apart 
from these, no contract (other than contracts entered into in the ordinary 
course of business) has been entered into by the Group within the two 
years immediately preceding the date of this report which is, or may be 
material; or which contains any provision under which any member of the 
Group has any obligation or entitlement which is material to the Group at 
the date of this report.
Political donations and expenditure
At this year’s AGM the Directors will again seek authority from 
shareholders, on a precautionary basis, for the Company and its 
subsidiaries to make donations to registered political parties and other 
political organisations and/or incur political expenditure in the European 
Union (EU), in each case in amounts not exceeding £125,000 in aggregate. 
The definitions of these terms in the Companies Act 2006 are very wide 
and as a result this can cover bodies such as those concerned with policy 
review, law reform and the representation of the business community.  
It could include special interest groups, such as those involved with the 
environment, which the Company and its subsidiaries might wish to 
support, even though these activities are not designed to support or 
influence support for a particular party. The Companies Act 2006 states 
that all-party parliamentary groups are not political organisations for these 
purposes, meaning the authority to be sought from shareholders is not 
relevant to interactions with such groups. The Company has no intention  
of changing its current practice of not making political donations or 
incurring political expenditure within the ordinary meaning of those words. 
This authority is therefore being sought to ensure that none of the 
Company’s activities inadvertently infringe these rules. 
National Grid made no donations in the EU during the year, including 
donations as defined for the purposes of the Political Parties, Elections 
and Referendums Act 2000. National Grid USA and its affiliated New 
York and federal political action committees (each, a PAC) made political 
donations in the US totalling $71,410 (£55,933) during the year. National 
Grid USA’s affiliated New York PAC was funded partly by contributions 
from National Grid USA and certain of its subsidiaries and partly by 
voluntary employee contributions. National Grid USA’s affiliated federal 
PAC was funded wholly by voluntary employee contributions.
Property, plant and equipment
This information can be found under the heading note 12 property, plant 
and equipment on pages 118 and 119, note 20 Borrowings on pages 127 
and 128 and where we operate on page 173.
Research and development
Investment in research and development during the year for the Group, 
including discontinued operations, was £27 million (2015/16: £29 million; 
2014/15: £23 million). Throughout 2016/17 , innovation funding has 
sustained investment across all three of our UK Regulated business 
areas: UK ET, UK GT and UK GD. We have continued to challenge  
the way we work, collaborating across the industry in search of new 
technologies and techniques in our drive to deliver benefits for our 
stakeholders. Due to the way in which we work with a large number  
of partners on new ideas, our disclosed research and development 
expenditure is lower than the overall contribution we make to the 
industry. We only disclose directly incurred expenditure, and not those 
amounts our partners contribute to joint or collaborative projects.
The UK ET innovation investment continues to aim to advance our 
strategic ambitions to reduce the cost of providing a secure, reliable  
and sustainable electricity transmission system. Progress has been 
made on the design of our new 400kV research centre at Deeside.
We have successfully installed and pressurised the new insulating  
gas (Green Gas for Grid g
3
), a potential replacement for SF6 for new 
transmission assets, on two gas insulated busbar sections at our 
substation in Sellindge. The equipment passed its High Voltage  
test on site and was energised in April 2017 .
Research has also progressed our understanding of and ability to predict 
and manage the impact of increased levels of distributed and renewable 
generation on the system. 
Our control room and forecasting team have already been able to use 
the initial output from our solar PV monitoring and forecasting work, to 
help with balancing the system at times of high levels of solar generation.
NGET’s Transmission & Distribution Interface 2.0 project is an £8 million 
Ofgem Network Innovation Competition award announced on 
Wednesday 30 November 2016. This is a new regional power market trial 
that will improve interaction between National Grid’s System Operator 
(SO), UK Power Networks’ role as regional electricity distributor and 
renewable energy generators connected to the distribution system.  
191 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Additional information The market will help renewable energy generators to offer their  
services to National Grid’s System Operator via a UK Power  
Networks’ Distribution System Operator (DSO) platform. This approach 
will also provide additional services to UK Power Networks. Improving 
communication, coordination and developing new commercial 
frameworks will maximise network capacity by better managing system 
constraints, giving National Grid’s System Operator access to previously 
unexploited power. It will also introduce new revenue streams for 
renewable energy generators. If successful, the regional power market 
model could be introduced to 59 other sites and potentially save up  
to £412 million for UK consumers by 2050.
We are also working in partnership with Scottish Power Electricity 
Networks on their £16 million Phoenix NIC project which aims to 
demonstrate how hybrid synchronous compensation could overcome 
technical limitations that currently limit the proportion of power generation 
from renewable sources and interconnectors that the Great Britain 
electricity system can handle. Our innovation portfolio has continued to 
develop throughout 2016/17 , with a continued focus on new techniques 
for safety and risk reduction through projects such as 3D laser scanning 
for more accurate pipeline condition assessment and removable 
composite transition pieces to access pipelines more easily. Other 
projects have explored new techniques for valve sealant lines and 
improved techniques for compressor emissions monitoring. 
Demonstration of the value delivered to our customers has been a key 
priority in 2016/17 and continues to be going forward into 2017/18.
Innovation in UK GD continued to focus on six value areas which reflect 
both the RIIO outputs. We continued to develop and refine pipe-lining 
technologies to reduce the impact of our pipe replacement activities on 
our customers and the environment. In addition, we have made a new 
tool available for our engineers to help find underground pipes more 
quickly. We also explored how virtual reality technology can improve  
the way we train engineers.
Research, Development & Demonstration (RD&D) work in the US has 
focused on the advancement of products, processes, systems and  
work methods that may be new to National Grid. This is accomplished  
by working with internal departments to identify where strategic RD&D 
investment is needed and is likely to prove beneficial to National Grid.  
To achieve these goals, we work in collaboration with technical 
organisations, academia and vendors in the energy sector that align with 
our goals and objectives. This collaboration has also helped inform our 
strategic direction in response to jurisdictional requests for modernisation 
(Grid Modernization in Massachusetts and ‘Reforming the Energy Vision’ 
in New York).
In the year, we invested and participated in several significant pilot 
projects with the intent of obtaining operational knowledge and 
experience of technology-driven system impacts. Below are a few 
examples of our RD&D projects:
• We are pre-approved to construct up to 20 MW of photovoltaic (PV) 
facilities in Massachusetts as part of our ‘Solar Phase II’ programme. 
These PV sites are designed with advanced grid interactive control 
features, beyond what typical PV facilities are required to provide. 
Operating and analysing the performance of these grid interactive 
controls will help prepare and futureproof our system to enable a high 
penetration of the Distributed Energy Resources on the distribution 
system. We are also pre-approved to construct up to 14 MW of 
photovoltaic (PV) facilities in conjunction with 7 MW of battery storage 
in Massachusetts as part of our ‘Solar Phase III’ programme. The 
intent of this project is to demonstrate the value of energy storage in 
the system peak load shaving, solar ramp rate control and mitigation 
of power quality issues.
• We are engaged with Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) on  
a number of programmes such as Distributed Energy Resources 
integration, energy storage and system planning. In February 2017 , 
National Grid received two EPRI Technology Transfer awards for the 
RD&D work on Smart Inverters and distributed energy resources 
hosting capacity. 
• We are progressing four New York REV pilot projects, which are  
1) Fruit Belt Neighbourhood Solar, 2) Community Resilience,  
3) Demand Reduction, and 4) Distribution System Platform to test 
new technologies and business models in which distributed energy 
resources are integrated for grid operations.
• We support several Department of Energy projects under the 
SunShot programme, aimed to further the integration and proliferation 
of solar PV. 
• Lessons learned from the two-year Worcester Smart Energy 
Solutions pilot in Massachusetts and the Volt VAR Optimization  
and Conservation Voltage Reduction pilot in Rhode Island have 
helped shape larger scale grid modernisation proposals in each  
of our jurisdictions.
• We demonstrated electric robot and UAS (unmanned aircraft 
systems) technologies in our service area, and are working to 
integrate these technologies into our operations.
• We are preparing to demonstrate online monitoring technology at 
transmission substations in our New England service area in order  
to move towards enhanced condition-based asset management.
• We are building equipment test and training labs in order to support 
our initial upgrades of transmission substations across our service 
area to the IEC 61850 communications standard.
US expenditure for gas research, development and deployment of new 
technologies is largely funded through a special Regulatory Order and 
customer surcharge mechanism in New York State. Primary investments 
were in the areas of enhancements to improve overall customer safety; 
methane detection equipment is being deployed and tested both as 
mobile solutions to identify leakage in the field and in residential buildings. 
After completing extensive bench testing, we are continuing a pilot study 
in the use of existing and new technology for methane sensors within 
residential properties and working with standards organisations to 
enhance safety through the development of revised standards and 
specifications for improved detection levels and proper placement and 
use of detectors. We are evaluating best practices in automatic shut-off 
valves, excess flow valves and developing an integrated system to 
provide storm hardening (flood condition detection) with a methane 
detector in low pressure areas. 
To further advance the safe operation of our systems, ongoing 
improvements for condition assessments of the most difficult to inspect 
pipelines are being enhanced through robotic inspection platforms with 
focus on crack detection sensors, Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer, 
and developing tools to assess smaller diameter unpiggable steel 
pipelines. In addition, new tools and techniques are being developed to 
increase safety of the workforce, safely stop off mains and services with 
less excavation, improve welding practices and advance the inspection 
of polyethylene pipe construction, joint quality and the tracking and 
traceability of materials used in the construction of our transmission  
and distribution assets and to move toward more electronically and 
geospatially based records of field operations and construction.

192 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Additional Information
Other disclosures continued Other unaudited financial information
Within the annual report a number of financial measures are presented. 
These measures have been categorised as either alternative 
performance measures (APMs), as per the European Securities and 
Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines, or as other financial information.
An alternative performance measure is a financial measure of historic  
or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other 
than a financial measure defined under IFRS. The Group uses a range  
of these metrics to provide a better understanding of the underlying 
performance of the Group. Where appropriate, reconciliations of 
alternative performance measures to IFRS measures and/or definitions 
are provided. 
The Group has defined the following financial measures as APMs: net 
revenue (reconciliations below), adjusted operating profit including and 
excluding timing (reconciliations below), adjusted earnings per share 
including and excluding timing (reconciliations below), net debt (included 
in note 27), capital investment (reconciliation below) and value added 
(reconciliation and definition on page 21). Adjusted profit and earnings 
metrics this year relate to both the continuing business and the Group  
as a whole i.e. including discontinued operations. 
Other financial information presented includes additional non-IFRS 
reconciliations and are identified as follows: funds from operations (FFO) 
(reconciliation below), FFO/interest cover (reconciliation below) and 
retained cash flow (RCF)/adjusted net debt (reconciliation below).
Other financial information also includes regulatory measures: Group,  
UK and US regulatory return on equity (RoE) (reconciliation below), 
regulatory asset based growth (reconciliation below), regulatory gearing 
(description on page 151) and annual asset growth (reconciliation below).
Alternative performance measures (APMs)
Net revenue
‘Net revenue’ is revenue less pass-through costs, such as payments  
to other UK network owners, system balancing costs, and gas and 
electricity commodity costs in the US. Pass-through costs are fully 
recoverable from our customers and are recovered through separate 
charges that are designed to recover those costs with no profit. Any 
over- or under-recovery of these costs is returned to, or recovered from, 
our customers.

Adjusted profit measures
In considering the financial performance of our businesses and 
segments, we analyse each of our primary financial measures of 
operating profit, profit before tax, profit for the year attributable to  
equity shareholders and EPS into two components.
The first of these components is referred to as an adjusted profit 
measure, also known as a business performance measure. This is the 
principal measure used by management to assess the performance of 
the underlying business.
Adjusted results exclude exceptional items and remeasurements. These 
items are reported collectively as the second component of the financial 
measures. Note 4 on page 101 explains in detail the items which are 
excluded from our adjusted profit measures.
Adjusted profit measures have limitations in their usefulness compared 
with the comparable total profit measures as they exclude important 
elements of our financial performance. However, we believe that by 
presenting our financial performance in two components it is easier to 
read and interpret financial performance between periods, as adjusted 
profit measures are more comparable having removed the distorting 
effect of the excluded items. Those items are more clearly understood  
if separately identified and analysed.
The presentation of these two components of financial performance  
is additional to, and not a substitute for, the comparable total profit 
measures presented.
Management uses adjusted profit measures as the basis for  
monitoring financial performance and in communicating financial 
performance to investors in external presentations and announcements 
of financial results.
Internal financial reports, budgets and forecasts are primarily prepared 
on the basis of adjusted profit measures, although planned exceptional 
items, such as significant restructurings, are also reflected in budgets 
and forecasts. We separately monitor and disclose the excluded items  
as a component of our overall financial performance.

The Group RoE calculation provides a measure of the performance  
of the whole Group compared with the amounts invested by the Group  
in assets attributable to equity shareholders.
Calculation: Regulatory financial performance including a long-run 
assumption of 3.0% RPI inflation, less adjusted interest and adjusted 
taxation divided by equity investment in assets. 
• Adjusted interest removes interest on pensions, capitalised interest 
and release of provisions. 
• Adjusted taxation adjusts the Group taxation charge for differences 
between IFRS profit before tax and regulated financial performance 
less adjusted interest. 
• Equity investment in assets is calculated as the total opening  
UK regulatory asset value, the total opening US rate base plus 
goodwill plus opening net book value of Other activities and our  
share of joint ventures and associates; minus opening net debt  
as reported under IFRS restated to the weighted average £/$ 
exchange rate for the year.

UK regulated return on equity (RoE)
UK RoEs are measures of how the businesses are performing 
operationally against the assumptions used by the regulator. These 
returns are calculated using the assumption that the businesses are 
financed in line with the regulatory adjudicated capital structure, at the 
cost of debt assumed by the regulator and that RPI inflation is equal  
to a long-run assumption of 3.0%. 
Calculation: Base allowed RoE plus or minus the following items:
• Additional allowed revenues/profits earned in the year from incentive 
schemes, less associated corporation tax charge; 
• Totex outperformance multiplied by the company sharing factor set 
by the regulator; and 
• Revenues (net of associated depreciation and base allowed asset 
return) allowed in the year associated with incentive performance 
earned under previous price controls but not yet fully recovered,  
less associated corporation tax charge (excluding logging up  
or pensions recovery).
Divided by average equity RAV in line with regulatory assumed  
capital structure.
US regulated return on equity (RoE)
US regulated RoE is a measure of how a business is performing 
operationally against the assumptions used by the regulator. This US 
operational return measure is calculated using the assumption that the 
businesses are financed in line with the regulatory adjudicated capital 
structure. This is a post-tax US GAAP metric calculated annually.
Calculation: Regulated net income divided by equity rate base. 
• Regulated net income calculated as US GAAP operating profit  
less interest on the adjudicated debt portion of the rate base 
(calculated at the actual rate on long term debt, adjusted  
where the proportion of long term debt in the capital structure  
is materially different from the assumed regulatory proportion)  
less tax at the adjudicated rate. 
• Regulated net income is adjusted for earned savings as appropriate 
and for certain material specified items. 
• Equity rate base is the average rate base for the relevant year as 
reported to the Group’s regulators (or where a reported rate base  
is not available, an estimate based on rate base calculations used  
in previous rate filings) multiplied by the adjudicated equity portion  
in the regulatory capital structure.

Additional information In compliance with SEC rules, we present a summarised analysis  
of movements in the income statement, an analysis of movements  
in adjusted operating profit (for the continuing group) by operating 
segment and a summarised analysis of movements in the statement  
of financial position for the year ended 31 March 2016. This should be 
read in conjunction with the 31 March 2017 unaudited commentary 
included on pages 85, 89, 97 and 98. 
Analysis of the income statement for the years ended  
31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015
Revenue 
Revenue for the year ended 31 March 2016 decreased by £145 million 
to £13,212 million. This decrease was driven by lower revenues in our US 
Regulated business, partly offset by revenue growth across all of our other 
businesses, in particular UK Electricity Transmission. US Regulated 
revenues were £493 million lower year on year due to lower commodity 
costs passed on to customers and unfavourable timing of recoveries. This 
was partly offset by higher increased revenue allowances under the Niagara 
Mohawk three year rate plan and the benefits of capex trackers and the 
stronger US dollar. UK Electricity Transmission revenue increased by £223 
million, mostly reflecting the recovery of higher pass-through costs such as 
payments to other UK network owners and system balancing costs. 
Revenue for the year ended 31 March 2015 increased by £416 million  
to £13,357 million. This increase was driven by higher revenues in our UK 
ET business, reflecting increases in allowed Transmission Owner revenues, 
and higher core allowances and pass-through costs in UK GT. Our US 
Regulated business revenues were lower, as a result of the end of the LIPA 
MSA in the prior year, partially offset by revenue increases from existing 
rate plans, including capex trackers, together with additional income from 
gas customer growth and the impact of the strengthening US dollar. 
Operating costs 
Operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2016 of £9,987 million were 
£419 million lower than the prior year. This decrease in costs included a 
£94 million impact in exceptional items and remeasurements, which is 
discussed below. Excluding exceptional items and remeasurements, 
operating costs were £325 million lower, principally due to lower pass-
through costs such as gas and electric commodity costs in the US and 
additional costs incurred the year before in the US to improve data quality 
and bring regulatory filings up to date, partially offset by higher depreciation 
as a result of newly commissioned assets and the impact of the stronger 
US dollar on sterling results.
Operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2015 of £10,406 million were 
£358 million higher than the prior year. This increase in costs included a 
£199 million year on year impact of changes in exceptional items and 
remeasurements, which is discussed below. Excluding exceptional items 
and remeasurements, operating costs were £159 million higher, principally 
due to: increases in controllable costs, including the impact of inflation  
and additional costs incurred in the US to improve data quality and bring 
regulatory filings up to date; higher US bad debt costs following the 
previous year’s exceptionally cold winter; and higher depreciation and 
amortisation as a result of continued investment programmes. These  
cost increases were partly offset by a reduction in spend on US financial 
systems implementation and stabilisation upgrades, with the project 
completing in the first half of the year. 
Exceptional operating items and remeasurements
Operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2016 included an £1 1 million 
gain on remeasurement of commodity contracts. 
Operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2015 included an  
£83 million loss (2013/14: £16 million gain) on remeasurement of 
commodity contracts. The year ended 31 March 2014 also included a  
net £100 million gain on exceptional items, including a net gain on the  
LIPA MSA transition in the US of £254 million and restructuring costs of 
£91 million, primarily in the UK as we reorganised certain parts of our 
business to deliver under the new RIIO price controls, and a £79 million 
provision for the demolition of UK gas holders that were no longer required. 
Net finance costs 
For the year ended 31 March 2016, net finance costs before exceptional 
items and remeasurements were £16 million lower than 2014/15 at  
£856 million, mainly as a result of lower UK RPI inflation, continued focus 
on management of cash balances and the benefit of the prior year’s  
debt repurchases, partially offset by increased borrowings and the 
impact of the stronger US dollar.
For the year ended 31 March 2015, net finance costs before exceptional 
items and remeasurements were £66 million lower than 2013/14 at  
£872 million, mainly as a result of lower average gross debt through  
the year, lower RPI in the UK and refinancing debt at lower rates. 
Exceptional finance costs for the year ended 31 March 2016 included  
a loss of £99 million on financial remeasurements, relating to net losses 
on derivative financial instruments. The year ended 31 March 2015 
included exceptional debt redemption costs of £131 million and a loss  
of £34 million on financial remeasurements relating to net losses on 
derivative financial instruments. The year ended 31 March 2014 included 
a gain of £93 million on financial remeasurements. 
Tax 
The tax charge on profits before exceptional items and remeasurements 
for the year ended 31 March 2016 was £61 million higher than 2014/15. 
This was mainly a result of increased taxable profits in the year. The 
effective tax rate for the year was 25.0% (2014/15: 24.6%).
The tax charge on profit before exceptional items and remeasurements 
for the year ended 31 March 2015 was £126 million higher than 2013/14. 
This was mainly due to higher profits before tax and the non recurrence 
of one-off items that benefited the prior year. 
Exceptional tax for 2015/16 was a credit of £177 million which represents 
tax credits on the exceptional items and remeasurements above, 
together with a deferred tax credit on the recalculation of deferred tax 
liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate from 20% to 18%.
Exceptional tax for 2014/15 of £76 million primarily represents tax credits  
on the exceptional items and remeasurements described above. 
Adjusted earnings and EPS 
As a result of the variances described above, adjusted earnings for  
the year ended 31 March 2016 were £1,812 million. For the year ended  
31 March 2015, adjusted earnings were £1,675 million. 
The above earnings performance translated into adjusted EPS growth  
in 2015/16 of 4.1 pence (9%) and 5.5 pence (14%) in 2014/15. 
In accordance with IAS 33, all EPS and adjusted EPS amounts for 
comparative periods have been restated for shares issued via scrip 
dividends and the bonus element of the 2010 rights issue.
Analysis of the adjusted operating profit by segment for the 
year ended 31 March 2016 
UK Electricity Transmission 
For the year ended 31 March 2016, revenue in the UK Electricity 
Transmission segment increased by £223 million to £3,977 million,  
and adjusted operating profit decreased by £64 million to £1, 173 million.  
The revenue growth of £223 million was principally due to the recovery of 
higher pass-through costs such as payments to other UK network owners 
and system balancing costs, and under-recoveries of allowed revenues in 
the prior year. This was partly offset by reductions in allowed revenues in 
2015/16 and a legal settlement received in 2014/15 that did not repeat in 
2015/16. Net revenue (after deducting pass-through costs) was £14 million 
higher. Regulated controllable costs were £28 million higher due to inflation 
and salary growth, together with legal cost recoveries in the prior year, 
higher tower maintenance costs and transformation costs associated with 
our System Operator role. Depreciation and amortisation was £14 million 
higher reflecting the continued capital investment programme. Other costs 
were £36 million higher than prior year due to additional asset impairments 
this year and lower scrap and disposal proceeds.
UK Gas Transmission 
Revenue in the UK Gas Transmission segment increased by £25 million 
in 2015/16 to £1,047 million and adjusted operating profit increased by 
£49 million to £486 million. Revenue was £25 million higher, principally 
due to over-recoveries of allowed revenues in the year. Regulated 
controllable costs were £10 million higher than the previous year,  
mainly as a result of inflation, higher gas system service charges  
and organisational change costs. Depreciation costs were £6 million  
higher due to ongoing investment. Other operating costs were  
£19 million lower than the previous year, mostly reflecting additional  
costs in 2014/15 relating to the closure of LNG facilities.
US Regulated 
Revenue in our US Regulated businesses was £493 million lower at  
£7 ,493 million, while adjusted operating profit increased by £21 million to 
198 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Additional Information
Commentary on consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2016 Commentary on consolidated 
financial statements
£1, 185 million. The stronger US dollar increased operating profit in the year by 
£81 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, 
revenue decreased by £1,051 million, principally as a result of lower 
commodity costs passed on to customers and unfavourable timing of 
recoveries year over year, partly offset by higher revenue allowances under 
the Niagara Mohawk three year rate plan and the benefit of capex trackers. 
The reduction in revenue was mostly offset by a £1,027 million reduction in 
pass-through costs incurred (excluding the impact of foreign exchange). 
Regulated controllable costs reduced by £71 million at constant currency, 
partly as a result of lower gas leak and compliance work this year and 
additional costs incurred last year to improve data quality and bring regulatory 
filings up to date. Depreciation and amortisation costs were £51 million higher 
this year at constant currency as a result of ongoing investment in our 
networks. Pension costs were £15 million higher at constant currency due to 
changes in actuarial discount rates, while other operating costs were £41 
million higher at constant currency including higher asset removal costs.
Other activities 
Revenue in Other activities increased by £110 million to £824 million  
in the year ended 31 March 2016. Adjusted operating profit was  
£174 million higher at £370 million. In the US, adjusted operating profit 
was £143 million higher, reflecting lower spend on upgrades to our 
finance systems which completed last year. In addition, we benefited 
from a £49 million gain on disposal of our investment in the Iroquois 
pipeline, and the deconsolidation of our investment in Clean Line. In the 
UK, adjusted operating profit was £31 million higher as a result of strong 
auction revenues at the French interconnector and higher property sales.
Analysis of the statement of financial position  
for the year ended 31 March 2016
The consolidated statement of financial position shows all of 
the Group’s assets and liabilities at the year end. As a capital-
intensive business, we have significant amounts of physical assets 
and corresponding borrowings.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and intangibles increased by £255 million to £6,202 million  
as at 31 March 2016. This increase primarily relates to foreign exchange 
movements of £184 million and software additions of £220 million, 
partially offset by software amortisation of £147 million.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment increased by £2,641 million to £43,364 million 
as at 31 March 2016. This was principally due to capital expenditure of £3,673 
million on the renewal and extension of our regulated networks and foreign 
exchange movements of £543 million, offset by depreciation of £1,467 million 
in the year. See page 22 for further details of our capital expenditure.
Investments and other non-current assets
Investments in joint ventures and associates, financial and other 
investments and other non-current assets have increased by £233 million  
to £961 million. This is primarily due to an increase in investments in joint 
ventures of £79 million, together with an increase in available-for-sale 
investments of £152 million.
Inventories and current intangible assets, and trade and 
other receivables
Inventories and current intangible assets, and trade and other receivables 
have decreased by £284 million to £2,832 million as at 31 March 2016.  
This is due to an increase in inventories and current intangible assets  
of £97 million, more than offset by a net decrease in trade and other 
receivables of £381 million. The £381 million decrease consists of a foreign 
exchange impact of £57 million due to the stronger US dollar against sterling 
offset by a decrease in the underlying balances of £421 million, reflecting 
collection of high 2015 winter billings, coupled with the impact of the recent 
mild winter.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables have decreased by £7 million to £3,285 million, 
primarily due to a foreign exchange impact of £48 million more than offset 
by movements in the US related to warmer weather and energy billing 
settlements.
Current tax balances
Net current tax balances have increased by £51 million to £175 million  
as at 31 March 2016, which includes a £77 million current tax asset  
(£60 million current tax asset in 2014/15 included in trade and other 
receivables). This is primarily due to the tax payments made in 2015/16 
being only partially offset by a smaller current year tax charge.
Deferred tax balances
Deferred tax balances have increased by £337 million to £4,634 million 
as at 31 March 2016. This was primarily due to the impact of the £125 
million deferred tax charge on actuarial gains in reserves (£299 million tax 
credit in 2014/15) and foreign exchange movements being offset by the 
impact of the reduction in the UK statutory tax rate.
Provisions and other non-current liabilities
Provisions (both current and non-current) and other non-current liabilities 
increased by £136 million to £3,790 million as at 31 March 2016.
Total provisions decreased by £16 million in the year. The underlying 
movements include additions of £63 million, primarily relating to an 
increase to the provision for the estimated environmental restoration and 
remediation costs for a number of sites and other provision increases  
of £33 million, together with foreign exchange movements of £42 million, 
offset by utilisation of £200 million in relation to all classes of provisions.
Net debt
Net debt is the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents, current financial 
and other investments, borrowings, and derivative financial assets and 
liabilities. See further analysis with the consolidated cash flow statement 
on page 90.

Plan liabilities (19,416) (9,603) (29,019)
(15) (2,570) (2,585)
The principal movements in net obligations during the year include net 
actuarial gains of £539 million and employer contributions of £587 million. 
Net actuarial gains include actuarial gains on plan liabilities of £877 million 
arising as a consequence of decreases in the nominal discount rate in the 
US and experience gains reflecting liability experience throughout the year 
including the impact of pension increases being lower than assumed and 
some updates to the way a section of plan liabilities is estimated. This is 
partially offset by actuarial losses of £338 million arising on plan assets 
resulting from actual asset returns being less than assumed returns which 
is based upon the discount rate at the start of the year.
Further information on our pension and other post-retirement obligations 
can be found in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
Off balance sheet items
There were no significant off balance sheet items other than the contractual 
obligations shown in note 30(b) to the consolidated financial statements, 
and the commitments and contingencies discussed in note 28.
Through the ordinary course of our operations, we are party to various 
litigation, claims and investigations. We do not expect the ultimate 
resolution of any of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect 
on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not 
guarantees of our future performance and are subject to assumptions, 
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual future results to differ 
materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking 
statements. Many of these assumptions, risks and uncertainties relate  
to factors that are beyond our ability to control or estimate precisely,  
such as changes in laws or regulations, including any arising as a result 
of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union; announcements 
from and decisions by governmental bodies or regulators, including 
proposals relating to the role of the electricity system operator; the timing 
of construction and delivery by third parties of new generation projects 
requiring connection; breaches of, or changes in, environmental, climate 
change and health and safety laws or regulations, including breaches or 
other incidents arising from the potentially harmful nature of our activities; 
network failure or interruption, the inability to carry out critical non 
network operations and damage to infrastructure, due to adverse 
weather conditions including the impact of major storms as well as the 
results of climate change, due to counterparties being unable to deliver 
physical commodities, or due to the failure of or unauthorised access to 
or deliberate breaches of our IT systems and supporting technology; 
performance against regulatory targets and standards and against our 
peers with the aim of delivering stakeholder expectations regarding  
costs and efficiency savings, including those related to investment 
programmes and internal transformation and remediation plans; and 
customers and counterparties (including financial institutions) failing to 
perform their obligations to the Company. Other factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from those described in this document
include fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity 
price indices; restrictions and conditions (including filing requirements)  
in our borrowing and debt arrangements, funding costs and access to 
financing; regulatory requirements for us to maintain financial resources 
in certain parts of our business and restrictions on some subsidiaries’ 
transactions such as paying dividends, lending or levying charges; the 
delayed timing of recoveries and payments in our regulated businesses 
and whether aspects of our activities are contestable; the funding 
requirements and performance of our pension schemes and other 
post-retirement benefit schemes; the failure to attract, develop and retain 
employees with the necessary competencies, including leadership and 
business capabilities, and any significant disputes arising with our 
employees or the breach of laws or regulations by our employees; the 
failure to respond to market developments, including competition for 
onshore transmission, the threats and opportunities presented by 
emerging technology, development activities relating to changes to the 
energy mix and the integration of distributed energy resources and the 
need to grow our business to deliver our strategy, as well as incorrect or 
unforeseen assumptions or conclusions (including unanticipated costs 
and liabilities) relating to business development activity, including 
assumptions in connection with the Company’s sale of a majority interest 
in its UK Gas Distribution business and joint ventures. 
For further details regarding these and other assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties that may affect National Grid, please read the Strategic 
Report and the Risk factors on pages 180 to 183 of this document. In 
addition, new factors emerge from time to time and we cannot assess 
the potential impact of any such factor on our activities or the extent to 
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual future
