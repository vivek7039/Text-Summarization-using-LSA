1 As previously guided, this year we are reporting on the 53 weeks to 4 March 
2017, with an extra week added to ensure that the year-end date stays close 
to the end of February. In order to provide a meaningful comparison with last 
year’s 52 week period, all P&L financial movements are reported on a 52 week 
basis, excluding the 53rd week, unless otherwise stated. Where applicable, 
the 53rd week’s known result has been used as the basis for the adjustment to 
provide the 52 week results, although a degree of judgement has been applied 
in deriving certain operating costs in respect of the final week. A detailed 
comparison of the 53 weeks and 52 weeks results are set out on page 44. All 
second half P&L financial movements relate to the 26 week period, excluding 
the 27th week, unless otherwise stated. All balance sheet figures are reported 
as at the year-end date and cash flow figures are for the 53 week period.

JD Williams ‘The Cut’ collection  
– a great success
In Autumn Winter we introduced  
‘The Cut’, a collection of our best 
value, current season clothes, to further 
reinforce our value for money credentials. 
Sales of these lines significantly 
exceeded expectations, up 72% versus 
comparable lines in the previous year. 
We extended the collection further for 
Spring Summer, and adopted a similarly 
assertive entry price strategy across our 
other brands.

Merchandising tools now live
A key release from our systems

tools which went live in October, ahead

reducing markdown.
Our best ever cyber fortnight
Building on a successful cyber fortnight 
last year, this year saw us beat records

strengthening brand 
engagement with 
existing customers.
Expanding our product ranges
We have significantly grown the number 
of third party brands we stock on our 
websites, typically stocking their ranges 
exclusively in larger sizes. This allows 
brands access to a new, growing 
customer base at relatively low risk, and 
gives our customers an even greater 
choice of products. Since the start of 
the year we have added over 100 third 
party brands across our categories.
Selling our ranges through  
other retailers
We are also partnering with other 
retailers, selling capsule collections of 
our ranges through their sites or stores. 
This allows us to further improve 
our brand awareness and gain new 
customers. To date we’re selling 
ranges through ASOS and Tesco, 
with more retailers in the pipeline. 
Championing body diversity 
in the fashion industry
We are a truly size and age agnostic 
fashion retailer; whatever a customer’s 
size or age, we aim to make them 
feel amazing in what they wear. 
This attitude differs significantly to 
the fashion industry as a whole. We’ve 
held a number of protests and other 
events to call for greater body and 
age diversity in the industry.

More flexible ways to pay
Ahead of our new Financial Services

we trialled a lower APR for qualifying 
new customers. The initial results of 
this trial are encouraging.

Further delivery improvements
We extended our cut-off for next day 
delivery by an hour to 10pm. We also 
launched Jacamo Unlimited, offering 
customers 12 months unlimited next 
day delivery for a one-off £9.95. Initial 
response to this delivery subscription 
offer has been encouraging, and we 
aim to expand it to other brands in 
due course. 
Marketing flexibility 
We are working hard to ensure our 
marketing spend is as flexible and 
efficient as possible, so that we can 
maximise revenue wherever possible. 
We can now change email campaign

Our three Power Brands are our growth 
engines; here we aim to gain new

Secondary Brands are also in growing 
markets, however they are more niche

Segment is in a slowly declining market; 
our objective here is to grow market share 
and hold this segment broadly flat over 
the medium term.

across all brands, with the younger brands 
typically having a higher penetration of 
sales sold through credit.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“The transformative 
changes we have 
made over the past 
few years have 
started to deliver 
results, as we benefit 
from our new-found 
trading agility.”
Andrew Higginson
Chairman
This year saw the first benefits come 
through from the material changes to 
people, processes and systems we have 
made to the business. After a challenging 
first half, the Board is pleased with the 
trading momentum seen in the second 
half, with the Group outperforming 
the wider market over the key peak 
trading period. 
I continue to be impressed by the sheer 
quantum of change that has occurred 
in the business over the past few years. 
Whilst the process of transformation 
has not been without its challenges, 
the business is now in a much stronger 
position, with a far more sustainable 
model for the future.
In September we gained our full FCA 
authorisation. This was an important 
milestone for the Group and marked 
the successful end to a lengthy and 
thorough process. 
This coming year will be another 
important one for the Group. We remain 
on track to complete the final stages of 
our systems programme by Summer 2018 
although, as has been the case throughout 
the programme, our first priority is risk 
minimisation, not speed of delivery at 
any cost.

We continue to innovate and improve our

Dividend 
Whilst continuing to invest in the business 
to secure our future growth, we also 
continue to recognise the importance 
of cash returns to our shareholders. 
We intend to pay a final dividend of 8.56p 
this year, taking the total dividend to 
14.23p – unchanged from last year.
Board composition 
In October I was pleased to welcome 
Richard Moross to the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. Richard is the 
founder and CEO of Moo.com and brings 
significant expertise in digital retailing 
and technology. 
Following her appointment to the board of 
Newell Brands Inc in the USA, Fiona Laird 
has indicated her intention to step down 
from the Board as soon as a suitable 
replacement has been found. External 
consultants have been engaged and an 
announcement will be made in due course.
After 23 years’ service, Ivan Fallon has 
indicated his intention to retire and he will 
therefore not be seeking re-election to the 
Board at this year’s AGM. The Board and I 
would like to thank Ivan for his outstanding 
contribution over many years and to wish 
him well for the future.
Outlook 
The past year has seen unprecedented 
changes in the macro-economic landscape 
which remains challenging for retail. This 
manifests itself in our cost prices through 
inflation, particularly in fuel, our product 
costs as a result of exchange rate changes, 
and the disposable income of our 
customers. Against this backdrop we 
remain vigilant over our core costs and 
efficiencies.

Ladieswear revenue up 4.2% over the

Gained our full FCA authorisation in 
September 2016. The authorisation 
was granted unconditionally.
Corporate Governance
The Board is committed to developing and applying high standards of corporate 
governance both in the management of its business and in its accountability to 
stakeholders as a whole.
Consumers globally continue to move 
their spending online, and our online 
capabilities and lack of a large store 
estate mean that we are at an advantage 
here. We must not become complacent, 
however, but instead we must continually 
innovate and improve our capabilities 
and customer offering. 
I would like to express my thanks to 
all stakeholders in the business, and in 
particular our brilliant colleagues, for 
all their passion, commitment and hard 
work throughout the year.

Strategic report MARKET REVIEW
Maintaining the pace 
in a challenging market
Global trends
With an uncertain global economic 
backdrop, the retail market not only 
faces the same uncertainties but also 
the knock-on effect of rising input costs 
and fragile consumer confidence. 
Coupled with an increasingly competitive 
retail market, the ability to act with agility 
and continue to innovate will be key to 
our success.
UK demographic 
The UK has an ageing population, with 
ONS figures showing a significant rise of 
the 65+ population, by 21%, over the past 
ten years. With people also becoming 
larger, as evidenced by rising obesity 
levels, our size and age inclusive approach 
are important differentiators which benefit 
from these population trends. 
Financial services – consumer credit
We see UK consumers continuing to 
participate in higher levels of unsecured 
credit, a supportive backdrop given our 
many years of experience in this sector. 
We continue to monitor consumers’ 
demand for payment innovations and 
ensure that we incorporate FinTech 
developments when suitable.
Macro- 
economic 
trends
The global economic 
backdrop is uncertain, with 
recent volatility, particularly 
in the percentage drop 
in sterling following the 
EU referendum.
Retail 
trends
Consumers are 
increasingly shifting spend 
away from retail purchases 
and towards leisure 
activities. 
Online 
trends
Shopping globally is 
increasingly online; the 
BRC estimates that over 
20% of all non-food retail 
spending now takes  
place online.

ROW
Trends
The uncertainty following the referendum 
has led to consumer confidence at lower 
levels than in the past few years. We 
expect shoppers to continue to remain 
cautious this year. 
The depreciation of sterling since the EU 
referendum means that FX rates represent 
a significant input cost headwind. Inflation 
is also expected to increase this year, 
putting further pressure on our costs. 
How we are responding
 – We hedge our dollar purchases 
exposure, allowing us to delay the 
impact of a weaker sterling rate, 
and giving us more certainty over 
input costs.
 – We aim to mitigate input costs and 
inflation as much as possible, working 
closely with our suppliers and moving 
supply nearer to the UK in some cases.
Opportunities for growth
We are planning to absorb or mitigate 
input cost increases, as opposed to 
passing these on to our customers, 
as we believe that this stance will allow 
us to gain further market share and 
underpin future sustainable profitable 
growth. Our international business 
provides a small natural hedge which 
we aim to grow in the future. 
Trends
Over the last 12 months there has been a 
shift in spending patterns away from the 
clothing and footwear sector and into the 
hospitality and entertainment sectors. 
Against this backdrop we work hard to 
grow loyalty and offer our customers a 
great choice of products. Within the retail 
sector itself, health and beauty tops the 
sector as the fastest growing according 
to the BRC. 
How we are responding
 – Widening share of basket by continually 
improving both our homewares and 
our health and beauty offering.
 – Continuing to invest in great value 
products.
 – Continuing to invest in our financial 
services offering, to allow customers  
to spread the cost of their purchases 
over time.
Opportunities for growth
Our customer loyalty rates continue 
to be strong, and we work hard to 
ensure our customers have a great 
shopping experience with us. Our new 
Financial Services system will allow 
us to offer customers a greater range 
of products, which should help us to 
increase share of spending and 
generate incremental income. 
Trends
Online penetration is predicted to grow 
from 15.7% in 2017 to 18.4% in 2022, with 
the clothing and footwear sector set to 
grow from 25.6% of online retail share in 
2017 to 29.4% in 2022 according to the 
latest figures from GlobalData. We are in a 
strong position to benefit from this trend 
given our online exposure and our lack of 
a significant store estate. 
How we are responding
 – Continuing to innovate and win 
share online.
 – Our new web platform will further 
improve our online trading agility.
 – Continuous improvements to customer 
experience, for example through 
personalisation and app development.
Opportunities for growth
As an online retailer, we will continue to 
make improvements to win more share 
online and to further improve the 
customer experience.

Introduction
I am pleased with the progress made 
this year, as we continue to build on our 
position as an agile, online fashion retailer. 
Ladieswear was a particular highlight, 
delivering the best performance for 
almost a decade as we gained significant 
market share. This was the result of 
changes made to design, buying, 
merchandising and sourcing over the 
past few years. 
We continue to place customers at the 
heart of everything we do. During the 
year we further improved our delivery 
proposition, maintained our assertive 
price positioning and continued focus on 
customer loyalty. I am pleased to report 
that our work paid off, with our customer 
satisfaction score increasing further to 
86.4%, the second highest customer 
satisfaction score in the UK retail sector. 
We have a clear focus on our three fashion 
Power Brands – JD Williams, Simply Be 
and Jacamo – and revenue here increased

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
18
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 successfully turned around the 
performance of our Traditional segment 
during the year, with revenue down in 
the first half but growing in the second.
Our online metrics remain strong, with 
new customers coming to us online 
exceeding 75% for the first time. 
71% of our traffic now comes from a 
mobile device. Within this, smartphone 
sessions – the device of choice for UK 
consumers today – increased by 49% 
to account for 46% of all traffic. 
Our performance in FY17 overall was in line 
with expectations. Spring Summer 2016 
started poorly across the sector, but we 
improved performance as we progressed 
through the first half. The second half was 
stronger, with a good Autumn Winter 
season and two record-breaking weeks 
for the business over Cyber fortnight. This 
trend is visible in our profit performance, 
with Adjusted PBT down 19 .8% in the first 
half and flat in the second.
Our size and age agnostic attitude, our 
dedication to continuous improvement 
in the customer experience and our 
relentless focus on helping our customers 
look and feel amazing through our trusted 
family of fashion brands all put us in a 
strong position. We look to the future 
with confidence.

We are pleased with the progress we 
have made on our systems programme. 
To date, we have successfully introduced 
a new finance system, our new 
Merchandise system, Cybersource and 
PowerCurve, both important parts of 
our Credit release, our Simply Be Euro 
foundation site and, most recently, 
our new USA website. 
The next release, which represents a 
major milestone in the programme, will 
be the High & Mighty website, which 
remains on track to replatform to Hybris 
in May. This release will also include the 
first go-live of our new Financial Services 
system. This sees a significant amount of 
core technical functionality delivered.
In line with the agile approach to running 
IT projects, we have then made an 
adaptation to the rollout plan compared 
to that previously communicated. 
Following the High & Mighty go-live we 
have now decided that Fashion World 
will be migrated onto the new systems 
after peak trading 2017 . Crucially, the 
pace of our development will be 
unchanged, and new releases will be 
added to the High & Mighty and USA 
sites on a monthly basis. 
The benefits of this approach are that:
• It significantly reduces the commercial 
risks, as new technology developments 
going forward will all be tested in a live 
environment, including through peak 
trading, before the major brands 
are migrated
• It minimises the time we will be 
operating at scale in two different 
technology worlds
We plan to migrate all brands onto the 
new platform by the end of Summer 
2018, as previously guided. The overall 
programme costs and benefits, and 
the timing of those benefits, are 
all unchanged. 
Future opportunities
International
We launched our new USA site in 
September. Through a series of 
post-launch releases we have now 
delivered the enhanced experience 
scoped for our customers, which gives 
us the foundations for our future 
international expansion. We recently 
announced the appointment of our 
first International Director, who will 
help us make the most of our significant 
growth opportunity, both in the 
USA and in other geographies.
Brand partnerships
We are increasingly partnering with 
other retailers in two ways. Firstly, we 
added over 100 new third party brands 
on our sites during the year, further 
broadening our customer offering. 
We have also started to sell capsule 
collections on other retailers’ sites. 
These offer a complementary way 
of driving sales and awareness of 
our brands in a cost-effective manner. 
We will continue to look at other 
opportunities like this going forward.
Fit 4 the Future on track

Outlook
The fashion sector remains as competitive 
as ever. Added to this, the depreciation of 
sterling and the recent increase in inflation 
both represent significant input cost 
headwinds to our business. Against this 
backdrop, our significantly increased 
trading agility and in-season flexibility puts 
us in a much better position to be able to 
quickly react to changing market 
conditions, ensuring our product offer 
remains competitive.

Great product is the lifeblood of our business – it is the absolute core 
of what we do.
Progress 2016
We strive to continuously improve our product offering, both in terms 
of our retail and Financial Services products. We are particularly 
pleased with our Ladieswear performance, the best for almost a 
decade. This result was made possible by the changes we have made 
to buying, merchandising, sourcing and design over the past few years. 
Priorities 2017
Menswear delivered a solid performance, however we see scope for 
further growth in this category. In Financial Services, we will continue 
our trial of lower interest rates for new customers, ahead of the new

Better by design
We have fundamentally changed  
our design, buying, sourcing and 
merchandising processes over the 
past three years and we are pleased to 
report that these changes are delivering  
results. Having previously relied solely 
on third party design agencies, we now 
have a 22-person in-house team, 
covering all product categories to 
ensure that our ranges are on-trend 
and flatter our customers, whatever 
their size or age. We have also 
introduced an in-house print team that 
creates signature prints for each season.
We have rationalised and consolidated  
our supply base, working closer with 
fewer suppliers. We have also increased  
sourcing closer to home to give us 
greater flexibility. These changes in our 
supply chain, together with process 
changes throughout the department, 
have enabled us to reduce lead times 
significantly. Our fastest lead time for a 
new product has improved from ten 
weeks two years ago to three weeks 
today. For repeat purchases, our fastest 
lead time is now seven days compared 
to seven weeks just two years ago. 
We have also reduced our average 
lead times by over 20% year on year.
We are now working on rolling out 
innovative digital fit techniques using  
3D avatars. This will allow us to design, 
develop and fit our product samples on 
each individual size, tailoring the fit to 
take account of body shapes and sizes. 
These cutting-edge techniques will 
represent a further improvement to our 
already industry leading fit capabilities, 
as well as enabling us to deliver our 
products faster than ever before, both 
important drivers of customer loyalty.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Price
Assertive 
price points 
and great 
promotions
We typically benchmark our prices to the 
mid-market, aiming to offer a better quality 
product at a lower price than our mid-market 
competitors. In Autumn Winter we adopted  
a more assertive price strategy, further investing 
in prices to offer customers exceptional value. 
This was led by ‘The Cut’ collection in 
JD Williams, a collection of our best priced, 
current season clothes. Sales of these lines 
significantly exceeded our already ambitious 
expectations, with the range up 72% compared 
to similar lines in the prior period. A similar 
pricing strategy was adopted across our entire 
brand portfolio. 
By ensuring that our initial price points were 
compelling, we reduced the proportion of lines 
sold on discount significantly. When we did 
offer promotions they represented exceptional 
value to our customers, with our cyber fortnight 
promotions and flash sales good examples 
of these. 
We continued to increase our use of data 
analytics to make pricing and promotional 
decisions, for example we have implemented 
price elasticity algorithmic modelling for our 
end of season sales and will be rolling this  
out further in the coming year. Our new 
merchandising system went live in the Autumn, 
giving us the ability to plan our ranges across our 
brand portfolio in a quick and consistent way.

Digital talent
We continue to invest heavily in digital 
talent across the organisation, both in 
terms of attracting the best talent and 
developing our people. Working at 
N Brown is fast paced and exciting, 
with no day the same as another. 
As well as capabilities, we hire for 
attitude and passion. 
Our digital centre of excellence 
continues to ensure that we stay ahead 
of the competition, covering areas such 
as personalisation, conversion rate 
optimisation, page load speeds and 
data analytics. Digital talent doesn’t just 
cover marketing and IT, we also continue 
to innovate in areas such as quality 
control, product fit and specification 
and our HR processes and colleague 
engagement platforms. 
During the year we partnered with seven 
digital start-ups through our innovation 
incubator JD Works. Over a ten week 
period these start-ups worked alongside 
us in our offices, helping us to accelerate 
our adoption of new ideas and 
technologies. These technologies 
included artificial intelligence, big data 
analytics, digitalised personal shopping 
and 3D virtual fitting.

A record breaking  
cyber fortnight
We had our best ever cyber fortnight, 
with record breaking revenue and profits. 
This was made possible by our recent 
warehouse extension, which doubled our 
through-put capacity – that is, our ability  
to get products through the warehouse 
and out for delivery to customers. 
Our websites dealt with the highest level 
of traffic we’ve ever experienced, with 
sessions up 20% against the prior year, 
itself a record. Smartphone sessions were 
up 49% and accounted for 46% of traffic 
during the period. We sent 19 million 
animated emails, 22% more than the year 
before, and these drove a 48% increase in

Performance
Our provision rate improved

This was a result of two factors. 
Firstly, we benefitted from the sale 
of a small quantum of high risk 
payment arrangement debt, which 
we were able to sell for a slightly 
better rate than book value; given 
the risk profile of this debt the sale 
had a disproportionate impact on 
the provision rate. Secondly, the 
change reflects the continued 
improvement in the quality of 
the debt book. 
Outlook
New customer recruitment 
typically results in an increase in 
the provisions rate. Offsetting 
this, we expect the loan book

RISK MANAGEMENT
Protecting the integrity of 
our business strategy
Risk management
The directors have overall responsibility 
for ensuring that the Group maintains a 
sound system of internal control. There 
are inherent limitations in any system of 
internal control and no system can provide 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement, loss or failure. Equally 
no system can guarantee elimination of 
the risk of failure to meet the objectives 
of the business. Against this background, 
the Board has established a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks the Group 
faces in order to give it reasonable 
assurances regarding its operations and 
compliance with laws and regulations.
In order to ensure key business 
developments and emerging risks are 
appropriately factored into the risk 
management process, the Group’s internal 
auditors facilitated two board level risk 
sessions in the year. The Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer and head of 
internal audit, along with the operational 
directors identified, ranked and reviewed 
the key risks facing the business and 
appraised the structure of internal controls 
and identified current and proposed

activities to mitigate these risks. 
The committee was provided with and 
discussed the outputs from this process 
which were used by internal audit as a key 
driver in developing the annual internal 
audit plan.
An enterprise wide mapping of activities 
across business functions was also 
undertaken by internal audit during the 
year to assess the level of risk within each 
activity. Output from this process has also 
been reflected in the annual audit plan.
Internal audit maintain the Group’s Three 
Lines of Defence model which documents 
the internal and external sources of 
assurance provided across the business. 
The adequacy of coverage over corporate 
risks at operational, oversight and 
assurance lines of defence is reviewed 
bi-annually and the output from this 
process is reported to the Audit 
Committee and used to drive the content 
of the annual internal audit plan.
Appropriate responsibilities and 
accountabilities have been set to ensure 
that there is ownership of the actions 
required to mitigate risk across 
the business.
The Group compliance function monitors 
policy and regulatory requirements and 
plays a key role in the mitigation of key 
risks across the business. The function 
continues to develop and is well 
established in providing assurance over 
areas of significant regulatory risk such 
as Financial Services and Data Protection. 
Risk committee
Operational management is asked to 
present on a cyclical basis on the progress 
of agreed actions against the major risks 
identified by the process. The output is 
shared with the Audit Committee and 
the full Board.

OPERATIONS
The Board believes that appropriate 
internal financial, operational and 
compliance controls are in place 
throughout the Group, the most significant 
of which have been specifically referred to 
in this report. The Group has a well-defined 
organisational structure, with clear lines of 
responsibility and explicit authority 
delegated to divisional boards and 
executive management. The Group also 
has a comprehensive financial reporting 
system with good communication of plans, 
budgets and monthly results to relevant 
levels of management and the Board.
The Group has complied, and continues to 
comply, with the provisions of the Code on 
internal controls. There is an on-going 
process in place for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks facing 
the Group that has been in place 
throughout the year and to the date of this 
report. The process has been reviewed by 
the Committee and the Board and accords 
with guidance appended to the Code.
The principal risks which the Group 
has identified, together with actions to 
mitigate those risks are set out overleaf.
Risk appetite
The Group’s framework for managing its 
consideration of risk appetite forms part 
of the annual Risk Management Cycle and 
is used to drive and inform any actions 
undertaken in response to the principal 
risks identified by the Board. Within this 
framework, the Group’s appetite for risk is 
defined with reference to the expectations 
of the Board for both commercial 
opportunity and internal control and is 
used to inform the Group’s annual internal 
audit plan.
A continuous process for identifying risks
The directors have  
overall responsibility  
for ensuring that  
the Group maintains  
a sound system  
of internal control.
Audit Committee
Receives and reviews reports from senior 
management to consider whether significant 
financial, compliance and operational risks 
are being identified, evaluated, managed 
and controlled and whether any significant 
weaknesses exist which need to be addressed. 
The Audit Committee report is set out in 
pages 67 to 69.
Risk Committee
Focuses on reviewing management’s  
activities to continually monitor and manage 
the risks identified. The output from the

which is being migrated into

‘The Cut’ range significantly outperformed 
expectations
Fifty Plus migration well on track
We are pleased with the performance of 
the JD Williams brand during the year, as 
our style proposition and age-agnostic 
attitude continue to resonate with 
customers, both existing and new.
We had particular success in the second 
half with our ‘The Cut’ range, a collection 
of our best priced, current season clothes, 
which further reinforced our value for 
money credentials. Sales of these lines 
significantly exceeded expectations, with 
sales up 72% versus comparable lines the 
previous year. Best-selling lines within the 
range included a £15 swing dress and a 
£18 tunic.
We continue to campaign against the 
lack of age diversity in the fashion industry. 
In September we launched ‘The New 
F Word’, a short film featuring nine 
inspirational women, all of whom have 
proved that 50 is an age to be celebrated. 
In February we staged a protest at London 
Fashion Week, together with five models 
all over the age of 45. Our campaign 
received significant press coverage and 
customer engagement. 
We are in the process of migrating the 
Fifty Plus title into JD Williams; this is the 
final title to go through this process. In the 
first half, revenue from Fifty Plus was down 
18% year on year, as we reduced marketing 
spend ahead of its migration. We then 
commenced the migration in Autumn 
Winter, resulting in revenue up 1% in the 
second half, in line with our expectations. 
The migration will be completed by the 
start of the second half of this coming 
financial year.

to £65.3m, with revenue performance 
strengthening through the year. Active 
customers grew double-digit year on year, 
although spend per customer was lower 
due to the subdued market backdrop, 
particularly in the first half. 
We saw strong product category 
performances in denim, following the 
launch of our new denim range, and 
sportswear, driven both by third party 
brands and the successful relaunch of 
our own-brand Snowdonia.
During the second half we launched our 
Real Man Runway, our search to find an 
everyday guy to star in our next campaign, 
whilst also helping to champion male 
diversity in the fashion industry. We 
received almost 500 entrants and our 
shortlist of 20 men as judged by a panel 
including brand ambassador Freddie 
Flintoff. The winner, Andy Caine from 
Leeds, will be the face of our AW17 
campaign. 
In late February 2017 we launched Jacamo

Strategic report PERFORMANCE REVIEW CONTINUED
Within our four Secondary Brands, 
Fashion World was the strongest 
performer, up mid single-digits year on 
year. This was driven by increased spend 
per customer, an encouraging trend.
Marisota, which is now predominantly 
used as a product brand focusing on fit 
solutions, saw a solid performance. 
Figleaves revenue was slightly down year 
on year. This was in line with expectations, 
as we slowed marketing spend during 
the launch of the new Demandware web 
platform at the start of Autumn Winter 
2016. In February we were pleased to 
announce the appointment of Miriam 
Lahage as Figleaves CEO. Miriam brings 
with her significant retail and online 
experience. The new management team 
will leverage the benefits of the new 
Demandware platform and we expect 
this to improve the performance of 
Figleaves going forwards.
High and Mighty revenue was down year 
on year as we continued to transition the 
brand from a predominantly stores to an 
online model with 1 1 fewer stores 
compared to two years ago.

Launch of new bespoke publications 
for customers
Reinvested back into key product categories, 
such as jersey, knitwear and nightwear
Improved cross-working across traditional 
titles, driving efficiencies and maximising 
profitability
Our Traditional Segment recorded 
revenue of £134.2m, down 1.3% year 
on year. This overall result masks a 
significantly improving trend as we 
progressed through the year, with revenue 
down 4.2% in the first half but up 1.6% 
in the second half, as the actions we took 
to address performance worked well. 
These actions included a revamp of our 
marketing materials and the launch of new 
bespoke publications such as our ‘Classic 
Detail’ catalogue. We also improved the 
product range, in particular reinvesting 
back into our jersey, knitwear and 
nightwear offerings. By title, Julipa was 
a particular strength. 
Looking forward, our strategy in 
Traditional remains unchanged, that is, to 
hold overall revenues broadly flat through 
gaining share in this declining market. 
We believe that we have a competitive 
advantage due to our scale, customer 
loyalty and experience in serving these 
customers. Whilst it is not, therefore, a 
significant growth driver for our business, 
it remains very relevant to our overall 
portfolio and we continue to generate a 
good financial return from this segment.

Strong performance in both credit arrears 
and provision rate
Received full FCA authorisation in 
September, a significant milestone
Launched a trial offering qualifying new 
customers a lower APR on our three Power 
Brands, with early results encouraging
Financial Services revenue was up 0.4% 
during the year. Within this, interest 
payments were up mid single-digit 
whilst non-interest lines were down low 
double-digit. The improvement in the 
quality of the loan book was reflected 
in the gross margin performance, which 
was up 1 10bps year on year to 55.7%. 
We saw a strong performance in 
credit arrears and the provision rate, as 
discussed in the KPI section on page 29. 
We continue to focus on growing two 
key customer bases – those who use 
their account (internally termed our 
‘rollers’) and cash customers, who pay 
immediately on a credit or debit card. 
Cash customers generate attractive 
returns, and are important in terms of 
driving our growth, broadening our 
appeal and enabling us to gain 
economies of scale. 
Looking forward, our intention over the 
long term is to increase the number of 
new credit rollers. The key enabler of this 
will be our new Financial Services system, 
which will be fully live across all brands by 
Summer 2018. 
Ahead of our new credit systems going 
live, we have been running a trial offering 
qualifying new customers a lower APR on 
our three Power Brands, in order to test 
take-up rates and customer behaviour. T o 
date, the trial has delivered encouraging 
results, with an increase in the proportion 
of new customers electing to open an 
account as opposed to paying in cash. 
The payment behaviour of these 
customers has also so far been in line 
with our expectations, however we need 
to allow more time to pass before we 
can fully judge the success of the trial. 
International 
USA 
USA revenue was £15.5m, up 8.5% year 
on year (down 4.2% in constant currency 
terms). The operating loss was £1.3m, 
compared to £1.0m in FY16. As expected, 
performance in the second half was 
impacted by the launch of the new USA 
website. Through a series of post-launch 
releases we have now delivered the 
enhanced experience scoped for our 
customers, which gives us the foundations 
for our future international expansion. 
The majority of our USA revenues are 
generated by the Simply Be brand, 
which continues to resonate very well 
with customers. Performance of the 
JD Williams brand, which we launched 
in the USA in March 2016, has so far 
been encouraging. 
Ireland
Ireland delivered revenues of £15.9m, 
up 18.8% year on year, or 3.8% in constant 
currency terms. The operating profit was 
£3.3m, a significant improvement on the 
£0.8m delivered last year. This performance 
was driven by the improvements to our 
product offering. 
Stores 
The performance of our store estate 
continues to be impacted by weak 
industry footfall. As a consequence, we 
are not planning to open any new stores 
in the future. As with any store estate, 
performance by store varies. We continue 
to take actions to address underperforming 
stores and improve the overall profitability 
of the estate. For FY18, some significant

A good trading 
performance, 
driven by 
Ladieswear and 
our Power Brands
53 week year
As previously guided, this year we are 
reporting on the 53 weeks to 4th March 
2017 , with an extra week added to ensure 
that the year-end date stays close to the 
end of February. In order to provide a 
meaningful comparison with last year’s 
52 week period, all P&L financial 
movements included in this review are 
reported on a 52 week basis, excluding 
the 53rd week, unless otherwise stated. 
Where applicable, the 53rd week’s known 
result has been used as the basis for the 
adjustment to provide the 52 week results, 
although a degree of judgement has been 
applied in deriving certain operating costs 
in respect of the final week. Group 
revenue for the 53rd week was £13m 
whilst Group adjusted and statutory PBT 
was £2m, in line with expectations. A 
detailed comparison of the 53 weeks and 
52 weeks results are shown in the table on 
page 44. All second half P&L financial 
movements relate to the 26 week period, 
excluding the 27th week, unless otherwise 
stated. All balance sheet figures are 
reported as at the year-end date and cash 
flow figures are for the 53 week period.
On a statutory 
53 week basis Group 
revenue was £900.7m, 
with Product revenue 
of £635.9m and 
Financial Services 
revenue of £264.8m. 
On a 52 week basis 
Group revenue was 
+2.5% to £887.7m, 
with Product revenue 
+3.4% to £627.2m 
and Financial Services 
revenue +0.4% to 
£260.5m.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Revenue performance
On a statutory 53 week basis Group 
revenue was £900.7m, with Product 
revenue of £635.9m and Financial Services 
revenue of £264.8m. On a 52 week basis 
Group revenue was +2.5% to £887 .7m, 
with Product revenue +3.4% to £627 .2m 
and Financial Services revenue +0.4% 
to £260.5m. 
Revenue by brand for the 52 weeks is 
shown in the table above. A detailed 
discussion of performance by brand is 
contained within the performance review 
on pages 38 to 41.
Revenue performance for the 52 weeks 
by category is also shown in the table 
above. We have changed our revenue by 
category allocation, moving Accessories 
revenue from Ladieswear into the 
renamed Footwear & Accessories 
category. This reflects our approach to 
these categories, with Footwear and 
Accessories managed by the same team. 
We are pleased to report 4.2% growth 
in Ladieswear revenue year on year. Our 
performance strengthened significantly 
as we went through the year. In the first 
half revenue was down 1. 1% year on year, 
against a weak sector backdrop and 
impacted by the decline in our Traditional 
titles. In the second half we outperformed 
the market and delivered revenue growth 
of 10.4% year on year. Our Lingerie ranges, 
included within Ladieswear, also recorded 
a strong performance with revenue up 
high double-digit. We saw particular 
success with our new Figleaves Curve 
range sold through both Simply Be and 
JD Williams.
Menswear recorded consistent growth 
throughout the year, and for FY17 revenue 
was up 4.6% year on year. Footwear and 
Accessories revenue growth of 0.7% again 
masks a different performance by half, 
with revenue in the first half down 3.6% 
before recovering to +5.3% in the 
second half. 
Home and Gift revenue was up 2.8%. 
Our strategy in Home remains unchanged 
– we aim to recruit new customers to our 
Fashion offering, but then see customers 
also buying Homewares. Within 
Homewares we focus on categories which 
have higher gross margins and are more 
competitively differentiated, such as 
Furniture, Gifting, Home Textiles, Kitchen 
and Home Décor, and Outdoor Living. 
These categories overall grew by 6%, with 
double-digit growth rates recorded in 
Furniture and Outdoor Living as a result 
of us further improving and expanding 
our ranges. 
Gross margin
Product cost of goods sold (COGS) were 
£284. 1m, compared to £265.9m in FY16. 
Product gross margin was 54.7%, down 
150bps year on year, in line with guidance. 
This was primarily a result of increased 
promotions against a challenging sector 
backdrop in the first half, together with 
headwinds from FX rates and our 
inventory clearance exercise. These factors 
were partially offset by a further increase 
in our buying-in margin and a small 
tailwind from mix.

2 52 week revenue has been calculated by excluding the actual revenue recorded for the 53rd week.
3 52 week cost of sales has been approximated by applying the full year gross margin percentage to 52 week revenue.
4 Approximation of variable and semi-variable costs has been made on a time apportionment basis. Certain fixed costs 
such as audit fee and depreciation/amortisation are deemed to be incurred on an annual basis and as such are 
consistent with those costs recorded for the 53 week period.
Our gross bad debt charge was  
£1 10.9m (FY16: £1 10.3m). This bad debt 
charge, together with a small number  
of other Financial Services costs, resulted  
in a Financial Services gross margin of 
55.7%, up 1 10bps year on year. This 
increase in gross margin is a result  
of the improvement in the quality  
of the customer loan book, together  
with the sale of some high risk payment 
arrangement debt at a slightly better  
rate than book value.
Warehouse and fulfilment costs increased 
by 3.8% to £79.6m, driven predominantly 
by volumes, which were up 6% year on 
year, together with further improvements 
to our delivery offering, partially offset by 
continued efficiencies. 
Marketing costs were up 0.5% year on 
year. Admin and payroll costs increased by 
6.3% to £130.3m, as we invested in digital 
talent, funded by the movement of some 
marketing costs.

 EBITDA declined by 4.7% to 
£1 15.9m. Depreciation and amortisation 
increased by 9.5% to £27 .6m, as a result of 
the investments we are making into the 
business. Overall, operating profit before 
exceptional items was £88.3m. 
Net finance costs
Net finance costs were £7 .7m, down 4.9% 
year on year, driven by lower funding costs 
on our securitisation facility. 
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 FX sensitivity
For FY18 we expect our annual purchases, 
net of international revenues, to be 
c.$125m, on which we have a hedging 
strategy in place, together with c.£130m, 
where we face indirect cost pressures due 
to the depreciation of sterling. 
Looking at our dollar exposure specifically, 
for FY18, we have, to date, hedged 90% 
of our net purchases at a blended rate of 
$/£1.27 . At a rate of $/£1.25, and before 
any mitigating actions, this would result 
in a c.£10m PBT headwind compared to 
FY17 . Every 5 cents move from this rate 
in our unhedged position would result in 
a PBT sensitivity of c.£0.4m. For FY19 we 
have, to date, hedged 25% of our net 
purchases at a blended rate of $/£1.27 . 
At a rate of $/£1.25, and before any 
mitigating actions, this would result in a 
c.£1m PBT headwind compared to FY18. 
Every 5 cents move from this rate in our 
unhedged position would result in a PBT 
sensitivity of c.£3.2m. 
Importantly, a number of mitigating 
activities are underway, including supplier 
negotiations, fabric and production 
planning, markdown optimisation and our 
ongoing work on supplier consolidation. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional costs totalled £25.2m. 
Within this, we incurred £22.9m related 
to Financial Services customer redress, 
£2.5m of external costs related to taxation 
matters and a credit of £0.2m relating to 
the closure of our clearance stores. 
Taxation
The effective rate of Corporation Tax is 
23. 1% (FY16: 23.9%). The tax charge for 
the 53 week period was £13.3m 
(FY16: £17 .3m) which meant that profit 
from continuing operations for the 
53 weeks to 4 March 2017 was £44.3m 
(FY16: £54.9m). 
Earnings per share
Earnings per share from continuing 
operations for the 53 week period were 
15.67p (FY16: 19.45p). Adjusted earnings 
per share for the 53 week period from 
continuing operations were 22.74p 
(FY16: 24.02p).
Dividends
The Board recognises the importance 
of the dividend to shareholders and 
accordingly, is holding the final year 
dividend flat on last year, at 8.56p, 
taking the full year dividend to 14.23p 
(FY16: 14.23p), as we continue to invest 
in the business.
Balance sheet and cash flow 
(53 weeks ending 4 March 2017 vs 
52 weeks ended 27 February 2016)
Capital expenditure for the year was 
£41.4m (FY16: £58.7m). The majority of this 
investment was on our systems investment 
programme. 
Inventory levels at the period end were up 
3.9% to £105.5m (FY16: £101.5m). Within 
this overall level, we successfully disposed 
of a small amount of aged stock, as 
planned. The higher inventory level year 
on year is driven by the impact of changes 
in exchange rates; inventory units were 
down 4.5% year on year. 
Gross trade receivables declined by 4.0% 
to £599.5m (FY16: £624.7m). The provision 
declined from £97 .6m to £64.7m, largely 
driven by the sale of some high risk 
payment arrangement debt at a slightly 
better rate than book value, along with 
ongoing progress in reducing overall 
debtor risk. The majority of the balance of 
debtors written off relate to this debt sale. 
Outside of this, the risk profile of our 
customer loan book continues to improve. 
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme has a surplus of £8.3m 
(FY16: £10.8m surplus). 
Net cash generated from operations 
(excluding taxation) was £87 . 1m compared 
to £86.9m last year. After funding capital 
expenditure, finance costs, taxation and 
dividends, net debt was broadly flat at 
£290.9m (FY16: £289.7m), in line with 
our expectations. Gearing levels were 
flat at 61%.
FY18 guidance
We have provided the following 
guidance for FY18; this is subject 
to change. 
Product gross margin -120bps to -20bps 
Financial Services gross margin flat 
to +100bps 
Group operating costs +3.5% to +5.5% 
(excluding depreciation and amortisation) 
Depreciation and amortisation 
£29m to £30m 
Net interest £8m to £9m
Tax rate c.20%
Capex of c.£40m
Net debt £300m to £320m

of our ongoing tax disputes with HMRC

Our Customer Charter sets out our 
commitment to customers. We seek to 
establish enduring relationships for the

importance of being a responsible lender. 
We continually monitor the experience of

renewable sources. 
We voluntarily report to both the Carbon

Overview
As a worldwide, multi-channel retailer, we 
recognise that we have a responsibility to 
minimise the impact that our operations 
have on the environment. We have been 
working towards environmental targets for 
several years and our performance against 
these targets has been formally assessed 
this year. New targets have recently been 
set reflecting our efforts to continually 
improve our performance and the 
expectations of our customers, staff  
and investors.
Group-wide responsibility for sustainability 
is assigned to Ian Carr, Director of 
Logistics, who sits on the Operational 
Board of JD Williams and Company 
Limited and who reports to the Chief 
Executive Officer and, through him, 
to the Board of Directors.
For the past ten years, we have  
been actively working alongside our 
environmental partners, Envantage Ltd and 
Viridor Limited to boost our environmental 
performance and increase Group-wide 
environmental awareness, accountability 
and disclosure. We have strived to reduce 
our carbon emissions profile, water 
consumption and waste impact through 
ongoing investment into energy efficiency, 
efficient operations, waste management, 
water minimisation initiatives and 
investment into green energy.
Carbon Disclosure Project
The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is a voluntary, investor-led programme, requesting 
companies to respond to a range of carbon and energy management related questions, 
as well as providing full carbon footprint disclosure. Companies are scored and results 
are published annually. Since 2008, the Group has responded to the climate change 
questionnaire and our performance is shown in the table below.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
In the last reporting year, a new scoring 
methodology was introduced which 
combined the previously separate 
disclosure and performance scores  
to provide one alphabetical score only 
(A to D-). In 2016, we achieved a score 
of B which is above the industry and sector 
average score (of C), placing us firmly in 
the ‘Management’ category.
We also report on the forests module of 
the CDP which encourages participants  
to look at how they procure and use forest 
commodities both directly and through 
the supply chain. As a direct consumer 
and onward retailer of forest products, 
we have a responsibility to ensure that 
our procurement is not at the expense  
of the future world’s forests, but positively 
supports responsible forest management. 
Our first submission to the Forestry 
Disclosure Project (FDP) was made in 2015 
and a score of B was achieved. In 2016,

Emissions profile
Our Green House Gas (GHG) emissions 
inventory is calculated for the global 
Group

 under the operational control 
approach, in accordance with the GHG 
Protocol and GHG emissions factors 
published by Department of Energy and 
Climate Change (DECC). The inventory is 
independently calculated by our partner 
carbon consultants Envantage Ltd.
Under GHG reporting guidelines, scope 1 
and 2 emissions are the key mandatory 
areas to report, illustrating the 
environmental impact of the Group for 
activities which we have direct control 
over; ie operation of our sites and vehicles. 
As a responsible retailer, we have also 
taken steps to quantify as many optional 
scope 3 emission sources that relate to 
our operations.
The table and chart below illustrate 
our GHG emissions across all our 
reporting areas, for the global Group 
from 1 March 2016 to 28 February 2017 
and the previous year.

Emissions change from previous year 
We have reduced our Group GHG 
emissions by 3% compared to the previous 
reporting period. A breakdown of the 
reduction in emissions by source is shown 
in the chart to the right. 
Relative performance using 
intensity ratios
As a growing organisation, evaluation 
of scope 1 and 2 emissions performance 
using intensity ratios allows a more 
meaningful comparison to be made 
between inventory periods. The table to 
the right shows the scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions in relation to both Group 
turnover (£million) and million items 
dispatched
3
. GHG emissions relating to 
Scope 1 and 2 sources have decreased 
considerably in terms of our relative 
performance against both turnover and 
items dispatched, as shown in the table 
and charts to the right.
Market based 
electricity emissions
As well as making efforts to reduce 
emissions by reducing energy 
consumption, the Group are also 
committed to reducing emissions 
by purchasing energy from greener 
technologies and sources.
In January 2015, the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol updated their Scope 2 reporting 
guidelines on how organisations report 
their emissions relating to purchased 
electricity, heat and steam. Companies 
shall now report two sets of Scope 2 
emissions: one using a location based 
method and another using a market based 
method. This is termed ‘dual reporting’.
The location based method reflects the 
average emissions intensity of grids on 
which energy consumption occurs; the 
same way that electricity emissions have 
been reported historically. The market 
based method reflects the emissions for 
the energy that a company is purchasing, 
as supplies under different contracts emit 
different levels of greenhouse gases 
depending on the energy source or 
technology used. Our market based and 
location based electricity emissions are 
shown in the table to the right.

since November 2016 we have purchased 
100% renewable electricity which is 
backed with REGO (Renewable Energy 
Guarantees of Origin) certificates. The 
REGO certificates provide confidence

with the GHG Protocol, we are now able 
to report our REGO backed electricity

green electricity we have been generating 
our own green electricity via a solar PV 
array at our distribution centres since 2016. 
We have a small number of sites outside 
the UK for which we are unable to 
purchase green electricity. We also 
operate several landlord managed sites 
and are not responsible for the 
procurement of electricity. Overall, 
97% of the electricity for our directly

Performance against 2017 targets
Since 2010 the Group has been working towards three environmental targets focusing 
on waste, water and greenhouse gas emissions. The targets were set against a base year 
of 2007 – 2008, with a goal of them being met by 2017 . Our performance against these 
targets has been reviewed and the results are outlined below.

Most of our waste is generated from activities carried out at our  
head office and distribution sites. We recognise that we have a 
responsibility to manage our waste so that it has the least impact 
on the environment as possible. A key part of this is ensuring our 
waste does not end up in landfill. 
We have achieved our target of zero waste to landfill for the  
past two years by taking advantage of new, cleaner disposal 
technologies such as energy from waste and mechanical  
biological treatment.

(used for internal haulage) across our facilities and vehicles. 
We almost achieved our relative emissions target and despite 
significant business growth, there has still been a reduction.
Since our emissions target was set, we have had a shift in  
business strategy, with an increased focus towards the volume  
of items distributed from our warehouses. This change in 
direction has been accounted for in our new targets, which  
are detailed opposite.

We have recently committed to new, 
Group-wide environmental targets. The 
targets have been carefully considered and 
account for our changing business strategy, 
making them relevant and challenging.
Having met our water reduction target,  
we consider that it is appropriate to shift 
our focus to another area of our 
operations: our haulage. Our haulage  
fleet is a key aspect of our operations  
that we have influence over in terms of 
reducing our environmental impact and 
we are keen to take on this challenge. As  
well as creating a new haulage focused 
target we have also expanded the scope 
of our emissions targets for our buildings.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 • Gas oil: Fuel is used in stand by 
generators and onsite transport 
(forklifts etc). Data for onsite transport 
is calculated using actual fuel usage 
from invoices and internal records of 
gas oil deliveries. Generator fuel usage 
has been estimated using generator 
fuel demand per hour and activation 
information.
• Diesel: Data is calculated based 
on actual fuel consumption taken 
from invoices.
• Company car: Data is primarily 
calculated for the Group using data 
logged in our Concur system which 
records distance travelled, and vehicle 
information for each business travel 
expense claimed. Any company cars 
not logged on this system have been 
taken from independent mileage 
claim records. 
• HFC: Refrigeration emissions have 
been calculated from the F-Gas register 
for applicable plant where provided. 
Where this is not possible, leakages 
have been estimated using DECC 
leakage tables. Emissions for plant not 
affected by this regulation (smaller 
systems) have been calculated using 
data provided by full service records. 
Where service records were not 
available for a very small number of 
shops, refrigeration losses have been 
estimated using DECC leakage tables. 
For a very small number of shops and 
the Bangladesh office, details of the 
systems were not known and therefore 
estimation of emissions has not 
been possible.
Mandatory GHG reporting notes
The data disclosed is in conformance with 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report Regulations). GHG 
emissions disclosed under the required 
reporting categories fall within the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been 
calculated on a global scale where the 
Group has operation control using the 
GHG protocol. The quantified emissions 
are for the reporting year 1 March 2016 
to 28 February 2017 . 
GHG emissions factors published by 
DECC for 2016 have been used to 
calculate GHG emissions. 
Noted change in emissions 
for 2015 – 2016
• Data accuracy: Some data for the 
2015-2016 inventory has been updated 
based on actual data or more accurate 
data for some sources. 
• Update in DECC emissions factors: 
Emissions from the previous published 
report for the period 2015 – 2016 have 
been recalculated with the newly 
published factors for 2016, affecting 
the months of January and February 
2016 (2016 factors were not available at 
time of publishing). This has resulted in 
a slight change in emissions compared  
to those originally reported.
• Improved waste quantification:  
Data relating to waste at the retail sites 
has been updated for 2015 – 2016 as 
waste audits were carried out this year, 
providing a more accurate indication 
of the emissions arising from 
waste disposal.
Data records
• Natural gas and electricity: Data is 
primarily calculated based on actual 
metered consumption from invoices or 
meter readings. Where actual metered 
data is not available, for example if 
energy is billed as part of a landlord 
service charge, energy consumption 
has been estimated using floor areas 
and published benchmarks. Some data 
has been estimated where quarterly 
bills have not yet been published.

We have already taken a step towards 
meeting this target by voluntarily 
upgrading our non-automated electricity

the Group at the end of that period to 
enable shareholders to assess how the 
Directors have performed their duty 
under section 172 of the Companies Act. 
The review also describes the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group,

business at the end of the financial 
year and an indication of likely future 
developments in the business.
Risk management

processes to manage risks appropriately. 
The Executive Directors and operating

October 2016 and shareholders are invited 
to ratify his appointment at the 2017 AGM.
Details of Directors’ interests (beneficial 
and non-beneficial) in shares of the Group 
are given in the Remuneration Report 
on page 84 and are deemed to be 
incorporated into this report by 
cross-reference.
The powers of the Directors are described 
in the Board terms of reference and the 
Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 64 to 66. The terms of reference  
for the Board and its Committees are 
available on the Group’s website  
www.nbrown.co.uk
Other than a contract of service, no other 
Director had any interest in any disclosable 
contract or arrangements with the Group 
or any subsidiary Company either during 
or at the end of the year.
Directors’ and officers’ liabilities
The Company’s Articles of Association 
provide that, in so far as the law permits, 
every Director of the Group or associated 
Company may be indemnified by the 
Company against liability. In accordance 
with section 236 of the Companies Act, 
qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
are in place for the Directors in respect of 
liabilities incurred as a result of their office, 
to the extent permitted by law. In addition, 
the Group maintains insurance for 
Directors and officers of the Group, 
indemnifying them against certain 
liabilities incurred by them whilst acting 
on behalf of the Group. Both the insurance 
and indemnities applied throughout the 
financial year ended 4 March 2017 and 
through to the date of this report.
Disclosure of information to auditors
The directors who held office at the date 
of approval of this directors report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware, and each 
director has taken all the steps that he or 
she ought to have taken as director to 
make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information.
Major shareholders
In addition to the Directors’ shareholdings shown in the Remuneration Report on page 
84 and in accordance with Chapter 5 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules, the following notifications had been received from holders of notifiable interests in 
the Group’s issued share capital at 13 April 2017:
Shareholder
Holding 
share capital % of issues 
Nigel Alliance OBE 31,489,256 11.07
Invesco Perpetual Asset Management 28,760,449 10.11
UBS Global Asset Management 16,778,791 5.90
Change of control
There are a number of agreements that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company such  
as commercial contracts, bank loan 
agreements, property lease arrangements 
and employee share plans. None of these 
are considered to be significant in terms 
of their likely impact on the business of the 
Group as a whole. Executive Directors’ 
service contracts are terminable by the 
Group on giving 12 months’ notice. There 
are no agreements between the Group 
and its Directors or employees that 
provide for additional compensation for 
loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid. No relevant 
events were reported in the year.
Significant contracts
The Group has a number of contractual 
arrangements with suppliers (both of 
goods and services) and occupies 
leasehold premises for the purpose of 
conducting its business. Whilst these 
arrangements are important to the 
business of the Group, individually none  
of them are essential to the business of  
the Group and do not require disclosure 
under section 417(5) (c) of the  
Companies Act.
Tax status
The Company is not a close Company 
within the meaning of the Corporation 
Tax Act 2010.
Independent auditor
The Group’s independent auditors,  
KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’), have indicated their 
willingness to continue in office and the 
Audit Committee has recommended that 
KPMG remain in office. A resolution to 
re-appoint the independent auditors will 
be proposed at the AGM.
The auditor’s fees for both audit and 
non-audit work are given in the Audit 
Committee report on page 69.
Governance
The Board is committed to maintaining 
high standards of corporate governance. 
Further details are contained in the 
Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 64 to 66.
Corporate social responsibility 
and greenhouse gas emissions
Details on corporate social responsibility 
and greenhouse gas emissions are set out 
on pages 46 to 55.
Charitable and political donations
During the year, the Group made 
charitable donations of £95,902 (2016, 
£13,315). No political donations have been 
made (2016, nil). No contributions have 
been made to non-EU political parties 
(2016, nil).
Auto-enrolment and 
Stakeholder pension

Zurich was appointed as provider for all 
qualifying employees. As at 31 May 2017

The Group is exposed to certain financial 
risks, namely interest rate risk, currency 
risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. 
Information regarding such financial risks

Governance DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Voting rights and restrictions 
on transfer of shares
None of the ordinary shares in the 
Group carry any special rights with regard 
to control of the Group. There are no 
restrictions on transfers of shares 
other than:
• certain restrictions which may from 
time to time be imposed by laws or 
regulations such as those relating to 
insider dealing;
• pursuant to the Company’s code for 
securities transactions whereby the 
Directors and designated employees 
require approval to deal in the 
Company’s shares; and
• where a person with an interest in the 
Company’s shares has been served 
with a disclosure notice and has failed 
to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in 
those shares.
The Directors are not aware of any 
arrangements between shareholders that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or voting rights. The rights and 
obligations attaching to the Company’s 
ordinary shares are set out in the Articles 
of Association.
Amendment of the Company’s 
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association 
may only be amended by a special 
resolution at a general meeting of 
shareholders. Where class rights are 
varied, such amendments must be 
approved by the members of each class 
of shares separately. The Company 
currently only has one class of share.
Powers of the Directors
The Directors are responsible for the 
management of the business of the 
Company and may exercise all powers  
of the Company subject to applicable 
legislation and regulation and the 
Company’s Articles of Association.
At the 2016 annual general meeting, the 
Directors were given the power to issue 
new shares up to a nominal amount of 
£10,442,189. This power will expire on  
the earlier of the conclusion of the 2017 
annual general meeting or 18 July 2017 . 
Accordingly, a resolution will be proposed 
at the 2017 annual general meeting to 
renew the Company’s authority to issue 
new shares.
Directors were also given the power to 
issue new issue shares up to a further 
nominal amount of £10,442,189 in 
connection with an offer by way of a rights 
issue. This authority too will expire on the 
earlier of the conclusion of the 2017 annual 
general meeting or 18 July 2017 , and a 
resolution will be proposed at the 2017 
annual general meeting to renew it.
Approval was also given at the 2016 
annual general meeting for a certain 
number of shares up to a maximum 
nominal value of £1,566,328 – to be 
allotted pursuant to the authority granted 
to Directors set out above without being 
covered by statutory pre-emption rights 
regime. As with the previously mentioned 
approvals, this authority too will expire on 
the earlier of the conclusion of the 2017 
annual general meeting or 18 July 2017 , 
and a resolution will be proposed at the 
2017 annual general meeting to renew  
this authority.
As in previous years, authorisation for the 
Directors to buy back the Company’s 
shares will not be sought at the 2017 
annual general meeting.
Employee share schemes 
– rights of control
The trustees of the N Brown Group plc 
Employee Share Ownership Trust hold 
shares on trust for the benefit of the 
Executive Directors and employees of the 
Group. The shares held by the trust are 
used in connection with the Group’s 
various share incentive plans. The trustees 
currently abstain from voting but have the 
power to vote for or against, or not at all, 
at their discretion in respect of any shares 
in the Company held in the trust. The 
trustees may, upon the recommendation 
of the Company, accept or reject any offer 
relating to the shares in any way they see 
fit, without incurring any liability and 
without being required to give reasons for 
their decision. In exercising their trustee 
powers the trustees may take all of the 
following matters into account:
• the long-term interests of beneficiaries;
• the interests of beneficiaries other than 
financial interests;
• the interests of beneficiaries in their 
capacity as employees or former 
employees or their dependants;
• the interests of persons (whether or not 
identified) who may become 
beneficiaries in the future; and
• considerations of a local, moral, ethical, 
environmental or social nature.
Going concern
The Directors have adopted the going 
concern basis in the financial statements 
and their opinion is explained on pages  
98 and 99.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
Code, the Directors have assessed the 
longer term viability of the Group and can 
confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue to 
operate and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due for the three year period from approval 
of this Annual Report. 
The Group uses a three year timescale to 
forecast its strategic plan on a rolling basis, 
as it is felt that a longer period would not 
produce a reliable result given the current 
pace of development both within the 
Group and the wider retail sector in which it 
operates. The Directors’ assessment has 
been made with reference to the Group’s 
current position and prospects, the Group’s 
strategy, the Board’s risk appetite and the 
Group’s principal risks and how these are 
managed, as detailed in the Corporate 
Governance Report.
The strategy and associated principal risks 
underpin the Group’s three year plan and 
scenario testing, which the Directors review 
at least annually. The three year plan makes 
certain assumptions about our core product 
and financial services growth drivers, 
margins and operating costs, together with 
the Group’s cash flows, general liquidity and 
other key financial ratios. Although the 
strategic plan reflects the Directors’ best 
estimate of the future prospects of the 
business, they have also tested the potential 
impact on the Group of a number of 
scenarios over and above those included in 
the plan, by quantifying their financial impact 
and overlaying this on the detailed financial 
forecasts in the plan. The plan has been 
subjected to severe but plausible stress tests 
using four primary downside scenarios 
which have been derived as part of the 
Board’s review of the Group’s principal risks 
detailed in the Corporate Governance 
Report. They represent ‘severe but 
plausible’ circumstances that the Group 
could experience. The stress tests apply a 
range of sensitivities to our headline interest 
rate, bad debt levels, Group revenue 
sensitivities and current tax positions; 
reflecting the principal risks of the business, 
primarily through a reduction in the credit 
activities of the Group, a negative potential 
customer impact arising from increased 
LIBOR rates, potential trading restrictions 
dealing with the impact of a cyber attack 
and negative outcomes from a number of 
tax positions we are currently defending.
62
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 The three year plan review is solidly 
underpinned by the regular Board 
briefings provided by the Group’s 
Operating Board and the discussion of  
any new strategies undertaken by the 
Board in its normal course of business. 
These reviews consider both the market 
opportunity and the associated risks, 
principally the ability to operationally 
deliver any new initiatives, to manage 
its working capital performance and the 
level of financial resources available to 
the Group. Implausible scenarios, such 
as multiple circumstances occurring at 
the same time are assumed to not occur. 
The Directors do not consider it plausible 
that any of the key risks would crystallise 
together in a way that would create a 
worst outcome over the three year 
assessment period. In the unlikely event  
of multiple risks occurring and having a 
particularly severe effect on the Group,  
all potential actions such as constraining 
capital spending and reducing payments 
to shareholders would be taken on a 
timely basis. Thus, the Directors believe  
it has the early warning mechanisms to 
identify the need for such actions and the 
ability to implement them on a timely 
basis if necessary.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent Company 
financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under Company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and parent Company and of 
their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU;
• for the parent Company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained  
in the parent Company financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent Company 
and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations,  
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement 
that comply with that law and those 
regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report, taken together, include a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
• the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Committees
The Board delegates authority to a  
number of Committees to deal with specific 
aspects of management and to maintain 
supervision over the internal control policies 
and procedures of the Group. These 
Committees meet regularly and have  
formal written terms of reference which are 
available for inspection on the Company’s 
website. The minutes of the meetings of 
these Committees are circulated to all 
Committee members in advance of the 
next Committee meeting, at which they are 
ratified. The following Committees of the 
Board have been established: 
• an Audit Committee;
• a Remuneration Committee; 
• a Nominations and Governance 
Committee; and
• a Corporate Social Responsibility 
Committee.
After each Committee meeting the 
Chairman of that Committee makes a 
formal report to the Board of Directors 
detailing the business carried out by the 
Committee and setting out its 
recommendations.
The Board is responsible for all major policy 
decisions and for determining the 
operational and strategic risks it is willing to 
take in achieving its objectives. The Board 
has, where necessary, delegated 
operational matters to its Committees and 
sub-Committees, and to its Executive and 
Operational Directors and senior officers. 
The Board is collectively responsible for 
providing effective leadership and 
promoting the success of the Group  
and works to a formal list of matters 
reserved for the Board (a copy of which  
is available on the Company’s website, 
www.nbrown.co.uk). Matters reserved  
for the Board include, amongst other 
things, decisions on business strategy, the 
approval of financial statements, the annual 
capital and operating expenditure plans, 
investment, treasury and dividend policies, 
governance issues, major capital projects, 
overseeing the Group’s risk control 
procedures, Board membership and  
the composition of its Committees and  
the Group’s ethical, social and 
environmental policies.
The Board governs through clearly 
mandated Committees, accompanied by 
robust monitoring and reporting systems. 
Responsibilities

between the Chairman, Andrew 
Higginson, who is responsible for the 
effective operation of the Board and the

performance. Equally there is a clear 
distinction between the Chair, the Senior 
Independent Director and the Non-

summarises the position:
Chair Leader of the Board. 
Responsible for Board effectiveness 
including agendas, Board 
composition and Board meetings.

The Chairman was considered independent 
at the time of his appointment. 
The Board understands the need for 
Non-Executive Directors to be and remain 
independent of the management in order 
to be able to exercise proper oversight 
and effectively challenge the Executive 
Directors. The Non-Executive Directors 
who served during the financial year 
ended 4 March 2017 were: 
• Andrew Higginson (Chairman);
• Lord Alliance of Manchester;
• Ivan Fallon; 
• Fiona Laird;
• Simon Patterson (resigned April 2016)
• Richard Moross  
(appointed October 2016)
• Ron McMillan  
(Senior Independent Director); and
• Lesley Jones
A number of Non-Executive Director 
only meetings were held this year to 
allow NEDs to discuss matters without 
the Executive Directors present. 
Day-to-day management of the Group’s 
activities is delegated to the operational 
board, known as the Operating Board, on 
which Angela Spindler and Craig Lovelace 
sit as Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer respectively. 
In November the members of the Board 
met with the Operating Board over a two 
day period to review the progress being 
made against, and the future development 
of, the Group’s long-term rolling 
strategic plan.
Effectiveness
The Board considers that, throughout the 
year, at least half of the Board, excluding 
the Chairman, comprised independent 
Non-Executive Directors and that the 
composition of the Board had the 
necessary balance of executive and 
Non-Executive Directors to provide 
the requisite skills, experience, challenge 
and judgement appropriate for the 
requirements of the business and full 
Board effectiveness.
The composition of the Board sub 
Committees is regularly reviewed and has 
been refreshed part way through this year. 
Where appropriate, the Committees will 
invite others to attend. 
The appointment of Richard Moross, 
our most recent Board appointment, 
further strengthens the digital skills 
and knowledge of the Board, thereby 
reflecting our digital first strategy. 
Diversity
The Board recognises the importance of 
diversity, including gender, at all levels of 
the Company as well as on the Board.  
The Company is committed to equal 
opportunities and increasing diversity 
across our operations in terms of relevant 
skills, experience, ethnicity and gender. 
The Board now comprises six male 
Directors and three female Directors. The 
Board continues to consider how diversity 
can be enhanced through the Board and 
the senior management teams and across 
the Group generally, whilst ensuring that it 
appoints only the most appropriate 
candidates to the Board. 
We currently have 33% female diversity 
at Board level and 30% on the Operating 
Board. This means we are already in line 
with the 33% target for 2020 set by the 
Davies report, and significantly higher than 
the current FTSE 250, who have achieved 
representation at 20.4%. We believe that 
gender representation makes good 
business sense, given that women make 
up over half of the UK population and 
almost 60% of our total workforce.
Strengthening our executive pipeline 
remains a priority for us and we continue 
to open up new opportunities for women 
in the business, working with head-hunters 
and agencies that can provide true gender 
diversification in their candidate bases.
To provide role models in the business and 
break the glass ceiling we are members of 
‘Women on Boards’. Our aim is to allow 
development of Board Directors and to 
allow Directors to take up Non-Executive 
roles in other businesses where 
opportunities arise.
At the date of this report the gender split 
(male/female, senior management and 
entire workforce) is as per the table and 
diagram below:
Board appointments  
All appointments to the Board follow a 
formal, rigorous and transparent process 
to ensure we are appointing the best 
possible candidate. Due regard is given to 
the needs of the Board in respect of skills, 
experience, independence and diversity. 
The appointment of Richard Moross was 
facilitated by external consultants 
MWM Consulting LLP . 
Appointments to the Board are made 
solely on merit based on the skills and 
experience offered by the candidate and 
required by the role. This ensures that all 
appointees have the best mix of skills and 
time to devote themselves effectively to 
the business of the Board and to discharge 
their duties to the best of their ability. 
Prior to appointment to the Board all 
Directors are informed of the expected 
time commitment. At the time of writing 
there are no concerns that any of the 
current Directors will be unable to 
commit sufficient time to the role. 
We have evaluated the commitments 
of the Chairman and are satisfied he has 
sufficient time to devote to his role.
External appointments or other significant 
commitments of the Directors require the 
prior approval of the Board. Details of such 
external appointments can be found in the 
Directors’ biographies set out on pages 
58 and 59.

Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED
The Articles of Association of the 
Company give the Directors the power 
to consider and, if appropriate, authorise 
conflict situations where a Director’s 
declared interest may conflict or does 
conflict with the interests of the Company. 
Procedures are in place at every meeting 
for individual Directors to report and 
record any potential or actual conflicts 
which arise. The register of reported 
conflicts is reviewed by the Board at least 
annually. The Board has complied with 
these procedures during the year.
Board development
The Company Secretary provides an 
on-going programme of briefings for 
Directors covering legal and regulatory 
changes and developments relevant to the 
Group’s activities and Director’s areas of 
responsibility. The Company Secretary is 
also responsible for the induction of new 
Directors. New Directors are provided 
with a comprehensive pack of information 
(including terms of reference, information 
regarding the business and guidance on 
their roles and duties as Directors) and 
meetings/site visits with key employee 
contacts are arranged as appropriate. 
Inductions to the business for new 
Directors are designed to expose them 
to all areas of the Group’s operations 
but with particular emphasis on each 
Director’s area of expertise.
Non-Executive Directors meet with 
operational teams and the Operating 
Board and undertake site visits to ensure 
that they have the most up-to-date 
knowledge and understanding of the 
Company and its activities and to enable 
the broader population of the Group to 
benefit from the skills and experience of 
the Non-Executive Directors. All Board 
members are permitted to obtain 
independent professional advice in 
respect of their own fiduciary duties and 
obligations and have full and direct access 
to the Company Secretary, who is a 
qualified solicitor and who attends 
all Board and Committee meetings 
as Secretary. 
The Chairman regularly reviews and 
agrees with each Director their training 
and development needs.
Board administration
Board papers include detailed 
management reports from the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, 
management accounts, broker analyses, 
compliance and regulatory briefings and 
bespoke reports. A comprehensive pack 
of papers is electronically circulated to 
each Director not less than seven days 
prior to each Board meeting. Budgetary 
performance and forecasts are reviewed 
and revised at each meeting. Outside of 
the meeting there is a regular flow of 
information between the Directors 
including the weekly dissemination of 
management information statistics. 
Board evaluation
The Board, having carried out a 
performance evaluation, believes 
the performance of the Chairman 
and Directors, and their commitment 
to their respective roles, continues to 
be fully effective and the Board and 
its Committees continue to provide 
appropriate oversight and challenge.
In accordance with Main Principle B.6 of 
the Code an internal effectiveness review 
of the Board and its Committees was 
undertaken during the second half of the 
year by way of a tailored, high-level 
questionnaire which was distributed for 
the Directors to complete. 
The responses to the evaluation of the 
Board and its Committees were reviewed 
with the Chairman and then considered by 
the Board. The overall view was that the 
Board remains effective, positive and 
cohesive and there has been progress in 
relation to the areas for improvement 
identified in the 2016 evaluation exercise. 
As with all evaluations an action plan has 
been agreed by the Chairman as a result 
of the evaluation and, based on this, the 
Board has agreed a set of objectives for 
2017/18. 
Beyond the annual evaluation, the 
performance of the Executive Directors is 
continuously monitored throughout the 
year by the Chairman and the senior 
Non-Executive Director.
Election of Directors
Pursuant to the Code, all Directors are 
required to retire and submit themselves 
for re-election annually. Accordingly, each 
of the Directors will retire at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting and 
offer themselves for reappointment at that 
meeting with the exception of Ivan Fallon 
who will not be seeking re-election.
All Non-Executive Directors serve on 
letters of appointment stipulating 3 year 
terms, apart from Ivan Fallon who remains 
on a three month rolling arrangement. 
All appointments are terminable, without 
compensation, on between three and 
six months’ notice by either party and 
are subject to other early termination 
provisions without compensation, for 
example in the event a Director is not 
re-elected at the annual general meeting.
Accountability
The Directors have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principle risks facing the 
Company including those which would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. The 
Board monitors the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems 
and at least annually carries out a review of 
the effectiveness and reports on the 
review in the Annual Report.
The Audit Committee report on page 67 
and the risk report on pages 30 to 35 set 
out the position of the Board on the risk to 
the Company, internal controls and its’ 
prospects in relation to this.
Remuneration
The Directors’ Remuneration Report 
setting out the remuneration policy and 
its implementation this financial year is 
on page 72 to 85.
No Director is involved in the approval 
of his or her own remuneration.
Details of Directors’ contract terms are 
shown in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 77 and 79. In accordance with  
the Code, the Company has made the 
terms and conditions of appointment  
of the Non-Executive Directors available 
for inspection.
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of 
good two way communications between 
the Company and shareholders. 
Accordingly, the Board welcomes the 
opportunity to discuss the contents of this 
report with shareholders at the N Brown 
Group AGM, details of which are to follow.
Other matters

Report include additional information 
which forms part of the Corporate

The Committee met four times during the year and attendance 
was as follows:
Responsibilities
Reviewing the integrity of the financial statements, 
price sensitive financial releases and significant financial 
judgements and estimates relating thereto;
Monitoring the scope of work, quality, effectiveness 
and independence of the external auditors and approving 
their appointment and fees;
Monitoring and reviewing the independence and activities 
of the internal audit function;
Assisting the Board with the development and execution 
of a risk management strategy, risk policies and exposures 
and a risk register; 
Keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal financial controls and internal control 
and risk management systems; and
Making recommendations to the Board in relation 
to the appointment of the external auditor.
Dear Shareholder,
The Audit Committee acknowledges and embraces its role of 
protecting the interests of shareholders as regards the integrity 
of published financial information and the effectiveness of audit. 
In so doing, the Committee exercises oversight of the Group’s 
financial policies and reporting, monitors the integrity of the 
financial statements and reviews and considers significant 
financial and accounting estimates and judgements. The 
Committee satisfies itself that the disclosures in the financial 
statements about these estimates and judgements are 
appropriate and obtains from the external auditor an 
independent view of the key disclosure issues and risks.
In relation to risks and controls, the Committee ensures that 
these have been identified and that appropriate responsibilities 
and accountabilities have been set.
A key responsibility of the Committee is to review the scope 
of work undertaken by the internal and external auditors and 
to consider their effectiveness.
During the year, the Committee again oversaw the process 
used by the Board to assess the viability of the Group, the 
stress testing of key trading assumptions and the preparation 
of the viability statement which is set out on pages 62 to 63 
in the Directors’ Report.
The Committee has also considered the narrative at the front end 
of the Annual Report and believes that sufficient information has 
been provided to give shareholders a fair, balanced and 
understandable account of the Group’s business.
Further information on the Committee’s responsibilities and the 
manner in which they have been discharged is set out below.
I shall be available at the annual general meeting in July to answer 
any questions you may have on this report and would like to thank 
my colleagues on the Committee for their help and support 
during the year.

Governance uphold rate and average redress rates and consider the 
provisions recorded to be appropriate. A priority for 2017 was 
the oversight of more flexible and personalised financial services 
products. These remain under development and the Committee 
will carry this priority into 2018.
Capitalisation of software development costs 
The Group’s Fit 4 the Future programme is ongoing and the 
Committee will continue to review the treatment of the significant 
software and project costs in order to satisfy itself that the 
Group’s approach to capitalisation of these costs remains 
appropriate. In this regard, the Committee has been assisted 
by both internal and external audit.
Marketing costs
An objective for the Committee in 201 7 was the review of marketing 
investment. This responsibility was assumed by the Board.
Bad and doubtful debts
The Group’s methodology to determine provisions for bad 
and doubtful debts in its credit ledgers is both complex and 
judgemental. A significant part of the external audit is focused in 
this area and the Committee seeks assurance from the finance 
function and the auditors that the approach to provisioning is 
consistent year on year or, if not, that changes are being made to 
better reflect changing economic or commercial circumstances.
Tax exposures
The Group continues to have a number of open tax items with the 
tax authorities and the calculation of the Group’s potential liabilities 
or assets in respect of these continues to involve a degree of 
estimation and judgement. The Board sets and oversees the 
Group’s tax strategy including tax risk. In undertaking this task the 
Group uses its tax advisers (Deloitte) and legal counsel. During the 
year the Group’s tax advisers have kept the Committee appraised 
of existing and emerging risks, and the Committee and the Board 
have considered the appropriateness of related tax provisions and 
assets and their disclosure in the Group’s financial statements.
Inventory Valuation 
Provision is made where the net realisable value of stock is 
estimated to be lower than the cost. The Committee recognises 
that there is an element of uncertainty in relation to the 
estimation of net realisable value but considers that, taking into 
account historical experience, likely future selling values and the 
availability of disposal channels, the provision is appropriate.
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group 
maintains a sound system of internal control. There are inherent 
limitations in any system of internal control and no system can 
provide absolute assurance against material misstatements, loss 
or failure. Equally, no system can guarantee elimination of the risk 
of failure to meet the objectives of the business. Against this 
background, the Committee has helped the Board develop and 
maintain an approach to risk management which incorporates 
risk appetite, the framework within which risk is managed and 
the responsibilities and procedures pertaining to the application 
of the policy.
The Group is proactive in ensuring that corporate and operational 
risk are identified and managed. A corporate risk register is 
maintained which details:
1. The risks and impact they may have
2. Actions to mitigate
3. Risk scores to highlight the implications of occurrence
4.  Ownership
5. Target dates for actions to mitigate
Committee composition
The Committee comprises three members, each of whom is an 
independent Non-Executive Director. Two members constitute a 
quorum. The Committee requires the inclusion of one financially 
qualified member with recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Committee chair fulfils that requirement. All members are 
expected to have an understanding of financial reporting, the 
Group’s internal control environment, relevant corporate 
legislation, the roles and function of internal and external audit 
and the regulatory framework of the business. As reflected in the 
biographical details on pages 58 to 59 , the Committee members 
have significant experience of working in or with companies in 
the retail, financial services and consumer goods sectors.
The members of the Committee during the year were:
• Ron McMillan (Chair)
• Lesley Jones
• Fiona Laird (resigned 6 October 2016)
• Richard Moross (appointed 6 October 2016)
Details of Committee meetings and attendances are set out 
on page 67 and the timing of Committee meetings is set to 
accommodate the dates of releases of financial information 
and the approval of scope of and reviews of outputs from work 
programmes executed by the internal and external auditors. In 
addition to scheduled meetings, the chairman of the Committee 
met with the CFO, the head of internal audit and the external 
auditors on a number of occasions during the year.
Although not members of the Committee, Angela Spindler 
as CEO, Craig Lovelace as CFO, the General Counsel and 
representatives from the internal and external auditors attend 
all meetings and, in addition, the Chairman of the Board 
regularly attends meetings.
Committee activities in 2016/17
In discharging its oversight of the matters referred to in the 
introductory letter to this report and as set out below, the 
Committee was assisted by management, the General Counsel 
and the internal and external auditors.
The recurring work of the Committee comprised:
• Consideration of the Annual Report and financial statements 
of the Group;
• Consideration of the interim results report and non-statutory 
financial statements of the Group for the half year;
• Consideration of the significant areas of accounting 
estimation or judgement;
• Consideration of the significant risks included 
in the Annual Report;
• Approval of the external auditors’ terms of reference, 
audit plan and fees; and
• Approval of the internal audit plan.
The key matters considered by the Committee during 
the year include the following:
Regulatory environment
The Group is regulated by the FCA under a licence granted on 
21 September 2016. Changes in laws and regulations impact 
the Group’s business, sector and market and the Committee 
continues to review the outputs of work carried out by the 
Group’s compliance function in order to satisfy itself that action is 
being taken to address the changes that are required to comply 
with the regulations. Provisions made for customer redress 
require significant levels of estimation and judgement. The 
Committee has considered the assumptions applied in recording 
such provisions, including the complaint volume, complaint 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
68
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 During the year, the Committee received reports from internal 
audit on the following topics:
• Fit 4 the Future
• Outsourcing providers
• Stock audits
• Retail stores
• Employee expenses
• Business continuity plan
• PCI compliance
• FCA compliance
• Group imports
• Warehouse expansion 
project
• Risk management
• Fraud review
In relation to each of the above, internal audit made 
recommendations for improvements, the vast majority of 
which have been or are being implemented by management.
The Committee has evaluated the performance of internal audit 
and has concluded that it continues to provide helpful and 
constructive challenge to management and demonstrates a 
commercial and constructive view of the business.
External auditors
KPMG were appointed as external auditors on 14 July 2015. 
The partner who has been responsible for the audit since 
KPMG were appointed is Stuart Burdass, a partner in the 
Manchester office. The total fees paid to KPMG for the year 
ended 27 February 2017 were £430,000, of which £1 10,000 
was in respect of non-audit services. Further details are set 
out in note 6 to the financial statements.
The Board’s policy in relation to the auditors undertaking 
non-audit services is that they are subject to tender processes 
with the allocation of work being done on the basis of 
competence, cost effectiveness, regulatory requirements, 
potential conflicts of interest and knowledge of the Group’s 
business. KPMG LLP has, during the year provided non-audit 
services in the form of pensions advisory work (a project which 
commenced before they were appointed as auditors). 
The Committee is satisfied that, in relation to these services, 
KPMG LLP has taken actions to ensure that any potential 
conflicts of interest are properly managed.
The Committee remains mindful of the attitude investors have 
towards the auditors performing non-audit services and the new 
legislation which is operative for accounting periods beginning on 
or after 17 June 2016. This new legislation introduces a permitted 
non-audit services fee cap of 70% of the average audit fee over a 
consecutive three year period. This cap will come into affect for 
the Group in the financial year ending February 2021.
The Committee has reviewed the performance of KPMG, 
a process which involved Committee members, the Chairman, 
the CEO, the CFO and senior members of the finance function 
and the General Counsel.
The overall conclusion of the process was that KPMG’s work was 
thorough and professional and it was, therefore, the Committee’s 
recommendation that the reappointment of KPMG be put to 
shareholders at the annual general meeting on 18 July 2017 . 
Given that this was only the second year of KPMG’s tenure as 
auditors, the Board has no present plans to consider an audit 
tender process.
The Committee reviewed the reports prepared by KPMG on 
key audit findings and the control environment, as well as the 
recommendations made by KPMG to improve processes and 
controls together with management’s responses to those 
recommendations. 
A description of the principal risks is set out on pages 30 to 35. 
The Board has confirmed that it has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those which threaten its business model, future performance, 
insolvency or liquidity.
The Board considers that the processes undertaken by the 
Committee are appropriately robust, effective and in compliance 
with the guidelines issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
During the year, the Board has not been advised by the 
Committee, nor has it identified itself, any failings, frauds or 
weaknesses in internal control which it has determined to be 
material in the context of the financial statements.
The Committee continues to believe that appropriate controls 
are in place throughout the Group, that the Group has a 
well-defined organisational structure with clear lines of 
responsibility and a comprehensive financial reporting system. 
The Committee also believes that the Company complies with 
the FRC guidance on risk management, internal control and 
related financial business reporting.
Going concern
The Committee considered the going concern position 
of the Group and the viability statement set out on page 62. 
In so doing, the Committee ensured that the assumptions 
underpinning forecasts were stress tested and that the factors 
which impact risks and uncertainties were properly considered.
Other activities
During the year, the Committee also received policy papers 
on anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and corruption, fraud 
and whistleblowing.
Reviewing the draft interim and Annual Reports
The Committee considered in particular the following:
• The accounting principals, policies and practices adopted 
and the adequacy of related disclosures in the reports;
• The significant accounting issues, estimates and judgements 
of management in relation to financial reporting;
• Whether any significant adjustments were required 
as a result of the audit;
• Compliance with statutory tax obligations and the 
Group’s tax policy;
• Whether the information set out in the Strategic Report 
was balanced, comprehensive, clear and concise and covered 
both positive and negative aspects of performance; and
• Whether the use of ‘alternative performance measures’ 
observed IFRS measures.
Internal audit
The head of internal audit has a direct reporting line to the 
Committee and attends all Committee meetings. During the 
year, internal audit undertook a programme of work which 
was discussed with and agreed by both management and the 
Committee and which was designed to address both risk 
management and areas of potential financial loss. Internal audit 
also has established procedures within the business to ensure 
that new risks are identified, evaluated and managed and that 
necessary changes are made to the risk register.

Identifying and nominating a suitable candidate 
to replace Fiona Laird.
Dear Shareholder,
The objectives of the Committee are to ensure the Board 
comprises individuals possessing the requisite skills, knowledge 
and experience and to review and make recommendations to the 
Board to ensure that the Company’s arrangements are consistent 
with best practice corporate governance standards.
The Nomination and Governance Committee was chaired by me 
throughout the year since the resignation of Simon Patterson on 
13 April 2016. The other members of the Committee are currently 
Andrew Higginson, Lesley Jones and Ron McMillan. 
The formal terms of reference for this Committee require it to 
make recommendations to the Board for appointments of 
Directors including, when appropriate, the Chair of the Board and 
also Directors of the Operating Board and other senior executive 
staff of the operating company. Where appropriate, the Chief 
Executive and Company Secretary are invited to attend meetings 
of the Committee.
During the year the Committee met on one occasion with full 
attendance by all members. Activities undertaken during the 
year included a review of the Committee’s terms of reference, 
the company’s succession planning, recruitment of a new 
Non-Executive Director and a Board evaluation.
The Committee evaluates Board candidates on merit, against 
objective criteria, taking into account the skills and experience 
required to perform the duties of the post with due regard to 
diversity and gender. Where appropriate, external search 
consultants are engaged.
This year we are delighted to have recruited Richard Moross in 
the position of independent Non-Executive Director. Richard 
brings with him specialist skills in digital retailing which I believe 
will be invaluable to the Board.
MWM Consulting LLP (‘MWM’) were appointed by the 
Committee as external agents to assist in the discharge of its 
duties and assisted the Committee with a comprehensive 
external candidate search and selection process to find a suitable 
replacement independent Director with the appropriate mix 
of skills and experience. MWM has no other connection with 
the Company.
As has been mentioned earlier in the Annual Report I will be 
resigning from the Committee and the Board as soon as a 
suitable replacement has been found. 
Ivan Fallon will also be leaving the Board in July as he will not be 
seeking re-election at the 2017 AGM.
Consultants have been engaged to commence the process for 
my replacement. As Ivan Fallon is not considered independent 
no replacement for him will be sought.
The new Chair of the Nomination and Governance Committee, 
Lesley Jones, will report on this in more detail in the next 
Annual Report.

with the community and our employees; and
Updating shareholders or a wider audience as necessary 
on the work of the Committee.
Priorities for 2018
Introducing and overseeing the effectiveness 
of the new 3 year CSR strategy.
Overseeing the implementation of the 
Gender Pay Gap reporting.
Monitoring the delivery of ethical trading.
Dear Shareholder,
The Committee has enjoyed another busy and productive year.
We successfully launched the Group’s CSR Charter in 2015 to 
highlight our passion for fair fashion, entitled ‘Taking Care of 
Our World’. The Charter is designed to align with and implement 
our three CSR pillars of ‘All People, One Planet, Every Product’.  
We are delighted to report that progress is in line with our 
expectations. Further detail on this is available in the CSR report 
on page 46.
The Committee’s oversight of the Group’s CSR activities has 
encouraged further alignment of our ethical policies with our 
commercial with tangible results and benefits.
As is expected of a CSR Committee we continue to be involved 
in a wide range of issues touching every area of the business. 
Over the year the Committee has discussed modern slavery, 
charity engagement, anti-bribery and corruption, living wage 
and set new environmental targets amongst many others. 
Our Modern Slavery statement was published in October and we 
intend to build on this year on year to further reduce the risk of 
slavery in our supply chain. The revised version of the statement 
will be released in October providing an update on the actions 
and initiatives we have in place to combat the risk of slavery in our 
supply chain.
This year we refreshed the membership of the Committee. 
In April 2016, we welcomed Ian Carr, Ralph Tucker and Tanya 
McCartney to report on Planet, Product and People respectively. 
In addition, Theresa Casey has been appointed the Group Head 
of CSR and oversees operational progress on CSR matters.
There will be further changes in the coming months and I wish the 
Committee the best of luck with their endeavours.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for 2016/17 on behalf of the Board and to summarise the 
Remuneration Committee’s main activities during the year.
This report contains the following parts:
• This ‘Annual Statement’, which identifies the key messages 
on remuneration for the year under review and explains the 
business context in which the Committee’s major decisions 
during the period were taken;
• An ‘Annual Report on Remuneration’, which provides 
shareholders with details of the remuneration that was actually 
delivered to the Company’s Directors during 2016/17 . This final 
part of the report will be subject to an advisory vote at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting; and
• The ‘Directors’ Remuneration Policy’ which was approved by 
shareholders at the 2016 AGM and is included in this reports 
for ease of reference.
The Group has undergone significant transformation and is keen 
to ensure that the incentive arrangements remain appropriate. 
The changes proposed last year were approved by shareholders 
at the 2016 AGM and have therefore been implemented during 
this financial year.
The Board believes that maintaining the highest standards of 
corporate governance is essential to protecting shareholder 
value; the alignment of remuneration with the forward looking 
business strategy is an integral part of this process. As such the 
Board fully debated and approved any payments or awards made 
to Directors to ensure that the incentive plans in place 
appropriately reward the delivery of our transformation plan 
whilst ensuring alignment with shareholders. We also consulted 
with our top ten shareholders and investor bodies on the change 
and took on board the feedback.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Remuneration outcomes for 2016/17
Annual bonus is paid 60% in cash and 40% deferred as a 
conditional award of shares that vest at the end of three years 
after the grant. The principal performance metric for the normal 
annual bonus was based on Group profit. The Committee 
determined that 43% of this element of the annual bonus targets 
had been met. The remainder of the normal annual bonus 
was based on meeting corporate and personal objectives 
and the Committee determined that 63. 18% of salary was 
payable to the CEO and 54.53% of salary was payable to the 
Chief Financial Officer.
The Committee reviewed the EPS and TSR performance of the 
Company in respect of the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
award. The Company was ranked below median against its peers 
at the end of the three year performance period and did not 
meet the threshold EPS targets, as a result of which the 
award lapsed.
Upon her appointment the CEO was granted two one-off share 
awards as detailed in the 2013 Annual Report. Vesting of the first, 
over shares worth £520,000 at the time of grant, was subject to 
employment conditions over two years which were met in the 
prior year. 
Vesting of the second award over shares worth £1,040,000 
at the time of grant, was subject to the achievement of strategic 
objectives measured over a period of three years as detailed in 
our 2015 Annual Report, which were met in the year.
The Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors 
in April 2017 and determined that the CEO and the Chief 
Financial Officer’s salaries should be increased by 2%, in line  
with the average increase received by the general workforce,  
with effect from 1 June 2017 . 
LTIP awards with a face value of 150% of salary in respect of 
Angela Spindler and 125% of salary in respect of Craig Lovelace 
were granted in July 2016. Vesting of these awards is subject to 
growth in adjusted EPS in excess of RPI (50% weighting), free cash 
flow (30%) and revenue (20%). In 2017 Angela Spindler and Craig 
Lovelace will again receive awards with a face value of 150% and 
125% of salary respectively. The award will be granted in July 2017 
and will be subject to the performance conditions set out above.
I will be available to answer any questions at the annual general 
meeting in July and very much hope that you will support the 
Annual Report on Remuneration at our forthcoming meeting.
I would like to thank all of my colleagues on the Remuneration 
Committee for all their hard work over the last year.
I am delighted with and proud of the progress the Committee 
has made during the last four years and I will be handing over 
the reigns to my successor in due course.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This report sets out the information required by Part 4 of the 
Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended. 
The report also satisfies the relevant requirements of the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, and describes how the 
Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions 
relating to Directors’ remuneration in the Code.
It summarises the Committee’s remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors which was approved by shareholders at 
the 2016 AGM and is binding for three years. The full Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, approved for three years from 2016 AGM,  
is shown on the following pages for ease of reference. Please note 
that the information shown has been updated to take account of the 
fact that policy is now approved and enacted rather than proposed.
The Committee’s policy is designed to ensure that the main 
elements of the remuneration package are linked to the 
Company’s annual and long-term strategy, are appropriate in 
quantum and capable of attracting, motivating and retaining 
Executive Directors. The policy aims to reward Executive 
Directors and senior Executives by offering them competitive 
remuneration packages, which are prudently constructed, 
sufficiently stretching and linked to long-term profitability 
and which do not encourage excessive risk taking.
In particular, the Committee strives to ensure that remuneration 
packages are:
• aligned with the Group’s strategic plan;
• aligned with shareholders’ interests;
• measured against stretching targets, both in absolute 
and relative terms;
• competitive and sufficiently flexible to support the recruitment 
needs of the business;
• paid in a combination of cash and shares; and
• linked to performance measured over annual and three-year 
performance periods.

Governance Summary of components of Executive Directors’ remuneration
The table below summarises the Committee’s policy for the main components of remuneration.
ELEMENT
PURPOSE AND 
LINK TO STRATEGY OPERATION MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
Salary Reflects the performance 
of the individual, their skills  
and experience, and the 
responsibilities of the role.
Provides an appropriate level  
of basic fixed income.
Reviewed annually, taking 
account of absolute Group 
profitability and performance 
against personal and corporate 
objectives.
Set with reference to the levels 
of base salary for similar 
positions with comparable 
status, responsibility and skills 
in competitor organisations  
of comparable size and 
complexity, in particular those 
in the home shopping and 
retail market sectors.
When reviewing salary 
increases the Committee takes 
into account the impact of any 
increase to base salaries on the 
total remuneration package.
Any changes normally take 
effect from 1 June.
Salary increases will normally 
be in line with increases 
awarded to other employees 
of the Group.
More significant increases may 
be awarded at the discretion 
of the Committee, for example: 
where there is a change in 
responsibilities or scope of 
the role; to reflect individual 
development and performance 
in the role (e.g. for recent hires); 
or in exceptional circumstances.
None, although overall 
individual performance is 
a factor considered when 
setting and reviewing salaries.
Annual bonus Drives and rewards annual 
delivery of financial, corporate 
and personal goals.
Annual performance targets 
are aligned to the long-term 
strategic KPIs of the Company 
and aimed at increasing 
shareholder value, whilst being 
prudent and safeguarding the 
future of the Company.
Deferral provides alignment 
with shareholders and assists 
with retention.
Targets are reviewed annually 
to ensure that they are 
appropriate to the current 
market conditions, the 
long-term strategy of the 
Company and that they 
continue to remain stretching 
and challenging.
Bonuses will be paid 60% in 
cash, with 40% deferred as a 
conditional award of shares.
Vesting of future deferred 
shares is at the end of three 
years from the award of the 
bonus, subject to continued 
employment (save in ‘good 
leaver’ scenarios).
The payment of any earned 
bonus remains ultimately at the 
discretion of the Committee.
Executives may also be 
entitled to receive dividends 
equivalents on vested shares.
Chief Executive: 
up to 150% of base salary p.a.
Other Executive Directors: 
up to 125% of base salary p.a.
A significant majority of the 
annual bonus will normally be 
determined by reference to 
performance against stretching 
Group profit measures.
Additional targets linked to 
corporate performance and 
individual targets will be applied.
Personal objectives will be 
measurable and linked to goals 
that are consistent with the 
Group’s longer-term goals.
Performance below threshold 
results in zero payment.
Payment rises from 0% to 100% 
of the maximum opportunity for 
levels of performance between 
threshold and maximum, with 
50% of the maximum normally 
payable for on-target 
performance.
Includes a ‘clawback’ 
mechanism in the event of 
material misstatement of the 
Group’s financial results or 
individual misconduct.

Long-term 
incentive  
plan ‘LTIP’.
Provides appropriate incentives 
to reward sustained success 
through the achievement of 
challenging business targets, 
thereby aligning the interests 
of shareholders and Executives.
Annual grants of performance 
shares which vest, subject to 
the Group’s performance, 
measured over three years.
Participation and all awards 
are subject to the discretions 
given to the Committee in the 
plan rules.
Executives may also receive 
dividend equivalents on 
vested shares.
The Committee retains the 
discretion to subject the LTIP 
awards to a holding period of 
up to two years post vesting.
Normal maximum of 
150% of salary.
Exceptional circumstances 
maximum of 200% of salary.
The performance conditions 
for awards granted from 
2016/17 onwards will be split 
between growth in adjusted 
EPS in excess of RPI (50% of the 
award), free cash flow (30% of 
the award) and revenue (20% of 
the award). The Committee will 
have the discretion to change 
the weightings of measures,  
or use different measures for 
subsequent awards so that 
they are directly aligned with 
the Group’s strategic objectives 
for each performance period.
Targets are set by the 
Remuneration Committee prior 
to each grant and will be based 
on a sliding scale. For each 
measure, performance below 
threshold results in zero 
payment. Payment rises from 
25% at threshold to 100% of 
the maximum opportunity at  
a maximum performance level.
Includes a ‘clawback’ 
mechanism in the event of a 
material misstatement of the 
Group’s financial results or 
individual misconduct.
All-employee 
share schemes 
(SAYE and SIP)
All employees, including 
Executives, are able to acquire 
shares by participating in the 
Group’s all-employee share 
plan at the discretion of 
the Committee.
The Group operates an HM 
Revenue & Customs approved 
savings related share option 
scheme for the benefit of 
Group employees provided 
that they have completed at 
least six months’ service. 
Participation in the SIP may 
also be offered.
The plans are subject to 
statutory individual limits as 
amended from time-to-time 
or such lower limits as set by 
the Group.
These are broad based plans 
and are not subject to 
performance targets.
Pension Provides retirement benefits 
that reward sustained 
contribution.
The Company operates a 
defined contribution plan and 
may also provide cash pension 
contributions or cash 
supplements in lieu.
Up to 15% of salary as a 
Company contribution to a 
defined contribution pension 
scheme and/or as a cash 
allowance.

Other  
benefits
Provides a competitive package 
of benefits that assists with 
recruitment and retention.
Main benefits currently include 
private medical insurance and 
a car allowance. Executive 
Directors are eligible for other 
benefits which are introduced 
for the wider workforce on 
broadly similar terms.
Any reasonable business related 
expenses (including tax thereon) 
can be reimbursed if determined 
to be a taxable benefit.
Car and fuel allowance up 
to £20,000 per annum.
Other benefits will be in line 
with market. The value of each 
benefit is based on the cost to 
the Company and is not 
predetermined.

Notes:
1  A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2017/18 is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
2  The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and other senior Executives is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole. However, there are 
some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for senior Executives. In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market 
competitive for the various categories of individuals. They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the Executive Directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed 
on performance-related pay in the market.
3  All-employee share plans do not have performance conditions. Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE and SIP on the same terms as other employees.
4  Copies of the LTIP rules are available on request from the Company Secretary.
5  LTIP awards granted prior to 2014 and LTIP awards prior to 2017 are subject to performance conditions described in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
6  The Company also operates share ownership guidelines requiring Executive Directors to acquire and hold a specified level of shareholding. The current level of holding expected 
under the guidelines is described in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
7  Awards may be structured as nil cost options, conditional awards of shares and may be delivered through a Joint Share Ownership Plan structure.
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 75
Governance How employees’ pay is taken into account
The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed 
with regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a 
whole. The Company’s ability to meet growth expectations and 
compete effectively is dependent on the skills, experience and 
performance of all of our employees. As a result, our employment 
policies, remuneration and benefit packages for employees are 
regularly reviewed. Whilst there are some differences in the 
structure of the remuneration policy, these reflect individuals’ 
differing responsibilities, with the principal difference being the 
increased emphasis on performance related pay for the more 
senior Executives within the organisation.
Although the Committee does not consult directly with 
employees on Directors’ pay, the Committee does take into 
consideration the pay and employment conditions of all 
employees when setting the policy for Directors’ remuneration. 
The Committee is also mindful of any changes to the pay and 
benefit conditions for employees more generally when 
considering the policy for Directors’ pay.
Committee discretions
The Committee operates the Group’s variable incentive plans 
according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC 
rules where relevant. To ensure the efficient administration of 
these plans and to be consistent with market practice, the 
Committee will retain certain operational discretions. 
These include:
• selecting plan participants;
• determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payment;
• determining the quantum of awards and/or payments 
(within the limits set out in the policy table above);
• determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment 
of performance;
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. change of control, rights issues, corporate 
restructuring events, and special dividends);
• determining ‘good leaver’ status for incentive plan purposes 
and applying the appropriate treatment; and
• undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance 
measures, and setting targets for the annual bonus plan and 
LTIP from year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the Annual Bonus Plan, 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan or LTIP performance conditions and/
or targets being deemed no longer appropriate (e.g. a material 
acquisition or divestment), the Committee will have the ability to 
adjust appropriately the measures and/or targets and alter 
weightings, provided that the revised conditions or targets are 
not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be 
explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as 
appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s 
major shareholders.
Legacy arrangements
In approving the remuneration policy, authority is given to the 
Company to honour any commitments previously entered into 
with the current or former Directors in accordance with the relevant 
plan rules, where applicable. It is also part of this policy that the 
Company will honour payments or awards crystallising after the 
effective date of this policy but arising from commitments entered 
into at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the 
Company. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set 
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Selection of performance metrics and targets
All incentives are subject to the individual review and scrutiny 
of the Committee, particularly in the case of share incentives, 
both at award and vesting to ensure that performance has been 
correctly adjudicated and to safeguard against excessive overall 
reward. Variable pay and remuneration is linked to both corporate 
and individual performance and is benchmarked to attract and 
retain the highest quality people.
The annual bonus is designed to thoroughly stretch the 
performance of the Executive and is linked to absolute growth in 
annual Group profit, the achievement of certain business targets 
and of personal objectives. These targets are reviewed and 
agreed by the Committee at the beginning of each financial year 
to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market 
conditions and the long-term strategy of the Company, and that 
they continue to remain stretching and challenging. The targets 
are linked to KPIs which are drawn from, and relate to, the 
achievement of ‘milestones’ contained in the Company’s strategic 
long-term plan. This ensures they are aligned to the strategic 
objectives of the Company and designed to increase shareholder 
value, whilst being prudent and safeguarding the long-term 
future of the Company.
For 2017 , the Committee has decided to maintain a condition 
based on growth in adjusted EPS, free cash flow and revenue 
measures for the LTIP . Adjusted EPS is considered appropriate as 
it is easily understood, is a key measure of financial performance 
and closely aligned to the Company’s objective of driving 
profitable growth. The measure takes account of fair value 
adjustments to financial instruments (net of tax) as well as other 
non-recurring exceptional items such as unplanned investments 
in IT infrastructure, acquisitions and/or disposals. As the targets 
are set as a rate of growth in excess of RPI it also takes into 
account inflation. The free cash flow measure is defined as cash 
flow generated from operations excluding receivables and is seen 
as a key measure for N Brown to monitor the flows of cash in and 
out of the business as well as providing an assessment of 
underlying profitability. Revenue is a critical KPI for the business 
and management have clear line of sight over this measure and 
given that earnings measures make up the majority of the plan, 
there is an appropriate balance to encourage revenue growth 
whilst maintaining margin. The Committee retains the discretion 
to change the performance measures to reflect its strategy.
The Committee considers the Group’s performance on 
environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) issues when setting 
the remuneration of any Executive Director and is of the opinion 
that the incentive arrangements for senior managers do not raise 
ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour or 
the taking of undue risks with the business.
Shareholding guidelines
It is the Board’s policy that Executive Directors build and retain a 
minimum shareholding in the Company. Under these guidelines 
the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer are 
respectively required to hold Company shares equal in value 
(at the time of acquisition) to 200% and 100% of their base salary, 
respectively, and to have met this guideline within five years 
of appointment.
Details of the current shareholdings of the Executive Directors are 
provided later in this report.

How shareholders’ views are taken into account
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received 
regarding the Directors’ Remuneration Report and guidance 
from shareholder representative bodies more generally. 
As appropriate, the Committee also seeks feedback from 
shareholders on specific matters. These views are key 
inputs when shaping remuneration policy.
In developing the changes proposed to the policy last year, 
the Committee engaged with its major shareholders and 
representative bodies and took their opinions into consideration.
Executive Directors’ service agreements 
and termination policy
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have 
contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of 
12 months’ notice.
The policy is that the Company does not make payments beyond 
its contractual obligations on termination. In addition, Executive 
Directors are expected to mitigate their loss or, within existing 
contractual constraints, accept phased payments. The 
Committee seeks to ensure that there are no unjustified 
payments for failure. Neither of the Executive Directors’ contracts 
provides for liquidated damages. There are no special provisions 
contained in any of the Executive Directors’ contracts that 
provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the 
Company. Furthermore, there are no special provisions providing 
for additional compensation on an Executive Director’s cessation 
of employment with the Company. Where the Director may be 
entitled to pursue a legal claim, the Company will be entitled to 
negotiate settlement terms that the Committee considers to be 
in the best interests of the Company and to enter into a 
settlement agreement to effect the terms agreed under the 
service contract and any additional statutory or other claims. 
The Committee may pay reasonable outplacement and legal 
fees where considered appropriate. 
Name Date of contract Potential termination payment
Angela Spindler 1 July 2013
12 months’ salary  
and benefits
Craig Lovelace 6 January 2015
12 months’ salary  
and benefits
Assumptions:
1  Fixed pay = salary to be paid in year, benefits and pension provision.
2  On target = fixed pay plus target annual bonus (50% of the maximum) of 75% 
of salary for the Chief Executive and 62.5% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer 
plus target LTIP awards of 37.5% of salary for the Chief Executive and 31.25% for 
the Chief Financial Officer.
3  Maximum = fixed pay plus maximum annual bonus of 150% of salary for the Chief 
Executive and 125% for the Chief Financial Officer plus maximum LTIP awards of 150% 
of salary for the Chief Executive and 125% for the Chief Financial Officer.
4  Salary levels (on which other elements of the packages are calculated) are based on 
those effective from 1 March 2016 (£543,660 for the Chief Executive and £342,720 
for the Chief Financial Officer).
5  The value of taxable benefits is based on an estimated cost of £19,000 in respect 
of the Chief Executive and £18,000 for the Chief Financial Officer and includes 
a car allowance and health insurance.
6  Pension provision is 15% of salary for the Chief Executive and 10% for the 
Chief Financial Officer.
Other than in certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances (including, 
but not limited to, redundancy, ill-health or retirement or on a 
change of control), no bonus would be payable unless the 
individual remains employed and is not under notice at the 
payment date. Any bonuses paid to a ‘good leaver’ would be 
based on an assessment of their individual and the Company’s 
performance over the period, and normally pro-rated for the 
proportion of the bonus year worked.
Deferred bonus share awards will also normally lapse on cessation 
of employment, unless the Executive Director is deemed to be a 
‘good leaver’ by the Committee. Awards will vest early on a 
change of control subject to the plan rules.
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 77
Governance With regards to long-term incentive awards, the LTIP rules 
provide that other than in certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances, 
awards lapse on cessation of employment. Where an individual is 
a ‘good leaver’, the Committee’s policy for future LTIP awards will 
be to permit awards to remain outstanding until the end of the 
original performance period, when a pro-rata reduction will be 
made to take account of the proportion of the vesting period that 
elapsed prior to termination of employment, although the 
Committee has discretion to partly or completely disapply 
pro-rating in certain circumstances. On a change of control 
awards would vest, subject to the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been achieved and, normally, 
pro-rating for time. The Committee has discretion to determine 
‘good leaver’ treatment. In doing so, it will take account of the 
reason for their departure and the performance of the individual.
For awards granted under the LTIP , awards lapse if cessation 
occurs during the financial year in which an award is granted. 
Thereafter awards held by good leavers may vest subject to 
performance without pro-rating. On a change of control existing 
awards would not be pro-rated.
Apart from service contracts, no Executive Director has 
any material interest in any contract with the Company or 
its subsidiaries.
Copies of Executive Directors’ service contracts (and also 
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment) are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office on application 
to the Company Secretary.
Recruitment of Executive Directors
Base salary levels will be set in accordance with the Company’s 
remuneration policy, taking account of the Executive’s skills, 
experience and their current remuneration package. Where 
it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of above 
inflation increases to the desired salary positioning may be 
given over subsequent years subject to individual and 
Company performance.
Benefits and pension will generally be provided in accordance 
with the approved policy, with relocation expenses and/or an 
expatriate allowance paid for if necessary. For an overseas 
appointment, the benefit and pension arrangements may be 
tailored to reflect local market practice (subject to the overall 
maximum limits set out in the policy table). Assistance with 
relocation may be provided where appropriate. Tax equalisation 
may also be considered as may payment of the Executive’s legal 
fees in connection with the appointment.
The variable pay opportunity will be in accordance with the 
Company’s approved policy as detailed above. However, 
different performance measures and targets may be set for the 
first year in the case of the annual bonus and long-term incentives 
taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the 
point in the financial year at which they joined. A new employee 
may be granted normal annual share awards in the first year of 
employment in addition to any awards made with respect to 
prior employment being forfeited. Such awards would normally 
be made shortly following an appointment (assuming the 
Company is not in a close period).
If it is necessary to buy-out incentive pay, which would be 
forfeited by reason of leaving the previous employer, in order to 
secure the appointment, this would be provided for taking into 
account the form (cash or shares), timing and expected value 
(i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria) of the 
remuneration being forfeited and such other specific matters as it 
considers relevant. Existing arrangements may be bought out on 
terms that are no more favourable than the Committee considers 
is required to provide reasonable compensation to the incoming 
Director for the awards they will be losing. Existing plans will be 
used to the extent possible (subject to the exceptional limits 
contained in the plan rules), however, the Committee retains 
discretion to agree bespoke arrangements and, if required, to 
make use of the flexibility provided by the Listing Rules to make 
awards without prior shareholder approval when buying out 
existing entitlements. The service contract for a new appointment 
would be in accordance with the policy for the current 
Executive Directors.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay 
awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be set in 
line with the approved policy.

ASSESSMENT
Non-Executive 
Directors’ and 
Chairman’s 
fees
Takes account of recognised 
practice and set at a level that is 
sufficient to attract and retain 
high-calibre Non-Executives.
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of 
engagement and their remuneration is determined by the 
Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association 
and based on independent surveys of fees paid to 
Non-Executive Directors of similar companies.
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all his responsibilities.
The Non-Executives are paid a basic fee. The Chairs of 
Committee and Senior Independent Director receive 
additional fees to reflect their extra responsibilities.
Non-Executive Directors may not participate in any of 
the Company’s share incentive schemes or performance-
based plans and are not eligible to join the Company’s 
pension scheme.
Any reasonable business related expenses (including 
tax thereon) can be reimbursed if determined to be a 
taxable benefit and limited benefits relating to travel, 
accommodation, secretarial support and hospitality 
provided in relation to the performance of their duties.
When reviewing fee levels, account is taken of market 
movements in Non-Executive Director fees, Board 
Committee responsibilities, ongoing time commitments, 
the general economic environment and the level of 
increases awarded to the wider workforce.
In exceptional circumstances, additional fees may be 
paid where there is a substantial increase in the time 
commitment required of Non-Executive Directors.
If there is a temporary yet material increase in the time 
commitment required of Non-Executive Directors, the 
Board may pay additional fees on a pro-rata basis to 
recognise the additional workload.
N/A. N/A.
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
Non-Executive Directors are retained on letters of appointment. Other than the Chairman and Lord Alliance, whose letters of 
appointment provide for six months notice in the event of early termination, all Non-Executive appointments are on three-year rolling 
terms terminable upon three months’ notice. All appointments are subject to successful re-election upon retirement at the annual 
general meeting. Termination carries no right to compensation other than that provided by general law.

Members of the Remuneration Committee 
Name From To
Fiona Laird (Chair) 1 April 2013 To date

Company to be independent. The Committee has formal written terms of reference which are available for shareholders to inspect 
and on the corporate website. The Committee met twice during the year. See page 72 for details of attendance.
Advisers
The Committee received advice from New Bridge Street (part of Aon plc). New Bridge Street was formally appointed by 
the Committee. 
New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct, which sets out guidelines to ensure that 
its advice is independent and free from undue influence. The Group received no other services from New Bridge Street or any other 
part of the Aon group of companies, during the year. The fees paid to New Bridge Street in 2016/17 were £25,964 (2015/16: £40,512). 
The Committee reviews the performance and independence of its advisers on an annual basis and is satisfied that the advice received 
is objective and independent.
The advisers’ terms of engagement are available on request from the Company Secretary.
Consideration of matters
The Remuneration Committee has considered a number of factors when determining the application of the Remuneration Policy 
including the average pay increases for the general workforce, market conditions and achievement of objectives.

2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement, in decreasing order of audit 
significance, that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows (unchanged from 2016):

The allowance for doubtful debts requires the Directors 
to assess which accounts are considered impaired and 
estimate the quantum of the associated impairment. 
This assessment is particularly judgmental in the case 
of customers in early arrears or under revised payment 
terms. A proportion of the Group’s customers are 
subject to revised payment terms, in particular where 
interest has been temporarily waived, which makes the 
impact of this judgment more significant for N Brown.
The Group has segmented the debtors book into 
accounts that are interest bearing and those that are 
not, which allows for a degree of granularity when 
applying the other key judgements, which are the 
probability of default and the timing and value of 
cash flows.
To assess the probability of default, the Group 
estimates a customer’s likelihood of entering default 
based upon the experience of customers with 
comparable characteristics such as arrears status 
and payment history. These estimates are inherently 
uncertain because they are reliant upon historical, 
non-predictive data and are impacted by the Group’s 
segmentation of customers with comparable 
impairment characteristics.
The expected loss on default of receivables is based on 
expected timing and value of cash flows which are 
estimated using historical cash receipts and write-offs 
incurred for customers with comparable arrears status 
and payment history, interest and fees charged and 
debt sale rates. These estimates are inherently 
uncertain because of the long-term nature of the cash 
receipts and the exposure of the portfolio to the credit 
performance of many individual customers.
Due to the quantity of data involved in assessing all of 
these elements of the provision, it is a complex model for 
which the completeness and accuracy of data inputs and 
the accuracy of calculations are, in themselves, risks.
Our audit procedures included:
We critically assessed the Group’s definition of ‘Objective 
evidence of impairment’ of customer receivables against the 
requirements of the relevant accounting standards, including 
evidence of the Group’s experience of customers with 
comparable characteristics.
We compared the assumptions made in respect of the 
probabilities of default against our understanding of the 
Group as well as our knowledge of market counterparts, 
and consistency with the historical internal data available.
We assessed and challenged the assumptions made in respect 
of timing and value of cash flows for all segments of the model 
(including customers in arrears and subject to revised payment 
terms) against historical internal data taking into account 
information from peers and knowledge of the industry. 
We obtained supporting evidence relating to the quantum 
of debt sales in the year and critically assessed if the debt 
sales supported management estimates for future cash 
flows and recoveries.
We assessed the accuracy of the allowance for doubtful 
debts model, with assistance from our IT specialists, by 
reviewing the detail of the model, and compared the 
methodology used to our interpretation of the requirements 
of the relevant accounting standards. This included testing of 
the completeness and accuracy of data through testing a 
sample of customer data back to the source system. 
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in relation to the allowance for doubtful debts for compliance 
with the relevant accounting policies.

The outcome of a number of open VAT and corporation 
taxation positions, some of which are proceeding 
towards litigation, is uncertain and as such has required 
the Directors to make significant judgements and 
estimates in relation to the likely outcome of these 
tax issues and exposures. There is a risk that the 
judgements made by the Directors, and therefore the 
amounts recorded in the financial statements will differ 
from any final settlements agreed with HMRC. Given 
the significant value and judgmental nature of this 
provisioning, this is considered to be an area of 
significant audit risk.
Our audit procedures included, with assistance from our 
own tax specialists:
• Analysing and challenging the assumptions applied by 
the Directors’ to determine tax provisions. 
• Inspecting correspondence with HMRC and evaluating the 
Directors interpretation of this correspondence by forming 
our own expectations of the provisions required in the 
financial statements. 
These assessments were based on our knowledge of the 
business and experience of the industry in which it operates, 
together with our knowledge and experience of the 
application of the relevant legislation by authorities and courts. 
Specifically in relation to VAT, we inspected legal counsel 
opinion received by the Directors in relation to the Group’s 
likelihood of success in each of the open VAT exposures and 
critically assessing whether amounts recorded in the financial 
statements were consistent with this legal opinion.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in relation to Taxation provisions for compliance with the 
relevant accounting policies. 
Carrying value 
of software 
and development 
costs under 
the course of 
construction: 
£83.4m 
(2016: £51.2m)
Risk vs 2016
Refer to page 68 
(Audit Committee 
Report), 
pages 95 and 99 
(accounting policy), 
page 106 (financial 
disclosures).
The Group has incurred significant software and 
development project costs in the year in respect of the 
Fit 4 the Future project, a significant systems 
infrastructure programme. The Group capitalises both 
internal and external eligible costs to the extent that 
future economic benefits are expected to be generated 
by the project. This requires judgement as to whether 
the costs incurred are directly attributable and 
incremental, and that the development relates to 
technically feasible systems and websites. Given the 
significant value and judgemental nature of the 
classification of software and development assets, 
between operational and capital expenditure, this is 
considered to be an area of significant audit risk.
Furthermore, assets under the course of construction 
are not subject to amortisation and as such are required 
to be tested for impairment annually. Assessing 
recoverability of these assets is based on forecasting 
and discounting future cash flows, which are themselves 
inherently highly judgemental.
Our audit procedures included comparing a statistical 
sample of costs capitalised to external invoices or internal 
timesheets, determining the nature of the expenses to 
assess whether costs are appropriately capitalised, by 
reference to the recognition criteria of the applicable 
accounting standards.
With assistance from our own IT specialists, we challenged 
the group’s assessment of the technical feasibility of the 
different project releases based on our discussions with key 
project leads and reviews of detailed business cases and 
project plans produced internally, outlining the proposed 
features and expected completion dates.
We challenged the group’s assessment of impairment 
indicators based on our understanding of project progress 
and performance to date obtained from our other 
audit procedures.
We critically assessed the key inputs into the Group’s cash flow 
forecasts, used as a basis for determining the Value in Use of 
the cash generating unit to which the asset was allocated, 
specifically revenue growth, cost reduction, discount rate and 
the timing and amount of capital expenditure. This assessment 
was performed with reference to Board-approved forecasts 
and knowledge gained from performing our other audit 
procedures including consideration of the accuracy of previous 
forecasts. We sensitised key inputs to the model to determine 
the likely impact on the value in use calculation.
We critically evaluated the discount rates used to discount 
the forecast cash flows by comparing the rates used to 
market data, and we performed our own sensitivity analysis 
of the impact on the impairment charge to changes in the 
rate used.
We evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosures 
in the Group financial statements.

The Group’s provision of credit services to customers 
mean that it operates within a regulated environment 
which requires the Group to comply with the 
requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
and maintain FCA permissions. 
The requirement for FCA permissions includes the fair 
treatment of customers, protections for vulnerable 
customers and appropriate and clear disclosure of 
terms to customers. Where the group has identified 
areas of non-compliance with these regulations, 
provision is made for the expected cost of redressing 
customers. Such provisioning requires significant 
judgements to be made with respect to complaint 
volumes, the level of average redress and expected 
uphold rates. Given the significant value and 
judgemental nature of this provisioning, this is 
considered to be an area of significant audit risk.
Our audit procedures include the following:
We have assessed the entity-wide governance processes for the 
identification of regulatory issues and areas of non-compliance.
We have reviewed correspondence with the regulators and 
assessed customer complaints for indications of significant or 
non-identified areas of customer detriment that may require 
provision in the financial statements.
We have assessed the areas of non-compliance and customer 
complaints identified and documented by the Group. Using 
our experience of the regulatory requirements and wider 
industry, we critically assessed the key inputs into the group’s 
calculation of regulatory provisions, specifically we:
• assessed the accuracy of the complaints register and the 
classification of complaints, by comparing data recorded 
to the supporting customer complaint.
• assessed the completeness of the complaints register and 
claims volume by comparing to customer correspondence 
and critically assessing claims volumes with respect to 
historical data
• compared average claim redress and uphold rates inputs 
to historical experience 
• compared the forecast future claims profile to historical 
data, considering the accuracy of previous forecasting 
and market expectations.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in respect of the judgement and estimation made in respect 
of regulatory provisioning.
Carrying value 
of inventories: 
£105.5m

Report),

The Group has significant levels of inventory and a 
number of judgements and estimates are involved in 
valuing aged or slow moving inventories.
Furthermore, the seasonal nature of a retail business 
and changes in customer preferences and spending 
patterns, primarily driven by the wider fashion industry, 
introduce uncertainty over the recoverability of 
inventories. 
Given the level of judgements and estimates involved 
this is considered to be a key audit risk.
Our audit procedures included comparing inventory levels, 
by season, to sales data to test whether slow moving and 
obsolete inventories had been appropriately identified. We 
considered sales of inventories during the year, in particular 
of inventory which has been held for greater than one year 
and clearance categories, and compared these sales to the 
Group’s forecast sales plan at the period end date.
 We utilised data analytics to test the adequacy of inventory 
provision by comparing the recent selling price of inventory 
to the cost of the inventory as well as analysing the ageing of 
inventory items. We also considered whether the Group’s 
accounting policies had been consistently applied and the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of the 
judgement and estimation made in respect of inventory 
provisioning.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £3.6m (2016: £3.8m), determined with reference to a benchmark 
of group profit before tax, normalised to exclude this year’s exceptional items as disclosed in note 7 , of £25.2m, of which it 
represents 4.3% (2016: 4.3%).
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.2m (2016: £0.2m), 
in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
All of the group’s reporting components were subjected to audits for group reporting purposes, The audits were conducted by 
the Group audit team and covered 100% of Group revenue, Group profit before tax, and Group assets. Component materialities, 
which ranged from £0.1m to £3.0m were applied by the Group team, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components (2016: audited as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information to group materiality of £3.8m).
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with the

Financial statements
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY 1 General information
N Brown Group plc is a company incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address  
of the registered office is listed in the Shareholder Information 
section on page 127 at the end of the report. The nature of the 
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out on 
page 60 of the Directors’ Report.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling 
because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations 
are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
The Group financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 
4 March 2017 have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
for use in the EU. The Company has elected to prepare its 
parent company financial statements in accordance with 
FRS 101, these are presented on pages 120 to 126.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently 
in the current and prior periods.
Adoption of new and revised standards
No standards have been adopted that affect the reported 
results or financial position.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements,  
the following Standards and Interpretations which have not  
been applied in these financial statements were in issue but 
not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been  
adopted by the EU):
• IFRS 9: Financial Instruments.
• IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
• IFRS 16 Leases*
• Clarification and Measurement of Share Based 
Payment Transactions – Amendments to IFRS 2*
• Recognition of Deferred Tax assets for unrealised 
losses – Amendments to IAS 12*
• Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers*
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards 
listed above will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group in future periods, except as follows:
• IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures 
of Financial Instruments. Management are still assessing the 
impact on the financial statements of future periods.
• Management have made initial investigations but have not 
yet assessed the impact of the introduction of IFRS 15 and 
IFRS 16 on the financial statements of future periods.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations are those which management identify

under continuing activities.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost 
basis except that derivative financial instruments are stated 
at their fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted 
are set out as follows.
Accounting period
Throughout the accounts, the directors report and financial 
review, reference to 2017 means at 4 March 2017 or the  
53 weeks then ended; reference to 2016 means at 27 February 
2016 or the 52 weeks then ended unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to the Saturday that falls 
closest to 28 February each year. The Employee Share 
Ownership Trust is also made up to a date coterminous  
with the financial period of the parent company.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group 
controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has  
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The 
acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to 
the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the  
date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary 
are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so 
causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies  
used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses  
are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the 
purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured  
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange,  
of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control  
of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets,  
liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions  
for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair 
value at the acquisition date.
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset on the 
date control is acquired and initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment,  
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities. and contingent liabilities exceeds 
the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at 
least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in  
the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill 
is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 March 1998 
was charged against reserves in the year of acquisition in 
accordance with UK GAAP and has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Product revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for 
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, 
net of discounts and sales related taxes. 
In the case of goods sold through our retail stores and trading 
websites, revenue is recognised when goods are despatched and 
the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer. 
Sales returns in the period are recognised as a deduction to 
revenue as incurred. Provision is made for outstanding returns not 
yet made at the period end. Accumulated experience (including 
historical returns rates) is used to estimate and provide for such 
returns. The provision is recorded as a reduction in revenue with 
a corresponding entry to debtors (for credit sales) and accruals 
(for cash sales). 
Financial services revenue includes interest, administrative 
charges and arrangement fees. Interest income is accrued on 
a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the 
applicable effective interest rate which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected 
life of the financial assets to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
Revenue from non-interest related financial income is recognised 
when the services have been performed.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for impairment in value. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets  
to their estimated residual values, based on current prices  
at the balance sheet date, over their remaining useful lives, 
using the straight-line method. No depreciation is charged  
on freehold land. In this respect the following annual 
depreciation rates apply:
Land and Buildings
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold property and 
improvements
over the period of the lease
Fixtures and Equipment
Computer equipment between 10% and 20%
Plant and machinery between 5% and 20%
Fixtures and equipment between 10% and 20%
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an  
asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
income statement.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to  
get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost 
of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the 
period in which they are incurred.
Intangible assets
Computer software development costs that generate economic 
benefits beyond one year are capitalised as intangible assets 
and amortised on a straight-line basis over a range of five to ten 
years. Assets under construction are not amortised but instead 
tested for impairment annually.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product 
or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group 
intends to and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to 
complete development, future economic benefits are probable 
and if the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable 
to the intangible asset during its development. Development 
activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or 
substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure 
capitalised includes the cost of materials and direct labour. Other 
development expenditure is recognised in the income statement 
as an expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure 
is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less 
accumulated impairment losses.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Financial statements 2 Accounting policies (continued)
Customer databases arising on acquisitions assessed under  
the requirements of IFRS 3 are amortised over their useful 
economic lives, which have been assessed as being five years.
Legally protected or otherwise separable trade names acquired 
as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value  
on acquisition. Brand names are individually assessed and are 
assumed to have an indefinite life and are not amortised,  
but are subject to annual impairment tests.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying value 
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. For goodwill and intangible assets that have 
indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to  
sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using  
a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as 
income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories have been valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Provision is made based on the age of the 
inventory and management’s estimates of future disposal 
strategies. Cost comprises direct materials and those overheads 
that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present 
location and condition based on the standard costing method. 
Cost has been calculated on a first-in first-out basis. Net 
realisable value means estimated selling price less all costs  
to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding  
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the  
tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected  
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset  
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are 
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of 
the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial 
position of each Group company are expressed in pounds 
sterling, the presentation currency for the consolidated financial 
statements.
In preparing the financial statement of the individual 
companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the 
rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.  
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items 
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair 
value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
96
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary 
items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included 
in profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on 
the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are 
included in profit or loss for the period except for differences 
arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect  
of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.  
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of  
that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange 
risks, the Group may enter into forward contracts and options 
(see below for details of the Group’s accounting policies in 
respect of such derivative financial instruments).
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial 
statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign 
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated  
at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange 
rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case  
the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity  
and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such 
translation differences are recognised as income or as  
expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Profits and losses on 
financial instruments are recognised in the income statement  
as they arise.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or  
loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired 
based on specific customer patterns of behaviour which may  
be affected by external economic conditions.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value  
of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective 
interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Trade receivables are assessed for impairment on a collective 
basis. Objective evidence of impairment could include the 
Group’s past experience of collecting payments and observable 
changes in national and local economic conditions that could 
correlate with a default event. For further details see note 17 .
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand 
deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Leasing
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income 
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease even 
where payments are not made on such a basis.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group  
after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the 
income statement using the effective interest method.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value, 
are not interest bearing and are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. 
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at  
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks  
of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the 
purchase of overseas sourced products, and interest rates 
relating to the Group’s debt. The Group uses foreign exchange 
forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts where 
appropriate to hedge these exposures. In accordance with  
its treasury policy, the Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s 
policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide 
written principles on the use of financial derivatives. 
Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign 
currency derivatives contracts is their quoted market value at 
the balance sheet date.
Market values are based on the duration of the derivative 
instrument together with the quoted market data including 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market volatility at 
the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate contracts 
is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay 
to terminate them at the balance sheet date, taking into 
account prevailing interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivative financial 
instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.

Financial statements 2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Provisions
The Group recognises a provision for a present obligation 
resulting from a past event when it is more likely than not that 
it will be required to transfer economic benefits to settle the 
obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated 
reliably. The Group has on-going discussions with HMRC in 
respect of a number of Corporation tax positions. Provisions are 
made in respect of these positions when management consider 
it probable that the position will be settled via payment to HMRC 
and it is possible to estimate reliably the amount of the obligation 
which will be settled. In determining whether a future economic 
outflow is probable the Group assesses all available information 
including the opinion of legal counsel where appropriate. 
Provision is made for customer remediation when the Group has 
established that a present obligation exists in respect of financial 
services products sold in the past. The provision requires a 
significant level of estimation and judgement and the amounts 
provided depend on a number of different assumptions.
Provision is made for restructuring costs, including the costs of 
redundancy, when the Group has a constructive obligation to 
restructure. An obligation exists when the Group has a detailed 
formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected by starting to implement the plan 
or by announcing its main features. If the Group has a contract 
that is onerous, it recognises the present obligation under the 
contract as a provision. An onerous contract is one where the 
unavoidable costs of meeting the Group’s contractual 
obligations exceed the expected economic benefits. When the 
Group vacates a leasehold property, a provision is recognised 
for the unavoidable future costs under the lease less any 
expected economic benefits (such as rental income). 
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising from past 
events, whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain 
future events, or present obligations arising from past events 
that are not recognised because either an outflow of economic 
benefits is not probable or the amount of the obligation cannot 
be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised 
but information about them is disclosed unless the possibility 
of any outflow of economic benefits in settlement is remote.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments  
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest. This is recognised as an employee expense 
with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair value is measured 
by monte - carlo for options subject to a market based 
performance condition and by use of a Black–Scholes model for 
all others. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting 
conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment 
is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up 
for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Own shares held by ESOT
Transactions of the group-sponsored Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (ESOT) are included in the Group financial statements. The 
trust’s purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited 
and credited directly to equity.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes 
are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of 
providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit 
Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at 
the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement comprising 
actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if 
applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) 
are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge 
or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the 
period in which they occur. Remeasurement recorded in the 
statement of comprehensive income is not recycled. Past 
service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of 
scheme amendment. Net-interest is calculated by applying  
a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. 
Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:
• current service cost, past-service cost and gains and losses  
on curtailments and settlements;
• net-interest expense or income; and
• remeasurement.
The Group presents the first two components of defined 
benefit costs within operating expenses (see note 30) in its 
consolidated income statement. Curtailments gains and losses 
are accounted for as past-service cost. Net-interest expense  
or income is recognised within finance costs (see note 9).
The retirement benefit asset/(obligation) recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of the defined 
benefit asset/(obligation), as reduced by the fair value of 
scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is 
restricted to the past service cost plus the present value  
of available refunds and reductions in future contributions.
Supplier rebates
The Group enters into volume based rebate arrangements with 
suppliers. Rebates are calculated annually based on agreements 
in place, which stipulate an agreed percentage of purchase be 
grated as a rebate. Rebates are agreed with suppliers before 
they are recognised in the Income Statement, outstanding 
balances are recorded in accrued income. 
Going concern
In determining whether the Group’s accounts can be prepared 
on a going concern basis, the directors considered the Group’s 
business activities together with factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and its financial position including 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and the 
principal risks and uncertainties relating to its business activities. 
These are set out within the Risk Management Report on pages 
30 to 31.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED The Group has considered carefully its cash flows and banking 
covenants for the next twelve months from the date of signing 
the audited financial statements. These have been appraised  
in light of the current economic climate. As such, conservative 
assumptions for working capital performance have been used 
to determine the level of financial resources available to the 
company and to assess liquidity risk. 
The Group’s forecasts and projections, after sensitivity to  
take account of all reasonably foreseeable changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group will have sufficient 
headroom within its current loan facilities of £405m – which  
are committed until August 2020 – and its £20m revolving 
credit facility. After making appropriate enquiries, the 
directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in the preparation of the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those that are considered to be one  
off, non-recurring in nature and so material that the directors 
believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion 
of underlying performance and should be separately presented 
on the face of the income statement.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the year end date, that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below.
Trade receivables
An appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable trade 
receivables is derived where there is an identified event which, 
based on previous experience, is evidence of a potential 
reduction in the recoverability of future cash flows. This 
estimation is based on assumed collection rates which, 
although based on the Group’s historical experience of 
customer repayment patterns, remains inherently uncertain. 
Changes in the assumptions applied (including period of 
historical experience used to estimate customer repayment and 
the occurrence and frequency of future debt sales), could have 
a significant impact on the carrying value of trade receivables.
As a result this is continually assessed for relevance and 
adjusted appropriately. Further information is given in note 17 .
Taxation
The Group has on-going discussions with HMRC in respect of 
a number of Corporation tax and VAT positions. The calculation 
of the Group’s potential liabilities or assets in respect of these 
involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of 
items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until 
resolution has been reached with HMRC or, as appropriate, 
through legal processes. Issues can, and often do, take a 
number of years to resolve.
In respect of Corporation tax, as at 4 March 2017 the Group 
has provided a total of £3.6m (2016: £Nil) for potential tax future 
charges based upon the Group’s best estimation and judgement 
and, where appropriate, legal counsels’ opinion. 
In respect of VAT, the Group has provided a total of £5.4m 
(2016: £5.4m) in respect of future payments which the Directors’ 
have a reasonable expectation of making in settlement of these 
historical positions.
In addition and separate to the above positions, the Group 
continues to be in discussion with HMRC in relation to the VAT 
consequences of the allocation of marketing costs between our 
retail and credit businesses. At this stage it is not possible to 
determine how the matter will be resolved. However within our 
year end VAT debtor is an asset of £36.0m (2016: £21.7m) which 
has arisen as a result of cash payments made under protective 
assessments raised by HMRC and the Group estimates that a 
further £10m could be paid under this assessment in the 
forthcoming year. Based on legal counsel’s opinion, we believe 
that we will recover this amount in full from HMRC and we are 
engaged in legal process to do so. 
The inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these 
positions means the eventual realisation could differ from the 
accounting estimates and therefore impact the Group’s future 
results and cash flows. Based on the amounts reflected in the 
balance sheet as at 4 March 2017 , the Directors estimate that the 
unfavourable settlement of these cases could result in a charge 
to the income statement of up to £43.3m (including the full write 
off of the VAT debtor noted above) and a cash payment to 
HMRC of up to £16.0m. The favourable settlement of these 
cases would result in a repayment of tax of up to £54.1m and 
an associated credit to the income statement of up to £29.0m.
Inventory
Provision is made for those items of inventory where the net 
realisable value is estimated to be lower than cost. Net realisable 
value is based on both historical experience and assumptions 
regarding future selling values and disposal channels, and is 
consequently a source of estimation uncertainty.
Regulatory
The regulatory environment in which the Group operates is 
both complex and changing and the Group continues to review 
and develop its compliance with the requirements of the FCA. 
Provisions for customer remediation require significant levels 
of estimation and judgement. The amounts of provisions 
recognised depend on a number of different assumptions, 
such as, the volume of inbound complaints, the uphold rate 
of complaint volumes and the average redress amount paid. 
A summary of the impact of a reasonable change in these 
assumptions is set out in note 23.
Software development costs
Included within intangibles assets are significant software  
and development project costs in respect of the Group’s 
transformation project, Fit 4 the Future. Costs are capitalised  
to the extent that future economic benefits are expected to  
be generated by the project, which requires judgement to be 
made as to whether the project will be completed successfully, 
will be technically feasible and whether sufficient revenue and 
profitability will be generated to recover the costs capitalised.  
If these criteria are not subsequently met, the asset would  
be subject to a future impairment charge which would impact  
the Group’s results. This is consequently a source of 
estimation uncertainty.

UK corporation tax is calculated at 20.0% (2016, 20.08%) of the estimated assessable profit for the period. Taxation for other 
jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. 
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. 
Further reductions to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted on 
26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. 
This will reduce the future current tax charge accordingly. The Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 4 March 2017 have 
been calculated based upon the rates which will apply when those balances are expected to unwind. 
The charge for the period can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows:

The Group has on-going discussions with HMRC in respect of a number of Corporation tax positions. The calculation of the 
Group’s potential liabilities or assets in respect of these involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of items whose 
tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with HMRC or, as appropriate, through a legal 
process. Issues can, and often do, take a number of years to resolve.
In respect of Corporation tax, as at 4 March 2017 the Group has provided a total of £3.6m (2016: £Nil) for potential tax future 
charges based upon the Group’s best estimation and judgement and, where appropriate, legal counsels opinion. Adjustments in 
respect of previous periods include current tax provisions made in respect of tax exposures (£2.4m) in addition to a reclassification 
between current and deferred tax in respect of tax deductions on software development costs (£1.7m).

12 Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
in issue during the period. 
The adjusted earnings per share figures have also been calculated based on earnings before items that are one-off in nature, 
material by size and are considered to be distortive of the true underlying performance of the business (see note 7) and certain 
other fair value adjustments. These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying 
trading performance of the Group. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is 
adjusted to assume conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The calculations of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:

Assets in the course of construction included in intangible assets at the year end total £88.5m (2016, £55.3m), of which £83.4m 
relates to the Fit 4 the Future project (2016, £51.2m). No amortisation is charged on these assets. All software additions relate  
to internal usage. Borrowing costs of £1.3m (2016 £nil) have been capitalised in the period using the weighted average bank loan 
interest rate applied to the capitalised spend on Fit 4 the Future project. In addition the Group has spend of £16.7m (2016 £16.5m) 
that relates to Fit 4 the Future assets which are now in use and therefore being amortised.
As at 4 March 2017 , the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the further development of intangible assets of 
£3.0m (2016: £3.4m) of which £1m (2016: £0.9m) is due to be paid within one year.
Impairment testing of software intangible assets
The Group is currently undertaking a systems transformation project, Fit 4 the Future. Elements of the project are not yet available 
for use and are not therefore being amortised. Where intangible assets are not being amortised management have tested for 
impairment with the recoverable amount being determined from value in use calculations. 
The value in use calculations use cash flows based on budgets prepared by management covering a three year period. These 
budgets have regard to historic performance and knowledge of the current market, together with managements views on the 
future achievable growth and impact of the Fit 4 the Future project. Cash flows beyond this three year period are extrapolated 
using a long term growth rate to five years at which point a terminal value has been calculated based upon the long term growth 
rate and the Group’s risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate. 
Other than the detailed budgets, the key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the long-term growth rate and the risk 
adjusted pre-tax discount rate. The long-term growth rate has been determined with reference to forecast GDP growth which 
management believe is the most appropriate indicator of long-term growth rates that is available. The long-term growth rate used 
is purely for the impairment testing of intangible assets and brands under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ and does not reflect 
long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments. The pre-tax discount 
rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which 
specific market-related premium adjustments are made. 
The value attributed to the key assumptions are as follows
• Long term growth rate : 1.9% (2016, 2.7%)
• Pre tax discount rate : 11.6% (2016, 8.0%)
The analysis performed indicates that no impairment is required. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key 
assumptions with other variables held constant. Management have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in 
these key assumptions that would cause the carrying value to exceed the value in use.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Impairment testing of brand intangibles
The brand names arising from the acquisitions of High and Mighty, Slimma, Figleaves, Diva and Dannimac are deemed to have 
indefinite lives as there are no foreseeable limits to the periods over which they are expected to generate cash inflows and are 
therefore subject to annual impairment tests with the recoverable amount being determined from the value in use calculations. 
The value in use calculations use cash flows based on budgets prepared by management covering a three year period. These 
budgets have regard to historic performance and knowledge of the current market, together with management’s views on the 
future achievable growth. Cash flows beyond this three year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate to 5 years at 
which point a terminal value has been calculated based upon the long term growth rate and the Group’s risk adjusted pre tax 
discount rate.
Other than the detailed budgets, the key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the long-term growth rate and the risk 
adjusted pre-tax discount rate which management have assumed to be 1.9% (2016, 2.7%) and 12.5% (2016, 8.0%) respectively. 
The analysis performed indicates that no impairment is required. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key 
assumptions with other variables held constant. Management have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in 
these key assumptions that would cause the carrying value to exceed the value in use.

Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost.
The average credit period given to customers for the sale of goods is 217 days (2016, 222 days). Interest is charged at 58.7% 
(2016, 58.7%) on the outstanding balance. Provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will be unable to collect all amounts due. For customers who find themselves in financial difficulties, the Group may 
offer revised payment terms to support the customer, encouraging customer rehabilitation and thereby maximising long term 
returns. These revised terms may also include suspension of interest for a period of time. The cash collection rates on these 
accounts are therefore reduced and a provision is held for all receivables on renegotiated terms. Accounts not on renegotiated 
terms are also assessed and all accounts that reach the trigger point of 56 days past due are considered for provision. 
The Group considers 56 days past due to be objective evidence of impairment for all accounts, not on renegotiated terms. 
All such accounts are subject to an individual impairment provision. All accounts that are not considered individually impaired are 
included in a collective provision to reflect impairment triggers that are incurred but not reported ('IBNR'). The group uses historic 
roll rates to measure the likelihood of receivables moving into a segment which is subject to individual impairment over a 6 month 
emergence period. This is then used to assess the level of provision needed in relation to these incurred but not reported 
('IBNR') events. 
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit 
quality and defines credit limits by customer. The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, with 
regard to the historical default rate has remained stable.

NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED The carrying amount of trade receivables whose terms have been renegotiated but would otherwise be past due totalled

Balance at the end of the period 64.7 97.6
The amounts written off in the period of £146.4m include the sale of impaired assets with a net book value of £29m. This sale has also 
been a material driver in the reduction in trade receivables on payments arrangements, from £122.3m to £67 .9m as at 4 March 2017 . 
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated and comprising 1.2 million 
(2016, 1.3 million) customers. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess 
of the allowance for doubtful debts.
‘Other debtors and prepayments’ includes a net VAT debtor, comprising the VAT liability which arises from day to day trading, 
together with amounts in relation to matters which are in dispute with HMRC. The Group continues to be in discussion with HMRC 
in relation to the VAT consequences of the allocation of marketing costs between our retail and credit businesses. At this stage it  
is not possible to determine how the matter will be resolved. However, within our year end VAT debtor is an asset of £36.0m 
(2016, £21.7m) which has arisen as a result of cash payments made under protective assessments raised by HMRC. Based on legal 
counsel’s opinion, we believe that we will recover this amount in full from HMRC and we are engaged in a legal process to do so. 
Other debtors and prepayments do not include impaired assets. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is  
the carrying value of each class of asset. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

margin over bank base rates. The Group has a revolving credit facility of £20m (2016, £20m) which is undrawn at period end.
ii. The Group has a bank loan of £270m (2016, £250m) secured by a charge over certain ‘eligible’ trade debtors (current and 
0–28 days past due) of the Group and is without recourse to any of the Group’s other assets. The facility has a current limit 
of £280m for which finance costs are linked to US commercial paper rates which is committed until August 2020. 
 
The Group also has unsecured bank loans of £85m (2016, £85m) drawn down under a medium term bank revolving credit 
facility, of £125 million, which is committed until August 2020.
iii. All borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group may use 
derivatives such as interest rate swaps where appropriate to manage this risk. None have been used in the current or prior year. 
Based on weighted average interest rates and the value of bank loans at 4 March 2017 the estimated future interest cost per 
annum until maturity would be £7 .6m (2016, £7 .9m).

At 4 March 2017 , the Group had available £50m (2016, £70m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all 
conditions precedent had been met, in addition to its undrawn overdraft facility of £20m (2016, £20m).
Note 20 summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies 
for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period. The covenants inherent to these borrowing 
arrangements are closely monitored on a regular basis.

Changes in the fair value of assets/liabilities recognised, being non-hedging currency derivatives, amounted to a credit of £0.2m 
(2016, credit of £1.1m) to income in the period.
The fair value of foreign currency derivatives contracts is their market value at the balance sheet date. Market values are based on 
the duration of the derivative instrument together with the quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates 
and market volatility at the balance sheet date.
The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are all grouped into Level 2 (2016, same).
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices).
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the period (2016, same).

NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Financial risk management objectives
The financial risks facing the Group include currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group seeks 
to minimise the effects of certain of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures as governed 
by the Group’s policies. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments,  
for speculative purposes.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations 
arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments for  
the purchase of overseas sourced products. Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to three years ahead.

Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates. Where appropriate, 
exposure to interest rate fluctuations on indebtedness is managed by using derivatives such as interest rate swaps.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
If interest rates had increased by 0.5% and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit before tax for the 53 weeks 
ended 4 March 2017 would have decreased by £1.8m (2016, £1.4m).
This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date and assuming the net 
debt outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. 
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative financial instruments are made through banks which are approved 
by the Board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures, supplied by independent rating 
agencies which together with assessment against credit policy determines the terms and credit limit offered. Customer debtor 
balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts as detailed in note 17 . 
While the group has a number of support options for customers in financial difficulty, the majority are subject to the revision 
of payment terms.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages liquidity 
risk by maintaining adequate banking and borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and 
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in note 18 is a description of additional undrawn facilities 
that the Group has at its disposal and details of the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.

NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of each category of the Group’s financial instruments are the same as their carrying value in the Group’s 
balance sheet other than as noted below.
Trade Receivables
As discussed in note 17 , where a customer finds themselves in financial difficulty, we may offer revised payment terms. 
This maximises long term returns to the business, but may not maximise the present value of the receivables.
The Group believes that the fair value of interest bearing receivables whether on a payment plan or not, is the same as their 
carrying value on the balance sheet, as interest rates are charged to reflect market rates.
For non interest bearing debt, fair value is estimated based on the recent sale prices of similar debt books. 
The fair value of receivables is calculated to be £524.1m (2016: £553.4m). This is considered a IFRS 13 Level 3 valuation 
(2016: same) as the valuation relies on unobservable inputs.
Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value (IFRS 13: Level 2) as discussed in note 19. A Level 2 valuation uses 
inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie, as prices) 
or indirectly (ie, derived from prices).

The provisions for customer redress relates to the Group’s expected liabilities in respect of payments for historic financial services 
customer redress. The provision made is firstly in respect of recompensing certain customers due to an error in our previous 
calculation for redress and, secondly, our estimate of the likely future costs arising from complaints relating to financial services 
products sold in the past.
As at 4 March 2017 the Group holds a provision of £19.9m of which £0.8m is in respect of administration expenses. There are still a 
number of uncertainties as to the eventual customer redress costs, in particular the total number of claims and the cost per claim, 
however the Directors believe that the amounts provided at the period end, based on historical and forecasted claim rates and 
amounts, along with known legal and regulatory obligations, appropriately reflect the expected cost to the Group. 
The principal sensitivities in the customer redress calculation are: customer claim volume, uphold rates (which reflects the number 
of customer claims which result in redress) and average redress amount.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED The fair value of management and sharesave options/awards granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black–Scholes 
option pricing model. The inputs into the Black–Scholes model are as follows:
2017 2016 
Weighted average share price at date of grant (pence) 189 339
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 37 97
Expected volatility (%) 29.2 – 35.0 27.7 – 34.2
Expected life (years) 2.5 – 5.5 2.5 – 5.5
Risk-free rate (%) 0.1 0.9
Dividend yield (%) 4.0 4.2
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period equivalent to 
the expected life of the option. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £0.5m and £2.2m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2017 
and 2016 respectively.
30 Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The Group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits. 
The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £3.9m (2016, £3.0m) represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. As at 4 March 2017 , contributions of £0.1m (2016, £0.3m) due in respect of the current reporting 
period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund. Under the scheme, the employees are 
entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable earnings and was closed to new members from 31 January 2002. On 
29 February 2016 the scheme was closed to future accrual. A past service credit in respect of this closure was recognised in 2016, 
as the Company was both committed to the change, and had the right to apply the change by the balance sheet date. No other 
post-retirement benefits are provided. The scheme is a funded scheme and operates under UK trust law and the trust is a separate 
legal entity from the Group. The scheme is governed by a board of trustees. The trustees are required by law to act in the best 
interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies (eg investment funding) together with the Group. 
The scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and investment risk.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 
30 June 2015 by an independent qualified actuary. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service 
cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method. The principal actuarial assumptions used in 
determining the Group’s net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date were as follows:
2017 2016 
Discount rate 2.65% 3.90%
Future pension increases 2.3% 2.15%

Cash and cash equivalents 1.2 0.8 0.3 0.2
143.5 100.0 118.9 100.0
All assets had a quoted market price (2016, all). Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit 
obligation are the discount rate, inflation and life expectancy.
• An increase of 0.25% in the discount rate used would decrease the defined benefit obligation by £7 .4m (2016, £5.8m). 
• An increase of 0.25% in the inflation assumption would increase the defined benefit obligation by £6.0m (2016, £4.4m).
• An increase of one year in the life expectancy assumption would increase the defined benefit obligation by £4.2m (2016, £2.2m)
The above sensitivities are applied to adjust the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period. Whilst the analysis 
does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows under the scheme, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity  
of the assumptions shown. No changes have been made to the method and assumptions used in this analysis from those used in 
the previous period.
The scheme is funded by the Group and current employee members. Funding the scheme is based on a separate actuarial 
valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the assumptions above. Funding requirements are 
formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and Recovery Plan agreed between the trustees 
and the Group.
Whilst no commitment has been made as at the balance sheet date, the Group expects to contribute £0.3m (2016, £0.2m) 
to the defined benefit scheme in the next financial year.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 4 March 2017 is approximately 24 years (2016, 24 years).
The defined benefit obligation at 4 March 2017 can be approximately attributed to the scheme members as follows:
• Active members: 0% (2016, 0%)
• Deferred members: 70% (2016, 68%)
• Pensioner members; 30% (2016, 32%)
All benefits are vested at 4 March 2017 (unchanged from 27 February 2016).

Financial statements
COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY 32 Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
N Brown Group plc (’the Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. These financial statements present 
information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group. These financial statements were prepared 
in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’). 
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary  
in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has 
been taken. 
The Company is the ultimate parent undertaking of the Group and also prepares consolidated financial statements. The 
consolidated financial statements of N Brown Group plc are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards and are available to the public and may be obtained from its registered office address.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of 
the following disclosures:
• Company cashflow statement and related notes
• Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries
• Disclosures in respect of capital management
• The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs
• Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel
As the consolidated financial statements of N Brown Group plc include equivalent disclosures the Company has also taken 
exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
• Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Finance charges are accounted for on an 
accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except  
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised 
directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than  
in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse  
in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of 
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred 
tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the 
Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form 
an integral part of the Company’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents on the basis there 
is right to offset.
Own shares held by ESOT
Transactions of the Company-sponsored Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) are treated as being those of the Company and 
are therefore reflected in the Company financial statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases and sales of shares in the Company 
are debited and credited directly to equity.
33 Profit for the period
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account 
for the period.
N Brown Group plc reported a profit after tax for the financial period ended 4 March 2017 of £41.2m (2016, profit £41.7m) which 
includes dividends received of £48.2m (2016, £49.0m).
