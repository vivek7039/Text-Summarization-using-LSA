The Group ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance 
with IFRS where the Group’s interests in joint ventures are 
shown as a single line item on the income statement and 
balance sheet and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100%. 
Management reviews the performance of the business 
principally on a proportionately consolidated basis which 
includes the Group’s share of joint ventures on a line by line 
basis. The key ﬁnancial performance indicators are also 
presented on this basis.
Alternative performance measures are ﬁnancial measures 
which are not speciﬁed under IFRS but are used by 
management as they highlight the underlying recurring 
performance of the Group’s property rental business and are 
based on the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations (BPR) 
reporting framework which is widely recognised and used 
by public real estate companies. 
Therefore, unless speciﬁcally stated, the performance metrics 
and ﬁnancial results reﬂected above and in the Strategic 
report reﬂect the Group’s wholly owned assets and its share 
of joint venture assets.
Further details and reconciliations between EPRA measures 
and IFRS equivalents can be found in the Financial review on 
page 35 and in note 8 to the Group ﬁnancial statements.

We will continue to build the 
foundations for future dividend 
progression.
Chairman’s statement
Whilst political and economic 
uncertainty was a signiﬁcant distraction 
for the markets in the year, the attraction 
of secure income continued to grow. 
Not only are we living in a low growth, 
low interest rate environment but ageing 
demographics are accentuating the 
search for income and alternatives 
to low yielding government bonds. 
This need has already risen substantially 
and will grow further in the years 
to come. High quality companies 
offering well-covered and growing 
dividends ought to become ever 
more highly prized.
Our signiﬁcant and increasing 
investment in distribution is delivering 
excellent returns, sustainable income 
growth and long term value for our 
shareholders. The sector is beneﬁting 
strongly from structural support as 
UK consumers continue to migrate 
to online. Conversely, physical retail 
continues to face signiﬁcant challenges 
from this online shift with the inevitable 
space overcapacity this brings to the 
retail market. 
This ongoing structural demand for 
distribution and lack of meaningful 
supply has given us the conﬁdence 
to increase our investment across 
all distribution sub-sectors of mega 
box, regional and urban logistics. 
We continue to see good investment 
and short cycle development 
opportunities, particularly in urban 
logistics, and we have now fully 
committed the proceeds of our recent 
equity placing into sensible, accretive 
assets. Our distribution exposure is 
expected to exceed 70% within the 
current ﬁnancial year.
Exposure to the best real estate sectors 
is driving demand for our space 
resulting in high occupancy, good like 
for like income growth and strong ERV 
uplifts. Our sector leading portfolio 
metrics have been maintained thanks 
to our strong occupier and property 
relationships. Over the last four years, 
through management activity, our 
occupancy level has been above 
99% and our unexpired lease term has 
remained at 12.8 years with only 1% of 
our leases due to expire within the next 
three years. 
Our predictable, repetitive and growing 
income streams have allowed us to 
progress the dividend again this year by 
3.4%. An attractive dividend needs to 
be adequately covered by operating 
earnings and I’m pleased that we have 
maintained the 1.1x dividend cover we 
achieved last year. 
We will continue to build the 
foundations for future dividend 
progression. Contractual rental uplifts 
are embedded in over 50% of the 
portfolio, we are achieving strong rent 
review uplifts and are adding new 
income from short cycle developments. 
LondonMetric is well placed and I 
am genuinely excited by its outlook 
and look forward to the year 
with conﬁdence.

Our focus, as a REIT, is to collect and compound 
our long and strong income and to enhance its 
repetitive, reliable and secure characteristics.
Our portfolio is positioned around 
strong fundamentals of owning 
highly desirable assets, let to good 
companies and where over time 
the income will grow.
Distribution weighting
>70%
by next year
Income growth with 
structural support
We continue to live in a world 
characterised by both political and 
economic uncertainty. The prolonged 
low interest rate environment and 
unorthodox monetary policy has 
created an almost desperate search 
for yield across a widening spectrum 
of investment classes. 
Our focus, as a REIT, is to collect and 
compound our long and strong 
income and to enhance its repetitive, 
reliable and secure characteristics. 
We expect this strategy to outperform 
more traditional hyper-active 
development and trading models 
where volatile and uncertain returns 
are diluted by income interruption 
and frictional costs. 
Technological advancement and 
innovation is having a profound 
impact on many businesses as they 
attempt to remain relevant in an 
evolving world where the pace of 
change is accelerating. The real 
estate sector is not immune. 
In recent years, we have seen a 
signiﬁcant shift in consumer shopping 
habits, with customer expectations of 
efficiency, speed and convenience 
driving omni-channel retailing. 
This has signiﬁcantly increased the 
proportion of non food retail sales 
online, which is expected to reach 
26% by 2020 compared to just 13% in 
201 1; a growth rate of 10% per annum. 
These structural changes in how 
people shop are driving retailer 
demand for logistics. We have 
responded to these trends by actively 
pivoting our investment focus from 
retail parks into the logistics and 
distribution sectors, which we expect 
to account for over 70% of our 
portfolio by the end of the current 
ﬁnancial year. We remain disciplined 
and unemotional in our investment 
approach and will continue to 
dispose of assets where we think 
growth prospects are less exciting. 
These actions have put us on the right 
side of the changing retail landscape 
and consequently we expect to be 
a strong beneﬁciary. We believe 
that the favourable demand/supply 
metrics for logistics will exist for some 
time, leading to high occupancy, 
long leases and attractive income.
Our portfolio is positioned around 
strong fundamentals of owning highly 
desirable assets that are beneﬁting 
from structural trends, let to good 
companies and where, over time, the 
income will grow and the returns will 
compound. This will allow us to deliver 
ongoing dividend growth over the 
next few years.
Andrew Jones
Chief Executive
12 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements
We continue to maintain our very 
strong portfolio metrics.
three urban logistics reviews with an 
average uplift of 16.9% on a ﬁve yearly 
equivalent basis.
This demonstrates not only the 
attractive dynamics of our buildings but 
increasingly the growing importance 
that occupiers are putting on logistics 
and fulﬁlment.
Structural changes impacting 
shopping habits and 
occupier demand
Technology is disrupting many long 
established industries and real estate 
is no exception.
Structural trends in consumer behaviour 
and shopping patterns continue to 
drive retail sales online leading to c.10% 
per annum online growth. 
Retailers are therefore increasingly 
committing more of their capital 
expenditure into improving the 
efficiencies of their fulﬁlment 
operation with more investment in 
digital infrastructure and distribution 
warehousing. Today, it is estimated 
that retailers and third party logistics 
operators account for 60-70% of all 
distribution warehousing real estate 
take up. 
The benchmark continues to be set by 
Amazon which doubled its UK logistics 
footprint in 2016 and accounted for 
c.20% of take up in 2016. The urban 
logistics infrastructure that they are 
building is evidence of the importance 
they attach to same day, even same 
hour, delivery, something that the rest 
of the market will also have to address 
to stay competitive.
The impact of this evolution on 
traditional retail has never been more 
pronounced and, as retailers seek to 
‘right size’ their store portfolios, their 
demand for physical retail space falls. 
There is clearly going to be pain felt 
across the sector as retailers continue 
to adjust to the growth of online 
shopping. Department stores and 
apparel retailers feel the most at risk, 
and whilst the stronger destinations 
will inevitably fare better, even the 
owners of super-prime locations will 
not be immune, as they have to deal 
with increasing polarisation, impending 
lease expiries, building obsolescence 
and/or tenant defaults. 
The property markets are increasingly 
aware of the shifting tectonic plates 
and are beginning to price in 
these changes.

Behaving as a REIT
With interest rates hovering not far from 
all time lows, and a growing number of 
people retiring every year, the demand 
for alternative sources of income is on 
the rise.
We take comfort in having made the 
right structural calls, focusing on income 
and income growth, and our alignment 
to the logistics sector will continue to 
provide a highly repetitive, predictable 
and reliable income stream and deliver 
exactly what a REIT was designed to do. 
Ten years on from the introduction of 
REITs, it’s notable how few companies 
have fully embraced the REIT structure. 
Our income focus remains central 
to our investment thesis and we aim 
to own assets where the net income 
exceeds the dividend and the 
‘terminal’ value will be higher  
in ﬁve years’ time.
Our ultimate priority is to pass on 
income generated from our tenants 
to our shareholders in the form of a 
dividend. Since merger in 2013, our 
EPRA earnings have grown from 3.9p 
to 8.2p per share, which has allowed 
us to not only cover our dividend 
comfortably but also progress it  
for the second year running.
Enhancing our strong  
portfolio metrics
We continue to maintain our very 
strong portfolio metrics with long 
average lease lengths of 12.8 years, 
high occupancy at 99.6%, high gross 
to net income ratio of 98.6% and with 
only 1.2% of our rent due to expire in 
the next three years. Over 50% of our 
portfolio is now subject to contractual 
rental increases.
Continued reﬁnement of our portfolio 
has delivered a strong performance in 
the year with a total property return of 
7 .4%, outperforming the IPD All Property 
by 280bps, and ERV growth of 3.8%. 
These robust metrics are reﬂective of 
our sector calls, the strength of our 
occupier relationships and the high 
occupier appeal of our real estate.
In the year, we delivered 69 asset 
management activities generating 
like for like income growth of 4.6%. 
New lettings achieved an average 
lease length of 18.2 years, helped 
by new leases to Amazon, Michelin 
and Eddie Stobart. Open market rent 
reviews on distribution assets were 
particularly strong and we settled

Increasing focus 
on urban logistics
As part of our end to end logistics 
strategy, our investment focus in the 
year was on building our platform 
in urban logistics. 
Urban logistics is an essential part 
of modern distribution and enables 
the retailer and parcel operator to 
get closer to its point of delivery and 
fulﬁl orders quickly. Operators are 
increasingly looking to move closer 
to their end customer, albeit there 
are some severe supply constraints.
The functionality of urban logistics 
has evolved from a location which 
previously stored products to an 
operation today that is designed 
to maximise speed of delivery. 
Rising consumer expectations have 
reduced average delivery times 
down from 28 days to just a few days, 
with next day delivery now common.
Looking forward, delivery times are 
likely to fall further as expectations 
grow and more demanding younger 
shoppers, in particular millennials, 
account for a larger proportion of 
retail spend. Half of shopping by 
millennials is expected to be online 
by 2019.
Vacancy across the urban logistics 
market is already very low and new 
supply is very limited, especially 
around the major UK cities. 
According to the UK Warehousing 
Association, there has been a 
46% reduction of industrial space 
across Greater London since 1980. 
This is expected to fall by a further 
30% over the next 20 years. 
Achieving scale in this sub-sector 
is not easy, which in itself creates 
barriers to entry. Over the year, our 
urban logistics portfolio increased 
from eight to 23 assets valued at 
£160.8 million, the majority of which 
are located around major UK cities. 
We have made a further £23.9 million 
of acquisitions since the year end and 
expect this portfolio to grow quickly to 
c.£250 million in value.

Urban logistics is an essential

Aligning our portfolio further 
towards distribution through 
investment and development
We have been a signiﬁcant beneﬁciary 
of an early move into the logistics and 
distribution sectors where demand/
supply dynamics have strengthened 
considerably over recent years. 
Our strategy is aligned to the structural 
beneﬁts of the distribution sector 
whilst overlaying a tactical approach 
to ensure we invest in the sub sector 
that offers the most compelling 
investment proposition.
After a record year for distribution take 
up in 2016, occupier demand remains 
strong across the UK. Supply remains 
highly restricted, there is limited 
speculative development and 
estimates suggest that there is only 
four to ﬁve years of land available to 
accommodate warehouse demand. 
These macro trends and attractive 
dynamics have seen investor demand 
for the asset class increase globally. 
Despite a more competitive landscape 
we have again made strong progress in 
growing our footprint across this sector, 
whilst remaining patient, disciplined 
and rational. 
Over the year, we acquired a further 
£107 .0 million of new distribution 
investments and developments  
at an average yield of 6.2%.
As at the year end, our distribution 
portfolio was valued at £950.2 million, 
which represented 62% of our whole 
portfolio, against 54% a year ago. 
This has increased to 64% including 
post period end activity.

 Distribution developments completed in the year

 Distribution developments under construction

We have previously commented 
on the very attractive property 
fundamentals underpinning the 
strong pricing of mega and regional 
distribution warehouse investments.
Investing further in that market has 
therefore been less compelling of 
late and we have shifted our sights 
to growing our exposure through well 
located short cycle development 
opportunities, where the returns 
are signiﬁcantly more attractive.
In Wakeﬁeld, our 527 ,000 sq ft 
development completed in 
September 2016. This was pre-let to 
Poundworld on a new 15 year lease 
with contracted rental uplifts linked 
to RPI. 
In Warrington, our 357 ,000 sq ft 
regional distribution development 
completed in November 2016. 
Five weeks later we let the building to 
Amazon on a new 15 year lease with 
contracted rental uplifts linked to CPI. 
We continue to look at reﬁlling our 
development ‘hopper’ but will only 
do so where the demand/supply 
dynamics are attractive and our 
exposure to market timings are short. 
Therefore to minimise development 
risk, we only commit to developments 
once planning consent has been 
received and once pre-lets are 
agreed or where we have strong 
conﬁdence of a letting before 
practical completion.
Today, we are committed to 
0.6 million sq ft of developments 
at Dagenham, Stoke and Crawley 
delivering an anticipated yield on 
cost of 6.2%. We have secured pre-
lettings on over half of the space.
Above: Our 527,000 sq ft development for Poundworld in Wakeﬁeld 
The warehouse was developed at a yield of 6.3%. Poundworld signed a 15 year lease with

are leveraging our occupier relationships to progress a full build out of the 277,000 sq ft 
development. The building will be rated BREEAM Very Good.
This will become a major automated 
fulﬁlment centre for Amazon and will 
employ c.1,200 people.
We also completed a 53,000 sq ft 
distribution facility in Crawley, which 
is let to furniture retailer Barker & 
Stonehouse on a new 15 year lease.

 Retail park disposal at King’s L ynn
Further reducing 
our retail portfolio
Our further push in the distribution 
sector has largely been funded 
by the sale of mature retail parks 
where business plans have been 
fully executed.
Despite the political and economic 
uncertainty, we have continued 
to see strong buying interest for 
our assets with our retail disposals 
totalling £127 .6 million. These disposals 
crystallised a geared IRR, on average, 
of 13%.
As a result of this activity our retail 
park weighting has halved over the 
last two years to 13% of the overall 
portfolio. We will continue to monetise 
further retail assets upon completion 
of various asset management 
initiatives during the year. 
Post year end, we disposed of our 
Morrisons foodstore in Loughborough 
for £32.5 million, reﬂecting a net initial 
yield of 4.3% and a proﬁt on cost 
of 26.0%.
Opportunistic retail acquisitions
We fully recognise the competitive 
nature of the retail market and 
therefore increasingly view this 
sector opportunistically. We will 
therefore limit our involvement to new 
convenience food opportunities and 
those where we partner with our retail 
customers in securing new outlets 
that they consider integral to growing 
their business.
Over the period we completed the 
development of seven convenience 
retail stores mainly let to Aldi and M&S. 
The average yield on cost for all of 
our retail developments was 6.7% and 
the average lease length achieved 
was 13.4 years. 
During the year, we also acquired 
two single let retail assets for our 
long income MIPP Joint Venture at 
an average yield of 6.8% and with 
a lease length of over 15 years.
Above: 74,000 sq ft retail park in King’s Lynn sold for £24.0 million at a NIY of 5.8% 
The property was purchased in 2011 for £15.1 million and has undergone complete 
refurbishment with six new lettings to Next, B&M, DFS, Tapi, Poundland and Greggs. Since 
purchase, the rental income has increased by 47% and the WAULT has risen from 4.3 years 
to 13.3 years.

Finances strengthened 
and diversiﬁed
Our ﬁnancing arrangements remain 
aligned to our property strategy and 
we have continued to strengthen our 
debt facilities with new lenders and 
ﬂexible arrangements. 
During the year, we entered into a 
£130 million private debt placement 
at a blended coupon of 2.7% and 
a weighted average maturity of 
8.3 years. This increased headroom 
available under our facilities which, 
as at 31 March 2017 , was £299.7 million. 
In addition, our £95 million equity raising 
in the year has given us the ﬂexibility to 
accelerate our distribution investments 
and developments without impacting 
on our conservative approach 
to gearing. 
As at 31 March, LTV was 30%, average 
debt maturity was 5.2 years and our cost 
of debt was 3.5% with a marginal cost 
on drawing further debt of just 1.5%.

Our disciplined 
investment approach
We focus on 
achieving attractive 
risk-adjusted returns 
which are structurally 
supported and 
underpin a steady 
long term income 
return proﬁle
The sustained low interest rate and uncertain environment has driven strong 
demand for long duration assets with stable cash ﬂows that are less sensitive 
to economic cycles. 
However, not all income is the same. Whilst strong and sustainable income with 
structural support will endure, weak and over-rented income will be exposed 
as structurally challenged assets see their income shortening. We are therefore 
increasingly wary over the pricing of some assets where cash ﬂows are at risk 
from continuing defensive capital expenditure and ongoing structural change. 
The yield gap between the very good and the poor assets has arguably 
compressed too far. As such we believe that structural changes will put some 
of these capitalisation rates under outward pressure.
Our disciplined investment approach continues to focus on delivering 
attractive risk-adjusted returns which are structurally supported and underpin 
a steady long term income return proﬁle for our shareholders. We will behave 
rationally through maintaining a margin of safety in our actions whilst retaining 
appropriate portfolio liquidity and ﬂexibility. 
We continue to see attractive investment opportunities where we can leverage 
our relationships and expertise, and we remain conﬁdent in our business model 
and ability to deliver on our strategic objectives and priorities.
Outlook
17 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Marketplace
The UK economy remains relatively robust, however recent GDP numbers 
are trending lower and inﬂation measures are trending higher as ripples 
of political and economic uncertainty continue.
Uncertain times lead many to seek those things that are more certain. 
In an uncertain world with strong tailwinds, we believe that providing 
a strong income proposition underpinned by a structurally supported 
real estate sector in assets with strong fundamentals creates certainty 
providing organic growth over time. Here we explain more.
The Macro Environment
The retail landscape continues 
to evolve and is in a state of ﬂux. 
Almost a decade on from the global 
ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, consumer 
attitudes and shopping habits have 
changed, driven by the continued 
accelerating pace of technological 
change and a shift in the traditional 
paradigm that each generation can 
expect to enjoy a better standard 
of living.
Online continues to gain market share 
from 13% of all non food retail sales 
in 201 1 to an expected 26% by 2020. 
1.2 billion parcels were delivered last 
year with next day delivery options 
increasing and a reduction in order 
cut off times.
Today’s consumer environment 
makes it ever more crucial for retailers 
to adapt to keep up.
The pace of change has never been 
this fast before, but is likely to never 
be this slow again. The compounding 
impact of technological change 
is creating an accelerating pace 
of change.
A decade on from the introduction 
of the iPhone, the consumer is 
increasingly comfortable with the 
interaction of technology throughout 
life and recognises the beneﬁts it 
brings and the ability it has to reduce 
frictional factors of every-day life.
The growth of new technologies, 
devices and channels is increasing 
the number of ways in which a 
consumer can engage with retailers 
and the route to purchase is no longer 
one dimensional through the store.
As a result, retailers are having 
to invest heavily in their digital 
infrastructure and logistics and 
fulﬁlment offer.
The major shifts at play have, 
unsurprisingly, taken their toll on 
retailers. Across the sector, operating 
margins have shrunk as cut throat 
competition and the cost of 
meeting consumer expectations 
for retail theatre as part of an 
in-store experience and a seamless 
omni-channel offer weighs on the 
operating costs of the business.
As retailers seek to grow revenue 
by meeting consumer demands 
through multiple interaction points 
and building brand loyalty, retailers 
are also having to reduce costs 
in other areas to ensure it delivers 
the level of investment required 
to remain relevant.
As a result, real estate has become 
more in focus than ever before. 
Store portfolios are shrinking as 
footfall and store sales decline with 
heavy investment into distribution 
and logistics operations to meet 
the continued growth of online sales.

The Winning Sectors of Retail
The change in the retailing 
landscape and wider structural 
mega trends are driving demand 
for a range of different types of 
warehousing. We look to invest 
tactically across the logistics sector 
to beneﬁt from the characteristics 
and investment propositions of each 
of the sub-sectors.
Mega  
Distribution
Regional 
Distribution
Urban 
Logistics
Large scale modern distribution units greater than 
500,000 sq ft located close to major arterial routes. 
Strategically located to serve the customer and attract 
labour pools.
Mid size units between 100,000 sq ft and 500,000 sq ft 
serving as regional hubs and creating the connecting link 
in any modern supply chain.
A smaller logistics unit allowing the ﬁnal journey of 
delivery. Strategically located in or close to dense areas 
of population to meet increasing consumer demands for 
next and same day delivery.
The UK convenience sector is a long standing feature of 
UK communities, however it is changing – from being shops 
used largely for emergency or distress purchases to being 
a regular part of many consumers’ grocery shopping 
repertoire. Footfall has declined by 15% across the high 
street since 2008 however convenience retail continues 
to perform strongly as online shoppers look to top up 
shop on a more regular basis to inﬁll their larger shopping 
needs. Retailers continue to expand their exposure with 
retailers such as M&S Simply Food targeting in excess of 200 
additional stores in an environment where they continue 
to consolidate general merchandising stores across the 
wider estate.
Distribution & Logistics
Convenience Led  
Retail and Long Income
Amazon’s UK business generated 
£7 .4 billion of revenue in 2016 which 
was an increase of 21% on 2015 and 
represents 7% of its worldwide sales. 
Since 2010, Amazon has invested 
£6.4 billion in its UK operations and it 
employs nearly 20,000 people.
Amazon’s UK logistics capabilities 
are unrivalled. It doubled its UK 
logistics footprint in 2016 and 
accounted for c.20% of take up. 
The urban logistics infrastructure 
that they are building is evidence 
of the importance they attach 
to same day, even same hour, 
delivery, setting new benchmarks 
for the competition to match.

Q1
Long term average
Demand across the logistics market 
(>100,000 sq ft) remains above long 
term averages of c.20 million sq ft per 
annum, driven mainly by retailers, third 
party logistics companies and major 
parcel carriers. In total, these occupiers 
accounted for 73% of total take up in the 
year to March 2017 . 
Together with the more traditional 
occupiers such as construction, food and 
automotive industries, total take up was 
31.0 million sq ft for the 12 months to March 
2017 with grade A at 23.6 million sq ft. 
Amazon is believed to have accounted 
for c.20% of all take up in 2016 and 
although this is not expected to be 
repeated in 2017 , the depth of demand 
is broad and robust suggesting another 
very strong year to come.
The resultant demand has led to an acute 
shortage of supply. CBRE estimate that 
only 10.8 million sq ft or six months’ new 
and grade A supply is available in the 
market across properties greater than 
100,000 sq ft with another 10.3 million sq ft 
second hand space available. 
With limited speculative development 
ongoing at 4.3 million sq ft, the supply 
constrained market dynamics are likely 
to continue. 
In more urban areas land is completing 
for alternative uses, such as residential 
together with an increase in demand.
This is causing further pressure on rental 
levels leading to strong rental growth in 
land constrained markets such as the 
regional and urban logistics sub sector.
As the need for increased and more timely 
deliveries continues as more consumers 
adopt online shopping, environmental 
considerations become increasingly 
important. Increased traffic congestion, 
CO 2 emissions and often noise pollution 
mean that urban neighbourhoods are 
historically incompatible. 
The market is beginning to respond 
positively to these challenges and is 
considering new and innovative ways 
to continue to meet modern day 
requirements whilst remaining sympathetic 
to our environment. This is likely to lead 
to further demand in other locations 
adding increased pressure to a supply 
constrained market.

The retail market evolution continues with distribution, 
logistics and convenience retail real estate sectors winning 
out as the shift to online is further embraced. Total return 
for the distribution sector was 8.1% in the year to 31 March 
2017 according to IPD, outperforming the overall property 
market by 350bps. 
The UK is the most sophisticated online shopping market 
in the world with over 75% of UK shoppers actively online. 
The proportion of non food retail sales online in 2020 
is expected to be 26% compared to 20% now. This will 
place further pressure on occupiers to be ﬁt for purpose 
and ensure they win at least their share of the growth. 
Technology will continue to evolve to the beneﬁt of the 
online shopping experience and drive further growth.
Demand and supply imbalances within the market, fuelled 
by this shift to online shopping, suggests that the relative 
property performance will continue. 
We anticipate another strong year with demand and 
supply constraints causing further rental pressure 
delivering a year of solid total returns. Longer term trends 
will persist providing strong, long, durable cash ﬂows in a 
winning sector.

The demand and supply imbalance 
is leading to rental pressure across 
the logistics market. According to 
IPD, rental growth for the distribution 
sector as a whole for the 12 months 
to March 2017 recorded 3.0%. 
Rental growth varies across the 
speciﬁc sub sectors of the logistics 
market as well as across different 
regions of the UK. 
Urban or close to urban locations 
are seeing particularly strong rental 
growth as the land competes for 
alternative uses and occupiers 
ﬁght to take the locations that 
meet the delivery demands of 
the end consumer.
The distribution and logistics sector 
continues to attract a high level of 
investor interest. 
Attracted by the structural and 
mega trends that beneﬁt the sector, 
the additional beneﬁts of long lease 
length, limited gross to net income 
leakage and robust covenant 
strengths mean that investment 
yields have continued to fall during 
the period. 
According to CBRE prime distribution 
yields stand at 5.0% compared to 
5.8% three years ago.

25 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Investment review
We invest in structurally supported real estate that 
delivers repetitive, dependable and growing 
income. Our investment activity in the year was 
focused on urban logistics investments largely 
funded by mature retail park sales.
Valentine Beresford
Investment Director
Distribution investments
£107m
Structural support for distribution 
We have been a signiﬁcant beneﬁciary 
of an early move into distribution. 
The demand/supply dynamics for this 
sector have strengthened considerably 
and remain highly attractive. 2016 was 
a record year for occupier take up and 
supply remains restricted with limited 
speculative development. This is driving 
sustainable rental growth.
High quality distribution portfolio
The value of our distribution assets, 
including developments, increased 
to £950.2 million, representing 62% of 
the total portfolio. This is expected 
to grow to over 70% as we complete 
developments and further investments. 
Our distribution investments are 100% 
let and have a WAULT of 12.9 years, 
with 57 .8% of income subject to 
contractual uplifts. 
Disciplined investing in distribution
The investment market for mega 
and regional warehousing remains 
competitive, particularly where assets 
are let to strong covenants on long 
leases. We have, however, remained 
disciplined and not chased the market.
Despite the sale of our HUT Group 
warehouse, we increased our 
mega and regional exposure in the 
year through further development 
completions. We spent £71.0 million 
on our Wakeﬁeld and Warrington 
developments, achieving a blended 
yield of 6.6%, which is c.150bps 
better than completed investment 
yields. We also acquired a regional 
warehouse let to One Stop in Wakeﬁeld 
for £9.5 million.
£97 million of investments 
in urban logistics
During the year, we increased our 
urban logistics portfolio signiﬁcantly to 
£160.8 million through 15 acquisitions. 
These acquisitions have enhanced 
our end to end logistics portfolio.
They are typically 50-100,000 sq ft, 
and provide ‘spoke’ operations for 
larger ‘hubs’. They are well located 
and facilitate next day and same 
day delivery to major cities and 
conurbations. They are increasingly 
critical to the distribution networks for 
retailers, third party logistics providers 
and other operators in meeting rising 
consumer delivery expectations. 
Our average yield on acquisitions was 
6.2%, which is c.100bps better than 
for larger warehouse investments. 
These assets offer strong rental growth 
prospects as evidenced by the ERV 
growth of 9.5% achieved on our 
existing assets. 
We remain excited by the opportunities 
in urban logistics where we continue 
to leverage our relationships to often 
secure off market purchases. Since the 
year end, we have acquired a further 
£23.9 million of assets.

Signiﬁcant further retail sales
As at 31 March 2017 , our retail parks 
represented 13% of the overall portfolio 
and this weighting has more than 
halved over two years. Our long 
income JV retail assets represented 
7% and our convenience retail assets 
accounted for 6% of the portfolio.
Retail disposal activity was particularly 
strong in the year at £127 .6 million. 
The key retail disposals were at Newry, 
King’s Lynn and Christchurch which 
totalled £89.2 million and represented 
the opportunity to monetise several 
of our larger retail park investments 
following intense asset management 
activity and where business plans had 
been fully executed. 
Post year end, we disposed of our 
Morrisons retail asset in Loughborough 
at a very attractive yield of 4.3%. 
Leisure asset sales
During the year, we sold an Odeon 
cinema in Taunton for £9.1 million. 
Post year end, we sold a further cinema 
in Birkenhead for £5.8 million. 
The sales have reduced our cinema 
ownership to six which account for 
£3.5 million of income per annum, 
100% of which is RPI linked, and have 
a WAULT of 21.3 years. We continue 
to see strong buying appetite for our 
cinema portfolio. 
Opportunistic retail acquisitions
Our MIPP Joint Venture acquired two 
single let warehouses for £18.4 million 
(Group Share: £9.2 million) at a yield of 
6.8% and continues to see opportunities 
in selective high quality assets that 
are smaller lot sizes and offer the 
potential to generate stable, consistent 
income returns. 
Following discussions with our Joint 
Venture partner, we have agreed 
to extend the term of the MIPP Joint 
Venture by a further three years 
to 2023. 
21 Residential disposals
At Moore House in Chelsea, our last 
remaining residential asset in which 
we have a 40% share, we continue 
to patiently sell down individual units. 
Purchaser interest has remained strong 
since last autumn and we sold 13 units 
in the second half of the year, taking 
the number sold in the year to 21. 
A further two units have been sold post 
period end and ten are currently under 
offer. There are 58 units remaining of the 
original 149 owned. 
Two urban logistics acquisitions in Leeds for £12 million 
During the year, we acquired two modern and well located urban logistics 
warehouses in Leeds. The warehouses are 100,000 sq ft and 49,000 sq ft in size 
and are let to Vision Alert (pictured) and Siemens. The aggregate price paid 
was £1 1.9 million, reﬂecting a blended NIY of 6.0% and a reversionary yield 
of 6.5%.

Our asset management and development 
activity continue to deliver value driven by 
our occupational intelligence.
Mark Stirling
Asset Director
WAULT
12.8 years
Delivering long term 
sustainable income
As an important driver of our repetitive 
income, we continued to achieve long 
lease lengths from our activity. The 33 
lettings in the year were agreed at 
an average lease length of 18.2 years 
and our lettings to Amazon and Eddie 
Stobart in the year were particularly 
signiﬁcant transactions. This activity 
helped to maintain our WAULT at 
12.8 years (12.1 years to break) which 
remains one of the longest in the sector. 
Only 1.2% of our income expires over 
the next three years, and over 17% 
of income has a WAULT of 20 years 
or greater.
Protecting the reliability 
of our income
Maintaining a strong tenant list with 
high occupier satisfaction is a key 
priority. Our occupancy rate at the 
year end was 99.6%, a high level that 
has been maintained for several years. 
We have a high quality list of tenants as 
reﬂected in our top ﬁve tenants which 
account for 34% of income and consist 
of Primark, Dixons Carphone, M&S, 
Argos and Eddie Stobart. 
Our gross to net income ratio of 
98.6% reﬂects our further alignment 
to distribution where operational 
requirements are minimal.
Achieving income growth
Through 69 occupier transactions we 
generated £7 .1 million of additional 
income and like for like income 
growth of 4.6%. The 33 new lettings 
delivered £5.8 million of income whilst 
contractual income uplifts and open 
market rent reviews helped to generate 
£1.3 million of additional income. 
With 52% of our rental income 
beneﬁting from ﬁxed or inﬂation linked 
uplifts, our portfolio has certainty of 
income growth.

with potential tenants on the 
remaining space
• Nottingham, where Hillarys Blinds 
extended their lease to ten years
• Newark, where we installed 1MW of 
solar, generating additional income 
of £0.1 million per annum. 
At our 1 14,000 sq ft development in 
Crawley a pre-let has been agreed on 
35,000 sq ft and we expect to sign the 
letting shortly.
Retail lettings
26 retail lettings were signed during 
the year. The key lettings were at:
• Tonbridge, where the former B&Q 
unit is fully pre-let following lettings 
with Home Bargains, Go-Outdoors, 
Jollyes, Costa and, most recently, 
with Carpetright
• Launceston, where the former B&Q

with B&M, M&S and Costa in the 
second half of the year
• Kirkstall, where lettings were signed 
with Peacocks, Holland & Barrett, 
Shoezone and Specsavers
• Dartford, where Wickes has signed 
a 20 year lease on 40,000 sq ft at 
our recently acquired investment
• Ipswich, where Wickes signed a 
15 year lease on 21,000 sq ft at 
our development and Costa has 
signed a 15 year lease on 2,000 sq ft. 
We are under offer on letting the 
remaining space 
At our last remaining office in Marlow, 
two leases were signed across 21,000 
sq ft. The property is 96.7% occupied. 
Rent reviews
Including contractual uplifts, 36 rent 
reviews were agreed across 4.1 million 
sq ft adding £1.3 million of income 
at 4.6% above passing and 4.3% 
above ERV. 
Rental growth on our distribution 
assets was strong and we settled nine 
reviews at 5.0% above previous passing, 
three of which were open market 
reviews on urban logistics and regional 
warehouses where the average uplift 
was 16.9% above passing on a ﬁve 
yearly equivalent basis. 
On our retail and leisure assets, we 
settled 27 rent reviews at 3.0% above 
previous passing and 6.5% above ERV. 
The majority of these reviews were 
inﬂation linked rent reviews and seven 
were open market reviews which were 
settled at 4.4% above previous passing.

Developed in the year
1. 1 million sq ft
Short cycle developments 
Following the completion of 1.9 million 
sq ft of developments last year, we 
successfully completed 1.1 million sq ft 
of further developments in the period 
representing £7 .9 million of additional 
income. The blended yield on cost for 
these developments was 6.5%.
Committed developments currently 
total 0.7 million sq ft, of which 
0.6 million sq ft relates to distribution 
developments at Dagenham, Stoke 
and Crawley all of which are expected 
to be completed within 6-12 months. 
The blended yield on cost for all 
committed development is anticipated 
to be 6.3%.
We continue to de-risk our pipeline 
developments. At Bedford, where the 
site has planning for up to 700,000 sq ft, 
a six month extension has been agreed 
to purify the conditions of purchase 
with the council. We anticipate 
completing the land purchase  
by the end of 2017 .
Property valuation and return 
Despite continued political and 
economic uncertainty, we generated 
a positive valuation movement 
of £21.0 million for the year. Our 
£44.0 million valuation gain in the 
second half more than reversed the 
£23.0 million valuation loss that we saw 
in the ﬁrst half. Our actions accounted 
for 77 .1% of the total valuation uplift for 
the year.
Our sector leading occupancy rates 
and lease lengths within the structurally 
winning real estate sectors continue to 
provide strong support to our valuations 
delivering a total capital return of 1.7% 
and signiﬁcantly outperformed the IPD 
All Property return measure of −0.1%.

Based on anticipated rents
Distribution real estate continues to see 
healthy demand in both the investment 
and occupational market. As a result, it 
is one of the best performing real estate 
subsectors and delivered a capital 
return of 2.8%. Our distribution assets 
strongly outperformed the subsector 
generating a capital return of 4.4%, 
as a result of both the quality of our 
assets and our development and 
asset management action. 
The Company’s retail and leisure 
portfolio saw a 0.5% valuation increase, 
with a 2.9% decline in the retail park 
portfolio offset by the strength in our 
long income retail, convenience and 
leisure assets. 
Our last two non-core buildings in 
Marlow and Moore House saw adverse 
valuation impacts over the year. 
Overall, our office and residential assets 
fell in value by 10.5%.
The valuation uplift, combined with 
the portfolio’s sustainable and growing 
income, helped us to deliver a total 
property return of 7 .4%, substantially 
beating the IPD All Property return 
measure of 4.6%. We believe that 
income will be the major component 
of total returns going forward, 
and we expect that the portfolio’s 
strong income characteristics 
will help to deliver further total 
return outperformance.

Martin McGann
Finance Director
Our commitment to repositioning the portfolio 
into our preferred distribution sector has delivered 
growth in secure and sustainable income and 
property values this year. 
EPRA earnings per share
8.2p
Overview
We have achieved both earnings 
and NAV growth this year and have 
strengthened and de-risked our 
ﬁnancing position through a private 
debt placement and an equity placing.
EPRA earnings have increased by 
5.3% to £51.0 million or 8.2p per share, 
compared with £48.5 million or 7 .8p 
last year. Reported proﬁt under IFRS has 
fallen by £19.7 million to £63.0 million 
primarily as a result of lower valuation 
gains this year. EPRA NAV is 
£1,030.5 million or 149.8p per share, an 
increase of 1 1.8% or 1.4% on a per share 
basis which reﬂects the impact of the 
equity placing. 
In September, we entered into a new 
£130 million private debt placement 
which diversiﬁed our funding sources 
and provided further capacity for 
investment. We supplemented this 
in March by an equity placing of 
62.8 million ordinary shares which 
raised gross proceeds of £95.5 million. 
Our loan to value ratio has improved 
as a result of the debt raised and equity 
issued in the year, falling to 30% from 
38% last year. Other ﬁnancing metrics 
remain strong, with average cost of 
debt unchanged at 3.5% and loan 
maturity, despite the passing of a year, 
of 5.2 years (2016: 5.6 years). We have 
£299.7 million of undrawn debt facilities, 
up from £69.9 million last year.
Our strong ﬁnancial results and robust 
portfolio metrics have enabled us to 
increase the dividend for the year to 
7 .5p per share, up 3.4% from last year. 
Three quarterly payments totalling 
5.4p per share have been made to 
date and a further 2.1p is proposed for 
payment on 10 July 2017 . The dividend 
continues to be fully covered by EPRA 
earnings at 109%. A scrip alternative 
to a cash dividend payment was 
offered to shareholders for all dividends 
declared in the year to 31 March 2017 
and it is our intention to continue to 
offer shareholders this choice.

Alternative performance measures
The Group uses EPRA earnings 
and EPRA net assets as alternative 
performance measures as they 
highlight the underlying recurring 
performance of the Group’s property 
rental business. 
The EPRA alternative measures are 
widely recognised and used by public 
real estate companies and seek to 
improve transparency, comparability 
and relevance of published results.
The Group’s key EPRA measures 
are summarised in the table below 
and also in note 8 to the ﬁnancial 
statements and Supplementary  
notes i to vii. 
Deﬁnitions of EPRA alternative 
performance measures are also given 
in the Glossary on page 148.
Alternative 
performance 
measure
Rationale
EPRA earnings Recurring earnings from core operational activities. It excludes 
items considered to be non recurring or exceptional in 
accordance with EPRA Best Practice Recommendations 
including property and derivative valuation movements, proﬁts 
and losses on disposal of properties and ﬁnancing break costs. 
It is presented as it is one of the Group’s KPIs, an industry 
standard comparable measure and supports the level 
of dividend payments. A reconciliation between EPRA 
earnings and IFRS reported proﬁt is provided in note 8  
to the ﬁnancial statements.
EPRA net assets EPRA net asset value is a key measure of the Group’s overall 
performance reﬂecting both income and capital returns. It 
excludes the fair valuation of derivative instruments that are 
reported in IFRS net assets. A reconciliation between EPRA 
net assets and IFRS reported net assets is provided in note 8 
to the ﬁnancial statements.
Presentation of ﬁnancial information
The Group ﬁnancial statements on 
pages 1 17 to 137 are prepared in 
accordance with IFRS. 
We account for our interests in joint 
ventures using the equity method as 
required by IFRS 1 1 which means the 
results and investment in joint venture 
entities are presented as a single 
line item in the consolidated income 
statement and balance sheet.
Management monitors the 
performance of the business on a 
proportionally consolidated basis which 
includes the Group’s share of income, 
expenses, assets and liabilities of joint 
ventures on a line by line basis in the 
income statement and balance sheet. 
The ﬁgures and commentary in 
this review are consistent with our 
management approach as we believe 
this provides a more meaningful 
analysis of overall performance.

The growth in EPRA earnings was driven

Based on properties held throughout 2016 
and 2017 on a proportionately consolidated 
basis to exclude the distortive impact of 
acquisitions, disposals and development 
completions in either period
The existing portfolio generated 
£0.7 million of additional income and 
the Group’s completed developments 
delivered a further £5.1 million. 
Net disposals reduced income by 
£1.8 million, offset by marginal savings 
in property costs of £0.1 million. 
Our net income as a percentage of 
gross rents has increased marginally 
to 98.6%. 
Administrative costs 
Administrative costs have fallen by 2.9% 
to £13.4 million after capitalising staff 
costs of £1.8 million (2016: £1.5 million) in 
respect of time spent on development 
activity in the year. 
EPRA cost ratio
The Group’s cost base continues to 
be closely monitored and the EPRA 
cost ratio is used as a key measure 
of effective cost management.

The EPRA cost ratio for the year, 
including direct vacancy costs, was 
16% compared with 17% last year. 
The ratio reﬂects total operating costs, 
including the cost of vacancy, as a 
percentage of gross rental income. 
The full calculation is shown in 
Supplementary note iv on page 144.
Net ﬁnance costs 
Net ﬁnance costs, excluding the costs 
associated with repaying debt and 
terminating hedging arrangements on 
sales and reﬁnancing in the year were 
£18.4 million, an increase of £1.7 million 
over the previous year. 
This was due to decreases in interest 
receivable from forward funded 
development projects and interest 
capitalised on developments 
of £0.4 million and £0.7 million 
respectively. In addition, increased 
Group bank interest costs of £1.4 million 
associated with higher average levels 
of debt were offset by lower joint 
venture interest costs of £0.8 million 
as a result of repaying debt facilities. 
The movements are shown in notes 5 
and 10 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Our interest rate exposure is hedged 
by a combination of ﬁxed and forward 
starting interest rate swaps and caps as 
discussed on page 39. 
Share of joint ventures 
EPRA earnings from joint venture 
investments were £5.8 million, a 
reduction of £0.8 million over last year 
due to the impact of disposals as 
reﬂected in the table below.

Taxation
As the Group is a UK REIT, any 
income and capital gains from our 
qualifying property rental business 
are exempt from UK corporation tax. 
Any UK income that does not qualify 
as property income within the REIT 
regulations is subject to UK tax in the 
normal way.
The Group’s tax strategy is compliance 
oriented; to account for tax on an 
accurate and timely basis and 
meet all REIT compliance and 
reporting obligations.
We seek to minimise the level of tax risk 
and to structure our affairs based on 
sound commercial principles. We strive 
to maintain an open dialogue with 
HMRC with a view to identifying and 
solving issues as they arise.

its ﬁndings to the Board. The Board 
also considers risk at a high level at 
each quarterly meeting via a risk 
dashboard. The Finance Director has 
overall responsibility for the execution 
of the tax strategy.
We pay business rates on void 
properties and stamp duty land tax. 
In addition we collect VAT, employment 
taxes and withholding tax on dividends 
and pay these over to HMRC.
We continue to monitor and 
comfortably comply with the REIT 
balance of business tests and distribute 
as a Property Income Distribution 90% 
of REIT relevant earnings to ensure our 
REIT status is maintained. 
Our formal tax strategy has been 
published on the Group’s website 
at www.londonmetric.com.
Dividend
The Directors have approved a fourth 
quarterly interim dividend of 2.1p 
per share, payable on 10 July 2017 
to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 9 June 2017 , 
bringing the total amount paid and 
payable for 2017 to 7 .5p, an increase of 
0.25p compared with the previous year. 
This year the Company has 
commenced a quarterly dividend 
payment cycle and has offered 
shareholders a scrip alternative 
to cash payments. 
The ﬁrst two quarterly payments 
totalling 3.6p per share were paid as 
Property Income Distributions (PIDs) in 
the year. The third quarterly dividend 
of 1.8p per share has since been paid 
as a PID. The fourth quarterly dividend 
will comprise a PID of 1.3p per share 
and an ordinary dividend of 0.8p 
per share and a scrip alternative will 
be offered.
IFRS reported proﬁt
The Group’s reported proﬁt for the 
year was £63.0 million compared with 
£82.7 million last year. The reduction 
was primarily due to lower property 
valuation gains realised, offset by a 
favourable movement in derivatives 
compared with the previous year as 
reﬂected in the table below. 
Other movements in reported proﬁt 
include the loss on sale of properties 
and associated debt and hedging 
break costs, which together reduced 
proﬁt by £9.1 million this year as 
opposed to increasing proﬁt by 
£1.6 million last year. 
Disposals of mature retail parks, 
principally at Newry, King’s Lynn 
and Christchurch, generated losses 
over book value of £4.5 million. 
The total proﬁt over original cost 
on sales in the year was £7 .4 million 
or 3.8% (2016: £37 .9 million or 23.0%). 
Disposals are discussed in detail in 
the Investment review section of the 
Strategic report on pages 26 to 29. 
In April 2016, we bought down 
£66.3 million of legacy out of the 
money interest rate swaps at a cost 
of £3.5 million as reﬂected in the table 
as hedging close out costs.
The IFRS reported proﬁt excluding 
the fair value of derivatives, together 
with the dividend charge in the year 
of £43.7 million, represents a total 
accounting return of 6.4%.
A full reconciliation between EPRA 
earnings and IFRS reported proﬁt is

Despite the market uncertainty over 
the past year, we have seen property 
values increase by £21.0 million and 
have delivered a total property return 
of 7 .4% compared to the IPD index of 
4.6%. Further detail can be found in the 
Asset management and development 
review on page 32.
The Group’s commitment to 
development activity is demonstrated 
by the signiﬁcant spend of £68.7 million 
in the year which included £52.7 million 
on forward funded developments 
principally at Warrington, Wakeﬁeld 
and Crawley. At the year end, the 
Group had capital commitments of 
£57 .8 million as reported in note 9 to the 
ﬁnancial statements, relating primarily 
to committed developments in 
progress at Dagenham, Crawley, Stoke 
and Ipswich. Further detail can be 
found in the Asset management and 
development review on pages 30 to 33.
The Group acquired 16 distribution 
assets and two retail assets through 
its MIPP joint venture in the year as 
reported in the Investment review on 
pages 26 to 29.
It has continued to dispose of mature 
retail assets that have delivered their 
business plans and recycle capital 
into end to end distribution units 
which offer attractive yields, strong 
rental growth prospects and asset 
management opportunities.
The disposal of 13 commercial and 21 
residential assets in the year generated 
proceeds of £201.9 million and reduced 
the carrying value of property by 
£198.2 million. 
Included within the trade and other 
receivables balance of £18.8 million on 
the Group balance sheet is £14.3 million 
due on completion of the sale of Alban 
Retail Park, Bedford.

The Group and joint venture split is 
shown in Supplementary note iii on 
page 143.
In September 2016, the Group 
entered into a private placement 
at a blended coupon of 2.7% and 
a weighted average maturity of 
8.3 years. The proceeds were used to 
repay existing unsecured debt which 
remained available to draw in full.
In March 2017 , the group completed a 
successful equity placing of 62.8 million 
ordinary shares raising gross proceeds 
of £95.5 million. It used the proceeds 
in part to further repay its existing 
unsecured facility, increasing available 
undrawn facilities to £299.7 million at 
the year end.
The Group’s share of joint venture 
gross debt has fallen by £8.4 million or 
13.4% since last year as a result of sales 
and consequent debt repayments. 
The Moore House debt facility was 
repaid in full in December 2016. 
The Group’s key ﬁnancial ratios remain 
strong with loan to value falling to 
30% and the average cost of debt 
remaining stable at 3.5%. We intend 
to keep LTV below 40% to provide 
sufficient ﬂexibility to take advantage of 
opportunities and execute transactions 
whilst maintaining sufficient headroom 
under our gearing covenants should 
property values decline.
The Group’s policy is to substantially 
de-risk the impact of movements in 
interest rates by entering into hedging 
arrangements. Independent advice 
is given by J C Rathbone Associates. 
At 31 March 2017 , 87% of our exposure 
to interest rate ﬂuctuations was hedged 
by way of current and forward starting 
swaps and caps assuming existing debt 
facilities are fully drawn (2016: 84%). 
We continue to monitor our hedging 
proﬁle in light of forecast interest 
rate movements.
The Group has comfortably complied 
throughout the year with the ﬁnancial 
covenants contained in its debt 
funding arrangements and has 
substantial levels of headroom. 
Covenant compliance is regularly stress 
tested for changes in capital values 
and income. 
The Group’s unsecured facility and 
private placement loan notes contain 
gearing and interest cover ﬁnancial 
covenants. At 31 March 2017 , the 
Group’s gearing ratio as deﬁned within 
these funding arrangements was 43% 
compared with the maximum limit 
of 125% and interest cover ratio was 
4.5 times compared with the minimum 
level of 1.5 times. 
Cash ﬂow
During the year, the Group’s cash 
balances increased by £0.3 million

reﬂect property acquisitions, including 
those classiﬁed as forward funded 
developments, of £147 .3 million and 
capital expenditure of £25.9 million 
offset by net proceeds from disposals of 
£165.0 million and distributions from joint 
ventures of £16.1 million.
Net repayment of bank facilities in

from the equity placing of £92.8 million.

39 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Risk management
As an income focused REIT our strategic priorities 
continue to be the delivery of sustainable, progressive 
earnings and long term capital growth.
Every business faces inherent risk 
and uncertainty. Whilst risk cannot be 
completely eliminated we recognise 
that effective risk management 
reduces the negative impact of 
risk on our business and improves 
our prospects for achieving our 
strategic objectives. 
Our risk management process
The Board operates a culture of 
embedding risk consideration 
into its decision making processes. 
It recognises its responsibility to 
undertake a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Company 
and the extent to which it is willing to 
accept some level of risk in achieving 
its strategy. Risk appetite is low where 
it prejudices strategic objectives and 
controls are in place to minimise the 
level of residual risk.
The Board considers risk at a high level 
at each meeting via a risk dashboard. 
The dashboard monitors material issues 
so that key risks can be managed 
appropriately and new risks identiﬁed 
early enabling action to be taken to 
remove or reduce the risk and any 
potential negative impact. The Board 
also considers the long term viability 
of the Company in the context of the 
principal risks it faces and its Viability 
statement is prepared in accordance 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The responsibility for detailed assurance 
on the risk management process has 
been delegated by the Board to the 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee 
carries out a detailed review of the 
risk register and internal controls at 
least once a year to consider the 
effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control processes and 
reports its ﬁndings to the Board. The risk 
register was last presented to and 
considered by the Audit Committee 
in March 2017 . 
The Executive Committee is 
responsible for the identiﬁcation of 
risk and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of the systems of 
internal controls, assisted by senior 
management. Appropriate mitigation 
plans are developed based on 
an assessment of the impact 
and likelihood of a risk occurring. 
Members of the Executive Committee 
are closely involved in day to day 
matters and the Company has a 
relatively low number of personnel 
all operating from one office location. 
This and the ﬂat management structure 
enable risks to be quickly identiﬁed 
so appropriate responses can be put 
in place. 
The risk register rates the signiﬁcance 
and probability of each risk identiﬁed 
by management as having either 
a high, medium or low impact. 
Greater weighting is applied the 
higher the signiﬁcance and probability 
of a risk. These weightings are then 
mathematically combined to produce 
an overall gross risk rating which is 
colour coded using a traffic light 
system. Speciﬁc risk management 
safeguards for each risk are identiﬁed, 
detailed and rated as strong, medium 
or weak with greater weighting 
applied the stronger the safeguard.

The gross risk rating and strength of 
safeguards against that risk are then 
combined to produce a resultant 
overall net risk. Consideration is given 
to the implementation of further action 
to reduce risk where it is considered 
necessary. Finally, each risk is allocated 
an owner and details of how the 
safeguards are evidenced is noted. 
The Board has limited control over 
certain external factors such as the 
heightened level of uncertainty 
associated with major political events 
such as the EU Referendum and the 
triggering of Article 50, the UK election 
outcome and the cyclical nature of the 
property market. The Board’s strategy 
over the last few years has however 
been to reshape its UK only portfolio 
into more resilient asset classes closely 
aligned to rapidly changing consumer 
shopping habits.

The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Company 
are those risks identiﬁed as having the potential to cause 
material harm to the business and its ability to execute the 
strategic objectives or exceed the Board’s risk appetite. 
The risks identiﬁed and reported on pages 42 to 47 and in the 
matrix opposite are categorised in a manner consistent with 
the Board’s risk dashboard which it considers at each meeting. 
The rationale for perceived movements in the risks identiﬁed 
are contained within the commentary for each risk category.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the prospects 
of the Group and future viability over 
a three year period, being longer 
than the 12 months required by the 
‘Going Concern’ provision. The Board 
conducted this review taking account of 
the Group’s long term strategy, principal 
risks and risk appetite, current position, 
asset performance and future plans. 
This period was chosen for the 
following reasons:
• The Group’s ﬁnancial business plan 
and detailed budgets cover a rolling 
three year period. The business plan 
includes budgeted proﬁt and cash 
ﬂows and also considers capital 
commitments, dividend cover, 
loan to value, loan covenants and 
REIT compliance metrics. These are 
updated and reviewed at least 
quarterly against actual performance
• It reﬂects the short cycle nature of 
the Group’s developments and asset 
management initiatives. Six forward 
funded developments completed 
in the year at Ferndown, Leicester, 
Liverpool, Wakeﬁeld, Warrington and 
Crawley. All of these developments 
were completed within one year. 
The other committed developments 
in progress at the end of the year, 
including those at Crawley, Stoke 
and Dagenham, are expected 
to complete next year
• The average length of asset 
management initiatives involving 
signiﬁcant reconﬁguration of retail 
parks is under one year
• The Group’s weighted average debt 
maturity at 31 March 201 7 was 5.2 years
• Three years is considered to be the 
optimum balance between long term 
property investment and the inability to 
accurately forecast ahead given the 
cyclical nature of property investment
The Group’s business model consists of a 
base case scenario which only includes 
deals under offer and also an assumed 
case which factors in reinvestment. 
A sensitivity analysis was carried out 
which involved ﬂexing a number of key 
assumptions to consider the impact of 
changes to the Group’s principal risks 
affecting the viability of the business, 
being:
• Changes to macro-economic 
conditions impacting rental income 
levels and property values
• Changes in the retail environment 
impacting occupancy levels 
and lettings
• Changes in the availability of funds 
impacting committed expenditure 
and investment transactions
The business model was stress tested 
to validate its resilience to property 
valuation and rental income decline, as 
well as increases in future libor and swap 
rates. It assessed the impact of these 
movements on future performance, 
liquidity and solvency and the ability 
to ﬁnance forecast transactions and 
committed capital expenditure and 
reﬁnance maturing debt. It took 
into account the ﬂexibility of capital 
expenditure and disposal plans and 
hedging in place.
In addition, further stress testing 
assessed the limits at which key ﬁnancial 
covenants and ratios would be 
breached or deemed unacceptable. 
Property values would need to fall by 
approximately 30% to reach the loan 
to value covenant threshold under the 
existing debt facilities.
The Directors have also taken into 
account the strong ﬁnancial position 
at 31 March 201 7 , signiﬁcant cash and 
available facilities, low LTV and the 
Group’s ability to raise new ﬁnance.
Based on the results of their review, 
the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the three 
year period of their assessment.
Risks which the Board considers have increased 
since last year:
2 – Economic and political outlook
8 – Valuation risk
Risks which the Board considers have remained 
broadly unchanged since last year:
1 – Strategy
3 – Human resources
4 – Systems, processes and ﬁnancial management
5 – Regulatory and tax framework
6 – Investment risk
9 – Transaction and tenant risk
Risks which the Board considers have reduced 
since last year:
7 – Development risk
10 – Capital and ﬁnance risk

Risk, impact, appetite How it is managed Commentary
1 Strategy
That the Company’s 
strategy is unclear 
or unrealistic for the 
current stage of the 
property cycle and 
the economic climate
Impact:
Suboptimal returns for 
shareholders. A potential 
inability to take advantage 
of opportunities and 
effectively manage 
threats. The Company 
may not be able to ensure 
that the people, resources 
and systems are in place 
to ensure ongoing success. 
Appetite:
The Board views this 
as fundamental to 
the business and the 
Company’s reputation.
The Board review and update strategy and 
objectives regularly adapting to changes 
in economic conditions and opportunities 
as they arise.
The Executive Directors are closely 
involved in day to day management and 
the Company operates from one office 
location with a relatively ﬂat organisational 
structure making it easier to identify 
market changes. 
Management have an entrepreneurial 
approach and extensive experience in 
real estate. 
Research is commissioned into consumer 
shopping patterns and occupational 
markets to assist strategic decision making. 
Financial forecasts are updated in light 
of strategic changes and reported to the 
Board and Executive Committee regularly. 
The Group has a rolling three year forecast.
Management has a substantial investment 
in the Company with interests aligned with 
external shareholders. 
The Company’s staffing plan is focused 
on experience and expertise necessary 
to deliver its strategy.
The Company has transitioned its portfolio 
so that 62% is now in the distribution sector. 
This and convenience retail are strong 
performing sectors with real prospects for 
rental and capital growth due to a supply/
demand imbalance driven by structural 
changes in consumer shopping habits. 
Completed developments of 1.1 million 
sq ft of space in the year added rent of 
£7 .9 million per annum. 
Development in progress of 0.7 million sq ft 
is expected to add a further £4.9 million of 
rental income.
Like for like income growth was 4.6% over 
69 lettings and rent reviews.
These strong operational metrics supported 
EPRA earnings of 8.2p per share an 
increase of 5.1% on the prior year.
Executive Directors hold 10.0 million 
shares between them and have unvested 
interests over a further 6.1 million shares 
and comfortably meet the Company’s 
increased shareholding guidelines as 
shown on page 106.

Risk, impact, appetite How it is managed Commentary
2 Economic and political outlook
A downturn or speciﬁc 
sector turbulence may 
result from economic 
and political factors 
Impact:
Poorer than expected 
performance, asset values 
may fall, tenant demand 
and asset liquidity may 
reduce. Debt markets 
may be impacted. 
Appetite:
Market conditions are 
outside of the Company’s 
control.
Research is commissioned into economic 
matters and market volatility is monitored.
The Company only invests in the UK and 
has little exposure to the London market. 
A signiﬁcant proportion of the Company’s 
portfolio is in a resilient asset class with a 
supply/demand imbalance. 
The weighted average unexpired lease 
term is high reducing re-letting risk.
The vacancy rate is low due to strict 
investment and development criteria. 
The tenant base is diversiﬁed. Acquisition 
due diligence considers tenant covenant 
strength. 
Developments and asset management 
initiatives are usually undertaken on  
a pre-let basis or where a researched 
supply/demand imbalance exists.
The Company has medium term, ﬂexible 
funding with signiﬁcant headroom in 
covenant levels and no reliance on sales.
The Company has a weighted average 
unexpired lease term of 12.8 years and an 
EPRA vacancy rate of 0.4%. This continues 
to be amongst the highest and lowest 
respectively in the industry.
Distribution assets now represent 62% of 
the portfolio. Logistics space is still heavily 
under supplied.
£52.7 million of expenditure in the year 
related to forward funded and pre-let 
opportunities. 
Successful equity placing in March 
increased available facilities for further 
investment to £299.7 million.
The Board is conﬁdent that economic 
and political risk is mitigated through the 
makeup of the portfolio with its strong focus 
on distribution and convenience retail. 
The strong portfolio metrics and ﬁnancial 
returns provide protection in the form of 
a sustainable long term income return 
to investors.
  This risk has increased since the last year end. Heightened 
economic and political uncertainty exists from major events such 
as the triggering of Article 50 and the upcoming UK election
Investment review

Asset management and development review

3 Human resources
An inability to attract, 
motivate and retain high 
calibre staff
Impact:
That the Company doesn’t 
have staff with the skills 
and experience to deliver 
its business plan. 
Appetite:
The Board views it as 
vitally important that 
the Company has the 
appropriate level of 
leadership, expertise and 
experience to deliver its 
objectives and adapt 
to change.
The Company maintains an organisational 
structure with clear responsibilities and 
reporting lines.
The remuneration structure is aligned 
to long term performance targets for 
the business with long term share based 
incentive arrangements in place.
Senior management shareholdings in the 
Company are signiﬁcant.
Annual appraisals identify training 
requirements and assess performance.
Specialist agencies are contracted where 
appropriate if there are perceived short 
term skills shortfalls.
The Chairman’s contract was extended 
to 31 March 2018. 
Further consideration will be given to the 
position of Chairman during the course 
of the current year.
The Executive Directors have a signiﬁcant 
shareholding and unvested share 
awards in the Company to incentivise 
performance and retention, providing 
stability in the management structure 
of the business.
Senior managers are incentivised in 
the same way as reﬂected in the table 
on page 96.

43 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Risk, impact, appetite How it is managed Commentary
4 Systems, processes and ﬁnancial management
There are weak controls for 
safeguarding assets and 
supporting strategy
Impact:
Inadequate asset security. 
Potentially suboptimal 
returns and decisions 
made on inaccurate 
information. 
Appetite:
Appetite for such risk is 
low and management 
continually strives to 
monitor and improve 
processes.
The Company has a strong control culture.
Systems security is in place, supported by a 
specialist advisor. Business continuity plans 
are up to date with adequate back up 
which is tested.
Procedures are in place to ensure 
accuracy of the property database 
and data capture.
Assets are safeguarded with appropriate 
levels of insurance.
Appropriate segregation of duties and 
controls over ﬁnancial systems are in place.
Financial information is provided to 
management on a timely basis for 
approval and decision making purposes.
Costs are controlled with procedures to 
ensure that expenditure is valid, properly 
authorised and monitored.
An extension of the property database 
was implemented in the year to improve 
administrative and reporting procedures. 
The risk posed by cyber attacks continues 
to grow as attacker capabilities become 
increasingly sophisticated and open to an 
ever widening and global organised crime 
network. The Board however considers that 
the delivery of the Company’s strategy 
is not dependent on the operation of its 
technology. Strategic risk therefore is not 
materially increased as a result of a cyber 
attack. IT security is an integral part of the 
Company’s risk management and control 
processes and the Audit Committee has 
considered the safeguards in place. 
There is a rolling programme in place for 
IT improvements and updates to ensure 
security, systems and equipment remains 
ﬁt for purpose. 
 No signiﬁcant change from 2016
Audit Committee report

5 Regulatory and tax framework
Non compliance with 
legal or regulatory 
obligations 
Impact:
Fines, penalties, sanctions 
and reputational damage 
which may impact investor 
demand in the Company. 
Potential loss of REIT status. 
Increased costs. Impact 
on re-letting potential of 
an asset. 
Appetite:
The Board has no appetite 
where non compliance 
risks injury or damage 
to staff, tenants, assets, 
shareholders and 
reputation.
There is a clear focus on obligations under 
the Company’s responsible business 
strategy and regulatory inﬂuences 
on the business such as Health and 
Safety, environmental, employment, 
anti-corruption related legislation and 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Responsibility for speciﬁc obligations is 
allocated to individuals and overseen 
by the Executive Committee. External 
specialists provide advice and support.
Staff training is provided. 
The Company receives external specialist 
tax advice.
Compliance with REIT legislation is 
monitored on an ongoing basis for decision 
making purposes and reported.
The impact of legislative changes 
is considered in strategic terms.
The Company may be affected in the 
future by proposed tax changes to 
loss relief should there be any future 
proﬁts which are not covered by its REIT 
exemption. These however are unlikely 
to be material. 
Changes relating to taxation of residential 
property, particularly the rate of SDLT 
has, in addition to economic factors, led 
to a slowdown in the London residential 
market to which the Company still has 
some exposure through its 40% joint venture 
interest in Moore House. The joint venture 
has continued to sell down ﬂats with 21 
being sold in the year.

6 Investment risk
Investment opportunities 
cannot be sourced at 
attractive prices
Impact:
Ability to implement 
strategy and deploy 
capital into value and 
earnings accretive 
investments at risk.
Appetite:
This risk is largely affected 
by matters outside of 
the Board’s control, 
but is minimised by 
having the right people 
and funding in place 
to take advantage of 
opportunities as they arise.
Management’s extensive experience and 
their strong network of connections provide 
insight into the property market and 
opportunities.
Management’s relationship with retailers 
and its ability to forward fund assets is 
an important factor in generating deal 
ﬂow given the difficulty in ﬁnding value 
in income generating assets due to yield 
compression in the market.
The Company acquired £1 16.2 million of 
property with a number of signiﬁcant off 
market transactions. 
The Company recycled capital out of 
mature and non core retail, leisure and 
residential assets with disposals totalling 
£147 .5 million in the year.
 No signiﬁcant change from 2016
Investment review
see page 26
7 Development risk
Excessive capital is 
allocated to activities 
with development risk. 
Developments fail to 
deliver expected returns 
due to inconsistent timing 
with the economic cycle, 
adverse letting conditions, 
increased costs, planning 
or construction delays 
Impact:
Poorer than expected 
performance. 
Appetite:
The Board is willing to 
take some speculative 
development and 
planning risk if it represents 
a relatively small 
proportion of the total 
portfolio and is supported 
by robust research in 
respect of demand and a 
high likelihood of planning 
approval.
The Company only considers short 
cycle and relatively uncomplicated 
development, although management 
have signiﬁcant experience of more 
complex development.
Exposure to development and phasing of 
projects is regularly considered. The overall 
level of exposure to development is low as 
a percentage of the total portfolio.
Standardised appraisals and cost budgets 
are prepared for developments with 
regular monitoring of expenditure against 
budget to highlight potential overruns at 
an early stage. External project managers 
appointed.
Procurement processes include tendering 
and the use of highly regarded ﬁrms 
with track records of delivery to minimise 
uncertainty over costs.
Developments are only undertaken in 
areas of high occupier demand. Signiﬁcant 
pre-lets are secured where possible before 
commencement to de-risk projects. 
Where possible development sites are 
acquired with planning approval in place.
The 357 ,000 sq ft speculative development 
at Warrington was let within ﬁve weeks of 
completion to Amazon.
Development only represents 1.8% of the 
portfolio at the year end.
Ten developments representing 1.1 million 
sq ft of space were delivered in the year 
on time and budget.
Committed development at the year end 
of 0.7 million sq ft was over 50% pre-let.
 This risk has reduced from 2016

Risk, impact, appetite How it is managed Commentary
8 Valuation risk
Assets may devalue 
Impact:
Pressure on NAV growth 
and potentially loan 
covenants.
Appetite:
This is an inherent risk in 
the industry. There is no 
certainty that property 
values will be realised. 
As reported the Board’s strategy has been 
to transition the portfolio into resilient asset 
classes. The property cycle is continually 
monitored with investment and divestment 
decisions made strategically in anticipation 
of changing conditions. 
Property portfolio performance is regularly 
reviewed and benchmarked on an asset 
by asset basis. 
Focus is on income security. Lettings to high 
quality tenants within a diversiﬁed portfolio 
of well located assets and a high weighted 
average unexpired lease term reduces the 
risk of negative movements in a downturn. 
Valuations should continue to be 
supported by a supply/demand 
imbalance in the Company’s preferred 
sector. 
The valuation decline at the Interim 
stage following the outcome of the EU 
Referendum had been recouped by the 
year end with an overall gain in the year 
of £21.0 million.
Delivery of developments on time and 
budget supported valuation assumptions.
The top ten tenants contribute 51.8% of 
contracted commercial rental income.
  Increased risk due to greater economic uncertainty 
Asset management and development review
see page 30
9 Transaction and tenant risk
Property purchases are 
inconsistent with strategy. 
Inadequate due diligence 
is undertaken. Lettings are 
made to inappropriate 
tenants 
Impact:
Pressure exerted on NAV, 
earnings and potentially 
loan covenants.
Appetite:
The Board’s appetite for 
risk arising out of poor due 
diligence processes on 
acquisitions, disposals and 
lettings is low.
Acquisitions are thoroughly evaluated 
through a detailed ﬁnancial, legal and 
operational appraisal prior to Board 
approval. 
Asset management initiatives 
undergo cost-beneﬁt analysis before 
implementation.
External advisors ensure appropriate 
pricing of lease transactions and assist 
acquisition due diligence.
Tenant covenant strength and 
concentration are assessed for all 
acquisitions and leasing transactions.
An experienced property management 
team work closely with tenants and 
consider action for slow payers.
Rent collection is closely monitored and 
reported to identify potential issues.
The Group has a diverse tenant base and 
limited exposure to individual occupiers in 
bespoke properties.
The Company has a very low level of 
tenant default and high occupancy levels.
The EPRA vacancy rate at the year end 
was 0.4%.
There were no signiﬁcant trade debtors 
considered at risk at the year end.
The tenant base has been further 
diversiﬁed during the year with the 
covenant strength of the top ten tenants 
increasing.
The Board considers that the occupational 
market is strong in the distribution and 
convenience retail sectors.

Financing risks
Risk, impact, appetite How it is managed Commentary
10 Capital and ﬁnance risk
The Company has 
insufficient funds and 
credit available to it
Impact:
Implementation of 
strategy is at risk. 
Appetite:
The Board has no appetite 
for imprudently low levels 
of available headroom in 
its reserves or credit lines. 
It accepts a low degree 
of market standard 
inﬂexibility in return for 
the availability of credit. 
Assets which have achieved target returns 
and strategic asset plans are considered 
for sale. 
Cash ﬂow forecasts are monitored closely 
to ensure sufficient funds are available 
to take advantage of investment 
opportunities and meet ﬁnancial 
commitments.
Relationships with a diversiﬁed range of 
lenders are nurtured and loan facilities 
regularly reviewed. The availability 
of debt and the terms on which it is 
available is considered as part of the 
strategy and analysis for each acquisition 
and development. 
Loan facilities incorporate covenant 
headroom, appropriate cure provisions 
and sufficient ﬂexibility to implement asset 
management initiatives. Headroom is 
actively monitored and incorporated into 
forecasts. Non ﬁnancial covenants are also 
closely monitored. 
Gearing levels are carefully considered 
and stress tested before entering into new 
arrangements. A modest level of gearing 
is maintained overall.
The impact of disposals on secured 
loan facilities covering multiple assets 
is considered as part of the decision 
making process. 
Interest rate derivatives are used to ﬁx 
or cap exposure to rising rates. Hedging 
recommendations are received from a 
specialist advisor.
The Company has joint ventures with well 
capitalised partners. Joint venture partners 
are chosen with care to ensure that 
strategies are not misaligned which may 
impact asset value and liquidity.
A private placement was entered into 
in September 2016 at a blended rate of 
2.7% and a weighted average maturity 
of 8.3 years diversifying the Company’s 
lending partners. 
An oversubscribed placing of £95.5 million 
completed in March 2017 to predominantly 
fund distribution acquisitions and a 
distribution development pipeline.
Headroom on the Company’s 
£443.8 million unsecured revolving credit 
facility has been increased as a result of 
the private placement, placing and sales 
providing greater operational ﬂexibility. 
76% of the facility has been extended 
for a further year to April 2022. 
Disposals of £201.9 million and acquisitions 
of £1 16.2 million in the year demonstrate our 
ability to recycle capital.
At 31 March 2017 , the Group had hedging 
in place covering 87% of total available 
debt facilities including joint venture 
arrangements. 
The Company has complied with and 
has signiﬁcant headroom in all ﬁnancial 
covenants.
The Company’s diversiﬁed and 
predominantly unsecured lending base, 
and its derivatives insulate it from credit risks 
associated with one off shocks from any 
single asset.

47 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our approach to Responsible Business
Responsible Business is an important priority for 
LondonMetric and we continue to work hard to 
fully integrate Responsible Business policies and 
procedures across our core business activities.
Our approach  
to Responsible Business 
Our Responsible Business Policy was ﬁrst 
published in 2014 following a detailed 
review of the sustainability risks and 
opportunities which are most material 
to our business. 
Our Responsible Business Strategy sets 
out our sustainability priorities across 
four core business activities: 
(i) our business operations
(ii) our property investments 
(iii) property development 
(iv) asset management
It is supported by the foundations 
of good risk management.
Key targets are set for each of our 
sustainability priority areas on an 
annual basis. The delivery of these 
targets is overseen by our Working 
Group and progress is monitored on a 
quarterly basis through our Responsible 
Business meetings, attended by 
key representatives from across the 
business. We also receive support from 
our external real estate sustainability 
advisor. In 2017 , we approved our 
Working Group terms of reference.
Responsible Business training is carried 
out across relevant employees annually 
to make sure we effectively deliver on 
our targets and continue to optimise 
our Responsible Business approach. 
We actively engage with stakeholders 
(investors, joint venture partners, 
occupiers, communities and local 
authorities) on Responsible Business 
themes and relevant materials are 
included in investor roadshows.
Importance of  
Responsible Business
• Critical to managing 
sustainability risks
• Important in generating sustainable 
value from our portfolio and 
enhancing proﬁtability
• Helps us to mitigate any potential 
long term risks posed by less resource 
efficient assets
• Enables us to successfully 
and sustainably deliver on 
our developments
• Promotes excellent stakeholder 
relationships and assists them in 
delivering on their own responsible 
business objectives
Responsible Investment, Asset

The market-based method uses an emissions factor that is speciﬁc 
to the electricity which has been purchased, or where not available 
a national ‘residual-mix’ factor is applied. Market-based emissions 
factors are taken from the latest Association of Issuing Bodies European 
Residual Mixes (2016).
The total carbon footprint and emissions intensities have been 
calculated using location-based Scope 2 emissions.
Data for the year to 31 March 2016 has been restated, including 
associated intensity metrics, as additional energy consumption 
data has been obtained since the previous report was published.
Scope 1 data does not include refrigerant emissions as these have 
been determined to not be material (represent <2% of total emissions); 
owned ﬂeet does not apply. 
Due to issues accessing energy data, we have also excluded the 
emissions for the vacant units of our residential asset Moore House. 
Last year this asset accounted for just 2% of total emissions.
Environmental performance highlights
In 201 5, we established a baseline and benchmarks for measurement 
of the environmental performance of our portfolio. Since then we 
have signiﬁcantly reduced our energy consumption and GHG 
emissions, enabling us to save over £3 1 7 ,000 in costs.

Down 18% on absolute basis
On a like for like basis, GHG emissions were down by 17% 
as a result of both the reduction in energy consumption 
and the annual reduction to UK emissions factors. We 
have also reduced our Carbon Reduction Commitment

to achieve this was upgrading car park lighting across 
a number of our retail park assets.

Data qualifying notes
We have reported on all of the emission sources required under 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013. 
We have used the main requirements of ISO14064 Part 1 and the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised 
Edition) for our methodology, using energy consumption data from 
our owned and occupied properties. We have chosen to report 
greenhouse gas emissions under our operational control. These sources 
fall within our consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We do not have 
responsibility for any emissions sources that are not included in our 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The guidance on the reporting of Scope 2 GHG emissions under the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol was updated in 2015 and we are now 
required to report two different values to reﬂect the ‘location-based’ 
and ‘market-based’ emissions resulting from purchased electricity.
The location-based method uses an average emission factor for 
the entire national grid on which electricity consumption occurs. 
Location-based emissions factors are taken from the latest UK 
Government (DEFRA) conversion factors for company reporting (2016).

Managing risks and future-prooﬁng our assets
Development is a signiﬁcant activity of ours. It is 
therefore important that we carry out our development 
work responsibly and give proper consideration to 
environmental, sustainable and social matters.
Our Responsible Procurement Policy 
and Development Requirements 
Checklist have expanded our 
sustainability efforts. This year 
we have made great progress in 
monitoring their implementation 
and have further enhanced these 
requirements for the coming year.

we continued to integrate a range of

Active supply chain management
Responsible Procurement Policy 
Supply chains remain under a 
high level of scrutiny. In 2015, we 
developed a procurement policy to 
ensure that our supply chain and our 
procurement practices meet good 
practice standards and deliver social 
and environmental beneﬁts. 
Responsible Development 
Requirements Checklist
All of our contractors are obliged to 
adhere to our development checklist, 
which sets minimum requirements for 
working on our development projects 
and includes:
• Requirements for on site Health & 
Safety management
• Compliance with the Considerate 
Constructors Scheme
• Environmental impact monitoring
• Management and reporting of 
progress against the checklist
• Promoting employment 
opportunities for local people 
and fair remuneration 
UK’s Modern Slavery Act 
The UK’s Modern Slavery Act 
was introduced in 2015 and our 
development checklist stipulates 
requirements for upholding human and 
labour rights within supply chains (see 
page 56). 
Monitoring our contractors 
Having implemented our development 
checklist, our focus is on ensuring that 
contractors meet our requirements. 
The monitoring of compliance 
has helped us to identify areas 
of improvement with regards to 
the environmental impact of our 
construction activities.
Beneﬁts for local communities
Our developments typically involve 
local contractors and suppliers. 
Once developments are complete 
and operational, our tenants employ 
locally-based staff for their retail 
stores or distribution warehouses. 
Our developments, therefore, generate 
signiﬁcant employment and economic 
beneﬁt to the local area. 
We engage extensively with the local 
community, in particular councils 
and local organisations to ensure that 
proper consideration is given to the 
local area, its needs and opportunities 
for local jobs and apprenticeships. 
By way of examples, see page 55. 
Future plans
We will continue to focus on 
ensuring that our Responsible 
Development Requirements are 
effectively implemented and our 
developments continue to include 
environmental sustainability aspects. 
We will also continue to support 
local job creation and the use 
of local suppliers to ensure that 
economic beneﬁts accrue to 
local communities.

Responsible asset management
We work in partnership with occupiers to 
undertake mutually beneﬁcial asset management 
opportunities and mitigate any material risks.
In addition to progressing on achievements to date and continuing to engage 
with our tenants, we will:
• For the ﬁrst time, undertake an investor survey to seek their views on our 
sustainability performance
• Further to our comprehensive independent tenant survey in 2015, undertake 
a follow on tenant survey
For the full Responsible  
Business 2017 report

We continue to actively maintain 
compliance and manage 
risks associated with key 
regulatory drivers:
EPCs: As part of our Responsible 
Investing, we carefully assess the 
environmental risks of assets prior 
to purchase.
This year, we have again reported 
that, for the purposes of MEES, 100% 
of our assets are rated ‘E’ or above. 
Through our asset management 
we are improving the rating of 
our assets. 
CRC: We continue to meet our 
obligations under the CRC Energy 
Efficiency Scheme. 
ESOS: Audits were carried out 
across our portfolio in 2015/16 
in accordance with the Energy 
Savings Opportunity Scheme, 
and we continue to satisfy our 
obligations under this scheme.
Our activities continue to drive 
energy use reductions, cost savings 
and greener energy sourcing: 
Lighting: External car park lighting 
accounts for a meaningful part 
of our energy usage and carbon 
footprint. To date, we have 
completed an LED lighting upgrade 
across four retail parks. The average 
expected reduction in energy 
requirements is 65%.
Green Tariff: At our office in Marlow, 
we have agreed to enter into 
a low carbon electricity supply 
with our incumbent supplier. 
Marlow accounts for 30% of our 
energy consumption and this 
contract will deliver not only 100% 
renewably sourced energy but also 
a 3% reduction in the tariff.
Recharge pods: We are trialling the 
installation of electric car recharge 
pods on two retail parks.
Solar PVs: As a result of ongoing 
engagement with our tenants and 
a number of feasibility studies, we 
have installed 700 KWs of solar PV 
capacity across our assets over the 
last two ﬁnancial years.
Following signiﬁcant engagement 
with Dixons Carphone, a further 
1,000 KW has been installed 
recently at our distribution centre 
in Newark. We continue to look at 
further solar installations, particularly 
on our current and recently 
completed developments. 
Tenant data: We have increased the 
scope of our environmental data 
collection from tenants and now 
collect data on 32% of our portfolio.
Energy audits: We have started 
to undertake full energy audits at 
several of our distribution centres 
and are progressing discussions with 
one tenant on an internal lighting 
replacement programme.

As part of our asset management activities we focus on: 
• Ensuring that we remain compliant with key 
environmental regulation
• Monitoring and targeting improvements in the 
environmental performance of our assets 
• Active engagement with our tenants, including on matters 
relating to sustainability  Our communities and charitable commitments
We recognise the importance of supporting our local 
communities. Our activities bring signiﬁcant beneﬁts to 
local areas and we see engagement with all stakeholders 
as crucial to maximising these beneﬁts. Our responsibilities 
also extend to supporting local causes and encouraging 
our employees to be community minded.
Beneﬁting local communities 
through our activities
We work in close partnership with 
our occupiers to deliver real estate 
that helps to fulﬁl modern shopping 
requirements. These activities beneﬁt 
local communities in a number of ways, 
primarily through: 
• Investment and construction jobs 
in the local area through our asset 
management and development 
activities; the ﬁt out work of our 
retailers also brings local job creation
• Creation of desirable shopping 
destinations which provide 
amenities, diverse retail offerings and 
convenient shopping locations that 
will remain vibrant for the long term
• Long term commitment of our 
retailers and occupiers, who typically 
sign 10-15 year leases bringing long 
term employment to the local area
At our newly developed distribution 
warehouse in Warrington, for example, 
Amazon are expected to employ 1,200 
people once fully operational.
Engaging with local communities
In undertaking our activities we 
understand the importance of 
engaging with local stakeholders 
including planning authorities, 
local councils and highways, local 
residence and business, employment 
organisation and charities. 
On each of our assets, through our 
procurement and development 
policies we require that our suppliers 
and contractors source locally 
and have proper regard for local 
communities. We encourage our 
occupiers to also employ locally.
During the year, we continued our 
support of community causes local 
to our assets, including: 
• Sponsorship of Coventry’s 
participation at the International 
Children’s Games
• Contributing towards 
improving sports facilities 
in Islip, Northamptonshire
• Committing to ongoing support 
of the community events in 
Kirkstall, Leeds
Community and charity 
minded company
Following the formation of a Charity 
and Communities Working Group 
in 2016, this year we published a 
Community Policy, which is available 
on our website.
Future plans
As well as continuing our local 
community engagement, we will 
continue to:
• Target giving to community 
causes local to our assets 
• Support LandAid events and 
employee-led charity events
• Match employee charity giving
• Encourage pro bono work and 
employee volunteering

We fully pre-let a former B&Q store redevelopment 
where we had previously accepted an early surrender. 
As part of our Responsible Business strategy, we 
undertook a public consultation and our plans received 
strong support from the community. 
Apprenticeship training at Stoke
As part of our 277 ,000 sq ft distribution development, 
demolition works were undertaken, including asbestos 
removal, by AR Demolition. 
Given the extent of the project, AR Demolition carried 
out invaluable apprenticeship training at the site.
Mudathon Event
The LondonMetric team participated in a Paragon 
Mudathon event to raise money for Landaid.
LondonMetric Cycle Ride
LondonMetric organised a 100 km charity cycle event 
with participants including many of its occupiers. The 
event, after matching by the Company, raised £3,560. 
All proceeds went to Prostate Cancer UK.
Ongoing community communication at Stoke
Through our contractor Winvic, monthly newsletters 
are distributed locally to inform the local community 
of progress and update on planned works. 
All our contractors adhere to the Considerate 
Constructors Scheme.
Travel Plan at our 120,000 sq ft Retail Park in Leeds
At our recent retail development, we published a 
travel plan to encourage the use of non-car journeys. 
In conjunction with the council, the plan was widely 
distributed locally and we are monitoring its impact. 
Community and charity – in action
55 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our people, human rights and governance
We support our employees internally by providing 
a healthy and productive workplace and uphold 
high standards of corporate governance.
Our people
LondonMetric has 38 employees 
including Directors. Over the four 
years since merger, our voluntary staff 
turnover rate has been low at 6%. 
Staff development, and wellbeing 
is highly important to us; we aim to 
attract, retain and motivate high 
performing individuals. We: 
• Actively encourage training with 
over 480 hours of training recorded 
by employees in the year
• Conduct annual reviews where 
performance is evaluated, objectives 
and training requirements are set, 
and employee feedback is discussed
• Promote healthy living, encourage 
volunteering and supporting of 
charitable causes. 
We continue to promote diversity 
across a range of criteria including skills, 
knowledge, experience, gender, age 
and ethnicity. 58% of employees are 
male and 42% are female.
Governance
As further set out in this Report, the 
Board is committed to upholding 
the high standards of corporate 
governance that underpin the 
successful management of the 
business and its success. 
Recently, we have formalised 
three additional Responsible 
Business policies:
• Health and safety: The policy aims 
to provide and maintain safe and 
healthy working conditions for all 
employees, providing appropriate 
equipment, operational processes 
and safe systems of work to cover 
all of our activities. (For more details 
see the full Responsible Business 
2017 Report)
• Compliance and anti corruption: 
Details how LondonMetric 
manages, investigates and reports 
risks associated with compliance, 
anti-money laundering, ﬁnancial 
crime and conﬂicts of interest 
• Responsible procurement: Establishes 
LondonMetric’s requirements 
in relation to labour standards; 
human rights; health and safety; 
resource use and pollution risk in 
relation to its procurement and 
development activities and speciﬁes 
considerations for managing agents 
and development contractors on 
environmental, community and 
labour aspects 
UK Modern Slavery Act
As a company located and operating 
solely in the UK, LondonMetric’s 
exposure to human rights risks – 
including modern forms of  
slavery – is very limited. 
LondonMetric has published 
its Remuneration Policy which 
demonstrates its commitment to 
transparent and fair remuneration 
for its own employees. However, to 
reduce exposure to slavery and human 
trafficking within its supply chain, 
LondonMetric speciﬁcally addresses 
these important areas in its Responsible 
Procurement Policy and Responsible 
Development Requirements Checklist. 
LondonMetric requires its contractors 
to meet a number of standards 
including: paying a fair wage to 
their workers, respecting Human 
Rights and Labour Rights Legislation, 
and investigating their own supply 
chains for slavery and human 
trafficking. For each development, 
contractors are expected to provide, 
on request, evidence that they meet 
these requirements. 
No human rights concerns have arisen 
within our direct operations or our 
supply chain during 2017 .
Our Modern Slavery Act Statement is 
available on the Company’s website 
home page.

Governance Introduction from the Chairman
Good governance is embedded 
into the way we manage our 
business to create a culture of 
appropriate decision making, risk 
assessment and transparency at all 
levels in the organisation.
Patrick Vaughan
Chairman
This year much thought has been given 
to our risk appetite and emerging risks 
in the aftermath of the EU Referendum 
and Brexit vote. The risk dashboard 
is a standing agenda item at each 
quarterly meeting, highlighting 
changes in the Group’s exposure to 
risks and prompting further debate.
Succession planning and talent 
development has continued to be 
a key area of focus to support the 
Company’s long term plans. Last year, 
we appointed The Zygos Partnership 
to assist with a phased refreshment of 
the Non Executive Board in light of their 
individual tenure and the best practice 
recommendations of the Code. 
As a result, we welcomed Andrew 
Livingston to the Board and Audit 
Committee this year and said farewell 
to Charles Cayzer who had served as 
a valuable Board member and Senior 
Independent Director for six years.
Having further considered the size, skill 
set and tenure of the Non Executive 
Directors this year, Andrew Varley has 
decided to retire from the Board and 
Committees in September. I would like 
to thank him for his contribution and 
dedication over the last four years at 
LondonMetric and previously as a Non 
Executive Director of Metric.
The Audit Committee has considered 
the updates to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and Guidance 
on Audit Committees, which are 
mandatory for the Company next 
year. The Board has considered 
the composition of the Audit 
Committee and its experience in 
the property sectors in which we 
operate in order to satisfy the new 
requirement that the Committee 
as a whole has competence in the 
relevant operating sectors. It has also 
reviewed the Company’s policy on 
non audit services provided by the 
external auditors.
The Audit Committee has once 
again challenged the going concern 
principal underlying the preparation 
of these accounts and considered the 
Company’s longer term viability. It has 
reviewed the processes in place and 
followed by management to ensure 
that the ﬁnancial statements are fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
has scrutinised and challenged the 
accounting treatment of signiﬁcant 
transactions and areas of judgement 
which could have a material impact 
on the results, including those 
concerning the valuation of property. 
This year the Committee has paid 
particular attention to the alternative 
performance measures reported in 
these accounts and the balance of 
statutory and non statutory measures.
Regular communication with investors 
continues to be a key priority for the 
Executive Directors. Understanding the 
views of shareholders is fundamental 
to the Company’s strategic direction 
and ultimate success. This year, the 
Executive Directors met with 280 
shareholders, fund managers, private 
wealth investors and other interested 
parties to discuss the Company’s 
performance and plans.
The Nomination Committee led our 
annual internal Board evaluation which 
involved all Directors completing a 
questionnaire which focused on the 
key components of good governance 
and effective performance. 
Overall the ﬁndings were extremely 
positive and concluded that the 
individual Directors, the Board and 
its Committees continue to work well 
together with the right balance of skills 
and expertise and within a climate of 
trust and transparency. The Committee 
will lead an externally facilitated review 
next year.
The Remuneration Committee 
has undertaken a full review of the 
Company’s Remuneration Policy for 
the forthcoming three year period in 
advance of the mandatory vote at 
the AGM. The overriding principle is to 
maintain a fair reward structure that 
adequately incentivises and retains the 
executive team to deliver long term 
growth and success. The Committee 
was advised by PwC, who were 
appointed new remuneration advisors 
in the year. The Chairman of the 
Committee consulted extensively 
with shareholders, who provided 
constructive feedback and, following 
suggested revisions, were supportive 
of the ﬁnal proposals.
Patrick Vaughan
Chairman 
31 May 2017
Good governance underpins the 
scope of transactions and our ability 
to operate in a way that is both legally 
compliant and also responsible.
This approach to business builds 
and maintains the trust of our key 
stakeholders including investors, 
business partners, customers, suppliers 
and employees. Furthermore we are 
committed to enhancing the business 
environments in which we operate as 
discussed in detail in the Responsible 
Business section of the Strategic report.
The Directors and senior managers 
have formed strong relationships over 
several years of working together in 
an open environment that welcomes 
challenge and constructive debate. 
Through the close involvement of 
the Executive Directors, this culture 
permeates through the wider 
organisation, promoting good 
governance practices beyond the 
Boardroom and supporting the 
successful delivery of strategy.
The Corporate Governance report 
which follows provides insight into 
our governance processes and 
activities in the year and demonstrates

The framework reﬂects the composition of the Board as at 31 March 2017
62 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible to 
the shareholders of the Company for 
the long term success of the business.
It sets and implements strategy and 
provides leadership and direction 
within a sound framework of risk 
management and internal controls.
Details of the Directors, including the skills 
and experience they bring to the Board, 
are reﬂected on pages 60 and 61.
There is a division of responsibility 
between the Chairman and Chief 
Executive which has been approved 
by the Board. 
The Chairman is responsible for 
leading the Board and monitoring its 
effectiveness and the Chief Executive, 
supported by the Executive Directors, 
is responsible for the day to day 
management of the Group and the 
implementation and delivery of the 
Board’s agreed strategic objectives.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring 
a constructive relationship between 
Executive and Non Executive Directors 
and for encouraging and fostering a 
culture of Boardroom challenge and 
debate. He maintains regular contact 
with the Executive Directors and senior 
management outside of formal Board 
meetings which ensures he is kept 
abreast of individual Directors’ views 
and issues as they arise. 
During the year the Board 
recommended the extension of the 
Chairman’s appointment for a further 
year to 31 March 2018.
As reported in the table on page 65, 
each of the Non Executive Directors, 
other than the Chairman, is considered 
by the Board to be independent from 
management and has no commercial 
or other connection with the Company. 
In considering independence, the 
Board concluded that tenure should 
be measured from the date of election 
to the LondonMetric Board. 
Committees comprise entirely of 
independent Non Executive Directors, 
other than the Nomination Committee 
as permitted by the Code. 
The Board’s composition throughout 
the year met the Code’s requirement 
that at least half of its members, 
excluding the Chairman, are 
independent Non Executive Directors.
The Board has a schedule of matters 
reserved for its attention which includes 
approval of budgets, ﬁnancial reports, 
signiﬁcant acquisitions and disposals, 
major capital expenditure, funding 
and dividend policy.
Board culture
Individual Directors and senior 
managers have formed strong 
relationships over several years of 
working together. 
The Chairman sets the culture of the 
Board and wider organisation which 
is deﬁned as a balanced approach 
to business and a willingness to take 
considered risks to achieve strategic 
goals within an open environment 
which encourages constructive 
challenge and debate. 
This culture and thinking permeates 
through the organisation through the 
close interaction of Directors and staff 
in day to day activities.
Board processes are well understood 
and adhered to after many years of 
consistent application.
Board Committees
The Board has three Committees of 
Non Executive Directors to which 
it has delegated a number of its 
responsibilities; the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees. 
The Committees ensure a strong 
governance framework for decision 
making and each operates within 
deﬁned terms of reference which 
are reviewed annually by each 
Committee and the Board and which 
are available on written request 
and on the Company’s website at 
www.londonmetric.com.
The Audit and Remuneration 
Committees are composed entirely of 
independent Non Executive Directors. 
The Nomination Committee includes 
the Chairman who is not considered 
to be independent but his attendance 
is permitted by the Code. 
The Chairman of each Committee 
provides a verbal update on the 
matters discussed at each meeting 
to the Board.
The Executive Committee meets 
monthly to discuss ﬁnancial and 
operating targets and performance, 
property transactions and the 
management of the business and 
its staff. There are informal meetings 
between the Executive Directors at 
other times and due to the size of 
the organisation they are involved 
in all signiﬁcant business discussions 
and decisions.
The Executive Committee is 
supported by three sub Committees, 
each focusing on different areas 
of the business; the Investment, 
Asset Management and Finance 
Committees. These Committees 
comprise Executive Directors and 
members of the senior management 
team and meet at least monthly.

Non Executive Directors
The Non Executive Directors are a 
diverse group with a wide range of 
experience encompassing property, 
ﬁnance, fund management, 
risk management and retailing. 
They provide a valued role by 
challenging aspects of executive 
decisions and monitoring the delivery 
of the agreed strategy, adding 
insight from their varied commercial 
backgrounds. They bring independent 
and objective scrutiny and judgement 
to all matters raised, ensuring that no 
one individual has unfettered decision 
making powers.
The Senior Independent Director acts 
as an intermediary to the Executive 
Directors for the Non Executive 
Directors and shareholders as 
required. He is available to meet with 
shareholders at their request to address 
concerns or, if other communication 
channels fail, to resolve queries raised. 
No such requests were received from 
shareholders in the year. The Non 
Executive Directors meet regularly with 
rare occasion that a Director is unable 
to attend a meeting, papers will still 
be provided in advance and their 
comments are provided to the Board 
prior to the meeting.
Non Executive Directors are 
encouraged to communicate directly 
and openly with the Executive Directors 
and senior management between 
scheduled Board meetings to explore 
and challenge large and complex 
transactions and as part of each 
Director’s contribution to the delivery of 
strategy. This ad hoc communication 
is often supplemented by site visits and 
provides further opportunity to mix with 
senior management.
The Executive Directors have regular 
off site meetings to discuss business 
strategy and performance in a less 
formal environment. External advisors 
and senior managers are invited to 
present and the focus is reviewing 
the appropriateness of and progress 
against agreed strategy in light of 
Company performance and the wider 
macroeconomic environment.

On appointment Non Executive 
Directors are advised of the likely 
time commitment to fulﬁl the role. 
The ability of individual Directors to 
allocate sufficient time to discharge 
their responsibilities is considered as 
part of the annual evaluation process 
undertaken by the Nomination 
Committee. The Board is satisﬁed that 
each of the Non Executive Directors 
is able to devote sufficient time to the 
Company’s business.
The Board has a regular schedule of 
meetings, timed around the ﬁnancial 
calendar, together with further ad 
hoc meetings as required to deal with 
transactional matters.
All Directors are expected to attend 
all meetings of the Board and of the 
Committees on which they serve, 
and to devote sufficient time to the 
Company’s affairs to enable them to 
fulﬁl their duties as Directors. On the

All Directors and Committees have

who is responsible for ensuring that 
Board procedures are followed and 
that governance regulations are 
complied with. The Directors may, in 
the furtherance of their duties, take 
independent professional advice 
at the expense of the Company. 
None of the Directors sought such 
advice in the year.
Conﬂicts of interest
Directors are required and have a 
duty to notify the Company of any 
potential conﬂicts of interest they may 
have. Any conﬂicts are recorded and 
reviewed at each Board meeting. 
There have been no conﬂicts of interest 
noted this year.

Leadership continued
Board changes
As reported last year, an executive 
search company was commissioned 
to source possible candidates for 
new Non Executive Directors of the 
Company. As a result of this search 
Andrew Livingston was appointed as 
a Non Executive Director and member  
of the Audit Committee on 31 May 2016,  
replacing Charles Cayzer who retired 
from the Board in September 2016.
Philip Watson replaced Charles Cayzer 
as Senior Independent Director and 
Rosalyn Wilton and James Dean were 
appointed to the Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees respectively.
Patrick Vaughan was appointed 
as Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee in July 2016. Andrew Varley 
has expressed his intention to retire 
from the Board and its Committees 
in September.
Professional development
Newly appointed Directors participate 
in a tailored induction programme 
and receive a comprehensive pack of 
information on the Group, its business 
and the governance structure. 
The induction also involves meeting 
with the senior management team 
to discuss property transactions, 
ﬁnancial matters, share dealing 
and governance.
This induction process was carried out 
for Andrew Livingston who joined as a 
new Non Executive Director in the year. 
For an insight into the Group, Andrew 
had one-to-one meetings with senior 
managers in property and ﬁnance 
and the Company’s external auditors.
Ongoing training and information 
updates in relation to the Group’s 
business, regulatory framework and 
accounting requirements are provided 
to the Directors through Board brieﬁng 
papers, reports and presentations by 
external advisors, senior executives 
and property visits.
During the year, training was provided 
through presentations at Board 
meetings by senior managers and 
advisors on real estate and capital 
markets. Speciﬁc brieﬁng papers were 
provided on the Private Placement 
debt facility, scrip dividend alternative, 
Market Abuse Regulations, institutional 
feedback and Responsible Business.
Each Director is expected to take 
responsibility for identifying their 
individual training needs and ensuring 
they are adequately informed 
about the Group’s strategy, business 
and responsibilities.
Directors are encouraged to attend 
relevant seminars and conferences 
and receive technical update material 
from advisors.
Non Executive Directors are 
encouraged to familiarise 
themselves with the Group’s business 
through regular communications 
with the Executive Directors and 
senior management between 
formal meetings. 
Informal communication between Non 
Executive Directors and the Executive 
Board is encouraged and occurs 
on a regular basis and supports the 
Company’s culture of openness.
Information ﬂow
The Chairman, supported by the 
Company Secretary, ensures that the 
Directors receive clear information on 
all relevant matters on a timely basis.
Comprehensive reports and brieﬁng 
papers are circulated one week prior 
to Board and Committee meetings 
to give the Directors sufficient time 
to consider their content prior to the 
meeting and to promote an informed 
Boardroom debate.
The Board papers contain market, 
property, ﬁnancial and risk updates 
as well as other speciﬁc papers relating 
to agenda items. 
The Board receives other ad hoc 
papers of a transactional nature at 
other times, circulated by email, for 
their review and approval which are 
ratiﬁed at the next Board meeting. 
In addition, the Chairmen of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees 
communicate regularly and 
independently with relevant staff 
and external advisors including the 
Company’s external auditors and 
remuneration advisors.

Director are the Company’s principal 
representatives and, along with 
the other Executive Directors and 
the Head of Investor Relations, hold 
meetings throughout the year to 
communicate the Company’s strategy 
and performance. These include results 
presentations, one to one meetings, 
group meetings, panel discussions, 
conferences and site visits.
Investor meetings
The framework of investor relations 
is set around the ﬁnancial reporting 
calendar, speciﬁcally announcement 
of half and full year results. In addition, 
signiﬁcant shareholder engagement 
occurs outside these periods and 
primarily consists of UK regional and 
overseas roadshows. 
These meetings and roadshows seek 
to keep investors informed of the 
Company’s performance and plans, 
answer questions they may have and 
understand their views.
Topics discussed include the 
development and implementation 
of strategy, performance, property 
transactions, quality of underlying 
tenants, strength of the Company’s 
income, debt structure and the real 
estate market in general.
Investor activity
During the ﬁnancial year, the Company 
met with over 280 shareholders, 
analysts and potential investors. 
A breakdown by type of investor seen 
and location of meeting are shown 
in the charts opposite. Meetings were 
held predominantly in the UK with 54% 
of investors seen in London.
As the importance of retail/private 
wealth shareholders continues to 
grow, the Company maintained its 
high level of roadshow activity in UK 
regions. Regional roadshows included 
visits to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dublin, 
Bristol, Liverpool and Manchester. 
In total, private wealth meetings 
accounted for 36% of investors seen 
and the Company continues to place 
great importance on engaging with its 
private wealth shareholders.
Approximately 17% of investor meetings 
were held overseas in Ireland, Holland, 
South Africa and the United States. 
The Company will continue to engage 
with overseas investors to broaden 
further its investor base.
Investor site visits
Three investor site visits were arranged 
in the year, at several of the Company’s 
distribution warehouses in:
• Newark, occupied by 
Dixons Carphone
• Reading, let to DHL
• Warrington, which was under 
construction at the time but was 
subsequently let to Amazon
The visits were attended by 
approximately 60 investors, several 
Directors and senior managers. 
In addition, in September 2016 the 
Company arranged a site visit to two 
of its key distribution warehouses in 
Thrapston, occupied by Primark, for its 
new Private Placement debt providers.
Equity placing
During the year, the Company 
undertook a successful equity placing 
to raise £95 million. The Company pre-
marketed the placing largely to its top 
shareholders ahead of announcing. 
The placing was priced at a tight 
discount of 1.9% to the previous day’s 
share price and a 6.3% premium to the 
last reported EPRA NAV. The fundraising 
structure of a placing allowed the 
Company to raise the money within 
less than a week thereby reducing 
equity market risk and giving high 
certainty of success. The placing was 
oversubscribed with strong support 
from existing shareholders and several 
new investors.

Feedback received is very supportive of 
the Company’s strategy, performance, 
management and future direction. 
The Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee wrote to shareholders 
in January 2017 outlining proposed 
changes to the Remuneration Policy 
that will be subject to a binding vote 
at this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
Following feedback from the 
shareholder consultation, the proposed 
new policy was amended to exclude 
an additional one year LTIP target. 
The majority of the shareholders 
consulted were supportive of the 
revised proposal.
As part of its ongoing shareholder 
engagement, the Company is 
planning to conduct its bi-annual 
investor sustainability engagement 
survey this year.
Public communication
Shareholders are kept informed of the 
Company’s progress through results 
statements and other announcements 
released through the London Stock 
Exchange. Company announcements 
are made available on the website 
affording all shareholders full access 
to material information.
The website is an important source 
of information for shareholders and 
includes a comprehensive investor 
relations section containing all 
RNS announcements, share price 
information, investor presentations 
and Annual Reports available 
for downloading. A live and on 
demand webcast of results and a 
CEO interview is posted twice a year. 
Individual shareholders can raise 
questions directly with the Company 
at any time through a facility on 
the website.
Key shareholder events 
throughout the year
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders are encouraged to 
participate in the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company, which

Areas of focus this year
• Approved the appointment of Andrew Livingston as a new Non Executive 
Director and Audit Committee member to replace Charles Cayzer who 
retired on 30 September 2016
• Approved the appointments of:
– Rosalyn Wilton to the Remuneration Committee
– James Dean to the Nomination Committee
– Philip Watson as Senior Independent Director
following the AGM in July 2016
• Led internal Board and Committee performance evaluation in January 201 7

• Recommended the appointment of Andrew Livingston to the Remuneration 
Committee following the AGM to replace Andrew Varley who will retire as a 
Non Executive Director and member of both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees in September 201 7
This year the Committee continued 
to focus on the size and composition 
of the Board and its Committees, 
having welcomed Andrew Livingston 
to the Board in May 2016 and after 
Charles Cayzer stepped down 
in September 2016. This led to the 
consideration of Andrew Varley’s 
retirement from the Non Executive 
Board and reduction in its overall size. 
The resulting Board composition 
continues to meet the requirements of 
the Code and has the correct balance 
of skills and knowledge to lead the 
Company going forward.
The Committee also led an internal 
evaluation of Board and Committee 
performance in the year and 
concluded that the Board was well led 
and administered by a dynamic and 
respected Chairman who promoted 
an open culture of discussion and 
constructive debate. 
The Directors unanimously considered 
the Board to have the appropriate 
complement of skills required to 
monitor performance, challenge 
management, promote debate 
and develop strategy.
Role of the Committee
The role of the Committee is to 
evaluate the size, structure and 
composition of the Board to ensure 
that it has the appropriate balance 
of skills, knowledge, experience and 
independence, having due regard 
to the beneﬁts of diversity. 
The Board’s collective experience 
covers a range of relevant sectors as 
reﬂected in the chart on page 64, 
including property, ﬁnance and retail.
The Committee drives succession 
planning for Directors and other 
senior executive positions and 
ensures that the refreshment process 
is properly planned and managed 
to maintain stability and mitigate 
business disruption.
It is responsible for identifying and 
recommending candidates to ﬁll Board 
vacancies and leads the selection 
process ensuring it is formal, rigorous 
and transparent.
On appointment, the Company 
arranges a tailored induction 
programme for all new Directors to 
help them develop an understanding 
of the business including its strategy, 
processes, people, assets, ﬁnances,

risks and controls. The induction 
includes the provision of a detailed 
Company information pack, site visits 
and introductions to and meetings with 
senior management and advisors.
A comprehensive induction 
programme was arranged for Andrew 
Livingston, who joined as a new 
Non Executive Director in the year, 
including:
• One to one meetings with Executive 
Directors and senior managers from 
property and ﬁnance
• Provision of past Board and 
Committee papers, minutes 
and ﬁnance reports, Board 
and Committee timetables
• One to one meeting with the 
Company’s audit partner
Responsibilities of the Committee
The principal responsibilities of the 
Committee are to:
• Review and evaluate the size, 
structure and composition of 
the Board
• Make recommendations to the 
Board regarding Board and 
Committee membership changes
• Consider succession planning for 
Directors and other senior executives
• Identify candidates to ﬁll Board 
vacancies as they arise
• Lead the Board and Committee 
performance evaluation exercise
• Assess the time commitment required 
from Non Executive Directors
• Consider the annual re-election 
of Directors to the Board
Composition of the Committee
The Committee is comprised entirely 
of Non Executive Directors and 
membership details are set out in the 
table on page 70. The Committee 
was chaired by Charles Cayzer 
until the AGM in July 2016 when he 
announced his retirement from the 
Board and Committee and Patrick 
Vaughan replaced him as Chairman. 
James Dean was appointed as a 
member of the Committee following 
the AGM and Charles Cayzer retired 
as a member of the Committee on 
30 September 2016.
Meetings and activities
The Committee met twice during 
the year to consider and make 
recommendations to the Board 
in respect of:
• The appointment, re-appointment 
and resignation of Non Executive 
Directors to the Board and 
its Committees
• The internally led performance 
evaluation of the Board and 
its Committees
• The re-election of Directors at 
the forthcoming AGM
• Its own terms of reference
Diversity
The Board continues to be committed 
to a culture that attracts and retains 
talented individuals to deliver 
outstanding results. 
It strives to operate in a working 
environment of equal opportunity 
and recognises the beneﬁts diversity 
brings to the organisation. It continues 
to promote diversity at every level of 
recruitment and across a range of 
criteria including skills, knowledge, 
experience, gender, age and ethnicity.
All appointments to the Board and 
senior management team are made 
on merit alone. The Board believes that 
an appointment on any other basis 
would not be in the best long term 
interests of the Company.
It supports and promotes greater 
female representation on listed 
company boards but it does not 
consider, given the size of the 
Company, that diversity quotas 
are appropriate in determining its 
composition and has not set targets. 
It does not wish to increase its size 
solely to enable further women to 
be appointed. However, there is an 
ongoing commitment to strengthen 
female representation at Board level, 
the pace of which will be dependent 
upon the availability of suitable 
candidates and Board vacancies. 
Gender and wider diversity will 
continue to be taken into account 
when evaluating Board composition 
and appointments and will be 
considered as part of the ongoing 
Board refreshment programme.
The Company as a whole is supportive 
of gender diversity, with 25% of 
senior management positions being 
ﬁlled by women and 42% of all staff 
being female.
The Company supports ﬂexible working 
practices for employees on a case by 
case basis, as utilised by four of the 
total 31 employees at the year end 
excluding Non Executive Directors.
Further information on the Company’s 
commitment to developing people is 
contained in the report on Responsible 
Business on page 56.

Succession planning
A key priority of the Committee is the 
consideration of succession planning 
and talent development to support 
the Company’s long term plans. 
In reviewing succession planning for 
both Executive and Non Executive 
Directors, the Committee considers 
the leadership needs of the Company 
and balance of the Board.
Last year, the Committee considered 
the tenure of the Non Executive 
Directors and the need for a 
progressive refreshing of the Board 
as required by the Code. 
It appointed an external executive 
search agency, The Zygos Partnership, 
to assist with a phased refreshment of 
the Non Executive Board. 
Potential candidates were shortlisted 
for consideration and the Committee 
recommended the appointment of 
Andrew Livingston, replacing Charles 
Cayzer who retired in September 
2016. Further details of Andrew’s 
appointment process was given 
in last year’s Annual Report.
Once again this year, the Nomination 
Committee considered the size and skill 
set of the Non Executive Board and has 
agreed that Andrew Varley will retire 
from the Board and Committees in 
September 2017 . 
The remaining balance of 
independent Non Executive Directors 
continues to meet the requirements 
of the Code and further Board 
refreshment will be considered next 
year in light of strategic focus and 
regulatory changes.
The Executive Directors consider 
succession planning below Board 
level and is committed to nurturing, 
developing and retaining high 
performing individuals to ensure a clear 
talent pipeline exists for future Board 
and senior management positions. 
Staff are encouraged to develop 
and broaden their experience and 
Directors are mindful of cover for 
senior management positions should a 
need arise. Low staff turnover at senior 
levels signiﬁes a loyal, content and 
motivated workforce.
Re-election of Directors
Following the Board evaluation and 
appraisal process the Committee 
concluded that each of the Directors 
seeking re-election continues to make 
an effective contribution to the Board 
and has the necessary skills, knowledge 
and experience to enable them to 
discharge their duties properly in the 
coming year.
The Committee considers the time 
commitment required of the Directors 
and other external appointments they 
have. Before taking on any additional 
external commitments Directors must 
seek the prior agreement of the Board 
to ensure possible conﬂicts of interest 
are identiﬁed and to conﬁrm they 
will continue to have sufficient time 
available to devote to the business 
of the Company.
The Board, following the advice of 
the Committee, recommends the 
re-election of all Directors at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Progress against the recommendations from last year’s internally facilitated review 
is set out below.

The Board has delegated 
responsibility for carrying out the 
performance evaluation to the 
Nomination Committee.
This year’s performance evaluation was 
led by the Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee and involved the Directors 
completing a detailed questionnaire 
which focused on the key aspects of 
good governance. 
The ﬁndings were collated by the 
Finance Director and were tabled 
for discussion at the Nomination 
Committee who reported their ﬁndings 
to the Board in January 2017 . The key 
areas of focus and ﬁndings are set out 
in the table on page 73.

Chairman’s introduction
The role of the Audit Committee is 
to review and report to the Board on 
ﬁnancial reporting, internal control and 
risk management and the performance, 
independence and effectiveness of the 
external auditors and audit process.
The Committee monitors the integrity 
of the ﬁnancial reporting process 
and scrutinises the full and half year 
ﬁnancial statements before proposing 
them to the Board for approval.
This year the Committee has continued 
to focus on risk management and 
has undertaken a comprehensive 
review of principal risks and the 
internal control framework. It has 
challenged the signiﬁcant accounting 
judgements made by management, 
including those concerning the 
valuation of investment property in 
light of the economic and political 
uncertainties arising from the EU 
Referendum and triggering of Article 
50 and the forthcoming UK election. 
The Committee has also scrutinised 
the processes in place to ensure that 
the Annual Report is fair, balanced 
and understandable.
The disclosure and explanation of 
alternative performance measures 
has been considered in accordance 
with FRC and ESMA Guidelines 
published in the year along with the 
2016 amendments to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code regarding the 
relevant sector competence of the 
Audit Committee.
It has also considered the 
independence and effectiveness 
of the external audit process and 
has recommended that Deloitte be 
reappointed at the AGM in July. As part 
of this process it considered the rotation 
next year of the lead audit partner 
and has reviewed the policy governing 
the provision of non audit services, 
establishing and clarifying guidelines 
for any such appointments.
The Committee has considered 
the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code concerning going 
concern and viability and has advised 
the Board on the statement made in 
the Risk management section of this 
report on page 41. It has also conﬁrmed 
to the Board that there are adequate 
processes and internal controls in place 
to ensure the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
to make its statement on page 1 1 1.

Membership
The Committee continues to comprise 
four Non Executive Directors, chaired 
by Rosalyn Wilton. Andrew Livingston 
was appointed to the Committee and 
Board as a Non Executive Director 
on 31 May 2016. Charles Cayzer 
retired from the Committee and 
Board on 30 September 2016, 
having served as a Non Executive 
Director of the Company for over 
six years. Members have no day to 
day involvement with the Company 
or links with the external auditor.
The Board is satisﬁed that Rosalyn Wilton 
brings recent and relevant ﬁnancial 
experience as required by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code as a 
former Chairman of the Risk Committee 
at AXA UK Limited. Additionally, in 
accordance with the 2016 Corporate 
Governance Code which becomes 
mandatory for the Company next year, 
the Board considers that all Committee 
members have the expertise and 
relevant competency required in 
the sectors in which the Company 
operates to discharge their duties, as 
they all hold or have previously held 
senior positions in related and relevant 
businesses. Andrew Livingston adds 
to the existing skill set of members, 
bringing current retail and ecommerce 
experience as Chief Executive of 
Screwﬁx, a leading online retailer.
Biographies of the Committee 
members which set out the relevant 
knowledge and sector relevant 
experience they bring can be found 
on pages 60 and 61.
Meetings
The Committee follows an annual 
programme to ensure it gives full 
consideration to matters of particular 
importance and its terms of reference.
The Committee met ﬁve times last 
year, with meetings aligned to the 
Company’s ﬁnancial reporting 
timetable. Meetings are attended 
by the Committee members and, 
by invitation, the Group’s external 
auditor, independent property valuers 
(CBRE Ltd and Savills Advisory Services 
Limited), the Finance Director and 
senior management. Time is allocated 
for the Committee to meet the 
external auditor and property valuers 
independently of management. 
In addition to formal Committee 
meetings, the Chairman has regular 
contact and meetings with the 
audit partner.
The May and November meetings are 
scheduled to precede the approval 
and issue of the full and half year 
ﬁnancial reports. Separate meetings 
are held with the Company’s 
property valuers to challenge 
the valuation process and review 
their independence. At the March 
meeting, the Committee reviewed 
risk management and internal control 
processes and considered the year 
end audit plan. It also considered 
a paper from the Finance Director 
on IT and cyber risk and the risk 
management processes in place.
The Chairman of the Committee 
reports to the Board on the matters 
considered and conclusions reached 
after each Committee meeting.
The Committee is satisﬁed that it 
receives sufficient, reliable and 
timely information and support from 
management and the Company’s 
external auditor to allow it to fulﬁl 
its obligations.

Activities during 2017
During the year, the work undertaken by the Committee has included the consideration, review and approval 
of the following:
76 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Financial reporting and  
signiﬁcant judgements
The Committee monitors the integrity 
of the ﬁnancial information published 
in the interim and annual statements 
and considers the extent to which 
suitable accounting policies have 
been adopted, consistently applied 
and disclosed.
It pays particular attention to matters 
it considers to be important by virtue 
of their size, complexity, level of 
judgement and potential impact on the 
ﬁnancial statements and remuneration. 
The signiﬁcant matters considered by 
the Committee, discussed with the 
external auditor and addressed during 
the year are set out in the table below. 
Further details can be found in note 1 
to the ﬁnancial statements.
The Committee has considered a 
number of other judgements made 
by management, none of which were 
material in the context of the Group’s 
results or net assets. These included 
judgements concerning the 
recoverability of ﬁnancial assets and 
the valuation of derivative instruments.
Management conﬁrmed that they 
were not aware of any material 
misstatements and the auditor 
conﬁrmed they had not found any 
material misstatements in the course 
of their work.
After reviewing reports from 
management and following its 
discussions with the auditor and 
valuers, the Committee is satisﬁed 
that the key ﬁnancial judgements and 
estimates have been appropriately 
and adequately addressed by the 
Executive Directors, reviewed by the 
external auditor and reported in these 
ﬁnancial statements. 
The Committee is also satisﬁed that the 
processes used to determine the value 
of the assets and liabilities have been 
appropriately reviewed, challenged 
and are sufficiently robust.
Signiﬁcant matter considered Committee’s approach
Property valuations
The property valuation is a critical and 
signiﬁcant part of the Group’s reported 
performance being the largest item on 
the balance sheet.
It is a key determinant of the Group’s 
proﬁtability, net asset value and total 
property return and is therefore a key 
area of focus.
Property valuations are inherently 
subjective as they are based on 
assumptions made by the external 
valuers which are underpinned by 
recent market transactions and may 
not prove to be accurate.
For further details on property 
valuations refer to notes 1 and 9 
of the ﬁnancial statements.
All of the Group’s investment properties and those held in joint ventures are externally 
valued by two independent property valuers, CBRE and Savills.
The Committee met twice during the year with the property valuers, as part of the 
interim and year end reporting process, to challenge and assess the integrity of the 
valuation process, methodologies and outcomes.
The key judgements applied to each property valuation and any issues raised or 
disagreements with management were considered and discussed, to ensure that 
undue inﬂuence had not been placed on the valuation process and the valuers 
remained independent and objective.
This year the Committee was mindful of the political and economic uncertainty 
associated with the EU Referendum and the UK election. It considered the impact 
on the investment and occupier markets and the lower volumes of transactional 
evidence available to support and substantiate certain property valuations.
Future rental growth and yield assumptions were challenged and supporting 
market evidence was provided to enable the Committee to benchmark assets 
and conclude that the assumptions applied were appropriate.
Any valuation which required a greater level of judgement, for example 
development assets, and any valuation movements that were not broadly in line with 
the IPD benchmark were scrutinised.
The Committee discussed with the valuers the impact on values of committed 
expenditure on developments, letting assumptions, vacant space, rent free periods 
and lease incentives.
As part of their audit work, Deloitte use valuation specialists to assess and challenge 
the valuation approach, assumptions and judgements. They meet independently 
with the valuers and report their ﬁndings and conclusions to the Committee.
Revenue recognition
Certain transactions include unusual 
or complex adjustments to revenue 
and require management to make 
judgements as to whether, and to what 
extent, revenue should be recognised 
in the year.
There is a risk of overstatement or 
deferral of income in order to meet 
performance and remuneration targets.
The Committee considered the timing of recognising rental income arising on 
pre-let developments at Leicester, Liverpool, Wakeﬁeld and Warrington that 
completed in the year and concluded that it was appropriately recognised from the 
commencement of the lease. It also considered the accounting for rent free periods 
and lease inducements including those to Amazon and Eddie Stobart.
The Committee received and assessed reports from the external auditor on the 
timing of revenue recognition for property and lease transactions completing in 
the year, lease incentives and surrender payments and considered consistency 
of accounting treatment with previous years.
The Committee considered the options available, challenged the judgements 
made and were satisﬁed that revenue had been appropriately recognised in 
the ﬁnancial statements.
77 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Accountability continued
Signiﬁcant matter considered Committee’s approach
Signiﬁcant transactions
During the year, the Group transacted 
on £318 million of property.
Some transactions were large and 
complex and required management 
to make judgements in determining 
whether a transaction represented 
a business combination under 
IFRS 3, when a transaction should 
be recognised and the fair value 
of consideration.
Signiﬁcant property acquisitions and disposals were reviewed by the Committee 
to the extent that there were unusual terms and conditions of judgement in 
relation to timing.
The Committee, in conjunction with the external auditor, received and challenged 
management’s accounting proposals in relation to:
• The corporate disposal of the Group’s retail park in Newry and distribution 
warehouse in Warrington, both of which were considered in substance 
to be property disposals
• The timing of recognition of acquisitions and disposals on unconditional exchange 
of contracts rather than completion, including the disposal of Alban Retail Park 
in Bedford which was accounted for as a disposal in the year with completion 
deferred until post year end
• The timing of the disposal of the distribution unit in Warrington where the occupier 
exercised its option to purchase
The Committee concurred with the approach adopted by management 
in each case.
Presentation of information
The Group operates through a number 
of joint ventures which are monitored 
by management on a proportionately 
consolidated basis but are required 
under accounting standards to be 
equity accounted.
EPRA performances measures are 
presented as KPIs and elsewhere within 
this report in line with other public real 
estate companies to highlight the 
recurring performance of the Group
The Group equity accounts for its three joint venture operations as required 
by accounting standards. Its share of proﬁt after tax and net assets is reﬂected in the 
ﬁnancial statements as one line in each of the income statement and balance sheet.
However, management monitors the business on a proportionately consolidated 
basis and uses EPRA performance measures which reﬂect the recurring performance 
of the Group’s property rental business. The ﬁgures and commentary presented in the 
Finance review section of the Strategic report on pages 34 to 39 are consistent with 
this approach. Reconciliations between the management and statutory bases are 
provided in note 8 to the ﬁnancial statements and in the Supplementary Information 
section.
The Committee has reviewed the prominence given to statutory and alternative 
performance measures and has concluded that sufficient disclosure, explanation 
and reconciliations are provided. It believes the approach adopted provides the 
most useful analysis of the year’s results.
REIT status
The Group must comply with the 
UK REIT regulations to beneﬁt from 
the favourable tax regime.
Failure to comply would result in tax charges and penalties that would have 
a signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s results.
The Committee reviews compliance with the REIT tests which are reported on as 
part of the quarterly report presented by the Finance Director to the Board and 
concluded that there was full compliance and signiﬁcant headroom for the 
current year.
Going concern and viability
The Company’s ongoing solvency 
and liquidity is a critical risk to its future 
viability and the appropriateness of 
preparation of the Group ﬁnancial 
statements.
The Board’s assessment of going 
concern is on page 1 10 and its 
Viability statement is on page 41.
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the going concern assumption in 
the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements and whether the business was viable 
in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
It considered the quarterly reports presented by the Finance Director to the Board 
which included the Group’s three year proﬁt and cash ﬂow forecasts, committed 
and undrawn debt facilities and expected headroom under the ﬁnancial covenants 
in those facilities.
The Committee reviewed management’s assumptions about the principle risks 
facing the Group, future trading performance, rental income growth, valuation 
projections, capital expenditure, funding requirements and gearing levels. 
It considered the amount of stress testing undertaken and the appropriateness 
of the three year assessment period.
In light of this review, the Committee conﬁrmed to the Board that it was appropriate 
for the ﬁnancial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis and that there 
was a reasonable expectation that the Company would be able to continue in 
operation over the three year viability period.

External audit
Deloitte LLP was appointed as external 
auditor following a formal tender 
process in 2013. Current UK regulations 
require rotation of the lead audit 
partner every ﬁve years, a formal 
tender of the auditor every ten years 
and a change of auditor every 20 
years. The lead partner, Claire Faulkner, 
who has held office for the past four 
years, will be stepping down following 
the conclusion of this year’s audit and 
Georgina Robb has been appointed as 
her successor. Georgina has shadowed 
the audit partner and team this year.
The Committee has assessed the 
performance, independence, objectivity 
and fees of the external auditor 
through discussions with the Finance 
Director and senior management 
team and through a review of 
the audit deliverables. In addition 
the Committee Chairman meets 
independently with the Audit Partner 
on a regular basis throughout the year.
In making its assessment, the Committee 
considers the qualiﬁcations, expertise 
and resources of the audit partner 
and team as well as the quality and 
timeliness of the audit deliverables. 
It reviewed the extent to which the audit 
plan was met, the level of independent 
challenge and scrutiny applied to the 
audit and the depth of understanding 
of key accounting judgements. 
It considered the interaction with and 
feedback from senior management 
in the audit process, focusing on the 
early identiﬁcation and resolution of 
issues and judgements and the quality 
and timely provision of draft accounts 
for review. The results of the audit 
debrief meeting held between senior 
management and the audit team 
are relayed to the Audit Committee 
along with any areas identiﬁed 
for improvement.
The Committee recognises the 
importance of auditor objectivity 
and independence and understands 
that this could be compromised by 
the provision of non audit services. 
This year it has reviewed and refreshed 
the Company’s policy governing 
the provision of non audit services in 
light of legislative changes including 
the 2016 update to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, Guidance 
on Audit Committees and the 
FRC’s Ethical Standard for Auditors. 
It took into account the fact that all 
taxation services and remuneration 
advice is provided separately by 
PwC and corporate due diligence 
and liquidation work is undertaken 
by BDO LLP .
However, the Company’s policy 
recognises that there may be certain 
circumstances where, due to Deloitte’s 
expertise and knowledge of the 
Company or real estate sector, it is 
appropriate for them to undertake 
non audit work.
A thorough assessment of each case is 
undertaken by the Executive Directors 
who observe the following guidelines;
• Pre approval of fees by the Executive 
Directors up to a limit of £100,000 or 
referral to the Audit Committee for 
review and approval
• Proposed arrangements to maintain 
auditor independence
• Conﬁrmation from the auditors that 
they are acting independently
• Certain services are prohibited from 
being undertaken by the external 
auditors including bookkeeping, 
preparing ﬁnancial statements, 
design and implementation of 
ﬁnancial information systems, 
valuation, remuneration and 
legal services

Audit and non audit fees to Deloitte
The table below sets out the ratio of 
non audit to audit fees for each of 
the past three years. The three year 
average ratio of non audit fees to audit 
fees is less than 1%, supporting the 
Committee’s conclusion that Deloitte 
remains independent and that the 
level on non audit fees is not material.
Deloitte has conﬁrmed to the 
Audit Committee that they remain 
independent and have maintained 
internal safeguards to ensure the 
objectivity of the engagement 
partner and audit staff is not impaired. 
They have also conﬁrmed that they 
have internal procedures in place to 
identify any aspects of non audit work 
which could compromise their role as 
auditors and to ensure the objectivity 
of their audit report.
Having undertaken its review, in the 
opinion of the Audit Committee, the 
2017 audit was appropriately planned, 
executed and of a high quality, there 
continues to be a good working 
relationship between management 
and Deloitte, who remain independent 
and objective. 
It has recommended to the Board 
that a resolution is proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM to reappoint 
Deloitte LLP as the Company’s 
and Group’s auditor.
The Company has complied with 
the provisions of the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) 
Order 2014 during the year.

Risk management  
and internal controls
The Board is ultimately responsible 
for establishing and maintaining 
the Group’s framework of risk 
management and internal control 
and for determining the nature and 
extent of the principal risks it is willing to 
take to achieve its strategic objectives. 
It recognises that risk is inherent in 
running the business and understands 
that effective risk management is 
critical to the decision making process 
and ultimate success of the Group.
The risk framework and processes 
in place to identify, evaluate and 
manage the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group are 
described in the Risk management 
section on pages 40 to 47 .
The system is designed to give the 
Board conﬁdence that the risks 
are managed or mitigated as far 
as possible. However, it should be 
noted that no system can eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve the 
Group’s objectives entirely and can 
only provide reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board undertakes a robust 
assessment of the principal and 
emerging risks facing the business at 
each meeting and has adopted a risk 
dashboard as a standing agenda item 
which highlights changes in the Group’s 
exposure to current and emerging risks 
and the mitigation thereof.
The Board has delegated responsibility 
for reviewing the effectiveness of the 
risk management framework and 
internal control environment and 
compliance with the Code to the 
Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee carries out an 
annual review of the risk register and 
reports its ﬁndings to the Board. The risk 
register was last updated in February 
2017 and presented to the Audit 
Committee at their planning meeting 
in March. The risk register identiﬁes 
the following for each key strategic, 
economic, transactional and ﬁnancial 
risk facing the business:
• Signiﬁcance and probability 
of each risk
• Controls and safeguards in place 
to manage and minimise each risk
• Movements in the Group’s exposure 
to the risk since the last review
• Allocated owner of the risk and 
management of safeguards
A key part of the risk management 
process is the identiﬁcation and 
assessment of risks which is the 
responsibility of the Executive 
Committee assisted by senior 
management. Short reporting lines 
and operating from one office ensures 
the Executive Directors have close 
involvement in day to day matters 
allowing early identiﬁcation of risks and 
development of mitigation strategies.
The Audit Committee monitors and 
reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal controls. It receives 
an annual internal control evaluation 
questionnaire which is completed by 
senior management and other reports 
provided by the external auditor.
The key elements of the Group’s 
internal control framework are 
as follows:
• A deﬁned schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board’s attention
• A documented appraisal and 
approval process for all signiﬁcant 
capital expenditure
• A comprehensive and robust system 
of ﬁnancial budgeting, forecasting 
and reporting
• Short term cash ﬂow forecasting 
that is considered weekly by the 
Executive Committee
• An integrated ﬁnancial and property 
management system
• An organisational structure with 
clearly deﬁned roles, responsibilities 
and limits of authority that 
facilitates effective and efficient 
decision making
• Close involvement of the Executive 
Directors in day to day operations 
including regular meetings 
with senior management on all 
operational aspects of the business
• Disciplined monthly meetings 
of the Executive, Investment, 
Asset Management and 
Finance Committees
• The maintenance of a risk register 
and quarterly risk dashboard 
highlighting movements in 
principal and emerging risks 
and mitigation strategies
• A formal whistle blowing policy
The requirement for a dedicated 
internal audit function was reviewed 
by the Audit Committee during the 
year and was not felt to be necessary 
or appropriate given the size and 
structure of the Group, the close day 
to day involvement of the Executive 
Directors and the internal control 
procedures in place. This is kept 
under regular review.
Based on its review and assessment, the 
Audit Committee is satisﬁed that there 
are no material weaknesses in the 
Group’s internal control structure and 
an effective risk management system 
is in place, and has reported these 
ﬁndings to the Board. It concluded 
that risks were properly categorised, 
understood and acted upon 
if necessary.

Fair, balanced and understandable
At the request of the Board, the Audit 
Committee considered whether the 
2017 Annual Report and Accounts was 
fair, balanced and understandable 
and whether it provided the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy. The Audit 
Committee is satisﬁed that the 
Annual Report and Accounts met 
this requirement.
In reaching this decision the Committee 
scrutinised the procedures in place 
and adopted by management in the 
preparation of the Annual Report, 
which included the following:
• The establishment of a team of senior 
managers drawn from ﬁnance, 
investor relations and property with 
clear responsibilities for preparation 
and review of relevant sections of 
the report
• Regular team meetings were held 
during the drafting stages to ensure 
consistency of tone and message, 
balanced content and appropriate 
linking of the various sections
• Regulatory and technical updates 
were provided by and discussed 
with the external auditor as part 
of a technical brieﬁng workshop 
attended by relevant staff in 
February 2017
• The Chief Executive provided early 
input to and agreed the overall 
message and tone of the report
• The Executive Directors were closely 
involved in the initial drafting process 
and reviewed their respective 
draft sections
• An extensive veriﬁcation exercise 
was undertaken to ensure 
factual accuracy
• The ﬁnal draft report was reviewed by 
the Audit Committee and discussed 
with the Finance Director and 
senior management before being 
presented for Board approval
In addition, the Committee considered 
whether the Annual Report had been 
written in straightforward language, 
without unnecessary repetition and 
the use of any alternative performance 
measures had been adequately 
explained and reconciled to the 
ﬁnancial statements.
The Directors’ statement on fair, 
balanced and understandable is on 
page 1 1 1 and their ﬁndings can be 
summarised as follows:
Fair
• Includes relevant transactions 
and balances
• Includes required regulatory 
disclosures
Balanced
• Consistent throughout
• Appropriate mix of statutory and 
alternative performance measures
• Alternative measures explained
Understandable
• Straight forward language
• Lack of repetition
• Use of diagrams and charts
• Clear cross references and links
• Clear contents pages to

Chairman’s introduction
The Group’s Remuneration Policy 
(‘Policy’) is designed to align 
Executive pay and incentives with 
the Company’s goals and encourage 
and reward exceptional overall and 
individual performance. 
The Policy we have operated for 
the past three ﬁnancial years was 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 
AGM and our new Policy, which is 
presented on pages 88 to 99, is being 
put forward for a binding vote at the 
forthcoming AGM. The Committee 
believes the proposed Policy is 
better suited to incentivise and 
motivate management to deliver the 
Company’s strategy over the next 
three year period and this is explained 
in further detail in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy report.
Our Annual Report on Remuneration 
contains details of our payouts during 
the ﬁnancial year being reported on 
and how we intend to implement 
our new Policy for the year ended 
31 March 2018. This part of the report is 
subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
Performance during 2016/17
The KPIs which underpin the 
Company’s incentive plans are EPRA 
earnings per share (EPS), total property 
return (TPR), total accounting return 
(TAR) and total shareholder return (TSR).
The Group’s decision to reposition the 
portfolio towards the logistics market 
away from the physical retail market 
to reﬂect the change in consumer 
shopping patterns is proving to be 
proﬁtable. The long term secure income 
ﬂows from the logistics sector supported 
by our development strategy has 
delivered strong ﬁnancial performance 
which is reﬂected in the sums paid to 
Executive Directors in the year.
The Group remains committed to 
a progressive dividend that is fully 
covered by EPRA earnings and has 
increased its payment this year by 
3.4% to 7 .5p per share.
EPRA earnings per share has increased 
by 5.1% to 8.2p and EPRA net assets 
per share by 1.4% to 149.8p. Group like 
for like net rental income increased by 
4.6% and the Group’s total property 
return of 7 .4% outperformed the IPD 
Quarterly Universe Index reweighted 
to the Group’s core assets of 5.9% by 
150bp. Total accounting return for the 
year was 6.4%.

Annual bonus 
The Executive Directors have delivered 
successfully against a large number of 
operational and strategic objectives 
including contracted income growth, 
portfolio repositioning, diversiﬁed 
funding, delivery of developments 
and strengthened relationships with 
key stakeholders. 
This strong ﬁnancial and non ﬁnancial 
performance has been taken into 
account when considering the 
variable elements of remuneration. 
The Committee has calculated annual 
bonuses for the Executive Directors 
to be at 89% of their respective 
maximum levels. 
Half of the bonus will be deferred into 
shares which vest in equal tranches 
over three years. 
LTIP vesting 
Vesting of the LTIP awards granted 
to Executive Directors in 2014 is 
dependent on Company performance 
over the three year period to 
31 March 2017 . 
Performance is measured by reference 
to TSR versus the FTSE 350 Real Estate 
Super Sector and EPRA EPS growth. 
The Committee assessed performance 
and based on actual EPRA EPS of 8.2p 
and TSR performance of 25.2%, 100% 
of both components are expected 
to vest in June 2017 , subject to 
continued service.
The Committee is satisﬁed that the 
level of payout under the variable 
incentive plans is appropriate given 
the performance outcomes over the 
respective performance period. 
No discretion was exercised by 
the Committee in relation to 
these outcomes. 
Salary increases
The Committee approved salary 
increases of 2.0% for the Executive 
Directors, effective from 1 June 2017 
which are lower than the increases 
for employees generally of 3.1%.
Policy renewal 
Increased minimum shareholding and 
new post cessation requirements
One of the core principles of the 
current Policy is to create alignment 
between shareholders and Executive 
Directors by encouraging high levels of 
Executive share ownership. 
The Committee believes that the Policy 
has been successful in achieving this, 
as demonstrated by the table on 
page 85 which shows how a shift in the 
Company’s share price has a material 
ﬁnancial impact on each Executive 
Director thereby ensuring they share 
the same ownership experience as 
other shareholders. 
Furthermore, this core principle has 
shaped one of the enhancements 
to the new Policy where we are 
increasing the minimum shareholding 
requirement for the Executive Directors 
to 700% of salary from 400%. 
This, coupled with the introduction of a 
one year post cessation share holding 
period equal to an individual’s salary 
will ensure that Executive Directors 
are incentivised to deliver sustainable 
results and will also ensure they have 
an incentive to manage an orderly 
succession on departure.
Opt-out of Bonus Deferral
In conjunction with the increase to the 
minimum shareholding requirements, 
we are proposing that Executive 
Directors can opt out of annual 
bonus deferral if they have met the 
increased requirement. 
The key purpose of bonus deferral is 
to link the interests of the Executive 
Directors and shareholders in the 
long term. 
This objective will have been achieved 
when Executive Directors have satisﬁed 
the heightened minimum shareholder 
requirements and therefore any 
incremental bonus deferral will have 
an immaterial impact given the size 
of their shareholdings. 
PwC research conducted with the 
London School of Economics indicates 
that Executive Directors perceive 
a time and forfeiture risk discount 
of 10-20% per annum to deferred 
share bonus awards, therefore the 
increased liquidity provided by cash 
payments increases the economic 
value of the remuneration and 
therefore the competitiveness of the 
Company without increasing headline 
incentive opportunities. 
In recognition of this change, the 
Committee is reducing the maximum 
bonus potential under the Policy from 
200% of salary to 175% of salary for 
newly appointed Executive Directors. 
The maximum bonus potential for the 
current Executive Directors is being 
retained at 165% of salary for the Chief 
Executive and 140% of salary for the 
other Executive Directors for the next 
ﬁnancial year.
For Executive Directors who have 
not met the minimum shareholding 
requirement, deferral of up to 100% 
of the annual bonus for three years 
may apply, which is increased from 
50% deferral under the current Policy. 
In addition, shares will only vest at the 
end of a three year deferral period 
subject to continued employment 
rather than in three equal tranches over 
three years under the current policy.
LTIP holding period
The Committee proposes to alter 
the LTIP to ensure performance is 
sustainable and it is aligned with 
corporate governance best practice 
by introducing a two year post-vesting 
holding period during which the 
Executive Directors cannot dispose 
of shares, other than for tax purposes. 
All other terms of the LTIP remain the 
same as under the current policy.
The schematic on page 84 shows the 
proposed operation of the LTIP for the 
Chief Executive under the new Policy.

Shareholder consultation
The Committee consulted extensively 
with shareholders and the main 
shareholder representative bodies, 
Institutional Shareholder Services, the 
Investment Association and Glass Lewis 
on the proposed Policy. 
One of the areas discussed with 
shareholders was whether to introduce 
an element to the LTIP where 
performance was measured over 
a period of one year. 
The Committee felt that whilst 
the current ﬁnancial LTIP metrics 
measure the output of a successful 
implementation of strategy over a 
ﬁxed three year time period they do 
not reﬂect the decisions which are 
likely to make them sustainable such 
as business/asset mix, new markets 
and acquisitions. 
For a heavily cyclical business such as 
LondonMetric it is equally important to 
incentivise strategic and operational 
objectives which have an impact on 
the long term sustainable performance 
of the business but may not be 
in either the current bonus or LTIP 
performance scorecard. 
The nature of operational/strategic 
targets is that they ﬂex and change 
over time and therefore the Committee 
proposal was to set and assess 
targets annually. 
Recognising that the performance 
risk is less with an element assessed 
annually compared to over three years 
the Committee proposed a reduction 
in the maximum LTIP award level from 
the current policy. 
Following the shareholder consultation 
exercise and having considered the 
proposed one year targets of LTV, EPRA 
cost ratio and portfolio weighting, the 
Committee decided not to proceed 
with the one year LTIP performance 
measure for the following reasons:
• The Committee on reﬂection felt 
that these objectives could be 
used as part of the current annual 
bonus plan within the personal 
objectives category
• Their use within the bonus under the 
personal objectives category would 
allow the Committee to provide 
more qualitative and granular 
disclosure of the objectives and 
targets; something requested by a 
number of shareholders during the 
consultation; and
•  The removal of the annual 
element of the LTIP simpliﬁed the 
incentive proposals in line with the 
Committee’s desires and in line 
with the feedback from some of 
the shareholders.
Following the Committee’s decision not 
to proceed with the annual element 
of the LTIP it determined that the LTIP 
would continue to operate with the 
same maximum and terms as under 
the current Policy but with the addition 
of a holding period.
The Company is grateful for the 
engagement and constructive 
suggestions made during this process 
at the end of which the majority of 
shareholders indicated that they were 
supportive of the proposed Policy.

Actual total remuneration compared to the 2017 potential
The following charts show the actual remuneration earned 
by the Executive Directors against the minimum, on target 
and maximum scenarios for the year.
The remuneration payable to each of the Executive Directors 
is based on salaries agreed for the year under three different 
performance scenarios: (i) Minimum; (ii) Target; and (iii) 
Maximum. The elements of remuneration have been 
categorised into three components: (i) Fixed; (ii) Annual 
Bonus (including Deferred Bonus); and (iii) LTIP . 
The target scenarios assume 50% payout of the maximum 
opportunity under the annual bonus and 25% (being 
threshold vesting) of the LTIP . For the purposes of comparison 
we have included the single ﬁgure remuneration for the year 
ending 31 March 2017 . 
A comparison of the actual remuneration earned compared 
to the Policy scenarios demonstrates the strong performance 
of the Company over the period with actual remuneration 
being between the on target and maximum Policy scenarios.

Due to the large shareholdings of the Executive Directors, 
a relatively small change in the share price would have a 
material impact on their wealth. For example, a 10p dip 
in share price would result in a loss in value for the Chief 
Executive equivalent to 102% of his annual salary. It is the 
Committee’s view that it is important when considering 
the remuneration paid in the year under the single ﬁgure 
to take a holistic view of the Director’s total wealth linked 
to the performance of the Company. In the Committee’s 
opinion, the impact on the total wealth of the Director 
is more important than the single ﬁgure in any one year; 
this approach encourages Directors to take a long term 
view of the sustainable performance of the Company; this 
is critical in a cyclical business. The ability for the Directors to 
gain and lose dependent on the share price performance 
of the Company at a level which is material to their total 
remuneration is a key facet of the Company’s future 
Remuneration Policy.

How we intend to operate the Policy next year
The table below illustrates the implementation of our new Policy for the coming year.

Standard beneﬁts will be provided. See Remuneration 
Policy for further details.
Annual bonus 
The maximum bonus opportunity will remain at 165% of 
salary for the Chief Executive and 140% of salary for the 
other Executive Directors.
The performance conditions and their weightings for the 
annual bonus are as follows:

are commercially sensitive and accordingly these are 
not disclosed. These will be reported and disclosed 
retrospectively next year in order for shareholders to assess 
the basis for any payouts. 
Under the proposed Policy, bonus deferral will not apply 
for the Executive Directors if they have met the new 
shareholding guideline. At the date of this report, each 
of the Executive Directors’ shareholdings exceeds their 
minimum requirements.
LTIP 
In line with the operation last year, awards made under the 
LTIP in the year to 31 March 2018 will be 200% of salary for 
the Chief Executive and 165% for other Executive Directors.

87 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The previous Remuneration Policy for the Group which was 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM on 17 July 2014 
for a period of three years is near expiry. This section outlines 
the new Remuneration Policy which, subject to shareholder 
approval, will take effect for three years from the 2017 AGM 
on 11 July 2017. 
Overview of our new Policy
The overriding objective is to operate a fair and transparent 
Remuneration Policy which motivates and retains 
individuals of the highest calibre and rewards the delivery 
of the Group’s key strategic priorities, long term growth 
and attractive shareholder returns. As well as motivating, 
remuneration plays a key role in retaining highly regarded 
individuals and needs to be competitive.
The principles which underpin the current Policy continue to 
be relevant to ensure that Executive Directors’ remuneration:
• Is aligned to the business strategy and achievement 
of business goals
• Is aligned with the interests of shareholders by 
encouraging high levels of share ownership
• Attracts, motivates and retains high calibre individuals
• Is competitive in relation to other comparable 
property companies
• Is set in the context of pay and employment conditions 
of other employees 
• Rewards superior performance through the variable 
elements of remuneration that are linked to performance
The table below outlines the key changes the Committee 
is proposing to ensure the Policy remains ﬁt for purpose and 
adheres to the principles outlined.
Remuneration continued
Area Proposed change Rationale for change
Minimum shareholding 
requirement
Increase the minimum shareholding 
requirement from 400% of salary to 700% 
of salary for existing Executive Directors. 
Current arrangement will apply for new 
Executive Directors.
Increasing the current shareholding 
requirement will ensure the lock-in and 
sustained alignment between Executive 
Directors and shareholder interests.
Post leaving shareholding 
requirement
Introduction of a post-leaving shareholding 
requirement of 100% of salary lasting one 
year from the date of cessation.
Ensures a focus on successful succession 
planning providing an ongoing equity risk and 
is in line with emerging shareholder sentiment.
LTIP post vesting holding 
period
Introduction of a two year holding period 
during which individuals cannot sell shares 
other than for tax purposes.
Five year time period for long term incentives 
is in line with corporate governance best 
practice.
Bonus deferral Executive Directors who have met their 
minimum shareholding requirement may opt 
out of bonus deferral and receive 100% of 
the annual bonus in cash. 
For those who have not met the minimum 
requirement, deferral may be up to 100% of 
the annual bonus (minimum 50%).
Deferred share bonus payments, where 
operated, to vest in full after three years as 
opposed to in three equal instalments over 
the three year period.
The key purpose of bonus deferral is to link 
the interests of the Executive Directors and 
shareholders in the long term.
The extensive shareholding already built up by 
the Executive Directors has achieved this goal 
and therefore share price movements have 
a material impact on wealth.
Cash payments increase the economic 
value of the remuneration without increasing 
headline incentive opportunities.
Vesting schedule of deferred shares brought 
in line with market practice.
Maximum bonus 
opportunity
Maximum bonus award in exceptional 
circumstances reduced from 200% to 175% 
of salary.
For current Executive Directors the maximum 
level of award is retained at 165%.
Reduced level of awards in exceptional 
circumstances will achieve a similar perceived 
value in light of the potential removal of bonus 
deferral.
Malus and clawback 
provisions
The new Policy provides clariﬁcation on the 
malus and clawback circumstances and 
the time horizons within which they may 
be operated.
These changes provide further protection for 
the Company and shareholders and help to 
ensure sustainable performance.

Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy Table
Base salary
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Provide a competitive level of ﬁxed pay to attract and retain Executive Directors of the required 
calibre to deliver the Group’s strategy.
Level of pay reﬂects individuals’ skills, seniority and experience and complexity of the role.
Operation An Executive Director’s basic salary is set on appointment and reviewed annually with changes 
taking effect from 1 June or when there is a change in position or responsibility.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Committee considers:
• Pay increases to other employees
• Remuneration practices within comparable property companies
• Any change in scope, role and responsibilities
• The general performance of the Company and each individual
• The experience of the relevant Director
• The economic environment
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set 
below the targeted policy level until they become established in their role. 
In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the general rise for employees 
until the target positioning is achieved.
Maximum  
opportunity
The Committee ensures that maximum salary levels are positioned in line with companies of 
a similar size to the Group and validated against other property companies, so that they are 
competitive against the market.
The Committee intends to review the comparator group each year and will add or remove 
companies as it considers appropriate. 
In general, salary increases for Executive Directors will be in line with the increase for employees. 
However, larger increases may be offered if there is a material change in the scope and 
responsibilities of the role, including signiﬁcant changes in Group size and/or complexity or if it is 
necessary to remain competitive to retain a Director.
The Company will set out in the section of the Annual Report on Remuneration headed Statement 
of Implementation of Remuneration Policy, in the following ﬁnancial year, the salaries for that year 
for each of the Executive Directors.
Performance  
measures
The Directors are subject to an annual performance assessment, the outcome of which is taken 
account of in setting base salaries.
Pension
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Provide a competitive post-retirement beneﬁt to attract and retain individuals.
Operation The Company provides a pension contribution allowance in line with practice relative to its 
comparators to enable the Company to recruit and retain Executive Directors with the experience 
and expertise to deliver the Group’s strategy.
This allowance will be a non-consolidated allowance and will not impact any incentive 
calculations.
Maximum  
opportunity
The maximum contribution is 15% of salary which is payable as a monthly contribution to the 
Executive Director’s individual personal pension plan or taken as a cash equivalent. Salary sacriﬁce 
arrangements can apply. No element other than base salary is pensionable.
Performance  
measures
None.
89 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Remuneration continued
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy Table continued
Beneﬁts
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Provide a comprehensive and competitive beneﬁt package to aid recruitment and the retention 
of high quality Executive Directors.
Operation Each Executive Director receives the following:
• Car allowance
• Private medical insurance
• Life insurance
• Permanent health insurance
The Committee recognises the need to maintain suitable ﬂexibility in the beneﬁts provided to 
ensure it is able to support the objective of attracting and retaining personnel in order to deliver 
the Group strategy. Additional beneﬁts which are available to other employees on broadly similar 
terms may therefore be offered.
Maximum  
opportunity
Car allowance is £20,000 per annum for each Executive Director.
Other beneﬁts are provided at the market rate and therefore the cost will vary from year to year 
based on the cost from third party providers.
Performance  
measures
None.
Annual bonus
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Incentivise the achievement of annual ﬁnancial targets consistent with the Group’s business plan 
for the relevant ﬁnancial year with particular focus on total property return (TPR) and EPRA earnings 
per share (EPS) as well as the delivery of agreed personal objectives. 
Operation Annual performance targets are set by the Committee at the start of the ﬁnancial year linked to 
the Group’s long term strategy of growth in EPRA EPS and TPR. At least half of the bonus will be 
linked to the key property and ﬁnancial metrics. Non ﬁnancial targets are set to measure individual 
strategic performance and contribution to the achievement of portfolio management initiatives 
and other operational management objectives.
Executive Directors who have met their minimum shareholding requirement have the option to 
receive the annual bonus paid in cash. For those who are yet to meet the minimum shareholding 
requirement, up to 100% of the annual bonus will be paid in deferred shares vesting after three 
years. No further performance conditions will apply to these shares other than continued 
employment and dividend equivalents are paid out at the end of the vesting period.
The annual bonus contains malus and clawback provisions as noted on page 95.
Maximum  
opportunity
The current maximum bonus for the Chief Executive is 165% of salary and 140% of salary for the 
other Executive Directors.
The payout for on target performance is 50% of the maximum and the payout for threshold 
performance is 25% of maximum.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, the Committee may award a bonus 
opportunity of up to 1 75% of salary. However, the maximum bonus limit for current Executive 
Directors will be capped at 165%, i.e. no exceptional awards will be made to existing Executive 
Directors.
Performance 
measures
Performance is assessed against target ﬁnancial and non ﬁnancial measures which may vary 
each year depending on the annual priorities of the business. At least half of the bonus payment 
is subject to ﬁnancial and/or property performance targets. 
The Committee will set challenging annual targets consistent with the Group’s business strategy 
that are appropriately stretching, but achievable. The Committee is of the opinion that due to the 
commercial sensitivity of annual targets, targets will be disclosed retrospectively.
Details of the targets set and measures applied for the current ﬁnancial year can be found in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 101 and 102.
The Committee retains discretion to make downward or upward adjustments to the amount of 
bonus payable resulting from the application of the performance measures if it believes that the 
outcomes are not a fair and accurate reﬂection of business performance.

Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy Table continued
Long term incentives 
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Incentivise and reward the delivery of long term Group performance and sustained growth in 
line with business strategy, thereby building a shareholding in the Group and aligning Executive 
Directors’ interests with shareholders’ interests.
Operation The LTIP rules were approved by the shareholders at the 2013 AGM.
Awards are granted annually to Executive Directors in the form of a conditional share award or nil 
cost option. 
Details of the performance conditions for grants made in the year will be set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration. If the Committee decides that the selected strategic metrics are 
commercially sensitive for future grants, details will be disclosed retrospectively in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Awards will normally vest at the end of a three year period subject to:
• the Executive Director’s continued employment at the date of vesting
• satisfaction of the performance conditions
Vested awards will be subject to a further two year holding period during which Executive Directors 
cannot dispose of shares other than for tax purposes.
The Committee may award dividend equivalents on awards that vest.
The LTIP contains malus and clawback provisions as noted on page 95.
Maximum  
opportunity
Annual awards with a maximum value of up to 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 165% 
of salary for the other Executive Directors based on the market value at the date of grant set in 
accordance with the rules of the LTIP .
25% of the award will vest for threshold performance.
100% of the award will vest for maximum performance. There is straight line vesting between these 
points.
Performance 
measures
For the awards to be made in the year to 31 March 2018, the following three year performance 
measures will apply to the award:
• Total Shareholder Return (TSR) exceeding the TSR of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Super Sector Index 
(excluding agencies and operators) 
• relative Total Accounting Return (TAR)
• EPRA EPS growth versus a base target plus RPI
The award to be made in the year to 31 March 2018 will be measured as follows: 
• 37 .5% on relative TSR
• 37 .5% on relative TAR 
• 25% on EPRA EPS growth
The Committee may change the balance of the measures, or use different measures for 
subsequent awards as appropriate.
No material change will be made to the type of performance conditions without prior shareholder 
consultation.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee retains the discretion to:
• vary, substitute or waive the performance conditions applying to LTIP Awards if it considers 
it appropriate and the new performance conditions are deemed reasonable and are not 
materially less difficult to satisfy than the original conditions
• make downward or upward adjustments to the amount vesting under the LTIP award resulting 
from the application of the performance measures if it believes that the outcomes are not a fair 
and accurate reﬂection of business performance

Non Executive Directors are paid an annual fee and additional fees for chairmanship of 
Committees and for the Senior Independent Director. The Company retains the ﬂexibility to pay 
fees for the membership of Committees. The Chairman does not receive any additional fees for 
membership of Committees.
Fees are reviewed annually based on equivalent roles in the comparator group used to review 
salaries paid to the Executive Directors. 
Non Executive Directors and the Chairman do not participate in any variable remuneration 
arrangements or other beneﬁts arrangements.
Maximum  
opportunity
The fees for Non Executive Directors and the Chairman are broadly set at a competitive level 
against the comparator group.
In general the level of fee increase for the Non Executive Directors and the Chairman will be set 
taking account of any change in responsibility. The aggregate fee for Non Executive Directors and 
the Chairman will not exceed £1 million.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the Non Executive Directors and Chairman 
and may settle any tax incurred in relation to these.
Recruitment remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors
Remuneration 
element Recruitment Policy
Salary, Beneﬁts  
and Pension
These will be set in line with the policy for existing Executive Directors.
Annual Bonus Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing Executive 
Directors and will not exceed 165% of salary (1 75% of salary in exceptional circumstances).
LTIP Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing Executive 
Directors and will not exceed 200% of salary.
Maximum Variable 
Remuneration
The maximum variable remuneration which may be granted in normal circumstances is 365% 
of salary (375% of salary in exceptional circumstances). This excludes in both cases the value 
of any buyouts. 
‘Buyout’ of incentives 
forfeited on cessation 
of employment
Where the Committee determines that the individual circumstances of recruitment justiﬁes the 
provision of a buyout, the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation of 
an Executive Director’s previous employment (the lapsed valued) will be calculated taking into 
account the following:
• the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the Executive Director’s 
cessation of employment
• the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of 
them being satisﬁed 
• any other terms and conditions having a material effect on their value
The Committee may then grant up to the same value as the lapsed value under the Company’s 
incentive plans. To the extent that it was not possible or practical to provide the buyout within the 
terms of the Company’s existing incentive plans, a bespoke arrangement would be used.
Relocation Policies In instances where the new Executive Director is required to relocate or spend signiﬁcant time away 
from their normal residence, the Company may provide one-off compensation to reﬂect the cost of 
relocation for the Executive Director. The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case 
by case basis but will take into consideration any cost of living differences and schooling.

Service contracts and payment for loss of office
Remuneration 
element Treatment on cessation of employment
General The Committee will honour Executive Directors’ contractual entitlements. Service contracts 
do not contain liquidated damages clauses. If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee 
will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. There are no 
contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on 
severance or early retirement. There is no agreement between the Company and its Directors or 
employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a 
takeover bid. The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments 
are made in good faith to discharge an existing legal obligation, or by way of damages for breach 
of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with 
the termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment.
Salary, Beneﬁts 
and Pension
These will be paid over the notice period. The Company has discretion to make a lump sum 
payment in lieu.
Cash bonus Good leaver: performance conditions will be measured at the bonus measurement date. Bonus will 
normally be pro-rated for the period worked during the ﬁnancial year.
Other reason: no bonus payable for year of cessation.
Discretion: the Committee has the following elements of discretion:
• to determine that an Executive Director is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only 
use this discretion in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be 
explained in full to shareholders
• to determine whether to pro-rate the bonus to time. The Committee’s normal policy is that it 
will pro-rate bonus for time. It is the Committee’s intention to use discretion to not pro-rate in 
circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to 
shareholders
Deferred share awards Good leaver: all subsisting deferred share awards will vest.
Other reason: lapse of any unvested deferred share awards.
Discretion: the Committee has the following elements of discretion:
• to determine that an Executive Director is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only 
use this discretion in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be 
explained in full to shareholders
• to vest deferred shares at the end of the original deferral period or at the date of cessation. 
The Committee will make this determination depending on the type of good leaver reason 
resulting in the cessation
• to determine whether to pro-rate the maximum number of shares to the time from the date 
of grant to the date of cessation. The Committee’s normal policy is that it will not pro-rate awards 
for time. The Committee will determine whether or not to pro-rate based on the circumstances 
of the Executive Directors’ departure
LTIP Good leaver: pro-rated to time and performance in respect of each subsisting LTIP award.
Other reason: lapse of any unvested LTIP awards.
Discretion: the Committee has the following elements of discretion:
• to determine that an Executive Director is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only

Remuneration continued
The Committee’s remuneration decisions are heavily steered by the Group’s strategic direction and corporate objectives, 
as reﬂected by the selected performance metrics for the annual bonus and the LTIP . The following table demonstrates 
how the Company’s strategic KPIs are aligned to our incentive arrangements. Further details of these KPIs can be found 
on pages 24 and 25 of this Annual Report.

In the Committee’s opinion it is key that the incentive arrangements operated by the Company are directly linked to the 
achievement of the Company’s strategy and overall corporate objectives. It is the Committee’s belief that the proposed 
incentive elements of the new Policy align with these objectives.
Strategy Link to Remuneration Policy
The following table outlines the Policy for the treatment of incentives in the event of a change of control:
94 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Recruitment remuneration arrangements 
The Company’s principle is that the remuneration of any 
new recruit will be assessed in line with the same principles 
as for the Executive Directors, as set out in the Remuneration 
Policy table. 
The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more 
than it considers necessary to secure a preferred candidate 
with the appropriate calibre and experience needed for 
the role. 
In setting the remuneration for new recruits, the Committee 
will have regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment 
regarding one-off or enhanced short term or long term 
incentive payments as well as giving consideration for the 
appropriateness of any performance measures associated 
with an award. 
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the 
policy would apply from the date of promotion but there 
would be no retrospective application of the policy in relation 
to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements. 
Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration 
package for an existing employee would be honoured 
and form part of the ongoing remuneration of the person 
concerned. These would be disclosed to shareholders 
in the Remuneration Committee report for the relevant 
ﬁnancial year.
New Non Executive Directors will be appointed through 
letters of appointment and fees set at a competitive market 
level and in line with the other existing Non Executive 
Directors. Letters of appointment are normally for an initial 
term of three years and are subject to a notice period of 
three months by either party.
Service contracts and payment for loss of office
The service contracts for the Executive Directors were 
reviewed and revised following the merger in 2013. 
Service contracts are terminable by either party with notice 
of 12 months. The Committee considers this appropriate for 
all existing and newly appointed Directors.
The Non Executive Directors do not have service contracts 
but are appointed under letters of appointment. Each Non 
Executive is subject to an initial three year term followed by 
annual re-election at the Company’s AGM.
The following deﬁnition of leavers will apply to both the 
annual bonus and the LTIP . A good leaver reason is deﬁned 
as cessation in the following circumstances:
• Death
• Ill-health
• Injury or disability
• Redundancy
• Retirement
• Employing company ceasing to be a Group company
• Transfer of employment to a company which is not a 
Group company
• At the discretion of the Committee
Cessation of employment in circumstances other than those 
set out above is cessation for other reasons.
Malus and clawback
The following deﬁnition of malus and clawback will apply to 
both the annual bonus (including any deferred shares) and 
the LTIP .
Malus is the adjustment of the annual bonus payments or 
unvested LTIP awards because of the occurrence of one or 
more circumstances listed below. The adjustment may result 
in the value being reduced to nil.
Clawback is the recovery of payments made under the 
annual bonus or vested LTIP awards as a result of the 
occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. 
Clawback may apply to all or part of a participant’s 
payment under the annual bonus or LTIP award and may be 
effected, among other means, by requiring the transfer of 
shares, payment of cash or reduction of awards or bonuses.
The circumstances in which malus and clawback could 
apply are as follows:
• Discovery of a material misstatement resulting in an 
adjustment in the audited accounts of the Group or any 
Group company
• The assessment of any performance condition or condition 
in respect of an annual bonus payment or LTIP award was 
based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information
• The discovery that any information used to determine the 
annual bonus payment or LTIP award was based on error, 
or inaccurate or misleading information
• Action or conduct of a participant which amounts to fraud 
or gross misconduct
• Events or the behaviour of a participant have led to 
the censure of a Group company by a regulatory 
authority or have had a signiﬁcant detrimental impact 
on the reputation of any Group company provided that 
the Board is satisﬁed that the relevant participant was 
responsible for the censure or reputational damage and 
that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to 
the participant
The following table outlines the time periods during which 
these recovery provisions may apply for each element 
of remuneration:

95 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Shareholding guidelines
Minimum shareholding requirement
In line with the Group’s remuneration principles, the 
Remuneration Policy places signiﬁcant importance on 
aligning the long term interests of shareholders with those 
of management by encouraging the Executive Directors to 
build up over a ﬁve year period and then subsequently hold 
a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of base salary. 
Adherence to these guidelines is a condition of continued 
participation in the equity incentive arrangements.
In addition, Executive Directors will be required to retain at 
least 50% of the post-tax amount of vested shares from the 
Company incentive plans until the minimum shareholding 
requirement is met and maintained. The following table sets 
out the minimum shareholding requirements.
Role
Shareholding 
requirement 
(% of salary)
Chief Executive 700%
Other Executive Directors 700%
Newly appointed Executive Directors 400%
The Committee has set the requirement at 400% of salary for 
the Policy period for newly appointed Executive Directors 
to reﬂect the practical maximum that could be achieved if 
all incentives were earned over the Policy period and paid 
in shares.
Post leaving shareholding requirement
The Committee has introduced a post leaving shareholding 
requirement for the Executive Directors, who must retain 
shares equivalent in value to one year’s salary for 12 months 
post cessation.
This requirement provides further long term alignment 
with shareholders and ensures a focus on successful 
succession planning.
Other directorships
Executive Directors are permitted to accept external, non 
executive appointments with the prior approval of the Board 
where such appointments are not considered to have an 
adverse impact on their role within the Group. Fees earned 
may be retained by the Director. There were no new 
appointments in the year. Andrew Jones is a Non Executive 
Director of Unite Plc and earned fees of £45,225 in the year 
to 31 March 2017 .
Employee considerations
The Company applies the same principles to the 
remuneration of all employees as it applies to the Executive 
Directors, namely that:
• Any incentive compensation is aligned to the business 
strategy and achievement of business goals
• The remuneration encourages employees to 
become shareholders
• The remuneration attracts, motivates and retains high 
calibre individuals
• The remuneration is competitive in relation to other 
comparable property companies 
• The incentive elements reward superior performance 
through the variable elements of remuneration that are 
linked to performance
The Committee is mindful of the internal pay relativities when 
setting pay for the Executive Directors. 
Whilst the Committee did not consult directly with employees 
on the drawing up of the new Policy given the small size of 
the Company, it believes that the Board as a whole has an 
accurate picture of employees’ views. 
The diagram below illustrates the cascade of pay structures 
throughout the business for the Chief Executive, other 
Executive Directors and senior management for the year to 
31 March 2017 .
The Committee believes this demonstrates a fair and 
transparent progression of remuneration throughout 
the Company which is in line with one of its core pay 
principles that variable performance based pay increases 
with seniority.

Statement of consideration of shareholder views
Following a thorough review of the current Remuneration 
Policy, the Committee carried out an extensive consultation 
with top shareholders and their representative bodies on 
the changes featured in the proposed Policy. We recognise 
the heightened attention placed on executive pay this 
year from both a political and corporate governance 
perspective, and have proposed a Policy which the 
majority of shareholders were supportive of during the 
consultation process. 
The Committee remains committed to ongoing dialogue 
with the Company’s shareholder base to ensure the views 
of all stakeholders are taken in to account in order to ensure 
the correct decisions are made for the Company.
Illustration of potential remuneration for Executive 
Directors under the new Policy
The charts below set out the potential remuneration 
receivable by the Executive Directors for the year to 
31 March 2018 reﬂecting base salaries proposed for the year 
commencing 1 April 2017 as reﬂected on page 87 and as 
increased from 1 June 2017 .
The minimum scenario reﬂects ﬁxed remuneration of salary, 
pension and beneﬁts only as the other elements are linked to 
future performance. Base salary is that to be paid in the year 
to 31 March 2018. Beneﬁts are as shown in the single ﬁgure 
remuneration table for the year for the year to 31 March 2017 
on page 101. 
The on target scenario reﬂects ﬁxed remuneration as above 
plus 50% of the maximum annual bonus entitlement and the 
threshold level of vesting for the LTIP awards, being 25% for 
each performance requirement.
The maximum scenario reﬂects the ﬁxed remuneration plus 
the maximum payout of all other incentive arrangements.

The charts below set out the target remuneration for each 
Executive Director for the year to 31 March 2018 based on 
whether the elements remain ‘at risk’, categorised as follows:
• Payment is subject to continuing employment for a period
• Performance conditions have yet to be satisﬁed
• Elements are subject to clawback or malus for a period, 
over which the Company can recover sums paid or 
withhold vesting
The annual bonus is at risk for three years due to the malus 
and clawback provisions on any paid awards, and are also 
at risk for one year prior to the payment of any awards due 
to the stretching annual performance conditions.

LTIP awards are at risk due to performance conditions and 
malus provisions applying for the ﬁrst three years of an 
award. Awards are at risk for a further two years due to the 
holding period during which Executive Directors cannot sell 
shares (other than to settle tax obligations relating to the 
award) and awards are subject to clawback. 
Figures have been calculated based on target performance 
(ﬁxed elements plus 50% of maximum annual bonus and 25% 
of the maximum LTIP). The charts have been based on the 
same assumptions as set out on page 97 for the illustrations 
of the potential remuneration for Executive Directors for the 
year to 31 March 2018.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Set out below is the Annual Report on Remuneration for the 
year ending 31 March 2017 which provides details of how 
the remuneration policy was applied and how we intend 
to apply the proposed policy for the year to 31 March 2018. 
It is subject to an advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM 
and complies with UK Corporate Governance Code, Listing 
Rules and The Large and Medium Sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013. The areas of the report which are subject to audit have 
been highlighted. 
The role of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee determines Directors’ remuneration in 
accordance with the approved policy and its terms 
of reference, which are reviewed annually by the 
Board and are available on the Company’s website at 
www.londonmetric.com.
The Committee’s responsibilities include the following:
• Setting and reviewing the Group’s overall remuneration 
policy and strategy
• Determining and reviewing individual 
remuneration packages 
• Determining and reviewing the rules for the Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Annual and Deferred Bonus 
Plan arrangements
• Approving salaries, bonuses and share awards for the 
Executive Directors
The Board recognises that it is ultimately accountable for 
executive remuneration but has delegated this responsibility 
to the Committee. All Committee members are Non 
Executive Directors of the Company, which is an important 
pre-requisite to ensure Executive Directors’ pay is set by 
Board members who have no personal ﬁnancial interest 
in the Company other than as potential shareholders. 
The Committee meets regularly without the Executive 
Directors being present and is independently advised by 
PwC, a signatory of the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of 
Conduct and which has no connection with the Group other 
than in the provision of advice on executive and employee 
remuneration matters and taxation advice. PwC were 
appointed as advisors during the ﬁnancial year under review 
after a competitive tender process, replacing New Bridge 
Street (a trading name of Aon plc). Total fees paid to New 
Bridge Street were £25,674 (2016: £103,195). Total fees paid to 
PwC in respect of remuneration advice to the Committee 
were £77 ,500. No Executive Director is involved in the 
determination of his own remuneration and fees for Non 
Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee 
and the Chief Executive and Finance Director attend 
meetings by invitation but are not present when their own 
pay is being discussed. 
The Chairman of the Committee reports to the Board 
on proceedings and outcomes following each 
Committee meeting. 
Meetings and activities
The Committee met on four occasions during the year.
The main activities of the Committee during the year and 
to the date of this report were as follows:
• Reviewed and designed the proposed Remuneration 
Policy to be put forward for shareholder approval at the 
AGM on 1 1 July 201 7
• Set a base EPS target for the 2016 LTIP awards and annual 
bonus for the year to 31 March 201 7
• Approved Executive Directors’ share awards under the 
LTIP following the announcement of the Company’s 
results for the year ended 31 March 2016
• Approved the Deferred Bonus Shares vesting in the year 
for Executive Directors
• Assessed the performance of Executive Directors against 
targets set and determined annual bonuses for the year
• Reviewed and approved annual salary increases 
effective from 1 June 201 7 and reviewed against pay 
increases within the wider workplace
• Reviewed and approved the Chairman’s annual fee 
to be ﬁxed at £250,000 per annum until 31 March 2018
• Reviewed its own effectiveness, Terms of Reference, 
constitution and performance
• Reviewed and approved the Remuneration Committee

2014 LTIP awards expected to vest in June 2017 for the performance period to 31 March 2017 . The value of the award has been calculated by 
multiplying the estimated number of shares that will vest, including the dividend equivalent, by the average share price for the three months to 
31 March 2017 . The estimated ﬁgures disclosed in the previous annual report for 2016 vesting has been re-stated to reﬂect ﬁnal vesting ﬁgures and 
the share price on the date of vesting
Annual bonus outcome for the year ended  
31 March 2017
The annual bonus performance targets set for the year to 
31 March 2017 and the assessment of actual performance 
achieved is set out in the tables below. 
Bonus awards are based 70% on the Company’s ﬁnancial 
performance and 30% on the individual’s contribution in 
the year. 
The ﬁnancial performance element measures growth 
in EPRA EPS and Total Property Return relative to the IPD 
Quarterly Universe Index re-weighted to the Company’s 
core portfolio. In determining the base EPRA EPS target, 
the Committee looks to maintain consistency with longer 
term incentive targets but is mindful of shorter term strategic 
priorities and changing market conditions. The 2017 annual 
bonus outcome is set out in the table below.

Performance graph 
The graph shows the Group’s total shareholder return (TSR) 
for the period from 1 October 2010, when the Company 
listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, 
to 31 March 2017 , compared to the FTSE All Share REIT 
Index, the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index and the FTSE 350 Real 
Estate Super Sector index. These have been chosen by the 
Committee as in previous years as they are considered the 
most appropriate and relevant benchmarks against which 
to assess the performance of the Company. 
The starting point required by the remuneration regulations 
was close to the bottom of the property cycle where a 
number of property companies launched rights issues while 
the Company did not. The Company’s share price had not 
fallen as much as the average share price of the FTSE Real 
Estate sector prior to this starting point, thereby setting a 
higher initial base price for this graph. 
Total shareholder return measures share price growth 
with dividends deemed to be reinvested on the ex-
dividend date.
The Company’s total shareholder return over the period 
since merger in 2013 has outperformed all indices as shown 
in the graph below.

107 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Report of the Directors
Martin McGann
Finance Director
The Directors present their report together with the audited ﬁnancial statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2017.
The principal activity of the Group continues to be property investment and 
development, both directly and through joint venture arrangements. 
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (‘ AGM’) of the Company will be held at the 
Connaught, Carlos Place, Mayfair, London W1K 2AL at 10 am on 1 1 July 2017 .
The Notice of Meeting on pages 149 to 153 sets out the proposed resolutions 
and voting details.
The Board considers that the resolutions promote the success of the Company, 
and are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Directors 
unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions as they 
intend to do in respect of their own beneﬁcial holdings, which amount in 
aggregate to 23,864,430 shares representing approximately 3.4% of the existing 
issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 30 May 2017 .

Principal activities and 
business review
The purpose of the Annual Report is to 
provide information to the members of 
the Company which is a fair, balanced 
and understandable assessment of the 
Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy. A detailed review of the 
Group’s business and performance 
during the year, its principal risks 
and uncertainties, its business model 
and strategy and its approach to 
responsible business is contained in the 
Strategic report on pages 1 to 56 and 
should be read as part of this report.
The Annual Report contains certain 
forward looking statements with 
respect to the operations, performance 
and ﬁnancial condition of the Group. 
By their nature, these statements 
involve uncertainty since future events 
and circumstances can cause results 
and developments to differ from those 
anticipated. The forward looking 
statements reﬂect knowledge and 
information available at the date of 
preparation of this Annual Report. 
Nothing in this Annual Report should 
be construed as a proﬁt forecast.
Results and dividends
The Group reported a proﬁt for the 
year of £63.0 million (2016: £82.7 million). 
A second interim dividend for 2016 
of 3.75p per share and the ﬁrst two 
quarterly dividends for 2017 totalling 
3.6p per share were paid in the year, 
of which 6.2p was paid as a Property 
Income Distribution (PID). 
The third quarterly dividend of 1.8p was 
paid following the year end on 18 April 
2017 as a PID. The Directors have 
approved a fourth quarterly dividend 
of 2.1p per share payable on 10 July 
2017 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 9 June 2017 , of 
which 1.3p will be paid as a PID. 
The total dividend charge for the year 
to 31 March 2017 was 7 .5p per share, 
an increase of 0.25p or 3.4% over the 
previous year. 
Of the total dividend for 2017 of 7 .5p, 
6.7p was paid as a PID as required 
by REIT legislation, after deduction of 
withholding tax at the basic rate of 
income tax. The balance of 0.8p was 
paid as an ordinary dividend which is 
not subject to withholding tax.

Investment properties
A valuation of the Group’s investment 
properties at 31 March 2017 was 
undertaken by CBRE Limited and 
Savills Advisory Services Limited on the 
basis of fair value which amounted 
to £1,533.8 million including the 
Group’s share of joint venture property 
as reﬂected in notes 9 and 10 to 
these accounts.
Share capital
As at 31 March 2017 , there were 
692,382,431 ordinary shares of 10p in 
issue, each carrying one vote and 
all fully paid. There is only one class 
of share in issue and there are no 
restrictions on the size of a holding 
or on the transfer of shares. None of 
the shares carry any special rights of 
control over the Company. There were 
no persons with signiﬁcant direct or 
indirect holdings in the Company 
other than those listed as substantial 
shareholders on page 108.
On 27 March 2017 the Company 
issued 62,804,390 new ordinary shares 
at a price of 152p per share, as a 
result of a successful equity placing. 
The Company pre-marketed the 
placing largely to its top shareholders 
ahead of announcing. 
The placing was oversubscribed 
with strong support from existing 
shareholders and several new investors.
A placing is an issue of shares directly 
to certain shareholders. There are 
regulatory restrictions on placings 
designed to protect the rights of 
existing shareholders which the 
Company adhered to.
At the 2016 AGM, shareholders gave 
the Company authority to allot 
shares up to a maximum amount of 
£20,934,797 , representing one third of 
the Company’s issued share capital 
as at 31 May 2016 and to allot shares 
up to a maximum nominal value of 
£6,280,439, representing approximately 
10% of the Company’s issued share 
capital at 31 May 2016 without having 
to ﬁrst offer those shares to existing 
shareholders. The Company used the 
authority given to it at the 2016 AGM 
to issue the shares in connection with 
the placing, which represented a 9.99% 
increase to the issued share capital as 
at 31 May 2016.
The placing raised gross proceeds of 
£95.5 million and the net cash received 
after deducting costs was £92.8 million 
which will be used to fund committed 
acquisitions and the development 
pipeline. The price reﬂected a 1.9% 
discount to the previous day’s share 
price and a 6.3% premium to last 
reported EPRA net asset value.
The fundraising structure of a placing 
allowed the Company to raise funds 
within less than one week, reducing 
equity market risk and giving a high 
certainty of success.
In addition the Company issued 
1,534,136 ordinary shares under the 
terms of its Scrip Dividend Scheme 
in the year. Since the year end the 
Company issued a further 589,633 
ordinary shares in relation to the third 
quarterly dividend scrip alternative.
The rules governing appointments, 
replacement and powers of Directors 
are contained in the Company’s 
Articles of Association, the Companies 
Act 2006 and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. These include 
powers to authorise the issue and 
buy back of shares by the Company. 
The Company’s Articles can be 
amended by Special Resolution in 
accordance with Companies Act 2006.
Purchase of own shares
The Company was granted authority 
at the Annual General Meeting in 
2016 to purchase its own shares up 
to an aggregate nominal value of 
10% of the issued nominal capital. 
That authority expires at this year’s AGM 
and a resolution will be proposed for 
its renewal. No ordinary shares were 
purchased under this authority during 
the year.
Directors
The present membership of the Board 
and biographical details of Directors 
are set out on pages 60 and 61.
The interests of the Directors and their 
families in the shares of the Company 
are set out in the Remuneration 
Committee report on page 82.
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all of the Directors 
will offer themselves for re-election at 
the forthcoming AGM on 1 1 July 2017 .
Directors’ and Officers’

and Officers’ liability insurance cover 
in respect of legal action against 
its Directors, which is reviewed and

at the date of this report.
Employees
At 31 March 2017 the Group had 38 
employees including all Directors. 
The Company encourages employee 
involvement and consultation and 
invests time in ensuring staff are 
informed of the Group’s transactions, 
activities and performance through 
internal email communication of 
corporate announcements and regular 
brieﬁngs and presentations. Its interim 
and annual results presentations are 
delivered to all staff along with other 
relevant employee matters including 
Health and Safety. 
Certain employees are eligible to 
participate in the annual bonus and 
LTIP arrangements, helping to develop 
an interest in the Group’s performance 
and align rewards with Directors’ 
incentive arrangements. 
The Company operates a non-
discriminatory employment policy and 
full and fair consideration is given to 
applications for employment made by 
people with disabilities, having regard 
to their skills and abilities, and to the 
continued employment of staff who 
become disabled.
The Company encourages the 
continuous development and 
training of its staff and the provision 
of equal opportunities for the 
training and career development 
of disabled employees.
The Company provides retirement 
beneﬁts for its employees excluding

Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare ﬁnancial statements for 
each ﬁnancial year. Under that law 
the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
and have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 (FRS101) 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. 
Under Company law the Directors must 
not approve the accounts unless they 
are satisﬁed that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the 
Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company 
ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently
• Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
• State whether applicable Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 (FRS101) 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
has been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁnancial statements
• Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial 
statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• Properly select and apply 
accounting policies
• Present information, including 
accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and 
understandable information
• Provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the speciﬁc 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient 
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on 
the entity’s ﬁnancial position and 
ﬁnancial performance
• Make an assessment of the 
Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial 
position of the Company and to 
enable them to ensure that the 
ﬁnancial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and ﬁnancial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
ﬁnancial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We conﬁrm that to the best of 
our knowledge:
• The ﬁnancial statements, prepared 
in accordance with the relevant 
ﬁnancial reporting framework, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, ﬁnancial position and 
proﬁt or loss of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole
• The Strategic report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face
• The Annual Report and ﬁnancial 
statements, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy

Summary of our audit approach
Key risk The key risk that we identiﬁed in the current year 
was the assessment of the carrying value of the 
investment property portfolio.
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current 
year was £20.1 million based on 2% of equity. 
For testing of balances that impacted EPRA 
earnings, we used a lower materiality of 
£2.6 million based on 5% of that measure.
Scoping The Group is subject to a full scope audit on 100% 
of net assets, revenue and proﬁt before tax. 
Signiﬁcant 
changes in 
our approach
There has been no change to the basis upon 
which materiality is calculated, our identiﬁed risks 
or our approach in scoping the audit from the 
prior year. 
Going concern and the Directors’ assessment 
of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the 
Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the 
going concern basis of accounting contained within note 1 
to the ﬁnancial statements and the Directors’ statement on 
the longer term viability of the Group contained within the 
Strategic report. 
We are required to state whether we have anything material 
to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ conﬁrmation on page 40 that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity
• the disclosures on pages 41 to 47 that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated
• the Directors’ statement in note 1 to the ﬁnancial 
statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identiﬁcation of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do 
so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of the ﬁnancial statements
• the Directors’ explanation on page 41 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period 
to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions
We conﬁrm that we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going 
concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any 
such material uncertainties. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not 
a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and conﬁrm that 
we are independent of the Group and we have fulﬁlled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
those standards.
We conﬁrm that we are independent of the Group and we 
have fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with those standards. We also conﬁrm we have not provided 
any of the prohibited non audit services referred to in 
those standards.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
113 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Valuation of investment property 
Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observations
The Group owns a portfolio of largely retail and 
distribution property assets, which is valued at 
£1,534 million (2016: £1,521 million), including 
share of joint venture properties, as at 31 March 
2017 . The valuation of the portfolio is a signiﬁcant 
judgement area and is underpinned by a number 
of assumptions including (i) capitalisation yields 
(ii) future lease income and (iii) with reference to 
development properties, costs to complete.
The Group uses professionally qualiﬁed external 
valuers to fair value the Group’s portfolio at 
six-monthly intervals. The valuers are engaged 
by the Directors and performed their work 
in accordance with the Royal Institution of 
Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation – Professional 
Standards. The valuers used by the Group have 
considerable experience in the markets in 
which the Group operates.
The valuation exercise also relies on the accuracy 
of the underlying lease and ﬁnancial information 
provided to the valuers by management.
Refer to page 77 (Audit Committee report), 
page 121 (accounting policy) and note 9 on 
pages 129 and 130 (ﬁnancial disclosures).
• We assessed management’s process for reviewing 
and assessing the work of the external valuer and 
development appraisals
• We assessed the competence, objectivity and 
integrity of the external valuer and read their terms 
of engagement with the Group to determine 
whether there were any matters that might have 
affected their objectivity or may have imposed 
scope limitations on their work
• We obtained the external valuation reports and 
met with the external valuers of the portfolio to 
assess the results of their work. We assessed and 
challenged the valuation process, performance 
of the portfolio and signiﬁcant assumptions 
and critical judgement areas, including lease 
incentives, future lease income and yields. 
We benchmarked these assumptions to relevant 
market evidence including speciﬁc property sales 
and other external data
• We tested a sample of properties through 
benchmarking of yields, understanding the 
valuation methodology and wider market analysis
• We performed audit procedures to assess the 
integrity of a sample of the information provided 
to the external valuer by agreeing that information 
to underlying lease agreements 
• We tested a sample of the costs to complete 
in relation to the development properties via 
agreement to supporting documentation
We concluded that 
the assumptions 
applied in arriving 
at the fair value 
of the Group’s 
property portfolio 
by the external 
valuers were 
appropriate.
Property transaction accounting
Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observations
The group has undertaken a large number of 
property acquisitions for a total consideration of 
£151.0 million and disposals for total proceeds of 
£201.9 million (including share of joint ventures). 
These transactions can include complexities such 
as rental top-up payments, conditionality and 
deferred completion arrangements or joint venture 
contractual obligations, requiring judgement as to 
the appropriate accounting to be applied.
Refer to page 78 (Audit Committee report), 
page 121 (accounting policy) and note 9 on 
pages 129 and 130 (ﬁnancial disclosures).
• We assessed the fair value of consideration and 
conﬁrmed key transaction terms by reference 
to acquisition or disposal agreements and other 
external evidence for all signiﬁcant acquisitions 
and disposals in the year
• We considered the date at which the transactions 
completed based on the timing of the transfer of 
risks and rewards of ownership per the acquisition 
or disposal agreements, and considered 
the impact of these transactions on revenue 
recognition
• We considered the adequacy of the disclosure 
of the transactions in the ﬁnancial statements
• We recalculated the proﬁt or loss on disposals 
based on the terms of the transaction.
We concluded 
that all property 
transactions had 
been appropriately 
accounted for.

114 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Revenue recognition
Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observations
Revenue for the Group primarily consists of 
rental income earned on its investment property 
portfolio. Total revenue for the year to 31 March 
2017 was £83 million (2016: £79 million), including 
share of joint ventures. Within revenue, there are 
certain transactions which warrant additional 
audit focus and have an increased inherent risk of 
error due to their non standard nature. Our risk of 
material misstatement focused on the accounting 
for unusual or more complex items including rent 
free periods and capital incentives, requiring an 
understanding of speciﬁc terms and conditions 
which vary between lease contracts.
Refer to page 77 (Audit Committee report), 
page 121 (accounting policy) and note 3 
on page 125 (ﬁnancial disclosures).
As part of our audit of revenue, we focused on 
any unusual and complex adjustments to revenue, 
agreeing the lease incentives for a sample of items 
to the underlying leases, with our sample covering 
both existing and new leases. We recalculated the 
required adjustment to the annual rent in relation 
to these items to determine whether the correct 
amount of revenue had been recognised in 
the year.
We concluded 
that revenue was 
appropriately 
accounted for.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We deﬁne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in 
the ﬁnancial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person 
would be changed or inﬂuenced. We use materiality both in 
planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the 
results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the ﬁnancial statements as a whole as follows:
Group 
materiality
We determined materiality for the Group to be 
£20.1 million (2016: £17 .9 million). We consider 
EPRA Earnings as a critical performance 
measure for the Group and we applied a 
lower threshold of £2.6 million (2016: £2.4 
million) for testing of all balances and classes 
of transaction which impact that measure, 
primarily transactions recorded in the income 
statement other than fair value movements on 
investment property, development property 
and derivatives.
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
Materiality for the Group is based on 2% (2016: 
2%) of shareholders’ equity. For EPRA Earnings 
the basis used is 5% (2016: 5%) of that measure. 
Rationale for 
the benchmark 
applied
As an investment property company, the main 
focus of management is to generate long term 
capital value from the investment property 
portfolio and, therefore, we consider equity to 
be the most appropriate basis for materiality. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would 
report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 
£1.0 million (2016: £0.4 million), as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identiﬁed when assessing 
the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an 
understanding of the Group and its environment, including 
Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on that assessment, and consistent with our 
conclusion on scoping in the prior year, our full scope audit 
is performed on 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s net assets, 
and 100% (2016: 100%) of revenue and proﬁt before tax. 
The Group is audited by one audit team, led by the Senior 
Statutory Auditor, responsible for the audit of the Company 
and each of its subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our audit work 
on subsidiaries and joint ventures is carried out to a materiality 
which is lower than, and in most cases substantially lower than, 
Group materiality as set out above. Our audit also included 
testing of the consolidation process and Group-wide controls.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
• the part of the Directors’ Report on Remuneration to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 
• the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Report of the Directors for the ﬁnancial year for which 
the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the ﬁnancial statements
• the Strategic report and the Report of the Directors 
have been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the 
Company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identiﬁed any material misstatements 
in the Strategic report and the Report of the Directors.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
115 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and 
accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us
• the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to 
report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the part of the 
Directors’ Report on Remuneration to be audited is not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review 
part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with certain provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), 
we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information 
in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
ﬁnancial statements
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our audit
• otherwise misleading
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identiﬁed any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement 
that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced 
and understandable and whether the Annual Report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we 
communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed.
We conﬁrm that we have not identiﬁed any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). 
Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our 
quality control procedures are effective, understood and 
applied. Our quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial 
statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and 
non ﬁnancial information in the Annual Report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

For the year ended 31 March 2017
1 Signiﬁcant accounting policies
a) General information
LondonMetric Property Plc is a company incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of 
the registered office is given on page 154. The principal 
activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) 
and the nature of the Group’s operations are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 56.
b) Statement of compliance
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union.
c) Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on a going concern 
basis, as explained in the Report of the Directors on 
page 1 10.
The functional and presentational currency of the Group 
is sterling. The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on 
the historical cost basis except that investment and 
development properties and derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments are stated at fair value.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently 
in all material respects. 
i) Signiﬁcant judgements and key estimates
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and other factors that are considered 
to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects 
only that period. If the revision affects both current and 
future periods, the change is recognised over those periods.
The accounting policies subject to signiﬁcant judgements 
and estimates are as follows:
Property valuations
The valuation of the property portfolio is a critical part of 
the Group’s performance. The Group carries the property 
portfolio at fair value in the balance sheet and engages 
professionally qualiﬁed external valuers to undertake 
six-monthly valuations.
The determination of the fair value of each property 
requires, to the extent applicable, the use of estimates 
and assumptions in relation to factors such as future lease 
income, lease incentives, current market rental yields, future 
development costs and the appropriate discount rate. 
In addition, to the extent possible, the valuers make 
reference to market evidence of transaction prices for 
similar properties. 
The fair value of a development property is determined 
by using the ‘residual method’, which deducts all estimated 
costs necessary to complete the development, together 
with an allowance for development risk, proﬁt and 
purchasers’ costs, from the fair valuation of the 
completed property.
Signiﬁcant transactions
Some property transactions are complex and require 
management to assess whether the acquisition of property 
through a corporate vehicle represents an asset acquisition 
or a business combination under IFRS 3.
Where there are signiﬁcant other assets and liabilities 
acquired in addition to property, the transaction 
is accounted for as a business combination. Where 
there are not it is accounted for as an asset purchase.
Other complexities include conditionality inherent in 
transactions and deferred property completions.
Revenue recognition
Certain transactions require management to make 
judgements as to whether, and to what extent, revenue 
should be recognised and the appropriate cut off for 
property transactions. Management consider whether the 
signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of assets have 
been transferred between buyer and seller and the point 
at which developments reach practical completion.
Other complexities include accounting for rent free periods 
and capital incentive payments.
Presentation of information
The Group operates through a number of joint venture 
operations which are accounted for under the equity 
method as described in Section d(ii) of this note. 
As management monitor the business on a proportionately 
consolidated basis, the information presented in the 
Strategic report is consistent with this approach.
In addition, EPRA performance measures are presented as 
Key Performance Indicators and in the Strategic report in 
line with other public real estate companies to highlight 
the recurring performance of the Group. There is a 
reconciliation between IFRS reported proﬁt and net assets 
and the equivalent EPRA measures in note 8 to these 
ﬁnancial statements.
REIT status
The Group must comply with the UK REIT regulation to 
beneﬁt from the favourable tax regime.

ii) Adoption of new and revised standards
Standards and interpretations effective in the current period
During the year, the following new and revised Standards 
and Interpretations have been adopted and have not  
had a material impact on the amounts reported in these 
ﬁnancial statements:

Standards and interpretations in issue not yet adopted
The IASB and the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee have issued the following 
standards and interpretations that are mandatory for 
later accounting periods and which have not been 
adopted early:
Name Description
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 2 (amendments) Classiﬁcation and Measurement of 
Share Based Payment Transactions
IAS 40 (amendments) Transfers of Investment Property
IAS 7 (amendments) Disclosure Initiative
IAS 12 (amendments) Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets 
for Unrealised Losses
Annual Improvements  
to IFRSs: 2014 – 2016 cycle Amendments to IFRS 12
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the 
Standards listed above will have a material impact on 
the ﬁnancial statements of the Group in future periods, 
except that IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and 
disclosures of ﬁnancial instruments, IFRS 15 may have an 
impact on the timing of revenue recognition and related 
disclosures, and IFRS 16 will impact the accounting for those 
leases currently classiﬁed as operating leases. Beyond the 
information above, it is not practicable to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and  
IFRS 16 until a detailed review has been completed. 
d) Basis of consolidation
i) Subsidiaries
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include 
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. 
Control is assumed when the Group:
• Has the power over the investee
• Is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from 
its involvement with the investee
• Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns
In the consolidated balance sheet, the acquiree’s 
identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are 
initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements from the date that control commences 
until the date that control ceases.
Where properties are acquired through corporate 
acquisitions and there are no signiﬁcant assets or liabilities 
other than property, the acquisition is treated as an asset 
acquisition, in other cases the purchase method is used.
ii) Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the 
Group has joint control. Associates are those entities over 
whose activities the Group is in a position to exercise 
signiﬁcant inﬂuence but does not have the power to 
jointly control.
Joint ventures and associates are accounted for under 
the equity method, whereby the consolidated balance 
sheet incorporates the Group’s share of the net assets of its 
joint ventures and associates. The consolidated income 
statement incorporates the Group’s share of joint venture 
and associate proﬁts after tax.
The Group’s joint ventures and associates adopt the 
accounting policies of the Group for inclusion in the  
Group ﬁnancial statements.
e) Property portfolio
i) Investment properties
Investment properties are properties owned or leased by 
the Group which are held for long term rental income and 
for capital appreciation. Investment property includes 
property that is being constructed, developed or 
redeveloped for future use as an investment property. 
Investment property is initially recognised at cost, including 
related transaction costs. It is subsequently carried at each 
published balance sheet date at fair value on an open 
market basis as determined by professionally qualiﬁed 
independent external valuers. Changes in fair value are 
included in the income statement. Where a property held 
for investment is appropriated to development property, it 
is transferred at fair value. A property ceases to be treated 
as a development property on practical completion.
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Properties, no 
depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties.
122 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes forming part of the Group ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 March 201 7 continued 1 Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Investment property is recognised as an asset when:
• It is probable that the future economic beneﬁts that 
are associated with the investment property will ﬂow 
to the Group
• There are no material conditions precedent which could 
prevent completion
• The cost of the investment property can be 
measured reliably
All costs directly associated with the purchase and 
construction of a development property are capitalised. 
Capital expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
redevelopment or refurbishment of investment property, 
up to the point of it being completed for its intended use, 
is included in the carrying value of the property.
ii) Assets held for sale
An asset is classiﬁed as held for sale if its carrying amount is 
expected to be recovered through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use. This condition is regarded 
as met only when the sale is highly probable, the asset is 
available for sale in its present condition and management 
expect the sale to complete within one year from the 
balance sheet date. 
iii) Tenant leases
Management has exercised judgement in considering the 
potential transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership in 
accordance with IAS 17 for all properties leased to tenants 
and has determined that such leases are operating leases.
iv) Net rental income
Rental income from investment property leased out under 
an operating lease is recognised in the proﬁt or loss on a 
straight line basis over the lease term.
Contingent rents, such as turnover rents, rent reviews and 
indexation, are recorded as income in the periods in which 
they are earned. Rent reviews are recognised when such 
reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Where a rent free period is included in a lease, the rental 
income foregone is allocated evenly over the period from 
the date of lease commencement to the earlier of the ﬁrst 
break option or the lease termination date. Lease incentives 
and costs associated with entering into tenant leases 
are amortised over the period from the date of lease 
commencement to the earlier of the ﬁrst break option 
or the lease termination date.
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and 
any property operating expenditure not recovered from 
tenants through service charges is charged to proﬁt or loss.
v) Proﬁt and loss on sale of investment properties
Proﬁts and losses on sales of investment properties are 
calculated by reference to the carrying value at the 
previous year end valuation date, adjusted for subsequent 
capital expenditure.
f) Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised in 
the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to 
the contractual terms of the instrument. Unless otherwise 
indicated, the carrying amounts of the ﬁnancial assets and 
liabilities are a reasonable approximation of the fair values.
i) Trade and other receivables and payables
Trade and other receivables and payables are initially 
measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. An impairment provision 
is created where there is objective evidence to suggest that 
the Group will not be able to collect receivables in full.
ii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits 
held at call with banks and other short term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less.
iii) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, borrowings 
are stated at amortised cost with any difference being 
recognised in the income statement over the term of 
the borrowing.
iv) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge its 
exposure to interest rate risks. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
are recognised initially at fair value, which equates to cost 
and subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes 
in fair value being included in the income statement.
g) Finance costs and income
Net ﬁnance costs include interest payable on borrowings, 
net of interest capitalised and ﬁnance costs amortised.
Interest is capitalised if it is directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or redevelopment of development 
properties from the start of the development work until 
practical completion of the property. Capitalised interest is 
calculated with reference to the actual interest rate payable 
on speciﬁc borrowings for the purposes of development 
or, for that part of the borrowings ﬁnanced out of general 
funds, with reference to the Group’s weighted average 
cost of borrowings.
Finance income includes interest receivable on funds 
invested at the effective rate and notional interest 
receivable on forward funded developments at the 
contractual rate.
h) Tax
Tax is included in proﬁt or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case 
the related tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable 
income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any 
adjustment in respect of previous years.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
123 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1 Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and their tax bases. The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner or realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.
i) Share based payments
The fair value of equity-settled share based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed 
on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
j) Shares held in Trust
The cost of the Company’s shares held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trust is deducted from equity in the Group balance sheet. 
Any shares held by the Trust are not included in the calculation of earnings or net assets per share.
k) Dividends
Dividends on equity shares are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends, this is when 
paid. In the case of ﬁnal dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

For the year ended 31 March 201 7 continued 2 Segmental information (continued)
An operating segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that engages in business activities, earns revenue and 
incurs expenses, whose results are reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision makers and for which discrete ﬁnancial 
information is available. Gross rental income represents the Group’s revenues from its tenants and net rental income is the 
principal proﬁt measure used to determine the performance of each sector. Total assets are not monitored by segment. 
However, property assets are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The Group operates almost entirely in the UK and no 
geographical split is provided in information reported to the Board.

The emoluments and pension beneﬁts of the Directors are set out in detail within the Remuneration Committee report on 
page 101.
The long term share incentive plan (‘LTIP’) that was created following the merger in 2013 allows Executive Directors and 
eligible employees to receive an award of shares, held in trust, dependent on performance conditions based on the 
earnings per share, total shareholder return and total accounting return of the Group over a three year vesting period. 
The Group expenses the estimated number of shares likely to vest over the three year period based on the market price 
at the date of grant. In the current year the charge was £1.8 million (2016: £1.6 million).
The Company awarded 2,196,467 LTIP shares during the year, 1,708,370 of which were awarded to Executive Directors 
as shown in the Remuneration Committee report on page 103. The cost of acquiring the shares expected to vest under 
the LTIP of £5.2 million has been charged to reserves.
Employee costs of £1.8 million (2016: £1.5 million) have been capitalised in respect of time spent on development projects.

of retained earnings in the year to 31 March 2018.
During the year the Company issued 1,534,136 ordinary shares in relation to the ﬁrst two quarterly dividends which reduced 
the cash dividend payment by £2.2 million to £43.7 million.
8 Earnings and net assets per share
Adjusted earnings and net assets per share are calculated in accordance with the Best Practice Recommendations 
of The European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA). The EPRA earnings measure highlights the underlying recurring 
performance of the property rental business.
The earnings per share calculation uses the weighted average number of ordinary shares during the year and excludes 
the average number of shares held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trust for the year.
The net asset per share calculation uses the number of shares in issue at the year end and excludes the actual number 
of shares held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trust at the year end.

Investment properties are held at fair value as at 31 March 2017 based on external valuations performed by professionally 
qualiﬁed valuers CBRE Limited (‘CBRE’) and Savills Advisory Services Limited (‘Savills’). The valuation of property held for sale 
at 31 March 2017 was £40.9 million (2016: £62.8 million).
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional Standards 2014 on the basis of fair 
value as set out in note 1. There has been no change in the valuation technique in the year. The total fees earned by CBRE 
and Savills from the Company represent less than 5% of their total UK revenues. CBRE and Savills have continuously been the 
signatory of valuations for the Company since October 2007 and September 2010 respectively.
Long term leasehold values included within investment properties amount to £102.0 million (2016: £93.9 million). All other 
properties are freehold.
Included within the investment property valuation is £65.3 million (2016: £52.5 million) in respect of unamortised lease 
incentives and rent free periods. 
The historical cost of all of the Group’s investment properties at 31 March 2017 was £1,135.5 million (2016: £1,127 .9 million).
Capital commitments have been entered into amounting to £57 .8 million (2016: £85.5 million) which have not been provided 
for in the ﬁnancial statements.
Internal staff costs of the development team of £1.8 million (2016: £1.5 million) have been capitalised, being directly 
attributable to the development projects in progress.
Forward funded development costs of £52.7 million have been classiﬁed within investment property under  
development as acquisitions.

i) Technique
The valuation techniques described below are consistent with IFRS 13 and use signiﬁcant ‘unobservable’ inputs. There have 
been no changes in valuation techniques since the prior year. 
Yield capitalisation – for commercial investment properties, market rental values are capitalised with a market capitalisation 
rate. The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the net initial yields and the fair market values per square foot 
derived from recent market transactions.
Residual – for certain investment properties under development, the fair value of the property is calculated by estimating 
the fair value of the completed property using the yield capitalisation technique less estimated costs to completion and a 
risk premium.
Comparison – for residential properties the fair value is calculated by using data from recent market transactions.
ii) Sensitivity
An increase or decrease in ERV will increase or decrease the fair value of the Group’s investment properties.
An increase or decrease to the net initial yields and reversionary yields will decrease or increase the fair value of the 
Group’s investment properties.
An increase or decrease in the estimated costs of development will decrease or increase the fair value of the Group’s 
investment properties under development.
There are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs as they are determined by market conditions; an increase 
in more than one input could magnify or mitigate the impact on the valuation.
iii) Process
The valuation reports produced by CBRE and Savills are based on:
• Information provided by the Group, such as current rents, lease terms, capital expenditure and comparable sales 
information, which is derived from the Group’s ﬁnancial and property management systems and is subject to the 
Group’s overall control environment
• Assumptions applied by the valuers such as ERVs and yields which are based on market observation and their 
professional judgement
CBRE and Savills meet the Auditors and the Audit Committee semi-annually.
10 Investment in joint ventures
At 31 March 2017 , the following principal property interests, being jointly-controlled entities, have been equity accounted for 
in these ﬁnancial statements:
Country of incorporation  
or registration Property sector Group share
Metric Income Plus Partnership England and Wales Retail 50.0%
LMP Retail Warehouse JV PUT Guernsey Retail 30.5%
LSP London Residential Investments Ltd Guernsey Residential 40.0%
The principal activity of all joint venture interests is property investment in the UK in the sectors noted in the table above, 
which complements the Group’s operations and contributes to the achievement of its strategy.
The Metric Income Plus Partnership (‘MIPP’), in which the Company has a 50% interest, acquired two assets in the year for 
£18.4 million (Group share: £9.2 million) and disposed of three assets for gross proceeds of £15.9 million (Group share: 
£8.0 million). 
The LMP Retail Warehouse joint venture disposed of one asset in Maidstone for £12.0 million (Group share: £3.7 million).
The Group also disposed of 21 residential ﬂats for £27 .0 million (Group share: £10.8 million) through its 40% interest in LSP London 
Residential Investments Limited in the year. The associated bank loan was repaid in full in the year.
At 31 March 2017 , the freehold and leasehold investment properties were externally valued by Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors (‘RICS’) Registered Valuers of CBRE Limited and Savills Advisory Services Limited. 
The valuation of property held for sale by joint ventures at 31 March 2017 was £1.6 million (Group share: £0.7 million),

On 21 September 2016 the Group entered into a £130 million private placement at a blended ﬁxed coupon of 2.7% and 
a weighted average maturity of 8.3 years. The proceeds were used to repay debt drawn under the existing unsecured 
credit facility.
Certain bank loans at 31 March 2017 are secured by ﬁxed charges over Group investment properties with a carrying value 
of £388.6 million. 
b) Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. The Group’s ﬁnancial risk management objectives are to 
minimise the effect of risks it is exposed to through its operations and the use of debt ﬁnancing. 
The principal ﬁnancial risks to the Group and the policies it has in place to manage these risks are summarised below:
i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations.
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial assets are cash balances and deposits and trade and other receivables. The Group’s credit 
risk is primarily attributable to its cash deposits and trade receivables. 
The Group mitigates ﬁnancial loss from tenant defaults by dealing with only creditworthy tenants. The trade receivable 
amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is 
made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original 
terms of the receivables concerned. The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and therefore the credit 
risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Cash is placed on deposit with a diverse mix of institutions with suitable credit ratings and rates of return and for varying 
periods of time. The credit ratings of the banks are monitored and changes are made where necessary to manage risk.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative ﬁnancial instruments is limited due to the Group’s policy of monitoring 
counterparty exposures with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. The Group has 
no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties.

133 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 Borrowings and ﬁnancial instruments (continued)
ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the ﬁnance charges and principal repayments 
on its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and short term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the 
Group has sufficient available funds for operations and committed investments. The Group’s funding sources are diversiﬁed 
across a range of banks and institutions. Weekly cash ﬂow forecasts are prepared for the Executive Committee to ensure 
sufficient resources of cash and undrawn borrowing facilities are in place to meet liabilities as they fall due. 
The Group had cash reserves of £42.9 million (2016: £42.6 million) and available and undrawn bank loan facilities at  
31 March 2017 of £296.8 million (2016: £64.9 million). 
The following table shows the contractual maturity proﬁle of the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities on an undiscounted cash ﬂow 
basis and assuming settlement on the earliest repayment date.

iii) Market risk – interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from the use of debt ﬁnancing at a variable rate. It is the risk that future cash ﬂows 
of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in interest rates. It is Group policy that a reasonable portion of 
external borrowings are at a ﬁxed interest rate in order to manage this risk.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage its interest rate exposure and hedge future interest rate risk for the 
term of the bank loan. Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk of paying 
rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully the cash ﬂow risk associated with interest payments, it considers that 
it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
At 31 March 2017 , 87% of the Group’s exposure (including share of joint ventures) to interest rate ﬂuctuations was hedged by 
way of current and forward starting swaps and caps assuming existing debt facilities are fully drawn (2016: 84%).
The average interest rate payable by the Group (including share of joint ventures) on all bank borrowings at 31 March 2017 
including the cost of amortising ﬁnance arrangement fees, was 3.5% (2016: 3.5%). A 1% change in interest rates would 
decrease or increase the Group’s annual proﬁt before tax by less than £0.1 million.
iv) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when maintaining capital are to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern so that 
it can provide returns to shareholders and as such it seeks to maintain an appropriate mix of debt and equity. The capital 
structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes long term borrowings and undrawn debt facilities, and equity 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. The Group balances its overall capital structure through the 
payment of dividends, new share issues as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.

All derivative ﬁnancial instruments are non current interest rate derivatives, and are carried at fair value following a valuation 
as at 31 March 2017 by J C Rathbone Associates Limited.
The market values of hedging products change with interest rate ﬂuctuations, but the exposure of the Group to movements 
in interest rates is protected by way of the hedging products listed above. In accordance with accounting standards, 
fair value is estimated by calculating the present value of future cash ﬂows, using appropriate market discount rates. 
For all derivative ﬁnancial instruments this equates to a Level 2 fair value measurement as deﬁned by IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurement. The valuation therefore does not reﬂect the cost or gain to the Group of cancelling its interest rate protection 
at the balance sheet date, which is generally a marginally higher cost (or smaller gain) than a market valuation.

Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Company is exposed to market risk through interest rate ﬂuctuations. It is the Company’s policy that a signiﬁcant portion 
of external bank borrowings are at either ﬁxed or capped rates of interest in order to manage this risk. 
The Company uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage its interest rate exposure and hedge future interest rate risk for 
the term of the bank loan. Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Company entirely from the risk 
of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully the cash ﬂow risk associated with interest payments, 
it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
The market values of hedging products change with interest rate ﬂuctuations, but the exposure of the Company to 
movements in interest rates is protected by way of the hedging products listed below. In accordance with accounting 
standards, fair value is estimated by calculating the present value of future cash ﬂows, using appropriate market discount 
rates. For all derivative ﬁnancial instruments this equates to a Level 2 fair value measurement as deﬁned by IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurement. The valuation therefore does not reﬂect the cost or gain to the Company of cancelling its interest rate 
protection at the balance sheet date, which is generally a marginally higher cost (or smaller gain) than a market valuation.
Details of the fair value of the Company’s derivative ﬁnancial instruments that were in place are provided below.

Notes to the Notice of the Annual General Meeting:
(i)  Shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting 
may appoint one or more proxies (who need not be 
shareholders) to attend, speak and vote on their behalf, 
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the 
rights attaching to the different shares held by him or her. 
(ii)  Your proxy could be the Chairman, another Director of the 
Company or another person who has agreed to attend to 
represent you. Your proxy will vote as you instruct and must 
attend the meeting for your vote to be counted. Details of 
how to appoint the Chairman or another person as your 
proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the 
proxy form.
(iii)  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person 
nominated under Section 146 of the 2006 Act to enjoy 
information rights (a ‘Nominated Person’) may, under 
an agreement between him/her and the shareholder 
by whom he/she was nominated, have a right to be 
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a 
proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated 
Person has no such proxy appointment right, or does not 
wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, 
have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to 
the exercise of voting rights. The statement of rights of 
shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in 
paragraph (i) above does not apply to Nominated Persons. 
The rights described in that paragraph can only be 
exercised by shareholders of the Company. 
(iv)  To have the right to attend and vote at the meeting you 
must hold ordinary shares in the Company and your name 
must be entered on the share register of the Company in 
accordance with note (vi) below.
(v)  To be valid, Forms of Proxy (and the power of attorney or 
other authority, if any, under which it is signed or a notarially 
certiﬁed copy thereof) must be completed and signed 
and received by Capita Asset Services at PXS1, The Registry, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4ZF as soon 
as possible but, in any event, so as to arrive no later than 
10 am on 7 July 2017 . A Form of Proxy accompanies this 
notice. Completion and return of a Form of Proxy will 
not preclude members from attending and voting at 
the meeting should they wish to do so. Where you have 
appointed a proxy using the hard copy proxy form and 
would like to change the instructions using another hard 
copy proxy form, please contact Capita Asset Services at 
PXS1, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent 
BR3 4ZF. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments 
(see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions. 
Any attempt to terminate or amend a proxy appointment 
received after the relevant deadline will be disregarded. 
Where two or more valid separate appointments of proxy 
are received in respect of the same share in respect of the 
same meeting, the one which is last sent shall be treated 
as replacing and revoking the other or others.
(vi)  The time by which a person must be entered on the register 
of members in order to have the right to attend or vote 
at the meeting is close of business on 7 July 2017 . If the 
meeting is adjourned, the time by which a person must be 
entered on the register of members in order to have the 
right to attend or vote at the adjourned meeting is close 
of business on the day that is two days before the date 
ﬁxed for the adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the 
register of members after such times shall be disregarded 
in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote 
at the meeting.
(vii)  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by 
utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so by utilising the procedures described in the 
CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST 
sponsored members, and those CREST members who have 
appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be 
able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
(viii)  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made 
by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST 
message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & 
Ireland’s speciﬁcations and must contain the information 
required for such instructions, as described in the CREST 
Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes 
the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the 
instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, 
in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received 
by the issuer’s agent (ID number RA10) by 10 am on 7 July 
2017 . For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be 
the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the 
message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the 
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to 
CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.
(ix)  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy 
Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation  
35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001.
(x)  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service providers should note that 
Euroclear UK & Ireland does not make available special 
procedures in CREST for any particular messages. 
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply 
in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take 
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or 
sponsored member or has appointed a voting service 
provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be 
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by 
means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this 
connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their 
CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system 
and timings.
(xi)  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or 
more corporate representatives who may exercise on its 
behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do 
not do so in relation to the same shares.
(xii)  You may not use any electronic address provided either 
in this Notice of Annual General Meeting or any related 
documents (including the form of proxy) to communicate

Explanatory notes:
The information below is an explanation of the business to be 
considered at the Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 1 – To receive the Annual Report and Audited 
Financial Statements
The Chairman will present the Annual Report and Audited 
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 to the 
meeting. Resolution 1 is to consider and approve the Report of 
the Directors, the ﬁnancial statements and the Auditor’s report 
on the ﬁnancial statements and on the auditable part of the 
Annual Report on Remuneration for the ﬁnancial year ended 
31 March 2017 .
Resolution 2 – Remuneration Policy
Resolution 2 is an ordinary resolution to approve the new 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (which will replace the 
Company’s existing Remuneration Policy). Shareholders are 
invited to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy which is 
set out on pages 88 to 99 of the Annual Report. The policy, which 
sets out the Company’s forward looking policy on Directors’ 
remuneration, is subject to a binding shareholder vote by 
ordinary resolution at least every three years.
Once the Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been approved, 
all payments by the Company to the Directors and any 
former Directors must be made in accordance with the 
policy (unless a payment has separately been approved 
by shareholder resolution). 
If the Company wishes to change the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, it will need to put the revised policy to a shareholder 
vote again before it can implement any payments pursuant 
to the amended policy. If the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
remains unchanged, the 2006 Act requires the Company to 
put the policy to shareholders for approval again no later than 
1 1 July 2020. 
Resolution 3 – Annual Report on Remuneration
Resolution 3 is an ordinary resolution to approve the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on the implementation of the 
Remuneration Policy. Section 439 of the 2006 Act requires UK-
incorporated listed companies to put their Annual Report on 
Remuneration to an advisory shareholder vote. As the vote is 
advisory it does not affect the actual remuneration paid to any 
individual Director. The Annual Report on Remuneration is set out 
in full in the Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
Resolutions 4 and 5 – Reappointment of auditors
Resolution 4 relates to the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the 
Company’s auditor to hold office until the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company and Resolution 5 authorises the 
Directors to set their remuneration. 
Resolutions 6 to 16 – Re-election and election of Directors
Resolutions 6 to 16 deal with re-election of the Directors. 
Biographies of each of the Directors seeking re-election can be 
found on pages 60 and 61 of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Board has conﬁrmed, following a performance review, 
that all Directors standing for re-election continue to perform 
effectively and demonstrate commitment to their role. 
Resolution 17 – Allotment of share capital
At the last Annual General Meeting of the Company the 
Directors were given authority to allot ordinary shares in the 
capital of the Company. This authority expires at the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting (or, if earlier, on the date which is 
15 months after the date of the Annual General Meeting). 
Your Board considers it appropriate that a similar authority 
be granted to allot ordinary shares in the capital of the 
Company up to a maximum nominal amount of £23,099,069 
(representing approximately one third of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital as at 30 May 2017) during the period 
up to the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of 
the Company. Such authority is sought in paragraph 17a of 
Resolution 17 . 
In accordance with the guidelines issued by the Investment 
Association, paragraph 17b of Resolution 17 will allow Directors 
to allot, including the shares referred to in paragraph 17a of 
Resolution 17 , shares in the Company in connection with a 
pre-emptive offer by way of a rights issue to shareholders up 
to a maximum nominal amount of £46,198,137 , representing 
approximately two thirds of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company as at 30 May 2017 .
152 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notice of Annual General Meeting continued Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Your Board considers it appropriate to seek this additional 
allotment authority at the Annual General Meeting in order 
to take advantage of the ﬂexibility it offers. However, the 
Board has no present intention of exercising either authority. 
If they do exercise the authority, the Directors intend to follow 
best practice as regards its use, as recommended by the 
Investment Association.
As at the date of this Notice the Company does not hold any 
ordinary shares in the capital of the Company in treasury.
Resolutions 18 and 19 – General and additional authority to 
disapply pre-emption rights
At the last Annual General Meeting of the Company the 
Directors were also given authority to allot equity securities for 
cash without ﬁrst being required to offer such shares to existing 
shareholders. This authority expires at the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting (or, if earlier, on the date which is 
15 months after the date of the Annual General Meeting).
The passing of Resolutions 18 and 19 would allow the Directors 
to allot equity securities (or sell any shares which the Company 
may purchase and hold in treasury) without ﬁrst offering them to 
existing holders in proportion to their existing holdings.
The authority set out in Resolution 18 is limited to: (a) allotments or 
sales in connection with pre-emptive offers and offers to holders 
of other equity securities if required by the rights of those shares; 
or (b) otherwise than in connection with a pre-emptive offer, up 
to an aggregate nominal amount of £3,464,860 (representing 
34,648,600 shares). This aggregate nominal amount represents 
5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 
30 May 2017 . 
Taking into account the template resolutions published by 
the UK Pre-Emption Group in May 2016, the authority set 
out in Resolution 19 is limited to allotments or sales of up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £3,464,860 (representing 
34,648,600 shares) in addition to the authority set out in 
Resolution 18 which are used only for the purposes of ﬁnancing 
(or reﬁnancing, if the authority is to be used within six months 
after the original transaction) a transaction which the Directors 
determine to be an acquisition or other capital investment 
of a kind contemplated by the Statement of Principles on 
dis-applying pre-emption rights most recently published by 
the UK Pre-Emption Group prior to the date of this Notice. 
This aggregate nominal amount represents an additional 5% 
of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 
30 May 2017 . 
The Directors also conﬁrm their intention to follow the provisions 
of the UK Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles regarding 
cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling three year 
period where the Principles provide that usage in excess of 7 .5% 
of issued ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding 
treasury shares) should not take place without prior consultation 
with shareholders, except in connection with an acquisition or 
speciﬁed capital investment as referred to above.
Resolution 20 – Authority to purchase own shares
Resolution 20 gives the Company authority to buy back its 
own ordinary shares in the market as permitted by the 2006 
Act. The authority limits the number of shares that could 
be purchased to a maximum of 69,297 ,206 (representing 
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital as at 30 May 2017) and sets minimum and maximum 
prices. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising the 
authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares but will 
keep the matter under review, taking into account the ﬁnancial 
resources of the Company, the Company’s share price and 
future funding opportunities. The authority will be exercised only 
after consideration by the Directors of the effect on net asset 
value and if the Directors believe that to do so would be in the 
interests of shareholders generally. Any purchases of ordinary 
shares would be by means of market purchases through the 
London Stock Exchange.
Listed companies purchasing their own shares are allowed 
to hold them in treasury as an alternative to cancelling them. 
No dividends are paid on shares whilst held in treasury and no 
voting rights attach to treasury shares.
If Resolution 20 is passed at the Annual General Meeting, 
it is the Company’s current intention to hold in treasury the 
majority of the shares it may purchase pursuant to the authority 
granted to it. However, in order to respond properly to the 
Company’s capital requirements and prevailing market 
conditions, the Directors will need to reassess at the time of 
any and each actual purchase whether to hold the shares 
in treasury or cancel them, provided it is permitted to do so. 
The Company may hold a maximum of up to 10% of its issued 
share capital in treasury in accordance with guidelines issued by 
the Investment Association.
As at 30 May 2017 (the latest practicable date before 
publication of this Notice), there were share awards over 
6,889,357 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company 
representing 0.99% of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital. If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary 
shares was exercised in full, these awards would represent 0.99% 
of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital.
Resolution 21 – Notice period for general meetings
It is proposed in Resolution 21 that shareholders should 
approve the continued ability of the Company to hold general 
meetings other than the Annual General Meeting on 14 clear 
days’ notice. 
This resolution is required under Section 307A of the 2006 Act. 
Under that section, a traded company which wishes to be 
able to call general meetings (other than an Annual General 
Meeting) on 14 clear days’ notice must obtain shareholders’ 
approval. Resolution 20 seeks such approval.
The resolution is valid up to the next Annual General Meeting 
of the Company and needs to be renewed annually. 
The Company will also need to meet the requirements for voting 
by electronic means under Section 307A of the 2006 Act before 
it can call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice.
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of 
routine for general meetings, but only where the ﬂexibility is 
merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be to 
the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
