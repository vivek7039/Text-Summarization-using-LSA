Mirriad Advertising plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Chairman’s statement
Roger Conant Faxon, Non-executive Chairman
number of employees increased from 74 to 91 as we continued to 
expand the Group’s technology group and started to build out our 
marketing and product teams.
We now have staff in place to serve our partners in China (Shanghai), 
Brazil (São Paulo), India (Mumbai), the United States (New York) 
and Europe (London). To build efficiency each of these offices is 
linked to provide support to each other guided by the centre 
in London. 
I would like to express the gratitude of the Board to all our staff, 
both longer serving and more recently joined, who have contributed 
to the development of the business. I have been impressed with 
their dedication and hard work while we have been putting in 
place the conditions for future growth. The demands on the team 
are unlikely to lessen as we target growth in our key markets. 
Retention and recruitment will be key to the Group’s future success. 
The Board is confident that the Company will be able to recruit 
the staff that will be needed to meet future challenges. 
Focus
The Group is putting the foundations in place now to enable 
meaningful revenue growth in the future. This requires relentless 
focus and a need to remain on strategy. Developing large enterprise 
clients takes time and patience and requires the Group to remain 
flexible in how it serves their needs while continuing to assure 
the effectiveness of our business model. 
The Board is confident that the Group can scale revenues 
by ensuring that its key customers are provided with the 
transactional tools and training needed to facilitate in‑video 
advertising. This is why the Group has spent considerable time 
and resource in developing a transactional tool which we call 
Marketplace. With relatively low levels of capital expenditure, 
the development of Marketplace and the potential to demonstrate 
the impact of in‑video advertising to broadcasters and digital 
distributors, we are confident in the Group’s ability to drive 
significant growth in the coming year and beyond. 
The Company’s first public AGM will be held on 13 June 2018.

Delivering a new advertising solution at 
 GLOBAL 
SCALE
is our purpose
I am delighted to present the first Annual Report 
and Accounts for Mirriad Advertising plc following 
the Company’s successful admission to AIM on 
19 December 2017. 
Key events 
As a result of the IPO, the Company raised net proceeds of 
£23.7 million. The fundraise has empowered the Company to 
expand the Group’s activities in its five target markets – China, 
India, the US, Brazil and Germany – the world’s largest and fastest 
growing advertising markets. 
The funds raised in the IPO allow the Group to enter 2018 
well capitalised, with a strong balance sheet enabling the Group 
to credibly demonstrate longevity to its customers, who are 
principally large digital distributors and broadcasters. The Group 
has made significant progress over the last few months since 
the IPO in rolling out its platform and technology with these 
customers which we believe will pave the way for revenue 
growth later in 2018 and beyond.
In the last quarter of 2017 the Group delivered its single biggest 
campaign. On behalf of Tangeche, a major China‑based car 
leasing firm, Mirriad embedded brand images and messages in 
over 200 episodes of video content over a five month period. 
This campaign both from its size and effectiveness is a clear 
example of the efficacy of Mirriad’s audience based model. 
The momentum has continued into the new year with the 
signing of two landmark contracts with Univision and NBCU 
in the North American market and renewing an important contract 
with Youku/Alibaba in the Chinese market. While the Group’s 
contracts do not guarantee an immediate flow of revenue 
they are critical markers of future success.
Our people 
People are our greatest asset and sit at the core of Mirriad. 
Our team of experts and specialists have developed all of our 
intellectual property, our business processes and know‑how 
that form the basis for our unique proposition. Our proprietary 
technology gives us a competitive advantage in the advertising 
industry. As a consequence the majority of the Group’s expenditure 
is on staff and staff related costs. During the year the average

STRATEGIC REPORT Chief Executive’s statement
Mark Sabin Tadeusz Popkiewicz, Chief Executive Officer
We have demonstrated the
TREMENDOUS 
MARKETING  
POWER
of in-video advertising
Progress in 2017: focus and maturing technology
Mirriad’s strategy has centred on three key areas: the 
development of core technologies; the development of an 
organisation capable of supporting large enterprise‑class 
customers; and the deployment of the trading platform and 
associated in‑video ad unit deemed essential to connect 
clients’ advertising budgets to the inventory we create 
and allow our business to scale.
We have maintained our tight focus on the world’s largest 
and fastest growing advertising markets with high levels of video 
consumption. On that basis we have rebalanced our customer 
portfolio in favour of larger, more dominant players in each 
respective market including Alibaba/Youku, NBCU, RTL Group, 
Globosat and others. We expect this focus to yield results in 
terms of revenues from the second half of 2018 and beyond 
as we deploy our platform and service model. We anticipate the 
number of customers under contract to show a small increase by 
the end of 2018 as current contractual negotiations complete.
The value chain for in‑video advertising involves three parties: 
content producers, distributors (digital or broadcast) and 
advertisers/media agencies. Mirriad’s platform provides 
a marketplace for activity. 
The Group’s business is principally based on contracting with 
distributors, the primary sellers of the in‑video advertising 
inventory, and taking a share of revenue from resulting in‑video 
advertising transactions. 
Mirriad’s revenue share generally averages approximately 20%.
Our technologies are designed to make a complex problem 
simple: Mirriad receives video content; analyses it for advertising 
inventory; makes it available to our customers to sell; and ultimately 
fulfils the campaigns they have sold to media agencies and brands. 
As our technology has developed we have increasingly focused 
resources on the last steps in this process. 
2017 was an important year for technology developments as 
we solidified our capabilities for creating or predicting advertising 
inventory from premium entertainment content and naturally 
inserting realistic branded imagery into video at scale. Development 
work continued around the Marketplace platform, which will 
enable key stakeholders such as content owners, distributors 
and advertisers to transact. We also laid foundations for the 
2017 was an important year 
for technology development.
Mirriad Advertising plc Annual report and accounts 2017
05 Marketing effectiveness
We ran the Group’s largest campaign at the end of 2017 
and into the beginning of 2018. Mirriad partnered with Youku/
Alibaba to create an in‑video ad campaign for a leading Chinese 
car leasing company, T angeche. The campaign embedded T angeche’s 
brand messages as ad units across more than 20 different shows 
over five months. This large‑scale campaign successfully reached 
the target audience and hit Tangeche’s awareness and 
consideration goals. 
We are delighted that the campaign results, independently 
researched by Miaozhen Systems, exceeded even our 
high expectations.
The campaign delivered nearly 800 million impressions. At the end 
of the campaign almost 71% of the audience had seen the ads, 72% 
of viewers thought that the inclusion of the brand in the shows 
made the scenes look more realistic and 94% of the target audience 
said they would take follow‑up action, with their intention to 
use the brand three times higher than before the campaign.
We believe that the Tangeche campaign is an excellent example 
demonstrating the marketing power of In‑Video advertising when 
delivered at scale.
The future
The path to success for Mirriad requires the Group to complete 
a number of steps. 
In 2017 and into the first half of 2018 we have concentrated 
on the first of those steps: deploying our Marketplace platform 
and services as well as establishing the In‑Video advertising unit 
through independent third party verification. This requires 
the organisation to onboard customer sales organisations at 
some of the world’s largest media companies and takes considerable 
time and effort. It also requires integration with third party systems 
either at the customer, for core services, or externally for third 
party verification and tracking of ad unit delivery. Both integration 
and onboarding are complex and time consuming but worthwhile 
initiatives, each requiring agreement with and co‑ordinated 
rollout with our customer organisations, their clients and 
other third parties.
Once the supply side of the model is operational our next 
step is to leverage demand for in‑video advertising by driving 
demand‑side awareness of the product and its benefits to 
advertisers and clients. We do this through delivery of advertising 
effectiveness research, executed locally and culminating 
in case studies on behalf of different brand categories. 
When demand is generated Mirriad has the technology and 
processes in place to fulfil transactions using Marketplace.
The final step is to achieve scale in our target markets. 
Ultimately, we believe we can drive scale in the business 
by establishing Mirriad In‑Video Advertising as a media buying 
plan line item. It is also worth emphasising that Mirriad has 
planned capabilities to support programmatic buying and can 
provide personalisation depending on our distribution 
partners’ infrastructure.
Mark Sabin Tadeusz Popkiewicz

Progress in 2017: focus and maturing technology 
continued
launch of an industry credible In‑Video advertising unit capable 
of supporting media trading at scale; a third party certified, verifiable, 
consistent currency in the form of an In‑Video advertising unit is 
essential to market liquidity.
The Company has been actively protecting its IP and currently 
holds 11 granted patents, with more in process over 2017. 
Industry trends
There continues to be significant publicity around the verification 
and value of advertising media with recent comments from both 
Marc Pritchard and Keith Weed, respectively Chief Marketing 
Officers of Proctor & Gamble and Unilever, the world’s largest 
two advertisers by spend. 
In 2017 Marc Pritchard said that:
“We bombard consumers with thousands of ads a day, subject 
them to endless ad load times, interrupt their screens with 
pop‑ups and overpopulate their screens and feeds… We’re 
awfully busy, but all of this activity is not breaking through 
the clutter. It’s just creating more noise.”
While Keith Weed said at the IAB Annual Leadership Meeting 
in 2018 that:
“[Consumers] don’t care about good value for advertisers. 
But they do care when they see their brands being placed next 
to ads funding terror, or exploiting children.”
Mirriad Ad Units are designed to address these issues and more: 
bringing a new ad unit format to market requires a new metric 
that is transparent, verifiable and validated by some of the most 
respected industry measurement companies. 
We have very recently announced the results of work we 
have been undertaking for over two years concerning the 
standardisation of the Mirriad advertising unit with comScore 
in the USA and Miaozhen Systems in China. This work is critical 
in enabling Mirriad In‑Video Advertising to become a trading 
currency alongside other advertising products. The work in 
these two pivotal markets should drive more transactional 
liquidity between media owners and advertisers.
In 2017 Mirriad solved the challenge of consistent delivery 
of the ad units by finalising the development of an automated 
measurement and gating technology called the Visual Impact Score 
(“VIS”), now integrated into the Marketplace platform. VIS solves 
a formidable problem by ensuring each instance of ad exposure 
meets thresholds known to drive effectiveness such as exposure 
size and proportion, clarity, proximity to action and prominence. 
Early in 2018 Mirriad commissioned independent research from 
global measurement company comScore, which analysed a large, 
statistically valid random sample of the new Mirriad ad units. 
The audit verified Mirriad’s VIS score, with 98.5% of the tested 
ad units passing the independent audit. Full study results are 
available in a whitepaper on the Mirriad website (www.mirriad.com). 
So advertisers can now have independently verifiable certainty 
around the quality of each billable ad – essential in today’s highly 
scrutinized world of value for money and data transparency, 
especially in the two largest advertising markets in the world. 
Mirriad will continue working with multiple independent vendors 
of advertising measurement in securing further validation of the 
In‑Video advertising unit construct and its effectiveness.

07 Financial review
David Dorans, Chief Financial Officer
Introduction
2017 was an important year for the Company with the admission 
of Mirriad to AIM, which raised a net £23.7 million to fund future 
expansion. In 2017 the Group focused on securing contracts with 
key customers in its target markets and continued the development 
of its core technology and transactional platform. The Group has 
focused its resources on fewer larger customers. The Group now 
has a base of customers which provides a platform for future growth, 
though the Directors caution that sales cycles are long and signature 
of customer contracts, while an important KPI, does not immediately 
lead to future revenue. 
Current year results
Revenue for the year increased to £874,191 (2016: £710,866) 
as the Group commercialised its offering in its target markets 
with a focus on its Asian business. Revenue has grown consistently 
between 2015 and 2017. Gross margin increased to £693,604 
(2016: £559,280). The Group’s principal cost is staff and 
its administrative expenses increased to £12,067,393 
(2016: £7,994,910) as the Group continued to expand staff in 
its local offices and invest in its technology team. The income 
statement includes £1,179,148 (2016: £733,897) related to 
research and development (R&D) activity. The loss for the 
year before tax increased to £11,271,298 (2016: £7,294,104) 
as a result of this expansion in headcount.
Tax 
The Group has not recognised any tax assets in respect of 
trading losses arising in the current financial year or accumulated 
losses in previous financial years. The tax credit recognised 
in the current and previous financial years arises from the 
receipt of R&D tax credits. 
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share was a loss of 19p per share (2016: loss of 18p 
per share) as a result of increased staff costs over the period. This is 
based on the weighted average number of shares in issue during 
the financial year.

STRATEGIC REPORT Dividend 
No dividend has been proposed for the year ended 
31 December 2017 (2016: £nil). 
Cash flow 
Net cash used in operations was £7,524,445 (2016: £6,303,982) 
as headcount increased over the year. During the year £842,010 
(2016: £520,607) of development costs were capitalised as 
required following the Group’s adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The Group also incurred 
£466,627 (2016: £41,312) of capital expenditure on tangible 
assets the majority of which, £346,367, related to the move to 
a permanent head office site in London. Net proceeds from the 
issue of shares in July and December 2017 totalled £25 million 
(2016: £11.4 million). Cash consumed by the business has 
increased every year since 2015 as the Group has increased 
headcount and opened subsidiaries in its target markets.
Balance sheet 
As a result of the IPO, net assets increased to £27.9 million 
(2016: £12.2 million). Cash and cash equivalents at 
31 December 2017 was £26.4 million (2016: £10.3 million). 
Some of the proceeds from the issue of shares have been 
placed on deposit for time periods ranging between instant 
access and up to one year in maturity. 
Accounting policies 
The Group’s consolidated financial information has been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted in the EU. The Group’s significant 
accounting policies, which have been applied consistently 
throughout the year, are set out on pages 29 to 34. 
The overall impact of the conversion to reporting under 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) was to 
decrease the loss for the year ended 31 December 2016 by 
£318,609, and by £112,514 for the period ended 31 December 
2015. The main driver of this movement was the capitalisation 
of development costs. More information on the IFRS conversion 
can be found in note 25.
Going concern 
After making enquiries and producing cash flow forecasts, 
the Directors have reasonable expectations, as at the date 
of approving the financial statements, that the Company and the 
Group will have adequate resources to fund the activities of the 
Company and the Group for at least 12 months from the date 
of the financial statements. Therefore, the financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set 
out on pages 10 and 11. 
Cautionary statement 
The Strategic Report, comprising the Business and Financial Reviews, 
has been prepared for the shareholders of the Company, as a 
body, and no other persons. Its purpose is to assist shareholders 
of the Company to assess the strategies adopted by the Group 
and the potential for those strategies to succeed, and for no 
other purpose. The Strategic Report, containing the Business 
and Financial Reviews, contains forward‑looking statements that 
are subject to risk factors associated with, amongst other things, 
the economic and business circumstances occurring from time 
to time in the sector and markets in which the Group operates. 
It is believed that the expectations reflected in these statements 
are reasonable but they may be affected by a wide range of 
variables which could cause actual results to differ materially 
from those currently anticipated. No assurances can be given 
that the forward‑looking statements in the Strategic Report, 
comprising the Business and Financial Reviews, will be realised. 
The forward‑looking statements reflect the knowledge and 
information available at the date of preparation.

09 Risks and uncertainties
Description Mitigation Change
Wide market adoption
The Group believes the addressable market for its services 
is both very large and global because of the continuing 
pressure on traditional advertising models and that this, in 
turn, will drive adoption of the Group’s services. However, 
the Group currently serves only a very small sample of 
this market.
The Group is targeting a limited number of territories 
and customers as it has limited resources. The Group 
believes that by focusing on the largest and fastest 
growing advertising markets and the largest customers 
within those markets it will best achieve its objectives.
Commercialisation of Marketplace product
The Group is rolling out its Marketplace platform 
to key customers to enable transactional liquidity. 
Revenue expectations depend on the successful rollout 
of the Marketplace platform to these key customers. 
Failure to successfully roll out Marketplace could reduce 
or delay the Group’s ability to generate revenue.
The Group is currently on target with these rollouts. 
The Board actively monitors the Group’s progress and 
has put in place an incentive scheme to motivate staff 
to hit internal deadlines. 
Competition 
The Group has not yet experienced meaningful competition. 
As far as the Group is aware no competitors can currently 
provide an equivalent service to the market but there are 
very large and well‑resourced organisations who sell advertising 
products as part of their core business that will also see the 
market potential that the Group sees. Increased competition 
may cause price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss 
of market share, any of which could have an adverse effect 
on the Group’s business.
The Group continues to monitor the market and remains 
in active dialogue with current and prospective customers 
to assess the level of competition. The Group believes 
that replication of its technology is complex, would take 
some time and would require access to high levels 
of content. This should allow the Group to adapt to 
emerging competition. 
Commercial arrangements
The Group has contracts with a number of customers. 
All the Group’s revenue is derived from contracts which 
have no contractual obligation to maintain or renew any 
level of purchasing activity and there is no minimum 
purchasing commitment under the Group’s agreements. 
There is no guarantee that the commercial arrangements 
with partners will proceed beyond the initial phases or 
the Group’s partners will choose to implement the Group’s 
service at any particular level or at all, since customers 
are freely able to reduce the level of services they procure 
from the Group. 
The Group has developed case studies and conducts 
research to demonstrate the benefit of its product to 
distributors, content owners and advertisers. The Group 
believes these prove the business case for adapting 
and using the Group’s technology. The Group works 
proactively with its customers to create demand in 
the market which can then be fulfilled using the 
Group’s services.
MANAGING RISK
The risks and mitigations faced by the Company and the Group are 
considered to be the same and are not discussed separately.
Mirriad Advertising plc Annual report and accounts 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT Description Mitigation Change
Failure to renew contracts
Typically the Group’s contracts have 24‑month durations 
and as they have been signed at different times the Group 
is generally in a state of contract renewal with one or more 
customers. Renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to 
a number of factors including the customer’s level of 
satisfaction with the Group’s services.
The Group maintains an active dialogue with all of its 
contracted customers over the contractual term. The Group 
aims to demonstrate the business benefit of the Group’s 
service and work co‑operatively with its customers on 
demand creation activities so that clients renew or extend 
existing arrangements.
Adequate supply of inventory for commercialisation and to meet demand 
The Group requires a continual and growing supply 
of high quality entertainment content, which has been 
rights cleared for the insertion of digital images, from its 
customers. This content is used to generate the inventory 
which Mirriad’s customers then sell on to media agencies 
and advertisers. Failure by its customers to secure a flow 
of rights‑cleared content would damage the Group’s ability 
to generate revenue.
The Group is investing in additional resource in two key 
markets (the USA and China) to assist its customers in 
securing a flow of cleared content. The Group actively 
engages with content owners to demonstrate that the 
Group’s in‑video advertising does not detract from the 
content originally created.
Dependence upon key intellectual property including patents and know-how 
The Group’s success depends in part on its ability to protect 
its rights in its intellectual property. The Group’s intellectual 
property also includes know‑how related to the provision 
of in‑video advertising and associated products and services. 
The Group relies on various intellectual property protections, 
including patents, copyright, trademarks, trade secrets and 
contractual provisions, to preserve its intellectual property 
rights. Any infringement of its rights might distract 
management attention and incur significant cost from 
the need to defend the Group’s intellectual property.
The Group has been active in patenting its technology 
and continues to develop the key algorithms used to provide 
its service. As far as it is able the Group monitors the market 
to ensure that none of its key intellectual property is 
infringed. The Group continues to invest significant 
resource in its research and develop activities to ensure 
that its products remain technologically relevant.
Continued investment and product development
The Group needs to continue to invest significant resources 
in catalysing the market and ensure adoption of its services. 
The Group will have to invest in research and development to 
enhance its existing services and introduce new products 
and services.
The Group is developing its product function so that 
investment is directed with maximum efficiency. It is also 
looking to create the ability for rapid adaptation of new 
products with a view to enhanced efficiency in spend.
Key personnel 
The Group depends on the services of its key technical 
and development, sales and marketing, and management 
personnel. The Group’s success is highly dependent on its 
continuing ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain 
highly qualified technical, sales, marketing and management 
personnel. In the UK a proportion of staff are EU nationals 
without British citizenship and at this stage it is impossible 
to say what impact the UK’s stated decision to leave the 
European Union will have on the Group’s ability to attract 
and retain staff. 
The Group continues to monitor its employee value 
proposition across the markets in which it operates in. 
The Group’s Remuneration Committee actively considers 
all elements of employee packages including base salary 
and short‑term and long‑term incentive schemes. The 
aim of each of these elements is to attract, retain and 
motivate staff across the Group.

13 Corporate governance report
Statement by the Directors on compliance 
with the Code of Best Practice
As an AIM-quoted company, Mirriad Advertising plc is not required 
to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Code”) that applies to companies with a premium London Stock 
Exchange listing. However, the Directors recognise the value and 
importance of high standards of corporate governance and, given 
the Company’s size and the constitution of the Board, comply with 
the principal provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code to the 
extent the Directors consider appropriate in light of the Group’s 
size, stage of development and resources. The Company also intends 
to follow the recommendations set out in the QCA Code.
The Board
The Group is controlled through a Board of Directors, which 
at 31 December 2017 comprised two Executive Directors, a 
Non-executive Chairman and three other Non-executive Directors, 
of whom two are considered independent. 
The Chairman is Roger Faxon and the Chief Executive Officer 
is Mark Popkiewicz. Both the Chairman and John Pearson, 
a Non-executive Director, are considered to be independent. 
Dr Mark Reilly and Alastair Kilgour joined the Board in a personal 
capacity at the time of the IPO having previously been the nominated 
representatives of the corporate directors IP Group plc and 
Parkwalk Advisors.
The overriding responsibility of the Board is to provide clear, 
entrepreneurial and responsible leadership to the Group within a 
framework of efficient and effective controls so as to allow for the 
key issues and risks facing the business to be assessed and managed. 
The Board operates both formally, through Board and Committee 
meetings, and informally, through regular contact between the Directors 
and senior executives. There is a schedule of matters that are 
specifically referred to the Board for its decision, including approval 
of interim and annual financial results, setting and monitoring of 
strategy and examining business expansion possibilities. The Board 
is supplied with information in a timely manner, in a form and quality 
appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties. The Directors can 
obtain independent professional advice at the Group’s expense in 
the performance of their duties as Directors. 
The Board normally meets on a monthly basis and aims to meet a 
minimum of 10 times per year for formal Board meetings and also 
arranges ad hoc meetings to consider strategic issues and approve 
key operational decisions as required. 
The Executive Directors are responsible for carrying out decisions 
reached by the Board and, where appropriate, communicating the 
decisions of the Board and any necessary actions to be taken back 
to the employees of the Company through the appropriate line 
management channels.
Board Committees
The Board Committees comprise the Audit Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee was established at the IPO and has two 
Non-executive Director members: Dr Mark Reilly (Chairman) 
and Roger Faxon. The Group’s external auditors, along with 
the Chief Financial Officer, are invited to attend the Audit 
Committee meetings.
The Audit Committee has responsibility for, among other things, the 
monitoring of the financial integrity of the financial statements of the 
Group and the involvement of the Group’s auditors in that process. 
It focuses on compliance with accounting policies and ensuring that 
an effective system of audit and financial control is maintained, including 
considering the scope of the annual audit and the extent of the 
non-audit work undertaken by the external auditors, and advising 
on the appointment of the external auditors. The ultimate responsibility 
for reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Accounts and the 
half-yearly reports remains with the Board.
The Audit Committee meets at appropriate times in the financial 
reporting and audit cycle, and at least twice a year. The terms of 
reference of the Audit Committee cover issues such as membership 
and the frequency of meetings, together with requirements of any 
quorum for, and the right to attend, meetings. The responsibilities 
of the Audit Committee include the following: external audit, financial 
reporting, internal controls and risk management. The terms of 
reference also set out the authority of the Committee to carry 
out its responsibilities.
Any non-audit services that are to be provided by the external 
auditors are reviewed in order to safeguard auditor objectivity 
and independence. The external auditors have the opportunity 
during the Audit Committee meetings to meet privately with 
Committee members in the absence of executive management. 
In preparation for the IPO, the Board considered a review of risks 
facing the Group, together with management’s assessment of the 
risks and mitigation steps. Since the IPO, the Audit Committee has 
been responsible for reviewing the Company’s procedures for the 
identification, assessment, management and reporting of risks. 
The Company has a whistleblowing policy, in which staff may notify 
the CFO or confidentially the Chair of the Audit Committee of any 
concerns regarding suspected wrongdoing or dangers at work.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee was reconstituted at the IPO and 
has three Non-executive Director members: the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee is John Pearson and Dr Mark Reilly and 
Alastair Kilgour are the other Non-executive members. In addition, 
the Company Chairman has a standing right to attend any Remuneration 
Committee meetings. The Committee meets periodically as required 
and is responsible for overseeing the policy regarding staff and executive 
remuneration and for approving the remuneration packages for the 
Group’s Executive Directors. It is also responsible for reviewing incentive 
schemes for the Group as a whole.
Nomination Committee 
Due to the size and state of development of the Company 
the Directors do not consider it necessary to set up a separate 
Nomination Committee. Appointments are considered by the 
Board as a whole. 
Risk management and internal controls
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness; the role of management 
is to implement Board policies on risk management and control. 
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Group operates 
a series of controls to meet its needs. These controls include, but are 
not limited to, a clearly defined organisational structure, written 
policies, a comprehensive annual strategic planning and budgeting 
process and detailed monthly reporting. The Group prepares a 
quarterly rolling budget, which is approved by the Board as part of 
its normal responsibilities. The quarterly budgeting process facilitates 
the Board’s understanding of the Group’s overall position throughout 
the year. The Audit Committee receives reports from management 
and the external auditors concerning the system of internal control 
and any material control weaknesses. Any significant risk issues are 
referred to the Board for consideration. The Board has considered 
the need for an internal audit function, but has concluded that, at 
this stage in the Group’s development, the internal control systems 
in place are appropriate for the size and complexity of the Group.
The Board has continued to review the system of internal controls 
since the IPO and has not identified, nor been informed of, any 
instances of control failings or significant weakness.
Shareholder communications
The CEO and the CFO regularly meet with institutional shareholders 
to foster a mutual understanding of objectives. The Chairman and the 
other Non-executive Directors are available to shareholders to discuss 
strategy and governance issues. The Directors encourage the 
participation of all shareholders, including private investors, at the 
Annual General Meeting. The Annual Report and Accounts is published 
on the Company’s website, www.mirriad.com, and can be accessed 
by shareholders.
Whistleblowing policy 
The Board has adopted a whistleblowing policy. The aim of the 
policy is to encourage all employees, regardless of seniority, to 
bring matters which cause them concern to the attention of the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee.

15 Remuneration report
As an AIM-listed company, Mirriad Advertising plc is not required 
to comply with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The content 
of this report is unaudited unless stated.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The Company created a new Remuneration Committee at the 
time of IPO. From that date, the Remuneration Committee has 
comprised the three Non-executive Directors, John Pearson 
(Chairman of the Remuneration Committee), Dr Mark Reilly 
and Alastair Kilgour. The Company’s terms of reference for its 
Remuneration Committee also allow the Chairman, Roger Faxon, 
to attend Committee meetings. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of the 
Executive Directors and makes recommendations to the Board on 
matters relating to remuneration, terms of service, granting of share 
options and other equity incentives.
The Remuneration Committee also considers the overall remuneration 
policy of the Group and makes recommendations to the Board. 
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is designed to enable the Group 
to attract, retain and motivate its staff and Executive Directors, 
while ensuring that overall remuneration is consistent with the 
performance of the Group and retains a balance between 
remuneration and shareholder value.
Non-executive Directors
Remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined 
by the Executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors are not entitled to pensions, annual 
bonuses or employee benefits. They are entitled to participate in 
share option arrangements relating to the Company’s shares and 
both the Chairman and Independent Non-executive have share 
option arrangements.
Each of the Non-executive Directors has a contract stating his annual 
fee and that his appointment is initially for a term of three years from 
the date of admission (subject to re-election at the Company’s AGM).
Their appointment may be terminated with three months’ written 
notice at any time.
The annual fee for the Chairman is £100,000. John Pearson’s 
annual fee is £40,000 and the remaining Non-executive Directors’ 
annual fees are £20,000 per annum from the date of admission 
(19 December 2017).
Directors’ service contracts 
Under the terms of the service agreements in place with Executive 
Directors, six months’ written notice must be given by either party 
to terminate those service agreements. Under the terms of the 
service agreements in place with Non-executive Directors, three 
months’ written notice must be given by either party to terminate 
that appointment. 
Compensation for early termination for Executive Directors is 
generally limited to six months’ base salary and benefits. Any 
entitlements under incentive plans would ordinarily lapse in 
accordance with the terms of the relevant plan, unless the 
Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion as provided 
under the incentive scheme rules. 
Directors’ remuneration
Normally, Executive Directors’ remuneration consists of basic salary 
and annual performance related bonus. In the case of David Dorans, 
Chief Financial Officer, there is also a £10,000 performance related 
element included in his base salary. 
Both of the Executive Directors have service agreements that can be 
terminated by either party giving at least six months’ written notice.
At the time of IPO, the basic annual salaries payable to the 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer were £185,000 
and £179,950 per annum respectively. 
Salaries for all staff, including Executive Directors, are reviewed 
annually, effective 1 January. In January 2018 the Executive Directors’ 
salaries were increased to £190,550 and £185,349 respectively. 
Executive bonuses
The Company operates a performance related bonus scheme for all 
staff including Executive Directors. The Chief Financial Officer was 
awarded a bonus of £9,900 triggered by meeting certain performance 
criteria in the financial year ended 31 December 2016. This was paid in 
March 2017. Both Executive Directors were awarded discretionary 
bonuses related to the successful IPO, paid in March 2018. These 
amounted to £15,000 for the Chief Executive Officer and £12,500 
for the Chief Financial Officer.
Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme 
open to all UK Executive Directors and employees.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulation. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European 
Union and Company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by 
the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company for 
that period. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors 
are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial statements 
and IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been followed 
for the Company financial statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. The Directors are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. The Directors 
consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the Directors’ Report confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
• the Company financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and loss of the Company; 
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
loss of the Group; and 
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Company, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces. 
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ 
Report is approved: 
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group and Company’s auditors 
are unaware; and 
• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group and 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

In respect of the Annual Report and financial statements

To the members of Mirriad Advertising plc
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Mirriad Advertising plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss 
and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company’s financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and financial statements, which comprise: the consolidated 
and Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2017; the consolidated statement of profit and loss, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Company statement of changes in equity and the 
consolidated and Company statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2017; and the notes to the financial statements, 
which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements.
Our audit approach
Context
Mirriad Advertising plc listed on the Alternative Investment Market as of 19 December 2017. This resulted in a number of changes being 
required to occur within the business including a change in GAAP from FRS 102 to IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The listing 
on the Alternative Investment Market provided Mirriad Advertising plc with the additional funding it required to continue onto its next 
stage of growth. The business has again expanded into overseas territories, with an entity established in Brazil during the year ended 
31 December 2017.
Overview
• Overall the Group materiality: £553,000 (2016: £702,325), based on 5% of loss before tax.
• Overall the Company materiality: £448,000 (2016: £417,646), based on 5% of loss before tax.
• We identified two significant components within the Mirriad Advertising plc Group: Mirriad Advertising plc 
(“Company”) and Mirriad Inc. 
• The UK and US entities were selected as significant components based on their large contributions to the 
overall Group loss before tax. 
• Both the UK and US entities were audited by the Group audit team and no assistance was required 
from any component auditors.
• During our scoping procedures China was considered to have a significant revenue balance and brought 
into scope. Only the revenue figure for China was selected and no other balance was brought into scope.
• The risk of fraud in revenue recognition (Group and parent).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report on the audit of the financial statements continued
Our audit approach continued
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Fraud in revenue recognition
• Fraud in revenue recognition is considered a key audit matter 
given the inherent nature of the business, as a recently listed 
technology company, with the primary objective to grow 
revenue and become profitable.
• The majority of revenue is recognised once the native in-video 
advertising (“NIVA”) service has been provided to the customer. 
The timing of when the service is delivered, and therefore 
when revenue is recognised, is not complex or judgemental.
• The key risk is considered to be in relation to the existence of 
revenue – that a customer exists and the service has been provided.
• We have understood how management recognise and process 
revenue through performing a walkthrough of the revenue cycle;
• We have obtained detailed revenue listings for the UK and 
China entities and agreed these to the general ledger;
• We have tested a sample of revenue transactions to sales 
invoices and also to customer buy (purchase) orders and/or 
contracts and/or written communications;
• We have tested a sample of the revenue transactions selected 
to subsequent customer cash receipts; and
• We performed data analysis to identify potentially unusual 
journal entries impacting revenue and performed testing 
on those items.
We found no material misstatements from our testing.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry 
in which they operate.
The Group’s accounting process is structured around a central finance function based in the UK. The finance function has control and 
oversight of all overseas territories, even where the overseas territories have a small local finance function. There are six reporting units 
in the Group: Mirriad Advertising plc (which records the majority of Group activity), Mirriad Inc. (which records all of the activity in the US), 
Mirriad Advertising Private Limited (India), Mirriad (Singapore) Pte. Ltd, Mirriad Software Science and Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd and 
Mirriad Brasil Tecnologias Para Midia Ltda. These four overseas entities (India, Singapore, China and Brazil) are not within our scoping 
based on their small impact to our materiality benchmark of Group loss before tax. 
For each reporting unit we determined whether we required an audit of its complete financial information (“full scope”) or whether 
specified procedures addressing specific risk characteristics or particular financial statement line items would be sufficient. 
It was assessed that Mirriad Advertising plc and Mirriad Inc. were the only reporting units that were required to be full scope, 
with the other four reporting units contributing less than 11% to loss before tax and 3% of Group total assets. 
Other specified procedures were required for China as it contributed 50% of Group revenue. The revenue was scoped in as part of our 
audit procedures on top of the two full scope UK and US entities. No other balances in China were above the 15% threshold considered 
to be a significant balance to the Group audit. 
Mirriad Advertising plc Annual report and accounts 2017
21 Report on the audit of the financial statements continued
Our audit approach continued
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £553,000 (2016: £702,325). £448,000 (2016: £417,646).
How we determined it 5% of loss before tax. 5% of loss before tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on the benchmarks used in the Annual 
Report, loss before tax is the primary measure 
used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the Group, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark. 
Based on the benchmarks used in the Annual 
Report, loss before tax is the primary measure 
used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the Group, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between £448,000 and £207,000. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £22,000 (Group 
audit) (2016: £35,116) and £22,000 (Company audit) (2016: £20,882) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when: 
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about 
the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 12 months from 
the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our Auditors’ Report 
thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform 
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report 
certain opinions and matters as described below.
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, set out on page 19, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditors’ Report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented.
1.1 Basis of preparation 
The financial statements of Mirriad Advertising plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRS IC”) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 4.
1.1.1 Going concern 
These financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future and for at least one year from the date of these financial statements. For these 
reasons they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group’s financial statements.
The cash flow projections are the sole responsibility of the Directors based upon their present plans, expectations and intentions. In this 
context, the Directors have prepared and considered cash flow projections for the Group for a period extending one year from the date 
of approval of these financial statements. Based on these cash flows the Directors are satisfied that the Group is able to meet its liabilities 
as and when they fall due for the foreseeable future and for a minimum period of 12 months from the date of these financial statements.
1.1.2 Conversion to IFRS
These financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2017, are the first the Group has prepared in accordance with IFRS. 
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its previously published FRS 102 financial statements 
as at and for the year ended 31 December 2016 and period ended 31 December 2015.
The main changes under IFRS are noted below and the impact on the income statement and balance sheet can be seen in note 25.
IAS 20 “Accounting for grants” has been applied to government grant income received in 2016 and 2015. Previously grant income was 
recognised when quarterly grant claims were actually submitted and the claim amount known, but this has been amended to recognise 
the grant income on an accruals basis over the period the grant costs were incurred.
IAS 38 “Intangible assets” has been implemented, which has led to capitalisation of staff costs related to development of computer 
software used by the business. Previously all such costs had been expensed through the income statement. 
2. Accounting policies
2.1 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(a) New standards, amendments and interpretations
The following standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2017, have had no 
material impact on the Group or parent company:
• Amendments to IFRS 12: Annual improvements to IFRS 2014–2016 cycle – none of the Group interests are classified as held for sale, 
held for distribution to owners or as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5.
• Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses – There are no unrealised losses on debt instruments 
and no carrying deferred tax asset.
• Amendments to IAS 17: Disclosure initiative – there are no significant changes in liabilities arising from financing activities which need 
disclosing in the statement of cash flows.
(b) New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2017, 
and have not been applied in preparing this historical financial information. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the 
financial statements of the Group or parent company, as set out below:
• IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information 
to users of historical financial information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an 
entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability 
to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 “Revenue” and IAS 11 “Construction 
contracts” and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier 
application is permitted, subject to EU endorsement.

2. Accounting policies continued
2.1 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures continued
(b) New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted continued
  The impact of IFRS 15 has been reviewed by management against the criteria of the new standard for the four largest main client agreements 
generating 88% of revenue in 2017, and the Company believes that there are no major differences between contracts from a revenue 
recognition viewpoint. As a result of this exercise no changes are expected to be required to revenue recognised to date. Most of the 
Group’s client contracts do not specify revenue values but provide a framework within which individual work to produce campaigns and 
revenues are agreed and executed. The revenue on such campaigns is currently recognised on a monthly basis depending on campaign 
progress and ad units delivered to the client, as a proportion of the total campaign goals or agreed fee. This matches the process of the 
“assets” generated from the campaigns being transferred to the client, for which the Group is entitled to revenue as the “assets” are 
produced. Where a fixed or minimum revenue value is specified in the contract, this is recognised over the duration of the agreement 
in line with the agreed performance criteria where these have been specified.
• IFRS 16 “Leases” addresses the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and establishes principles for reporting 
useful information to users of historical financial information about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors. A key change arising 
from IFRS 16 is that most operating leases will be accounted for on the balance sheet for lessees. The standard replaces IAS 17 “Leases” 
and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 2019 and earlier adoption is permitted, subject 
to EU endorsement and the entity adoption of IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” at the same time. The full impact of 
IFRS 16 has not yet been assessed, but the Group expects this to increase assets and lease liabilities.
• IFRS 9 “Financial instruments” addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. 
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies 
the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value 
through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit 
or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected 
credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes 
to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for 
liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright 
line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the 
“hedged ratio” to be the same as the one management actually uses for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation 
is still required but is different from that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted, subject to EU endorsement. 
  IFRS 9 requirements have been assessed by management and deemed to have no material impact on the Group. There are no complex 
financial instruments, derivatives or hedges in place, and the only items held by the Group covered by IFRS 9 are cash balances, trade 
related receivables and payables and accruals. Such items are recognised at their transaction value. Although there are differences in 
the basis of debtors provisioning this is not expected to have a material impact.
2.2 Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The cost of a business combination is the fair value of the consideration given, liabilities incurred or assumed and of equity instruments 
issued plus the costs directly attributable to the business combination.
On acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the fair value 
cannot be measured reliably, in which case the value is incorporated in goodwill. Where the fair value of contingent liabilities cannot be 
reliably measured they are disclosed on the same basis as other contingent liabilities.
Goodwill recognised represents the excess of the fair value and directly attributable costs of the purchase consideration over the 
fair values to the Group’s interest in the identifiable net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
2.3 Consolidation
The Group consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made 
up to 31 December 2017, and the prior year to 31 December 2016. As these are the first financial statements for the Group under IFRS 
a balance sheet for the period ended 31 December 2015 has also been reported, as per the requirements of IFRS 1.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as 
to obtain benefits from its activities. 
Any subsidiary undertakings or associates sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the dates of change of control 
or change of significant influence respectively.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. Accounting policies continued
2.3 Consolidation continued 
Where control of a subsidiary is lost, the gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. The cumulative amounts of any 
exchange differences on translation, recognised in equity, are not included in the gain or loss on disposal and are transferred to retained 
earnings. The gain or loss also includes amounts included in other comprehensive income that are required to be reclassified to profit or 
loss but excludes those amounts that are not required to be reclassified. 
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Adjustments are made to eliminate the profit 
or loss arising on transactions with associates to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.
2.4 Foreign currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which each entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
Pound Sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group.
(ii) Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transactions is included as an exchange gain 
or loss in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary items measured at historical costs are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary 
items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was determined. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the profit and loss account 
within “Finance income or finance costs”. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the profit and loss account within 
“Administrative expenses”. 
(iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; 
(b)  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the rate on the dates of each transaction); and 
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
2.5 Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for services provided, 
stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. Revenue represents the value (excluding value added tax) of fees for the services 
provided. All Group revenue comes from the primary business activity of providing native in-video advertising (“NIVA”) services to 
broadcasters, advertisers, brand owners and their agencies. This involves the insertion by the Group of a product, signage or video into 
existing content. Revenue is recognised when the services have been delivered and provided to customers in accordance with contractual 
terms and conditions and there are no further obligations attached.
Most of the Group’s client contracts do not specify revenue values but provide a framework, and normally a share of customer revenue, 
within which individual work to produce campaigns and revenues are agreed and executed. The exact revenue for each campaign is set 
out in the relevant insertion (purchase) order which shows the agreed number of advertising units or insertions to be delivered.
The revenue on such campaigns is currently recognised on a monthly basis depending on campaign progress and ad units delivered to the 
client, as a proportion of the total campaign goals or agreed fee. This matches the process of the “assets” generated from the campaigns 
being transferred to the client, for which the Group is entitled to revenue as the “assets” are produced.
Where a fixed or minimum revenue value is specified in the contract, this is recognised over the duration of the agreement in line with 
the agreed performance criteria where these have been specified.
2.6 Cost of sales
Cost of sales comprises costs directly related to the ad delivery team in India, which performs the integration work of the creative imagery 
(our embed) into the original content and quality control of the end result. All other staff costs are included in administrative costs below 
gross profit.
2.7 Other operating income
Other operating income relates to income received from government grants.

2. Accounting policies continued
2.8 Government grants
Grant income represents amounts received from the government to assist with the funding of research and development activities carried out 
by the Group. Government grant income is recognised at fair value in the profit and loss account at the point that there is reasonable assurance 
that the Group has complied with the conditions attaching to them and the grants will be received. Government grants are recognised in the 
income statement on a systematic basis over the periods in which the related costs towards which they are intended to compensate are 
recognised as expenses. Where grant related costs relate to staff expenses which are being capitalised as development costs the related 
grant income is not recognised in the income statement but is instead deducted in arriving at the intangible asset being recognised.
2.9 Interest income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate method.
2.10 Current and deferred tax
Taxation expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting period. Tax is recognised in the income 
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case tax 
is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Current tax is the amount of income tax payable or receivable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the year or prior years. T ax is calculated 
on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end.
Deferred tax is the timing difference between the tax base and the carrying value in the balance sheet. These timing differences arise from 
the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences at the reporting date except for certain exceptions. Unrelieved tax losses and other 
deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or 
other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end and that are 
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.
Research and development tax credits are recognised as an income tax credit in the income statement, with a corresponding asset recognised 
until the amounts are received. Such amounts are only recognised at the period/year end based on an assessment of relevant time spent 
by employees on research and development activities. Where government grants have been received against the same employee costs, 
such amounts are removed from the R&D tax credit calculations.
2.11 Leases
At inception the Company assesses agreements that transfer the right to use assets. The assessment considers whether the arrangement 
is, or contains, a lease based on the substance of the arrangement.
Operating leased assets
Leases that do not transfer all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments under operating leases are 
charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
2.12 Employee benefits
(i) Pension
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for UK employees. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit 
expense when they are due. Differences between contributions payable in the year, and contributions actually paid are shown as accruals 
in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Company has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been made.
(ii) Annual bonus plan
The Company operates an annual bonus plan for all employees. An expense is accrued over the related service period and recognised in 
the profit and loss account when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation to make payments under the plan as a result of past 
events and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
2.13 Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation schemes to certain key employees. The fair value of share-based 
payments under such schemes is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest, with a corresponding entry to equity. In arriving at this estimate the Company takes into account non-market-based 
factors and the expected attrition of employees over the period.
Fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model and requires several assumptions and estimates as disclosed in note 20.
2.14 Property, plant and equipment
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic purchase cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset and costs attributable to bringing the asset into its working condition for its intended use.

2.14 Property, plant and equipment continued
Depreciation and residual values 
The fixed assets have been depreciated on a straight line basis at rates calculated to reduce the net book value of each asset to its estimated 
residual value by the end of its expected useful economic life in the Company’s business, and the rates are as follows:
• Fixtures, fittings and computer equipment – 3 years
• Leasehold improvements – 5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. The effect of any 
change is accounted for prospectively.
Derecognition
Tangible assets are derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected. On disposal, the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss and included in “Administrative expenses”.
2.15 Intangible assets
Computer software
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are 
directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible 
assets when the following criteria are met:
• it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
• management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;
• there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
• it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and
• the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the development employee costs and the fees of any 
contractors directly involved in the project. 
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously 
recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed three years.
Intellectual property and patents
Patents and brand assets acquired were valued based on a relief from royalty approach, and are amortised over their useful economic life 
of four years. Brand assets are included in “Other intangible assets”.
Intangible assets are stated at cost or valuation less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated, 
using the straight line method, to allocate the depreciable amount of the assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, 
as follows:
• Patents  – 4 years
• Internally generated software development costs – 3 years
• Other intangible assets – 4 years
Amortisation is charged to administrative expenses in the profit and loss account.
Where factors, such as technological advancement or changes in market price, indicate that residual value or useful life have changed, 
the residual value, useful life or amortisation rate are amended prospectively to reflect the new circumstances. The assets are reviewed 
for impairment if the above factors indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
2.16 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services rendered in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in 
one year or less they are classified as current assets. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

2.17 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks with original maturities of three months or less.
2.18 Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. Trade receivables are recognised initially 
at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
2.19 Share capital
Ordinary Shares, preference shares and deferred shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
Ordinary and preference shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds, and taken against the share 
premium account.
2.20 Related party transactions
The Group discloses transactions with related parties which are not wholly owned with the same Group. Where appropriate, transactions 
of a similar nature are aggregated unless, in the opinion of the Directors, separate disclosure is necessary to understand the effect of the 
transactions on the Group historical financial information. It does not disclose transactions with members of the same Group that are 
wholly owned.
3. Financial risk management 
3.1 Group financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s 
overall risk management programme is focused on operating cost and cash management.
(a) Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to US Dollars, Indian Rupees, Singapore Dollars, Chinese Yuan and Brazilian Real. Foreign exchange risk arises from commercial transactions, 
and investments in foreign subsidiaries. 
The Group has certain investments in foreign subsidiaries, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. There are 
currently no measures in place to manage currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations. Such movements 
are recognised in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income. For the year ended December 2017 the revaluation 
loss on foreign subsidiary net assets recognised in the statement of comprehensive income was £14,088 (2016: £133,270). 
Following the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union Sterling has been relatively volatile, and there has been mixed impact 
on the Group. When Sterling depreciates the Group’s overseas income increases but the cost base rises. Conversely when Sterling 
appreciates, revenues are reduced but costs also decrease. As the Group is currently loss making, any appreciation in Sterling has a 
beneficial impact on the net loss.
(b) Credit risk
In common with most businesses, the Group extends credit to its customers. The credit risk on this activity is judged as low and the 
Group has not experienced significant bad debt. Most clients are large blue-chip organisations and further credit checks are not carried 
out before entering into commercial arrangements. Standard credit terms offered are 30 days but this can vary depending on the 
commercial agreement reached. See note 16 for further disclosures on credit risk.
(c) Liquidity risk
Cash flow forecasting is performed centrally on a rolling basis for the Group as a whole and the Company ensures that the subsidiaries 
have sufficient cash to meet their local operational needs.
The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings, based on the remaining period at 
the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

3.2 Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group considers capital to be its equity reserves.
The Group ensures it is meeting its objectives by reviewing its key performance indicators (“KPIs”) to ensure cash consumption and costs 
are controlled, revenues are in line with expectations, and key customers are under contract.
There is no debt in the Group and to date no dividends have been paid.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
(a) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
(i) Intangible assets 
As part of the acquisition of the trade and assets of Mirriad Limited in May 2015 a fair value review exercise was carried out on the assets 
and liabilities being transferred. The Group also capitalises internally generated software development costs as described below.
Estimate on original value of acquired intangible assets – As part of the fair value review exercise, patents and other intangible assets 
were capitalised as intangible assets based on their estimated fair values at the time. Following the fair value exercise it was noted that the 
effective consideration paid was lower than the assets being acquired so a negative goodwill balance was recognised and then fully written 
off in 2015.
Estimate on the useful life of acquired intangible assets – The intangible assets are being amortised over their expected useful life, being 
four years. No residual value is expected at the end of the useful life for any of the intangible assets. The assessment of the useful life 
requires management judgement. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of impairment and any 
impairment is charged to the income statement.
Judgement on when capitalisation of internally generated software begins and ends – Internally generated software development costs 
have also been capitalised, which are principally employer payroll costs. Such costs are only capitalised to the extent that they relate to an 
identifiable asset that is expected to generate future economic benefits, can be reliably measured and relate to the development phase of 
the software creation. Costs related to the research phase or subsequent maintenance are not capitalised. 
Estimate on the useful life of internally generated software – The intangible assets are being amortised over their expected useful life, being 
three years. No residual value is expected at the end of the useful life for any of the intangible assets. The assessment of the useful life 
requires management judgement. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of impairment and any 
impairment is charged to the income statement.
(ii) Share-based payments
The Group records charges for share-based payments. For option-based share-based payments management estimates certain factors 
used in the option pricing model, including volatility, vesting date of options and number of options likely to vest. If these estimates vary 
from actual occurrence, this will impact the value of the equity carried in reserves. Further details of the Group’s estimation of share-based 
payments are disclosed in note 20.

5. Segment information
Management mainly considers the business from a geographic perspective since the same services are effectively being sold in every Group 
entity. Therefore regions considered for segmental reporting are where the Company and subsidiaries are based, namely the UK, the USA, 
India, Brazil, China and Singapore. The revenue is classified by where the sales were booked not by the geographic location of the customer. 
For this reporting purpose the Singapore and China entities are considered together. 
The only income outside of the primary business activity relates to income received from grants which is recognised in other 
operating income.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, 
has been identified as the steering committee that makes strategic decisions. The steering committee is made up of the Board of Directors. 
There are no sales between segments. The revenue from external parties reported to the strategic steering committee is measured in a 
manner consistent with that in the income statement.
The parent company is domiciled in the United Kingdom. The amount of revenue from external customers by location of the Group billing 
entity is shown in the tables below.

Unrecognised deferred tax has been calculated at 17%, reflecting the latest enacted rate. The unrecognised deferred tax asset would 
be recovered against future Company taxable profits. In the opinion of the Directors, there is insufficient evidence that the asset will 
be recovered, as such the deferred tax asset has not been recognised in the financial statements.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
The main rate of corporation tax was aligned with the small profits rate at 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. Changes to the UK corporation 
tax rates were enacted as part of the Finance (No.2) Act 2015, which received royal assent on 18 November 2015, and Finance Act 2016, 
which received royal assent on 15 September 2016. These include reductions to reduce the main rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% 
from 1 April 2020. These rate reductions have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date as noted above.

Intangible assets comprises two patents acquired from Mirriad Limited in 2015 which are being amortised on a straight line basis over four years.
Other intangibles above includes the technology acquired from Mirriad Limited, which has a carrying net book value of £13,264 
(2016: £23,211) and the Mirriad brand acquired as part of the same transaction, which has a carrying value of £104,048 (2016: £182,084). 
These items are being amortised on a straight line basis over four years.
The internally generated software costs reflect staff time incurred on two main products for internal use which underpin the business processes. 
These development costs have been offset by grant income received for the same staff costs over the period. To the extent that work on 
the products reflects research or maintenance activities such related costs have not been capitalised. The capitalised software development 
costs are being amortised on a straight line basis over three years.
Despite the losses incurred, none of the intangible assets are deemed to be impaired. An impairment review was performed. This review 
demonstrated that the current Company value exceeds the assets and, as these intangibles are an integral part of the Company’s operations, 
the Company is comfortable that there is no impairment.

20. Share-based payments
Certain employees participate in the key employee share option scheme, which provides additional remuneration for those employees 
who are key to the operations of the Group. In accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based payments” the cost of the equity-settled transactions 
is measured by reference to their fair value at the date at which they are granted. Fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the period until the award vests. No expense is recognised for awards that do 
not ultimately vest. At each reporting date, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-based transactions reflects the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the Directors at that date, will ultimately vest.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments are recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding increase 
in equity during the vesting period – please see note 18 for details of the share-based payment reserve. During the 12 months ended 
31 December 2017, the Group recognised a share-based payment expense of £1,675,271 (2016: £192,047). The charge is included 
within administrative expenses.
The Company grants share options under an Unapproved Share Option Scheme (the “Unapproved Scheme”) and under its tax efficient 
EMI Option Scheme (the “EMI Scheme”). Under the Unapproved Scheme, options are granted to non-UK-based employees at an exercise 
price deemed to be market value of the shares. Under the EMI Scheme options are granted to UK-based employees at a fair value. In general, 
for options granted one-third are exercisable on the first anniversary of the grant, a further third are exercisable on the second anniversary of 
the grant and the remainder are exercisable three years after the date of grant. All vested options expire ten years after the date of grant. The 
only exception were options issued in 2015 which vested immediately. Employees are not entitled to dividends until the shares options are 
exercised. Vesting of the options is subject to continued employment within the Group.
Both the Unapproved and EMI Scheme rules contained a provision whereby the normal three-year vesting schedule of the options will 
be accelerated on admission to AIM such that all subsisting options could be exercised either immediately prior to admission or during the 
90 days following admission with the lapse of unexercised options occurring 90 days after admission. The Board resolved on 14 November 
to amend the rules for unapproved option holders to permit them to choose either to accept the accelerated vesting and exercise their options 
within 90 days of admission or to accept an amendment whereby unapproved options will continue to vest under their original vesting schedule. 
All employees elected to continue with the original vesting schedule.
The Chairman’s unapproved options did accelerate on admission to AIM and are now fully vested. The Chairman’s options are exercisable 
up to not less than five years following termination of office.
No unapproved options were exercised during the year (2016: nil).

The fair values were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted average fair value of the options granted under 
the Unapproved Scheme during the period under this model was £0.31 per option (2016: £0.31). The significant inputs into the model were 
share price of £0.62 (2016: £0.62) at the grant date, exercise price as shown above, volatility of 47.9% (2016: 48.4%), expected option life 
of 6.5 years (2016: 6.5 years) and an annual risk-free interest rate of 1.706% (2016: 2.0687%). The volatility used for the calculations was 
based on the average (median) 6.5 year volatility for AIM-listed technology companies as at 31 December 2017.
The weighted average fair value of the options granted under the EMI Scheme during the period under this model was £0.46 per option 
(2016: £nil). The significant inputs into the model were share price of £0.62 (2016: £0.62) at the grant date, exercise price as shown above, 
volatility of 48% (2016: nil), expected option life of 6.5 years (2016: nil) and an annual risk-free interest rate of 1.75% (2016: nil).

23. Related party transactions
The Group is owned by a number of investors, the largest being IP2IPO Portfolio (GP) Limited (as general partner for IP2IPO Portfolio L.P), 
who owns approximately 27% of the share capital of the Company. Accordingly there is no ultimate controlling party.
During the year the Company had the following significant related party transactions which were carried out at arms length. No guarantees 
were given or received for any of these transactions:
IP2IPO Services Limited
IP2IPO Portfolio (GP) Limited – a company with the same parent company as IP2IPO Services Limited; one of the Company Directors 
during the period had the following transactions: (1) purchase of 6,010,323 Ordinary Shares in the IPO in December 2017 at £0.62 per 
share; and (2) charged Mirriad Advertising plc £52,543.76 for services as a corporate finance adviser. This fee was satisfied by the issue and 
allotment of 84,748 preference shares in July 2017.

and during the period charged Mirriad Advertising plc £3,500 in August 2017 for data room charges related to fundraising activity.

The Non-executive Director of the Company during the period purchased 4,032,258 Ordinary Shares in the IPO in December 2017 
at £0.62 per share.
All the related party transactions disclosed above were settled by 31 December 2017 except where stated.

which net off on consolidation – these have not been shown above.

comprise key management personnel as defined by IAS 24, “Related party disclosures”. Remuneration of Directors and senior management 
is disclosed in the Remuneration Report.

Notes on IFRS adjustments
A – Capitalised development costs
FRS 102 allows an option to capitalise development costs provided specific criteria are met, but this option was not taken by the Company, 
despite the criteria being met. Under IFRS an intangible asset arising from the development phase of an internal project must be recognised 
if certain criteria have been met.
IAS 38 “Intangible assets” has now been implemented, which has led to the recognition of staff costs related to the development of 
computer software products used by the business. The costs are recognised to the extent they relate to the development phase of 
the work being carried out. These development costs are being amortised over three years.
B - Grant income
Previously grant income was recognised when quarterly grant claims were actually submitted and the claim amount known, but 
this has been amended to recognise the grant income on an accruals basis over the period the grant costs were incurred in line with 
IAS 20 “Government grants and disclosure of government assistance”. The impact of this was to reallocate grant income between 2015 
and 2016 which gave rise to a corresponding accrued income balance at the end of 2015.
C – Loss for the period/year
This entry represents the retained earnings impact of all the adjustments posted.
Notes on other adjustments
D – Depreciation in India
This adjustment ensures depreciation is appropriately allocated between 2015 and 2016.
E – Share-based payments
IFRS 2 “Share-based payments” has now been applied to share options granted in 2015 and 2016 resulting in a charge in the income 
statement and a corresponding entry in equity. Previously share-based payments had not been recognised as an expense and they were 
not deemed material to the FRS 102 financial statements.
F – Holiday pay accrual
IAS 19 “Employee benefits”. A holiday pay accrual has been made for annual leave accrued and not taken at the period/year end. No such 
accrual had previously been recognised in the FRS 102 financial statements.
G – National Insurance on share-based payments
A National Insurance accrual has been recognised in relation to the share-based payments issued to employees. This was previously not 
recognised and was not deemed material to the FRS 102 financial statements.
H – Operating income
Grant income has reclassified from revenue to other operating income.
I – Cash and cash equivalents
There was no impact on overall cash flows of the IFRS conversion.
26. Post balance sheet events
On 24 April 2018 the Company announced the completion of an investment by Puhua Tianqin Equity Investment Fund Partnership 
(“Puhua”), a capital fund established in Jinhua in the People’s Republic of China. 
Puhua has subscribed for 3,225,806 new Ordinary Shares at a price of 62p per share, the same price funds were raised at in Mirriad’s IPO 
on 19 December 2017. The investment raised gross proceeds of approximately £2 million for the Company.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Explanatory notes to the resolutions
Resolution 1 – Receiving the accounts and reports
All public limited companies are required by law to lay their annual accounts before a general meeting of the Company, together with 
the Directors’ Report and Auditors’ Report on the accounts. At the Annual General Meeting, the Directors will present these documents 
to the members for the financial year ended 31 December 2017.
Resolution 2 – Directors’ Remuneration Report
The Company is required to put an ordinary resolution to members approving the report at the meeting at which the Company’s 
Annual Report and Accounts for that year are laid.
Resolution 3 – Re-appointment of auditors
This resolution concerns the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors until the conclusion of the next general meeting 
at which accounts are laid, that is, the next Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 4 – Auditors’ remuneration
This resolution authorises the Directors to fix the auditors’ remuneration.
Resolutions 5 to 10 – Re-election of Directors
These resolutions concern the re-election of all of the Directors of the Company, who are retiring at the first Annual General Meeting 
since the Company’s admission to AIM in accordance with article 88.1(a) of the Company’s articles of association.
Resolution 11 – Directors’ power to allot shares
This resolution grants the Directors authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company and other relevant securities up to an aggregate 
nominal value of £350, representing approximately 33.33% of the nominal value of the issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 
17 May 2018, being the latest practicable date before publication of this notice. In addition, in accordance with guidelines issued by the 
Investment Association, this resolution grants the Directors authority to allot further equity securities up to an aggregate nominal value 
of £701, representing approximately 66.66% of the nominal value of the issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 17 May 2018, 
being the latest practicable date before publication of this notice. This additional authority may be only applied to fully pre-emptive 
rights issues.
Unless revoked, varied or extended, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or the 
date falling 15 months from the passing of the resolution, whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 12 – Directors’ power to issue shares for cash
This resolution authorises the Directors in certain circumstances to allot equity securities for cash other than in accordance with the 
statutory pre-emption rights (which require a company to offer all allotments for cash first to existing shareholders in proportion to their 
holdings). The relevant circumstances are either where the allotment takes place in connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive 
issue or the allotment is limited to a maximum nominal amount of £105, representing approximately 10% of the nominal value of the 
issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 17 May 2018, being the latest practicable date before publication of this notice. 
Unless revoked, varied or extended, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company 
or 15 months after the passing of the resolution, whichever is the earlier. 
The Company may hold any shares it buys back “in treasury” and then sell them at a later date for cash rather than simply cancelling them. 
Any such sales are required to be made on a pre-emptive, pro-rata basis to existing shareholders unless shareholders agree by special 
resolution to disapply such pre-emption rights. Accordingly, in addition to giving the Directors power to allot unissued Ordinary Shares 
on a non-pre-emptive basis, Resolution 12 will also give Directors power to sell Ordinary Shares held in treasury on a non-pre-emptive 
basis, subject always to the limitations noted above. 
The Directors consider that the power proposed to be granted by Resolution 12 is necessary to retain flexibility, although they do not have 
any intention at the present time of exercising such power.
Unless revoked, varied or extended, the authorities conferred by Resolution 12 will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company or 15 months after the passing of the resolution, whichever is the earlier.
Notes to Notice of Annual General Meeting
1.  Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. 
A member may appoint more than one proxy provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share 
or shares held by that member (so a member must have more than one share to be able to appoint more than one proxy). A proxy need 
not be a member of the Company but must attend the Annual General Meeting in order to represent you. A proxy form which may be 
used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this notice. If you do not have a proxy form and believe that 
you should have one, or if you require additional forms, please contact the Company’s registrars on 0370 702 0150. Calls cost 12p to 14p per 
minute plus your phone company’s access charge. Calls outside the United Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate. 
They are open between 8.30 a.m.–5.30 p.m., Monday to Friday excluding public holidays in England and Wales.

2.  To be valid, the proxy form must be completed and lodged, together with the original power of attorney or other authority (if any) 
under which it is signed, or a duly certified copy of such power or authority, with the Company’s registrars, Computershare Investor 
Services Plc, by hand only to Computershare Investor Services Plc, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZY or in accordance 
with the replied paid details, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the Annual General Meeting. 
3.  The return of a completed proxy form, other such instrument or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as described in paragraph 7 below) 
will not prevent a member attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so (although voting 
in person at the Annual General Meeting will terminate the proxy appointment).
4.  T o be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the votes 
they may cast), members must be registered in the Register of Members of the Company at the close of business on 11 June 2018 
(or, if the Annual General Meeting is adjourned, such time being not more than 48 hours prior to the time fixed for the adjourned meeting). 
Changes to the Register of Members after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend 
and vote at the Annual General Meeting.
5.  As at 17 May 2018 (being the last business day prior to the publication of this notice of meeting) the Company’s issued share capital 
consisted of 105,122,717 Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in 
the Company as at 17 May 2018 were 105,122,717.
6.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using 
the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST 
members who have appointed a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able 
to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
7.  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST 
Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s specifications, and must contain 
the information required for such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST). The 
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (CREST ID No. 3RA50) by 10.00 a.m. 
on 11 June 2018. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the 
message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the 
manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated 
to the appointee through other means.
8.  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK and Ireland 
Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, 
therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take 
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure 
that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting system providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations 
of the CREST system and timings.
9.  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
10.  Any corporation which is a member can either (i) appoint a proxy (described in notes 1 to 3 above) or (ii) appoint one or more corporate 
representatives, who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member provided they do not do so in relation to the same 
shares. Members considering the appointment of a corporate representative should check their own legal position, the Company’s 
articles of association and the relevant provision of the Companies Act 2006.
11.  A copy of this notice, and other information required by section 311A of the Act, can be found at mirriadplc.com/investor-relations
12.  You may not use any electronic address provided either in the Notice of Annual General Meeting or any related documents (including 
the Chairman’s letter and proxy form) to communicate for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
13.  Voting on all resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll. This is a more transparent method of voting as shareholders’ votes are 
counted according to the number of shares registered in their names. 
14.  The following documents will be available for inspection during normal business hours at the registered office of the Company from 
the date of this notice until the time of the meeting. They will also be available for inspection at the place of the meeting from at least 
15 minutes before the meeting until it ends:
 (a) copies of the service contracts of the Executive Directors of the Company; and
 (b) copies of the letters of appointment of the Non-executive Directors of the Company.
