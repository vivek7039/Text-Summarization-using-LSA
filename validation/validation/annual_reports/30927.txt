Who we are  Five key strengths of Ibstock plc
Our market-leading businesses enable 
us to benefit from the expected growth 
in demand in the UK and our regional 
markets within the US.
Many of our long-standing customer 
relationships have lasted over 40 years. 
Our customer focus is based on quality, 
service and consistency and our 
service-led ethos is one of the key 
drivers in the growth of our market 
share in bricks over the past 10 years.
Our management team has extensive 
experience in the building products 
market with our Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer having 
combined experience of over 50 years 
within the industry. They are ably 
supported by our Group Executive 
Committee who have an average of 
18 years’ experience.
We have 28 clay and 15 concrete plants 
throughout the UK and US manufacturing 
over 500 varieties of bricks coupled 
with ownership of valuable long-term 
clay reserves.
 – 43 main manufacturing sites; 33 UK 
sites and 10 US sites.
 – Over 150 million tonnes of consented 
clay reserves and in excess of an 
additional 100 million tonnes of clay 
resources. 
 – Realisable production capacity of 
1.2 billion bricks per annum.
In the UK, demand for building products is 
anticipated to increase due to Government 
support for new housebuilding, increasing 
household formations and population 
growth. We have invested in the latest 
technology to increase capacity and to 
meet the growing market demands.
 – The new Leicester plant, which 
commenced commissioning in Q4 
2017 , is expected to add capacity of 
circa 100 million bricks per annum.
 – The capacity expansion project at 
our Lodge Lane blue brick plant in 
Cannock began commissioning in Q4 
2017 . This investment in a replacement 
kiln increases capacity and maintains 
the Group’s leading position as a full 
range supplier.

Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 05
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information 2018 has been another year 
of progress with the Group 
performing in line with the 
Board’s expectations.
Overview
The demand for our products has again 
been strongly supported by good activity 
levels across the UK new housebuilding 
market. Market-wide demand has been 
such that our customers have on occasion 
faced extended waiting times for some of 
our products, especially soft mud bricks 
and roof tiles. This reduced availability 
underpins the Group’s strategy to increase 
capacity and highlights the importance of 
the Board’s decisions to invest in our new 
soft mud brick factory in Leicestershire 
and roof tile line in Leighton Buzzard. 
The Board is responsible for the 
governance of the Group, and we 
recognise its crucial role in helping Ibstock 
deliver our long–term success. I should 
draw your attention to my Corporate 
Governance statement on page 44, 
which summarises our progress in this 
area during 2017 when we achieved 
compliance for the full year with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. However, 
I am conscious of the ever evolving 
regulations and guidance surrounding 
corporate governance, and so we have 
sought to enhance our disclosures 
within the Strategic Report in light of 
these changes. 
Board changes
As a Board we have consistently focused 
on succession planning as one of our 
most important activities.
In October 2017 , we announced that 
Wayne Sheppard, Group CEO, had 
notified the Board of his intention to retire 
in 2018 and that Joe Hudson would join 
the Board as CEO designate in early 2018. 
Wayne has been instrumental in Ibstock’s 
success. As CEO, he has led the Group 
through a successful IPO and delivered 
strong growth. I wish him well in his 
retirement and on behalf of the Board 
and the shareholders I thank him for his 
efforts and significant achievements.
I am absolutely delighted that we have 
managed to secure the appointment of 
someone of Joe’s calibre and experience. 
His track record of performance at 
Aggregate Industries and Lafarge Holcim 
has been outstanding and we look forward 
to him leading Ibstock through the next 
stage of its development.
In addition to the CEO change, the 
composition of our Non-Executive 
Directors also altered during 2017 .
As reported in last year’s Annual Report 
and Accounts, Justin Read joined our 
Board as an independent Non-Executive 
Director from 1 January 2017 . Since his 
appointment, Justin has provided a wealth 
of experience that has been of great 
benefit to Ibstock as we continue to 
develop our business. 
Matthias Boyer Chammard and Michel 
Plantevin, who were representatives of 
Bain Capital Europe, resigned from the 
Board in May 2017 and did not seek 
reappointment at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting. I wish to thank both Michel and 
Matthias for the constructive and thoughtful 
contribution they have made to the Board 
and the Company during our time as 
a listed company.
In December 2017 , Lynn Minella who has 
been an independent Non-Executive 
Director since February 2016, resigned 
from the Board following her relocation to 
the United States. As well as being Chair 
of our Remuneration Committee, Lynn has 
served as a member of our Audit and 
Nomination Committees. I wish to thank 
her for the contribution she has made to the 
Group since the time of her appointment 
and wish her every success in her new 
role. Lynn will be succeeded as Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee by Tracey 
Graham, an experienced Chair of such 
committees, and who has served on the 
Group’s Remuneration Committee since 
February 2016.
As recently announced, I will be stepping 
down as Chairman at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting in May 2018. 
I have greatly enjoyed my time guiding the 
Group in its first years as a listed business. 
However, following my appointment as 
Chairman of Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc, 
and in the interests of good corporate 
governance, I have taken the difficult 
decision to step down from the Board of 
Ibstock plc. Following the conclusion of 
our Annual General Meeting, our Senior 
Independent Director Jonathan Nicholls, 
will be appointed Chairman of the Board. 
Tracey Graham will be appointed as the 
Senior Independent Director. In addition 
to her current role as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and Justin 
Read will be appointed Chair of the 
Audit Committee.
Shareholder returns and dividends
We paid our interim dividend on 
22 September 2017 of 2.6 pence per 
ordinary share and propose to pay a final 
dividend in respect of 2017 of 6.5 pence 
per share, making a total dividend of 
9.1 pence. The Board proposes to pay 
our final 2017 dividend payment on 8 June 
2018 to shareholders on the register on 
11 May 2018. During 2017 , we clarified our 
dividend payment policy such that our 
interim dividend equated to one-third of 
the full year dividend for the prior year. 
The Board believes that this clarification 
provides greater certainty to shareholders. 
The Board has also determined a 
supplementary dividend policy as part of 
the Group’s wider capital allocation policy. 
This is discussed in more detail within the 
Financial Review on page 40.
Colleagues
Employees are our greatest asset and the 
progress made during the year has only 
been possible due to their effort and 
dedication. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank all our employees for 
their contribution.

Taking stock 
When we listed in 2015 we 
said there were supportive 
market fundamentals and 
opportunities for Ibstock.
We have delivered. 
It has taken over £100m 
of planned investment 
in infrastructure, brand, 
innovation and people.
We’ve achieved a lot in 
three years and there’s 
more to come.
Wayne Sheppard,  
Chief Executive Officer
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 08 Ibstock plc Having announced my intention to retire in 
2018, it is with mixed emotions that I write 
my last CEO statement. I am, however, 
delighted to be able to report significant 
headway in each area of the Group’s 
strategy during 2017 , continuing the strong 
progress made since the business listed in 
October 2015.
The Group has grown revenue and 
adjusted EBITDA in both 2016 and during 
the year ended 31 December 2017 , with 
revenue growth of 4% and adjusted 
EBITDA growth of 7% in the current year.
The Group’s statutory results are 
discussed in the Financial Review on 
pages 38 to 42.
This year’s Annual Report focuses on the 
Group’s strategic progress since our listing 
and some of the individuals who have 
enabled this. Our strategic achievements 
in the areas of Health and Safety (“H&S”), 
investment and innovation are described 
below and within our Strategy section on 
pages 22 and 23. 
Succession planning has always been 
a high priority for us, including my own, 
as I will reach the age of 60 in 2019. 
Having considered the best time for my 
own succession, I advised the Board that 
ideally I would like 2018 to be my last year 
as CEO with the third anniversary of the 
IPO coming in October 2018. I am 
delighted that Joe Hudson joined Ibstock 
in early 2018 to allow a thorough handover 
of responsibilities (see inset on page 14).
Safety
A business which looks after its employees 
is a business that thrives and a key element 
is ensuring the well-being of our team. 
H&S continues to be our highest priority 
and we continually work to drive improved 
performance in this area as we have done 
for many years. Ibstock Brick was one of 
the founding members of the Ceramic 
Industry Health and Safety Pledge in 2001 
as part of an industry-wide commitment 
to engage in a process of continuous 
improvement in health and safety. 
The initiative is managed by the British 
Ceramic Confederation (BCC) and has 
won significant recognition from the 
UK Government’s Health and Safety 
Executive (HSE) and is seen as a model 
for other industries.
I am pleased to report that our revised 
measure of all lost time accidents (LTA) – 
employees and those working on our 
sites, such as contractors, reduced from 
20 to 18 during the year ended 
31 December 2017 . This 10% reduction 
marked a significant year-on-year 
improvement. This is particularly pleasing 
as the measure includes the many 
contractors on our sites engaged with the 
construction of our major projects during 
the year such as the new brick factory and 
the blue brick kiln. At times this amounted 
to several hundred additional people on 
our sites every day.
We continue to work hard in this aspect of 
our business as we strive to achieve world 
class performance and drive LTAs to zero.
Ibstock has driven the development of 
intelligent mobile plant to operate on our 
sites to protect our employees and 
visitors. These fork lift and clamp trucks 
are able to detect objects behind the 
truck when reversing and apply brakes 
automatically, thus avoiding a collision and 
making reversing operations much safer. 
As well as the increased safety of our 
employees, contractors and visitors, 
there is an added benefit to the Group 
of reduced stock damage and building 
maintenance. This technology was 
co-developed with mobile plant supplier 
partners and is now available across the 
industry as a standard option; however it 
has been mandatory for all new plant in 
Ibstock for several years.
I believe this is an example of Ibstock 
continually pushing the boundaries to 
protect our employees.
For 2017 we introduced the reporting 
of “causes for concern” (CFC) by all 
employees to identify and correct hazards 
before an accident occurs. We have 
targeted two reports per person per year 
to increase awareness in the working 
environment. During the year, over 3,500 
CFCs were reported and corrected and 
whilst increasing awareness, this initiative 
must have also reduced the potential for 
accidents to occur. I believe this is 
reflected in our 2017 LTA performance.
Invest
At the time of the Group’s initial public 
offering (IPO), we advised that we believed 
the fundamentals underpinning growth in 
our UK markets looked robust and that we 
would invest in our businesses to support 
growth and cost efficiency. We have 
subsequently invested over £100 million 
and delivered the major projects identified 
and more.
Our new roof tile line at Leighton Buzzard 
commenced commissioning in late 2016 
and has improved its performance during 
2017 . Take-up of these innovative new tiles 
has been good with the major developers 
who have appreciated this new capacity 
coming to the market at a time of need. 
We have not said much publicly about 
an investment in our Supreme Concrete 
Company to further automate the 
production of general cast concrete 
products. Our first machine to a bespoke 
design was commissioned in 2017 and 
has been very successful in increasing 
productivity, reducing manpower 
requirements and eliminating manual 
handling. We intend to invest in further 
machines over the coming years. 
Construction of our new Leicester brick 
factory is complete and we commenced 
making bricks and commissioning towards 
the end of the year. Early in 2018 the first fired 
bricks exited the kiln ready for despatch 
to customers. This has been a massive 
project to deliver and I am pleased that we 
achieved it with only one lost time accident 
over the entire two-year build programme 
involving several million man hours. 
As you will see from my remarks in the 
Business Review section (see pages 16 
and 17), the timing for our investment in 
additional brick capacity has been superb. 
We have designed an excellent range of 
bricks that we will progressively prove and 
commission the new factory as 2018 
progresses. The range has been designed 
to target imports and the factory has also 
been designed to be exceptionally flexible 
and make a very broad range of types and 
styles of brick.
We said 
We would build a strong 
business for the future.
And here is how we did 
this year.

Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Innovate
Innovation continues to be a priority 
for all businesses within the Group. 
By continually seeking to improve our 
customer service and introducing new 
products to our ranges, we can respond 
to our current customer or business 
needs, but also anticipate future trends. 
Our innovation objectives will increase the 
Group’s efficiency and continue to support 
increased profitability.
As mentioned above, two of the biggest 
innovations are supported by our major 
investments in the new SL8 and PAN8 
roof tiles and the new brick factory to 
make a range of new and exciting bricks. 
Indeed, our new brick factory includes 
some significant innovations in the clay 
brick manufacturing process, such as 
a tunnel dryer for soft mud bricks.
Glen-Gery, our US brick subsidiary, 
has developed two new ranges of 
laminate stone products to complement 
our brick ranges. These products are the 
new “StoneFit” system and “Creative 
Mines” range of laminated stone and will 
increase our offering in the residential 
cladding market. 
Supreme Concrete has developed a new 
range of fencing products allowing the 
fencing range to be repositioned at various 
price points.
The Ibstock Kevington components 
business has developed a brick clad 
underslung soffit – a brick clad 
component for non-residential buildings 
called “Nexus” that fully came to market 
in 2017 and has been received as a very 
innovative new product by architects and 
specifiers alike.
Amongst our targets for the future are to 
ensure our brick ranges continue to satisfy 
traditional RMI markets and that we develop 
new ranges to meet the more fashionable 
non-residential and developer markets.

the UK’s withdrawal from the European 
Union (“Brexit”) upon our business. The 
Group exports a very small proportion of 
its products, but where it does, mainly to 
Ireland, the devaluation of Sterling has 
made our products better value for our 
customers. Clearly the converse is true for 
imports with imported brick from northern 
Europe having become less profitable or 
competitive for the exporters which is also 
helpful to our business. However, certain 
imported raw materials, such as 
reinforcement steel, have become more 
expensive although this input cost impact 
is relatively small in scale, as we own 
our primary raw material; clay. Skilled 
employee availability, especially for skilled 
maintenance personnel is a concern. 
However, our growing apprentice 
programme helps to mitigate any potential 
adverse impact.
In March 2016, we also mentioned an 
investment at our Ravenhead wire cut 
brick factory to automate our de-hacking 
and packaging operations and this 
was commissioned on time and cost 
during 2016.
Since our IPO we announced an £8 million 
investment to replace the blue brick kiln at 
our Lodge Lane plant. This project was 
completed in 2017 and is at an advanced 
stage of commissioning with blue bricks 
being produced to meet customer demand. 
These investments are very exciting but 
Ibstock is a long-term legacy business and 
we have also continued to invest in the 
Group’s long-term future in a number 
of ways: 
We have acquired substantial additional 
clay reserves at two of our sites to support 
the continued development of the business 
and also maintained planning permission 
for an additional concrete products factory 
at one of our sites to support further 
strategic growth when required. 
To prepare for the future we have 
continued to invest in our people – good 
examples being our continuing apprentice 
programme with 34 apprentices under 
training and the roll out of training 
initiatives to our wider workforce 
amounting to over 9,000 training days 
over the year. Additionally, several senior 
appointments were made that reinforce 
the strength and depth in the Company 
teams, and the formation in 2017 of the 
Group Executive Committee (see overleaf) 
positions us well for the future.
We have commenced a project to 
implement the JD Edwards ERP system 
into Supreme Concrete. Once implemented, 
all UK businesses will be on a common IT 
platform allowing a common Customer 
Relationship Management (CRM) system 
to be implemented to support the 
extraction of further commercial synergies 
from the UK businesses in the future.
We continue to work to redeploy our 
assets by enhancing the value of our 
surplus land. These activities have resulted 
in considerable success over the past 
decade or more by improving the planning 
status of surplus land assets. Recent 
activity is likely to lead to significant 
additional cash flows and profits during 
2018 and 2019. These cash flows can 
then be deployed to the benefit of the 
Company and its shareholders.
In 2018 our investment objective is to 
deliver fully the benefits of the major 
projects undertaken to date. We expect 
significantly lower capital expenditure over 
the next two years, whilst over this time 
we will be planning and developing for the 
next potential capacity expansion and 
improvement projects.
Wayne Sheppard welcomes our 
new Chief Executive designate
 
I am delighted that Joe Hudson joined 
Ibstock in early 2018. Joe has very 
relevant experience in building materials, 
most recently with Lafarge Holcim where 
he was responsible for their UK cement, 
Bradstone paving and concrete block 
businesses. With experience of 
manufacturing with high capital cost plant 
and the sale of aesthetic masonry and 
commodity concrete building products, 
he is ideally experienced to be the next 
CEO of Ibstock plc. 
Chief Executive designate
Chief Executive’s statement continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 Ibstock plc Summary
Supported by strong market 
fundamentals, Ibstock continues to follow 
a growth strategy underpinned by organic 
growth opportunities in UK clay and 
concrete products. We continue to look for 
value-enhancing acquisitions, particularly 
those that would provide new platforms 
for growth and enhance our portfolio of 
principally residential building products. 
In the US, the brick industry continues to 
operate at low levels of capacity utilisation 
resulting in lower returns than we enjoy in 
the UK. Against this backdrop, we 
continue to consider all options and 
opportunities for our business.
We will shortly complete our CEO 
succession plan with the business in a 
good position. Profit performance and 
cash generation are strong and continue 
to improve. Debt levels are at a 1x 
adjusted EBITDA after the substantial 
investments made since our IPO – the full 
benefits of which are still to come. 
The UK pension scheme has been well 
managed and this has allowed the 
Company to enter into discussions with 
the Trustees to accelerate the de-risking 
strategy already in place. Importantly, 
we have a highly experienced Group 
Executive Committee to provide continuity, 
manage the business, provide succession 
and support my successor. 
We have a clear strategy and have 
outlined our capital allocation priorities, 
which are set out in the Financial Review. 
Given our robust balance sheet and 
strong cash generation, in the absence of 
any significant value enhancing acquisitions 
and with continuing supportive markets, 
the Board currently expects to introduce 
a supplementary dividend alongside the 
interim dividend in 2018.
Finally I should like to thank all of my 
Ibstock colleagues for their hard work and 
commitment over many years that has 
been instrumental in the Group’s strong 
performance. It has been a pleasure to 
work with them all and I will miss them 
greatly. With their undoubted continued 
support for my successor, the further 
progression of the strategy we have 
deployed and with the investments we 
have made, we have every reason to look 
to the future with confidence.

Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 15
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Business review
2017 proved to be a testing year for 
a number of reasons. 
We had reported some slowing in our 
markets in 2016 leading up to the UK’s 
European Union referendum (“Brexit”), but 
with that event behind us our UK markets 
showed good resilience in the final quarter 
of 2016. However, economists were 
generally forecasting significant adverse 
impacts on our markets for 2017 .
Despite the uncertainty arising from the 
referendum in 2016, we entered the year 
with a plan to sell slightly more than in the 
previous year – our more positive view of 
our markets supported by customer 
advice on prospective build volumes. As 
we moved into the Spring, it became clear 
that our markets had shrugged-off Brexit 
– economic forecasters had been overly 
pessimistic – and our volumes were 
progressing strongly into the new build 
sector in particular. We increased our 
production plans to maximum output from 
the already high utilisation rates to meet 
this demand. Our repair, maintenance and 
improvement (“RMI”) markets, served 
principally by Ibstock Brick and Supreme 
Concrete, remained stable. 
During the Summer months demand 
remained robust and new build products, 
such as bricks and roof tiles, moved onto 
waiting times. With demand exceeding 
supply during this period, some customers 
did not receive the volumes they wanted 
when they needed it. Consequently, I am 
very pleased that we still managed to 
record a small improvement in our overall 
Net Promoter Score this year.
Due to high demand, brick imports 
increased strongly as the year progressed, 
exceeding circa 0.31 billion bricks for 
the year across the UK market. UK 
manufacturers sold approximately 2 billion 
bricks, although circa 0.16 billion of this 
was supplied from existing stocks. In 
summary, the UK market consumed circa 
2.4 billion bricks and UK manufacturers 
manufactured less than 1.9 billion, leaving 
a deficit of circa 0.5 billion bricks that was 
filled through manufacturer destocking 
and imports.
With this market situation, Ibstock’s 
decision to build a new brick factory in 
Leicestershire providing 100 million bricks 
of additional supply to the UK market has 
proven to be a good one. The new factory 
started making bricks in December 2017 
and the first bricks from the plant were 
sold to customers during early 2018. 
As the plant is commissioned, production 
efficiency will increase during 2018, and, 
The fundamentals of a 
housing shortage and strong 
Government commitment to 
increase housebuilding remain 
robust and strongly support 
our UK businesses.
Overall Group performance
2017 presented many challenges to the 
Group; however, we performed strongly 
during the year, delivering profits and cash 
generation in line with management’s 
expectations. Group revenue increased 
by 4% to £452 million (2016: £435 million) 
and Group adjusted EBITDA increased 
by 7% to £120 million (2016: £112 million). 
A slightly weaker US performance was 
offset by a stronger performance in the 
UK, driven by improved year-on-year 
results in both clay and concrete.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 Ibstock plc as planned, we expect the plant to average 
about half capacity over the year and for 
2019 to be the first year at full output. 
Customers are pleased that this new 
capacity is coming to market particularly 
as this is soft mud product where the 
shortage of UK supply is at its most acute. 
The new factory has been designed to be 
able to manufacture bricks in a wide range 
of styles and thus meet almost all 
customer specifications. 
Increased new build housing volumes 
have also increased the demand for roof 
tiles and industry demand is often in 
excess of capacity over the course of 
a year. Ibstock’s investment in new 
additional roof tile capacity for its Forticrete 
subsidiary has proven to be timely. As 
previously reported, Forticrete’s new SL8 
and PAN8 tiles are highly innovative and 
offer improved aesthetics and reduced 
laying cost to the customer. They have 
been well received.
2017 was a commissioning year for the new 
roof tile plant and demand for these new 
products has often exceeded our growing 
capacity. Production efficiency levels 
improved as the year progressed and we 
reached expected long-term production 
targets by year end. On this basis, we 
entered 2018 with the plant performing to 
expectation and providing product into a 
market showing strong demand growth. 
We will continue to seek to optimise 
output from our roofing business as 2018 
progresses and further smaller investments 
to increase capacity, particularly for roofing 
accessories, are planned to support the 
growth of roof tile sales.
Forticrete also manufacturers reconstructed 
stone products that are sold into new build 
residential markets. Previous investments 
in walling stone at our Anstone plant and 
in cast stone at our Thornley plant have 
ensured that we have sufficient capacity 
to meet current demand. 
To meet growing new housing demand, 
our Supreme subsidiary worked hard to 
improve manufacturing efficiency in the 
production of concrete lintels and floor 
beams during the year and this supported 
good sales growth. RMI markets for 
fencing and general concrete products 
were reasonably stable and we enjoyed 
a solid year.
Supreme also installed its first new fully 
automated concrete casting machine to 
manufacture fence posts, gravel board 
and rail products. This innovation has 
taken several years to develop and bring 
to fruition; however, it offers improved 
operational efficiencies over current 
standard production methods and 
eliminates the health and safety risks 
associated with manual handling 
of product. 
Outlook for 2018 
The fundamentals of a housing shortage 
and a strong Government commitment 
to increase housebuilding volumes 
remain robust and strongly support our 
UK businesses.
During 2017 , UK brick demand exceeded 
supply, manufacturers destocked and 
import levels increased. Consequently the 
investments we have made to increase 
capacity in both brick and roof tiles have 
been well-timed and our customers value 
this additional capacity. 
In the US, our Glen-Gery brick business 
continues to hold a leading position in 
the Mid-West and North-East markets. 
Whilst brick demand in 2017 declined 
slightly in our primary markets, we believe 
that Glen-Gery with its excellent customer 
relationships, broad product range and 
reputation for quality and service is in 
a good place to benefit from any future 
improvements in the brick market. With 
a new President in place and a small but 
growing presence in the residential 
laminate stone market, we look to the 
year ahead with confidence. 
Customer demand in our UK clay and 
concrete markets remains encouraging, 
with the full benefit of the investments we 
have made still to come. While we remain 
mindful of the uncertainties of the UK 
economy we expect another year of 
progress for the Group.
For Ibstock in the UK, 2017 was a busy and 
very important year of development for the 
Group – our past decisions to invest in 
additional capacity, having recognised the 
strong fundamentals supporting UK new 
housing growth, look to have been correct 
as they enter production. We began 2018 
with new capacity at a time when it is 
clearly much needed to support strong 
market demand. 
US
Revenue in the US was down 2% (6% at 
constant exchange rates) for the full year 
compared to 2016, principally reflecting 
a more competitive new build residential 
market and a less favourable product mix.
In the second half of 2017 , forecasters 
were still expecting both residential and 
non-residential markets in the North-East 
and Mid-West to have been flat to slightly 
positive overall for the year. 
However, brick industry data for our 
primary markets actually shows that brick 
demand declined slightly across all our 
end use markets through this period. 
Our experience was one of tough markets 
in 2017. 
Specifically, residential markets were very 
competitive in the Mid-West, where we 
stood firm on our pricing with a resultant 
impact on volume. We also experienced 
a decline in the number of non-residential 
end use projects and overall we believe 
we may have lost a little share during 2017 
in this market as a result. Over recent 
years we believe our pricing has on 
average been ahead of the industry, 
reflected in the strong profit improvement 
recorded in 2016. 
Glen-Gery has worked to increase its 
relatively small exposure to the laminate 
stone and thin brick markets. During the 
year the manufactured stone product 
range was expanded with two new 
product lines and capacity to supply 
the “thin brick” market was increased. 
During 2017 management changes were 
made at senior level and a new and highly 
experienced President joined the business 
in the latter part of the year. With the 
benefits of initiatives taken in 2017 
beginning to be seen and a new President 
in post, we look to recover our market 
share position in 2018 albeit against 
challenging market conditions.

We have market-leading 
positions within each of 
our markets 
The main market drivers 
that are expected to increase 
the demand for our products: 
– UK construction output  
– UK housing starts.  
Total Great Britain construction output 
is estimated at £153.0 billion in 2017 
(a 3.0% increase compared to 2016). 
The Construction Products Association 
estimates that Great Britain construction 
output will increase marginally (by 0.2%) 
in 2018 before seeing an increase of 
1.7% in 2019 as activity picks up. It is 
apparent that the trend differs across all 
construction sectors with an increase in 
activity being particularly marked within 
the private housing sector. 
Source: Construction Products Association, 
Winter 2017 . (e = estimates, f = forecast)
Our clay and concrete products are 
integral components to construction 
activity, particularly housing construction 
and repairs, maintenance and improvement 
(“RMI”). Demand for our products is 
directly affected by developments in 
the construction markets in which we 
operate, as well as the general level of 
construction activity. 
Several macroeconomic factors influence 
the levels and growth of construction 
activity, including demographic trends, 
the state of the housing market, mortgage 
availability, mortgage interest rates, and 
changes in household income, inflation 
and Government policy.
With the largest production capabilities, 
the Group continues to hold a market-
leading position within the UK market for 
clay bricks, together with leading market 
positions in UK concrete products and in 
the US regions within which the Group 
operates. In the UK, the three largest brick 
manufacturers (Ibstock, Forterra and 
Weinerberger) accounted for approximately 
90% of brick production in 2015. Our US 
operations are regional leaders in the clay 
products markets of the North-East and 
Mid-West where a number of regional 
and national manufacturers also operate. 
Conversely, many of the UK concrete 
markets which the Group operates in 
are fragmented with many small players.
Following the UK’s Referendum on EU 
membership in June 2016, macroeconomic 
uncertainty exists although to date major 
housebuilders have continued to report 
high demand for new housing and resilient 
customer confidence.

The Company’s primary markets in the

Housing starts in Glen-Gery’s primary 
markets fell sharply (approximately 68%) 
from a peak in 2005 through to 2009. 
Residential starts then increased with 
support from improvements in the 
economy and growth in employment. 
Housing starts in Glen-Gery’s primary 
US markets are forecast to decrease by 
2.4% in 2017 and decrease by 4.1% in 
2018, whilst the US is expected to see 
residential housing starts increase by 
2.1% and by 0.4% in 2017 and 2018, 
respectively.
Non-residential square feet of 
construction in Glen-Gery’s primary 
markets are expected to be 1.1% lower 
in 2017 , with a decline of 0.6% forecast 
for 2018.
US housing starts UK housing starts
The UK housing market has been 
structurally undersupplied for a number 
of years, with housing starts below 
household formations. With an estimated 
80% of new homes using clay bricks 
within their construction, increases in new 
housing volumes directly impact the 
demand for our brick products.
Since the UK Government commissioned 
the Barker Review in 2003, which 
suggested a shortage of housing in the 
UK at that time of approximately 450,000 
houses, this undersupply has grown to 
in excess of one million homes.
The UK Government’s white paper 
“Fixing our broken housing market” in 
February 2017 reiterated the need for 
new homes in England in order to keep 
pace with population growth and to 
tackle the years of housing undersupply. 
The UK’s General Election in June 2017 
saw each of the main political parties 
reveal policies strongly supportive of 
housebuilding and subsequent 
Government policy continues to provide 
backing to housebuilding. 
The Autumn Budget 2017 announced 
measures to assist with the desire to 
increase housebuilding to 300,000 new 
homes annually, whilst new build dwelling 
starts totalled 166,100 in the year to 
September 2017 . 
UK repairs, maintenance and 
improvement (“RMI”) market, trends 
and developments
The private residential RMI sector is the 
third largest construction sector with 
output in 2017 worth approximately 
£18.3 billion, a growth of 2.0% on the prior 
year. Activity in the RMI sector is closely 
correlated with the level of property 
transactions (with individuals renovating 
homes prior to a sale, or modifying them 
after purchase). This generally leads to 
stable activity levels and RMI output is 
forecast to reduce marginally (by 1.0%) 
in 2018 (Source: Construction Products 
Association). This reduction forecast is 
linked to subdued second-hand housing 
transaction levels in 2018, and follows the 
sustained demand seen in 2017 from the 
older demographic who are less 
dependent on real wage growth.

How we  
create value
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 20 Ibstock plc How we create value
The Directors believe that the Group’s 
market-leading businesses place it in 
a strong position to benefit from the 
expected demand growth in the UK 
and in its regional markets in the US.
Extraction
Clay and shale used in our brick 
production process is sourced from clay 
pits that the Group operates on land 
that it owns or leases under long-term 
agreements in the vicinity of its brick 
manufacturing plants in the UK and the 
US providing security of supply of the key 
raw material used in brick manufacture.
Procurement
The Group is a major customer for a 
number of its key third party suppliers, 
which allows efficient purchasing and 
transportation, together with the 
establishment of long-term relationships. 
Additionally, for the Group’s concrete 
products, the main raw materials are bulky 
in nature and are locally sourced. Natural 
gas and electricity costs represent the 
greatest input costs apart from labour. 
The Group regularly reviews its energy 
costs and uses forward purchasing 
contracts to increase pricing certainty 
when favourable compared to future price 
expectations in the open market.
Product design
The Group continually seeks to improve 
the quality of its existing products and also 
introduce new products through innovation 
and investment in new technology. Its new 
product development programme works 
closely with customers and our sales team 
to identify opportunities for new products.
Manufacturing process
The Group has the largest brick production 
capacity in the UK and has a strategic 
footprint across the UK and in the US 
markets in which it operates. We also have 
the most modern and innovative concrete 
roof tile line in the UK and our concrete 
fence post manufacturing facilities provide 
us with a market-leading position. 
The Group manufactures bricks through 
two main processes: wire cut and soft 
mud, which take their names from the 
processes to create them. With wire cut 
bricks, clay is continuously extruded to a 
required size and shape, before cutting by 
wire into individual bricks. These are then 
dried before firing in a kiln. Soft mud bricks 
are made by placing a mix of clay and 
water into individual moulds to create a 
brick shape, which is dried and then fired 
in a kiln after ejection from the mould.
The Group’s concrete products are made 
from cement, sand, admixtures and 
pigments, which are mixed together. In 
the case of a roof tile, the mix is extruded 
onto moving pallets and then cut to form 
individual tiles. The cut tiles are cured in 
chambers, finish coated and dried. The 
‘grey’ concrete products, such as fence 
posts, are made using a semi-dry or wet 
cast process. The concrete is discharged 
from a machine hopper into a mould 
containing steel reinforcement bars with 
high frequency vibration used to compact 
the mixture and then demoulded by 
turning over the moulds before curing. 
Technical support
The Group seeks to differentiate itself as a 
manufacturer by employing five architects 
and a Computer Aided Design office to 
assist specifiers and customers in their 
designs and efficient use of our products.
Customer service
Ibstock sells its products to a diverse 
group of customers in the construction 
industry in the UK and US. Each business 
has its own sales team that is aligned by 
customer group and region in order to 
focus on key decision-makers and 
customers. This is monitored through 
extensive and regular customer 
satisfaction surveys.
Distribution
The Group’s 43 principal manufacturing 
plants across the UK and US are 
strategically located close to main 
transportation links to facilitate onward 
distribution. In the UK, the Group 
outsources substantially all its haulage to 
two contractors. In the US, a relatively large 
proportion of sales are direct collections by 
the end-customer. Additionally, in the US, 
the Group operates a network of 10 resale 
centres across its primary markets. 
Our key differentiators
Market leadership
Our market-leading businesses enable 
us to benefit from the expected growth 
in demand in the UK and our regional 
markets within the US.
Scale
We have over 150 million tonnes of 
consented clay reserves and in excess 
of 100 million tonnes of clay resources, 
providing good support for production 
capacity of 1.2 billion bricks per annum 
across 28 clay and 15 concrete plants 
throughout the UK and US.
Long-standing customer relationships
Our customer focus is based on quality, 
service and consistency and our service-
led ethos is one of the key drivers in the 
growth in our market share in bricks 
over the past 10 years and many of our 
long-standing customer relationships have 
lasted over 40 years.
Growing capacity
We are investing in the latest technology to 
increase capacity and to meet the growing 
market demands.
Highly experienced management team
Our management team has extensive 
experience in the building products market 
and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer have combined experience 
of over 50 years within the industry.
Outputs
Shareholders
The Directors recognise the importance 
of rewarding our shareholders for their 
continued investment in the future of the 
Group. We view the risks to our dividend 
as intrinsically linked to the principal risks 
and uncertainties noted on pages 34 to 
37 , primarily those impacting the wider 
macroeconomic environment and the 
cyclical nature of the industry for building 
products. It is our objective to set out a 
clear dividend policy to enable stakeholders 
to assess both the case for investment 
and stewardship in holding the Board to 
account. Our dividend policy is set out 
within the Financial Review on page 40.
Employees
The Group employs a large number of 
people across its operations and as 
described in the Resources and 
relationships section on pages 26 to 31, 
the development and progression of our 
employees is seen as key to the Group’s 
long-term success. Alongside the Group’s 
strategic priority of providing a safe working 
environment, the Directors believe that the 
employee share ownership encouraged 
by the Share Incentive and Save As You

strong corporate governance, are further

Customers
Builders’ merchants, housebuilders, 
specialist brick distributors, contractors 
and installers are the five main customer 
groups for the Group’s clay and concrete 
products in the UK. In the US, clay products 
sold to distributors constituted the majority 
of sales for the year, with the remainder 
sold to housebuilders, contractors and 
developers. These customers are not 
always the same as the individuals and 
organisations that are making the buying 
decisions for the Group’s products. In many 
cases, the preference of the end users or 
their specifier dictates the choice of product 
rather than the intermediary that actually 
purchases the product from the Group. 
The unrivalled choice of products available 
within the Group’s range of clay bricks 
provides these customers with the widest 
selection from which to choose. As a 
full-range supplier, our concrete businesses 
provide customers with broad product set 
upon which to base their buying decisions. 
Communities
The Group interacts directly with the 
communities within which we operate. 
In addition to the employment provided by, 
and taxation contributed by, the Group, 
our Resources and relationships section 
on pages 26 to 31, together with the 
Group’s Environmental Report, set out a 
number of examples of this interaction as 
the Group aims to be a “good neighbour” 
and contribute to those communities. 
Ibstock is a proud member of “Business 
in the Community”.

What we achieved in 2017
Coinciding with European Week of 
Safety and Health at Work 2017 , we 
re-launched the Group’s 12 fundamental 
pillars to Health and Safety across each 
of our subsidiaries.
The Group is well-known for its long-
standing commitment to Health and 
Safety (“H&S”) and innovations such as 
the reverse-braking technology used 
on our mobile plant have helped to 
reinforce this commitment. 
Nine Ibstock Brick projects were 
recognised for their commitment to 
Health and Safety at the British Ceramic 
Confederation’s Pledge awards in 
October 2017.
This continued commitment has seen 
the key Lost Time Accidents metric 
reduce to 18 in 2017 .
What we achieved in 2017
2017 saw the commencement of 
commissioning of the Major Capital 
Expenditure Projects across our UK clay 
brick operations with the new soft mud 
factory in Leicestershire and new kiln 
facilities at the Lodge Lane factory in 
Staffordshire. Additionally, production 
ramped up following the installation of 
a new bespoke machine at our Barnwell 
concrete factory in Cambridgeshire.
The successful completion of these 
Major Capital Projects continues the 
Group’s strong track record of investing 
in order to improve efficiency and meet 
increasing demand. 
What we achieved in 2017
We successfully launched our new 
PAN8
®
 roof tile to the UK market – the 
second tile profile to be made on our 
new roofing tile line in Leighton Buzzard, 
Bedfordshire.
Forticrete also launched the revolutionary 
Low Pitch Roof Window System, which 
allows the installation of a roof window at 
angles as low as 10°. This is lower than 
the minimum pitch of many traditional 
roof window systems and maximises the 
distance that properties can be extended 
with the benefit of natural daylight.
Ibstock Kevington introduced Nexus
®
 – 
our next generation brick-faced support 
system. The new system combines a 
specially developed lightweight brick-
faced steel unit with a support system 
and offers easier handling coupled with 
maximum adjustability, both vertically 
and horizontally, for quick and simple 
alignment on site.
Our objectives for 2018
Establish a five-year H&S strategy that 
focuses on developing a world class 
culture and performance through the 
continuous improvement of engineering 
excellence, management systems and 
the adoption of a behavioural safety 
programme. We will take the opportunity 
to further develop our emphasis on 
people by including a clearly defined 
health and wellbeing programme.
Our objectives for 2018
The focus for 2018 will be on delivering 
the benefits of the Group’s new 
investments in order to achieve all 
of the efficiencies desired. 
During 2018, management will 
continue to appraise other investment 
opportunities across the Group to

Our employees
Health and Safety
The Group, as with many manufacturing 
businesses, faces the risk that an 
employee may be injured whilst engaged 
in work activities. The most common 
injuries within our business arise from slips 
and trips, contact with moving machinery 
and manual handling injuries. As such, it is 
a strategic priority to focus on Health and 
Safety (“H&S”) in the workplace, and is at 
the core of our operations. 
The Group employs over 2,800 people 
across the UK and US and it is the 
Group’s objective to provide a healthy 
and safe working environment for all our 
employees and the contractors at Ibstock 
sites. See also our Strategy on pages 22 
and 23, and risk number 3 within our 
principal risks and uncertainties on 
page 35.
As a large employer in both the EU and 
the US, the Group must comply with all 
relevant national and local regulatory 
requirements. These combined with 
industry specific codes of practice and 
guidelines establish minimum health 
and safety requirements, and under such 
laws and regulations, employers typically 
must establish the conditions and the 
management of work in a manner that 
effectively prevents or adequately controls 
hazards within the work environment. 
These documents are used to help define 
Group policies and procedures for all 
employees. These are set out in the 
Ibstock Health and Safety Policy Manual. 
The Group has training programmes 
in place to ensure all employees are 
competent to carry out their duties and 
an auditing protocol is in place to ensure 
policies and procedures are effective 
and adhered to. A dedicated team of 
Health and Safety professionals support 
the operational employees in all aspects 
of Health and Safety management 
and leadership.

Gender split across 
the Group
To mark the European Week for Safety 
and Health at Work, we launched a series 
of new videos to remind employees about 
the importance of Health and Safety in the 
work place. The videos cover employees 
at each of our individual businesses as 
well as contractors, and are based around 
The 12 Fundamentals – the main points on 
which the organisation’s Health and Safety 
policies are built. They are aimed at 
promoting a culture of Health and Safety 
awareness amongst employees and 
highlights how best practice can keep 
staff safe.
It is the Group’s objective to achieve zero 
injuries and we continue to reduce the 
number of lost time accidents incurred 
each year. We are happy to report a 
reduction in the current year with 18 LTAs 
in the year ended 31 December 2017 . This 
represents a fall of 10% year-on-year. The 
Board continues to regularly monitor the 
Group’s performance against our Lost 
Time Accidents KPI, and this focus 
continues to play a part in reducing this 
KPI measure over recent years. In 2017 , 
the KPI was amended to ensure the 
inclusion of LTAs of both company 
employees and contractors. This 
incremental focus has been given to 
ensure that the safety of the significant 
number of contractors working at the 
Group’s operations is considered equally 
within our key safety metric. 
2015 2016 2017

In addition to continuing our long-term 
focus on the improvement in LTA 
performance, 2018 will also see the 
definition and commencement of our new 
five-year Health and Safety strategy and 
the health and wellbeing programme, 
as outlined in our Strategy section on 
page 23.
Equality and diversity
We recognise the unique contribution of 
each and every person that we employ 
and aspire to provide a harmonious 
working environment where everyone can 
grow their skills and thrive together and 
share in our success. The Group’s diversity 
policy guides us to ensure that all job 
applicants, employees and other workers 
(such as agency staff and consultants) are 
treated with dignity and respect regardless 
of any personal characteristics. 
The Group is an equal opportunities 
employer. The Group considers 
applications for employment from disabled 
persons (having regard to their particular 
aptitudes and abilities) and encourages 
and assists, whenever practicable, the 
recruitment, training, career development 
and promotion of disabled people and the 
retention of, and appropriate training for, 
those who become disabled during their 
employment. 
Where an employee becomes disabled, 
all efforts are made to try to ensure the 
employee can continue in their current 
role. However if, due to the specific 
circumstances, this is not possible, every 
effort will be made to provide retraining for 
alternative employment within the Group 
or elsewhere. 
The Company remains supportive of 
the employment and advancement 
of disabled persons and ensures its 
promotion and recruitment practices 
are fair and objective. The Company 
encourages the continuous development 
and training of its employees and the 
provision of equal opportunities for 
the training and career development 
of all employees.
We are committed to identifying and 
eliminating discriminatory practices, 
procedures and attitudes and we expect 
all employees, officers, consultants, 
contractors, casual workers and agency 
workers to support our commitment and 
assist in all possible ways to prevent 
discrimination.
As a building products manufacturer, 
Ibstock has traditionally attracted a very 
high proportion of male employees, 
especially within factory-based production 
roles. Office-based support roles have 
a more even split of male and female 
employees, including high representation 
of women in customer support roles. 
The Group acknowledges the aims, 
objectives and recommendations outlined 
in the Hampton-Alexander Review which 
is focused on ensuring talented women 
succeed by removing barriers to their 
success, and continuing to drive forward 
the momentum of the Davies Review – 
“Women on Boards”. 
We are aware of the need to achieve an 
appropriate balance of women on our 
Board and in senior positions throughout 
the Group. However, we do not consider 
that it is in the best interests of the 
Company, or its shareholders, to set 
prescriptive targets for gender and we will 
continue to make appointments based on 
merit, against objective criteria to ensure 
we appoint the most suitable person for 
each role. 
We are working hard to encourage more 
females into the business. Our current 
employee population reflects the 
traditional nature of the industry, with 
around 85% of roles being occupied 
by men, including a high percentage of 
males employed in factory-based 
production roles. 
Our employee population is therefore 
reflective of the manufacturing sector as 
a whole, and especially within building 
products manufacturing where men have 
traditionally performed factory-based 
production roles.

However, all employees will eventually 
retire, and over the last 20 years the Group 
has run a highly successful apprenticeship 
programme. Since 2012 we have 
enhanced this programme through central 
co-ordination and standardisation to 
ensure all apprentices are trained to a 
consistent standard, including specific 
sign off within the organisation over and 
above that of the training provider. 
Our apprenticeship scheme ensures that 
we mitigate the risk of an ageing workforce 
and harness the skills and experience of 
these people so that when they retire their 
replacement is fully trained and competent 
to take over their role.
Currently, we have 34 members of our 
apprenticeship scheme, completing 
technical, mechanical or electrical 
apprenticeships and in a male-dominated 
environment; we were pleased to have 
recently recruited our first female 
apprentice, who will commence her 
apprenticeship in September 2018. 
Our objectives for 2018 include finalising 
the feasibility assessment of expanding 
our offering to an Operators’ 
apprenticeship which will be based 
upon the Sciences Manufacturing 
Process Operative Standard. 
Employee engagement
Delighted customers can only be delivered 
through highly competent, engaged and 
diligent people. The day-to-day 
relationships with our customers are 
central to our success and have often 
been built through personal relationships 
going back many years. To mitigate the 
risk of disappointing our customers, we 
are proud that our employee retention 
levels are high. In 2017 , our employee 
retention rate was 88% and, when 
combined with our service profile, 
demonstrates a sustainable organisation 
where people feel valued and advocate 
us as being a great employer.
A variety of methods are used to engage 
with employees, including factory and 
team meetings; departmental briefings; 
and in-house publications. The Group will 
use one or more of these channels to brief 
employees on the Group’s performance 
and the financial and economic factors 
affecting the Group’s performance. In 
particular, the Group operated a Save As 
You Earn (“SAYE”) share scheme in 
2015/16 and has announced a new 
scheme for 2018 at the maximum 
allowable discount of 20%. The scheme 
is open to eligible employees, who are 
encouraged to save a fixed monthly sum 
for a period of three years. There has been 
a high level of participation in the 2015/16 
scheme from Ibstock employees and we 
Our gender diversity performance is 
displayed in the charts on page 27 and in 
the year we redoubled our efforts in this 
area with the formation of a Groupwide 
‘Women in business’ forum promoting 
greater engagement from our female 
leadership and talent pipeline. This internal 
network is intended to ensure women 
across our companies feel supported in 
achieving their career aspirations, through 
peer support and focused coaching, as 
appropriate.
The Group is pleased to comply with new 
gender pay gap regulations and we 
believe firmly in providing equal 
opportunities regardless of gender or 
ethnicity. The results of our gender pay 
gap for the two impacted UK subsidiaries 
are noted below. 
Gender pay gap
Difference in mean 
pay between men 
and women
Ibstock Brick 7%
Forticrete 21%
We view the gender pay gap data as a 
valuable tool to help understand why our 
own business and our industry are 
missing out on female talent. We are 
proud of the steps we have already taken, 
and continue to take, to encourage more 
females into our business. The above 
table demonstrates that there is variation 
across the Group and we believe further 
continued action needs to be taken to 
increase the representation of women 
within our production facilities, which offer 
diverse roles suitable for all. We see 
gender pay gap reporting as a critical step 
in our drive to attract, retain and develop 
a diverse workforce across the Group.
Training and apprenticeships
Our people lie at the heart of the Group’s 
operations and as such we are committed 
to developing an environment where every 
employee can thrive and give their very 
best each and every day. Our continual 
investment in their training and 
development contributes to a highly 
engaged workforce with the skills and 
experience necessary to deliver the 
Group’s business objectives both now and 
into the future. In 2017 , over 9,000 days of 
training were provided to the Group’s 
employees and we deliver a comprehensive 
development programme covering a 
range of topics from operational skills 
improvement through to modular and 
structured Leadership Programmes to 
support our succession plans. We pride 
ourselves on developing our people and 
around 20% of roles were filled by internal 
applicants ensuring our people are able to 
fulfil their career aspirations and we retain 
their in-depth skills and knowledge of our 
customers and operations, which is one of 
the key reasons for our continued success.

It’s all about  
the people
This year’s award went to Ben Lumsden, 
3rd Year Dual Skilling Engineering 
Apprentice at Throckley Factory.
Ben has taken on two apprenticeships 
in a condensed timeframe and he has 
shown exceptional academic achievements 
so far, which he should be very proud of. 
He clearly enjoys being on the 
apprenticeship scheme and has 
demonstrated this recently by becoming 
an employee representative for the 
apprentices at EEF and also an Apprentice 
Ambassador for Ibstock Brick.
We are sure that Ben will embrace the 
opportunity given to him, and progress 
his exceptional study work into practical 
development at Throckley and the Ibstock

Gaynor Richards 
Personal Assistant to the CEO and CFO, Ibstock plc
Having joined the business in 1984 
Gaynor has witnessed many milestones in 
Ibstock over the last 30 years including the 
acquisitions of Supreme, Forticrete and 
Anderton, and more recently the plc 
floatation in 2015.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 28 Ibstock plc are hopeful this will be replicated in the 
2018 scheme as we encourage employee 
membership so that they can share in the 
Group’s success. 
Ibstock Brick, the largest operating 
company within the Group, has run 
employee opinion surveys for the last 19 
years and this has been extended across 
the wider Group during 2017 . The new 
questionnaire is based upon the four 
enablers of engagement (leadership, 
engaged managers, employee voice and 
integrity). Consistently our response rates 
have been in excess of 80% and allow 
us to identify specific improvement areas 
and formulate action plans to consistently 
improve employee engagement. 
In extending the survey, it was 
comprehensively revised to ensure that we 
fully capture the true drivers of employee 
engagement and ensure that we continue 
to deliver for our customers. Despite the 
positive overall outcomes, which were in 
line with external industry benchmarks, 
the Group recognises the vital importance 
of employee engagement. As such, each 
department has been tasked with 
preparing an action plan to address any 
concerns specific to its employees. We 
recognise that to remain a great employer 
we must never be complacent and are 
totally committed to listening to our 
employees ideas and opinions.
Innovation
In addition to the Group’s tangible assets, 
such as our reserves and resources and 
property, plant and equipment, our strong 
brand names and customer base are 
recognised as intangible assets within the 
Group balance sheet. This recognition has 
arisen as a result of the acquisition of the 
trading businesses in February 2015 and 
demonstrates the value attributed to the 
strong reputations of the Group’s 
businesses. Certain other intangibles are 
not recognised within the financial 
statements, including the employees (see 
above section on Company employees) 
and the Group’s strong market position 
(see Our markets section on page 18 
and 19). 
The Group continually seeks to improve 
the quality of its existing products and 
processes, as well as to introduce new 
products through innovation and 
investments in new technology. This 
innovation reduces the risk that we are 
unable to respond to our current customer 
or business needs, but also helps us to 
anticipate future trends. 
The Group’s innovation efforts are 
pursued at each of the Group’s four 
primary operating businesses. In 2017 , 
within Ibstock Brick we added 16 new 
bricks to our range resulting in sales of 
over five million bricks. In particular, the 
introduction of the “Collington blend” 
brick at our Ashdown factory sold over 
1.3 million bricks with the product addition 
contributing to the factory’s profitability. 
Our UK brick range is already the most 
extensive in the market and our innovative 
focus to expand the colour, size and 
texture options available, as well as 
entering new markets, continues to ensure 
that our range remains market leading. 
Further examples of innovative products 
and concepts developed during 2017 
include: the Glen-Gery “StoneFit” laminate 
stone products – an innovative stone 
cladding solution that uses patented 
interlocking panels; and Supreme 
Concrete’s “Padstones” – an accessory 
to compliment the existing lintel range, 
which offers strength and value for money.
Furthermore, at Group level, innovation 
is pursued through collaborative projects 
among the businesses. The Group has 
a strong track record of award-winning 
products, including:
 – Brick Development Association (“BDA”) 
Awards – Ibstock Brick has a long track 
record of award wins having been in 
more than half of the award winning 
categories and multiple “supreme” 
award winners. In 2017 , this includes 
supplying bricks to the Supreme Award 
winner, South Gardens, which also won 
the Large Housing Development Award. 
Our bricks were also used in five other 
category-winning projects as well as 
receiving three commendations from 
the expert judging panel;
 – Ibstock Brick was recognised for its 
marketing support at the recent Jewson 
supplier awards being awarded with the 
Juice Award for Best Marketing Support 
in December 2017 (see case study); 
 – Brick in Architecture Awards – Glen-
Gery has won numerous awards across 
a broad range of categories in the last 
five years; and
 – Ibstock Brick best service provider 
(manufacturing) of the year to Barratt 
Homes for 2016.
Responsible business
As the laws governing business dealings 
become ever more complex we need 
to ensure the judgements and decisions 
we make are taken with both the 
knowledge and application of the highest 
ethical principles. Following our listing, 
we updated and re-issued our Code of 
Business Conduct and Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption policies to continue to 
ensure that we operate in an open, 
fair and honest manner in all of our 
business dealings. We have also 
implemented our Trade Associations 
Policy to help support employees in 
their dealings with fellow employees, 
customers, suppliers, regulators and 
colleagues in competing businesses.

are upheld throughout our various 
supply chains. 
Anti-corruption and bribery
We devised our Anti-bribery and 
Corruption Policy to help support 
employees in making all those business 
decisions faced – be it with fellow 
employees, customers, suppliers, 
regulators and within the communities we 
work next to. We believe that these sound 
ethical principles help us all to act with 
honesty and integrity at all times. We 
believe it also means looking after the best 
interests of the Group. 
Our Group Code of Conduct, together 
with our Supplier Code of Business 
Conduct, set out the behaviours expected 
of our staff and third parties we do 
business with. Also, to help us encourage 
the highest standards of ethical behaviour, 
corporate governance and accountability 
in our business activities, the Group 
operates an anonymous Whistleblowing 
hotline, which is available 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week. A summary of 
whistleblowing activity, together with 
details of related investigations, is provided 
to the Board on a regular basis. 
Social matters
The Group’s main impact on society is 
the provision of employment and training 
across the wide geographies we 
operate within, and our practices in 
relation to our employees and apprentices, 
as discussed above. 
We believe that these sound, ethical 
principles will help us to act at all times 
with honesty and integrity, constantly 
striving to operate in the best interests of 
our business. This will help ensure that 
Ibstock continues to maintain and 
enhance its excellent reputation as a 
Group that everyone can trust and wants 
to do business with.
Building on these compliance policies, 
2017 saw the first year of the Group’s new 
online compliance training. This web-
based compliance training was completed 
by 100% of the UK employees surveyed 
with the US exercise currently ongoing. 
The training covers a wide range of the 
Group’s policies and codes of practice, 
including Anti-Bribery, conflicts of interest, 
business ethics and diversity. 
In 2017 , our tax strategy was disclosed 
on the Group’s website (http://www.
ibstockplc.com/~/media/Files/I/Ibstock/
documents/tax-strategy-fy17 .pdf). This 
formalises the Group’s approach to 
conducting its tax affairs and managing 
our tax risks. Our vision for tax is to be a 
responsible corporate citizen, contributing 
the right amount of tax to society at the 
right time and in the right tax jurisdiction 
whilst maintaining our integrity and 
corporate reputation and continuing to 
deliver value for our shareholders. In this 
statement, we set out our strategy for 
conducting our tax affairs and managing 
tax risks.
In preparation for the new Criminal 
Finance Act legislation, the Group 
undertook a risk assessment exercise 
facilitated by the outsourced Internal 
Auditor. This reaffirmed the relatively low 
risk across the Group due to the limited 
international scope of our operations and 
blue chip nature of our major customers 
and suppliers. 
Respect for human rights
The Group is aware of its obligations 
under the Human Rights Act and seeks 
to act accordingly in all aspects of its 
operations. Modern slavery is an 
international crime and we are committed 
to taking all necessary steps to prevent 
modern slavery within our business and 
also within our supply chains. During the 
year, the Group’s Modern Slavery 
Statement was published in accordance 
with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and 
publicly summarising the principals of the 
Group’s Modern Slavery policy (see http://
www.ibstockplc.com/~/media/Files/I/
Ibstock/investor-docs/results-and-
presentations/ibstock-modern-slavery-
statement.pdf).
The Group is proud of its long history of 
being part of the local communities in 
which it operates. Each of the companies 
within the Ibstock family provides financial 
support, and is actively engaged in, these 
communities. This involvement ranges 
from financial support for community 
projects to stakeholder engagement 
relating to quarry extensions. Some 
examples of our involvement are included 
within our Environmental Report. This sets 
out several case studies from across the 
Group illustrating how we have engaged 
with local communities. 
Ibstock became a member of “Business 
in the Community” (“BITC”) in 2016 and 
during the year ended 31 December 2017 
our involvement has stepped up. The 
Group has undertaken visits alongside 
BITC staff to assess employment 
opportunities within communities identified 
by them, and we plan to progress this 
further during 2018. 
Our societal influence also encompasses 
our products’ impact on the built 
environment and the aesthetics of our 
building products are carefully considered 
during the design phase and through our 
close working relationships with architects 
and other customers through the planning 
process. Our products are subject to testing 
by our Group technical department and 
we perform quality audits through the year 
aimed at ensuring high standards across 
our factory locations are maintained. 
Our wider social policies are not 
discussed due to their immateriality.
Environmental matters
The Group, like any successful business, 
must be conscious of the impact its 
operations have on the environment. 
As a manufacturer, the Group’s impact 
can be significant.
Our products make use of a variety of 
raw materials, some of which require 
extraction. Where the Group undertakes 
its own extraction, we are subject to 
restoration obligations that may involve the 
reinstatement of quarries following our 
use. We monitor such obligations carefully 
and work with local authorities and 
communities to ensure quarry 
reinstatement is carried out most 
effectively. We are subject to laws and 
regulations in the UK and the US 
governing the protection of the 
environment and natural resources. 
Resources and relationships continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 30 Ibstock plc We are bound by rules, which include 
those governing air emissions; water 
discharges; the use of solid and 
hazardous materials and wastes; and the 
investigation, remediation and monitoring 
of contamination. Our policies in each of 
these areas ensure compliance with the 
relevant legislation, and adherence to our 
set policies is monitored regularly by both 
our internal and external third party 
environmental audit team.
By recognising our responsibilities as a 
manufacturer to reduce the environmental 
impact of our operations, we are 
committed to introducing environmental 
management systems and all of our UK 
businesses are now accredited with ISO 
14001 – the International Environmental 
Management standard. Our US business 
has an established Environmental 
Management System, which incorporates 
energy management. In addition to this, 
we continue to invest in energy efficiency, 
CO
2
 reduction, the generation of electricity 
from landfill gas and the recycling of raw 
materials, such as process water, to 
minimise waste and cost.
Ibstock Brick is also accredited with 
ISO 50001 – the International Energy 
Management standard (EMS), which 
provides a framework of requirements for 
organisations to continually improve and 
integrate energy management into their 
overall efforts to improve environmental 
management. All of our UK businesses 
are fully complaint with the Energy 
Saving Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) and 
have had relevant energy assessments 
carried out in order to identify areas for 
energy savings.

for the US subsidiary entity’s locations and immaterial 
UK subsidiaries. UK Government conversion factors 
and EUETS verified emissions have been used.
Emission sources falling outside the Group’s 
operational control and other Scope 3 emissions have 
not been collated and reported. 
The Group has used CO
2
 per tonne of production as 
its intensity ratio as this is the most appropriate and 
relevant factor associated with our activities and should 
provide an appropriate basis on which to compare 
trends over time.
The strategic location of the Group’s 
manufacturing plants with a wide spread 
of factory locations across the UK and our 
regions in the US; enable us to minimise 
the transport distances of products from 
leaving our premises to reaching the 
customer. This assists in reducing the 
environmental impact of transporting 
our products. In the UK, the Group 
predominantly outsources its haulage 
to two contractors who, as significant 
companies in their own right, maintain 
high standards of road safety and strive to 
minimise their own environmental impact. 
From a wider sourcing perspective, all UK 
businesses comply with BES 6001 – the 
Framework Standard for Responsible 
Sourcing. Our responsible sourcing of 
construction products is demonstrated 
through our ethos of supply chain 
management and product stewardship. 
This encompasses social, economic and 
environmental dimensions. 
In addition to the Greenhouse Gas 
emission figures, set out in the table 
above, the Group also utilises a number 
of other key measures in assessing the 
effectiveness of its environmental policies. 
These are set out within our Environmental 
Report, which the Group issued most 
recently in May 2017 . 
Water is essential in our manufacturing 
processes and we are committed to 
reducing our dependence on our use of 
mains water, which has a higher carbon 
footprint than non-mains water. We 
carefully monitor the usage of water by 
source and report our performance in this 
area within our Environmental Report.
Landfill is a finite resource and becoming 
increasingly scarce. As a Group, our 
objective is to move towards “Zero waste 
to landfill” and we follow an established 
hierarchy for waste management, 
monitoring the amount of waste to 
landfill per tonne of production. 
Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 31
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information The Board is responsible for 
determining the nature and 
extent of the principal risks it 
is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives.
The Board is assisted in discharging this 
responsibility through its Audit Committee, 
whose role includes review of the Group’s 
internal control and risk management 
system. The report of the Audit Committee 
can be found on pages 59 to 64, whilst 
details of the Group’s system of internal 
controls can be found in the Corporate 
Governance statement on page 57 .
The principal risks are broadly categorised 
as strategic, operational or financial in 
nature. Strategic risks arise from decisions 
taken by the Board and management 
concerning the Group’s strategy and 
concern the positioning of the Group 
within the building products market. 
Operational risks result from the failure of 
internal processes and controls or external 
events. Financial risks arise from 
movements within the financial markets in 
which the Group operates or the inefficient 
utilisation of the Group’s capital resources. 
The risks discussed below, separately 
or in combination, could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business 
model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity.
The principal risks are set out together with:
 – A description of the risk and its 
potential impact;
 – Examples of current controls and 
mitigation the Group has in place;
 – An indication of direction of travel of the 
risk exposure; and
 – An indication of the link to the Group’s 
strategy, as set out on pages 22 and 23.

Principal risks and uncertainties Managing risk
The Group uses a heatmap to 
provide a visual, holistic view of the 
risk environment and assist in the 
management of risks.
The heatmap illustrates the Directors’ 
assessment of the gross risk together 
with the residual risk following mitigation 
and reduction of the risk through the 
internal control actions established by 
the Group.
Risk management 
framework
To effectively manage risk, operational 
level controls are embedded across 
the Group and form a key part of day 
to day processes.
During 2017 , a key component of the 
Directors’ assessment of the risk was 
management’s review of the risk 
matrices prepared by each subsidiary 
entity. Following the formation of the 
Group Executive Committee, this body 
will perform a further review role in 2018 
and beyond.
The Board maintained its ultimate 
responsibility for the Group’s control 
monitoring and provided direction to 
management in its assessment of 
Group‑wide risk.

Principal risks
The UK Referendum on EU membership 
in June 2016 introduced a degree of 
uncertainty and may give rise to longer‑ term macroeconomic changes which as 
outlined in Risk 1, below, could reduce 
demand for the Group’s products. 
The potential impacts of ‘Brexit’ could be 
more pervasive and impact several of the 
principal risks identified by the Group and 
so, shortly after the UK Referendum result 
was announced, a Brexit Committee was 
established. As part of this Committee’s 
remit, contingency plans were developed 
to mitigate risks arising from the interaction 
of Brexit and our Principal risks.
1 Economic conditions 
 
 
The Group’s business could be materially 
impacted by changes in the macroeconomic 
environment in the UK and the US. Specifically, 
demand for the Group’s products is strongly 
correlated with residential construction and 
renovation activities and non‑ residential 
construction, together with the supply chain’s 
attitude to stock levels, which are cyclical.
Strategy link 
Invest 
Innovate
2 Government action and policy
 
 
The Group has an exposure to both UK 
and US political developments. Significant 
reductions in Government spending, or 
changes in Government policy, could have 
a material effect on demand for the Group’s 
products – reducing sales and affecting the 
Group’s financial results.
Strategy link 
Invest 
Innovate
Mitigation 
The Group analyses construction statistics for 
the past five years and, using independent 
forecasts of construction statistics, forecasts 
future demand with the aim of anticipating 
market movements. 
The Group has historically flexed capacity and 
its cost base where possible during economic 
downturns to allow more of the Group’s 
manufacturing plants to remain open and 
viable, maintaining skills, development and 
training. The Group believes that this has 
maintained employee morale and high levels of 
customer service through the last economic 
downturn. It also allows the Group to respond 
more rapidly to increases in demand and keep 
customers satisfied.
The Group’s repair, maintenance and 
improvement (“RMI”) and specification product 
ranges diversify end‑ use exposure and provide 
greater resilience in light of changing market 
demand in any of its end‑ use markets.
Mitigation 
The Group analyses construction statistics for 
the past five years and, using independent 
forecasts of construction statistics, forecasts 
future demand with the aim of anticipating 
market movements.
In the UK, the major political parties each 
included favourable housing policies within 
their 2017 General Election manifestos. This 
positive policy environment has been further 
supported by announcements following the 
election – namely, the £15.3 billion new 
financial support for house building over the 
next five years; the abolition of stamp duty on 
homes under £300,000 for first time buyers; 
and £34 million government investment in 
teaching construction skills such as bricklaying 
– all announced in the Autumn Statement 
2017 . These measures, in addition to the 
existing National Planning Policy Framework 
(“NPPF”) and Help to Buy scheme, show the 
Government’s ongoing commitment to house 
building. However, the Group recognises the 
risk which can result from political changes or 
economic uncertainty.
RMI and new housing demands are, to a 
certain extent, counter‑ cyclical to each other, 
providing some balance to the portfolio of 
offerings for the Group.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 34 Ibstock plc
Principal risks and uncertainties continued 3 Government regulation and 
standards relating to the 
manufacture and use of building 
products
The Group’s production, manufacturing 
and distribution activities are subject to health 
and safety risks. The Group is subject to 
environmental, health and safety laws and 
regulations and these may change. These laws 
and regulations could cause the Group to 
make modifications to how it manufactures 
and prices its products. They could also 
require the Group to make significant capital 
investments or otherwise increase its costs or 
this could result in liabilities.
Failure of the Group to comply with the relevant 
regulations could result in the Group being 
liable to fines or a suspension of operations, 
which would impact the Group’s financial 
results, together with any associated negative 
reputational damage.

Innovate
4 Customer relationships  
and reputation 
 
The Group receives a significant portion of 
its revenue from key customers and the loss 
of any such customer could result in a 
significant loss of revenue and cash flow. 
Further, the Group does not have long‑ term 
contracts with its customers and the Group’s 
revenue could be reduced if its customers 
switch some or all of their business with the 
Group to other suppliers.
At 31 December 2017 , the Group recognises 
intangible assets for customer relationships 
and brands valued at £72.6 million and 
£43.4 million, respectively.
Strategy link 
Innovate
5 Business disruption
 
 
A material disruption at one of the Group’s 
manufacturing facilities or quarries, or at one of 
the Group’s suppliers’ facilities, could prevent 
the Group from meeting customer demand.
The Group depends on efficient and 
uninterrupted operations of its information and 
communication technology, and any disruption 
to or interruptions in these operations could 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
operations and financial performance.
Additionally, the Group is exposed to the 
impact of unexpected or prolonged periods 
of bad weather, which could adversely affect 
construction activity and, as a result, demand 
for the Group’s products.
Strategy link 
Innovate
Mitigation 
The health and wellbeing of our employees 
is fundamental to our business. We have 
stringent Health and Safety policies and 
monitor compliance regularly.
We have invested considerable resources in 
employee training across our manufacturing 
processes. We have invested heavily in safe 
systems and facilities to protect our employees.
The Group currently complies with existing 
legislative requirements and actively monitors 
for any legislative changes with which it may 
need to comply.
Mitigation 
The Group has a service‑ led ethos with 
many top customer relationships lasting over 
40 years. The Group’s customer focus is 
supported by a commitment to quality, service 
and consistency.
The Group’s sales and production teams are 
highly integrated to ensure that production 
aligns with customers’ needs. Sales teams 
receive in‑ depth technical training and are 
assisted by a design support service team as 
well as targeted marketing materials to assist 
with specification and selection.
All four of the Group’s primary businesses have 
their own sales teams aligned by customer 
group and region in order to focus on key 
decision makers and customers. Key account 
management is supervised at a senior level 
where long‑ term relationships benefit from the 
continuity of senior management who have the 
ability to liaise across the Group’s businesses.
The Group has a broad spread of customers 
and no single customer comprises more than 
10% of the total Group revenue.
Mitigation 
The Group has the ability to transfer some of 
its production across its network of plants and 
is able to engage subcontractors to reduce the 
impact of certain production disruptions.
In relation to supplier disruption or failure, 
further third party suppliers have been identified 
who can maintain service in the event of a 
disruption. In relation to IT, a major incident 
action plan has been developed and the Group 
maintains data backups and a comprehensive 
disaster recovery plan covering Group and 
individual factory locations. 
Although weather conditions are completely 
beyond the Group’s control, fortunately, in both 
the UK and US in 2017 the Group’s trading 
was not adversely affected. Management 
do not underestimate the potential impact that 
future prolonged periods of bad weather 
could have. 
The Group’s wide geographical spread 
mitigates this risk to some extent and allows it 
to manage its production facilities to mitigate 
the impact of such disruption.
Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 35
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information 6 Recruitment and retention  
of key personnel 
 
The Group is dependent on qualified 
personnel in key positions and employees 
having special technical knowledge and skills. 
Any loss of such personnel without timely 
replacement could significantly disrupt 
business operations.

Innovate
7 Input prices 
 
 
The Group’s business may be affected by 
volatility in extraction expenses and raw 
material costs. Risks exist around our ability 
to pass on increased costs through price 
increases to our customers.
The Group’s business may also be affected by 
volatility in energy costs or disruptions in 
energy supplies.
Significant changes in the cost or availability of 
transportation could affect the Group’s results. 
Strategy link

8 Product quality 
 
 
The nature of the Group’s business may 
expose it to warranty claims and to claims for 
product liability, construction defects, project 
delay, property damage, personal injury and 
other damages. Any damage to the Group’s 
brands, including through actual or alleged 
issues with its products, could harm our 
business, reputation and the Group’s financial 
results.
Strategy link 
Innovate
Mitigation 
We ensure that we recognise the changing 
labour markets, and packages for key and 
senior staff remain competitive.
The Group believes that it is essential to 
protect and develop the management team, 
where appropriate ensuring that the team 
is structured in a way which best takes 
advantage of the available skills and robustly 
identifies the team and structure for the future. 
Extensive succession plans are in place, which 
is key to ensuring a managed transfer of roles 
and responsibilities (see Nomination 
Committee Report on pages 55 and 56).
Apprenticeship schemes are in operation with 
a yearly intake across the business (engineering 
and technical based). High potential individuals 
are identified with development plans 
formulated. External recruits are brought in 
where any skill gaps are identified and to 
enhance the talent pool.
Mitigation 
Significant input costs are under constant 
review, with continuous monitoring of raw 
material costs, energy prices and haulage 
expenses, with the aim of achieving the best 
possible prices and assuring stability of supply. 
With regards to possible energy shortages, the 
Group operates a hedging strategy to mitigate 
the impact of sudden price increases. 
As competitors of the Group are likely to 
experience similar levels of input price 
increases, we aim to have appropriate pricing 
policies to remain competitive within our 
markets and pass on significant increases 
in input.
Mitigation 
The Group operates comprehensive quality 
control procedures across its sites with both 
internal and external audit reviews of product 
quality completed to ensure conformity with 
internationally recognised standards. 
All accredited staff undergo rigorous training 
programmes on quality and the Group’s 
Technical teams carry out regular testing of all 
of our products to provide full technical data 
on our product range. 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 36 Ibstock plc
Principal risks and uncertainties continued 9 Financial risk management 
 
 
In addition to the input cost risks outlined 
opposite, the Group is subject to the following 
other financial risks:
 – Foreign exchange risk – As the Group 
has operations in the UK and the US, 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely 
impact the Group’s results.
 – Credit risk – Through its customers, the 
Group is exposed to a counterparty risk 
that accounts receivable will not be settled 
leading to a financial loss to the Group.
 – Liquidity risk – Insufficient funds could 
result in the Group being unable to fund its 
operations.
 – Interest rate risk – Movements in interest 
rates could adversely impact the Group 
and result in higher financing payments to 
service debt.
Strategy link 
–
10 Pension obligations 
 
 
The Group has obligations to its employees 
relating to retirement and other obligations and 
any changes in assumptions or in interest rate 
levels could have adverse effects on its 
financial position.
Strategy link 
–
11 Cyber security 
 
 
Recent high‑ profile attacks on companies 
across a number of industry sectors (including 
one of our own major customers) have 
highlighted the damage that can now be 
caused by hackers and cyber terrorists. As a 
result, and as the Group continues to evolve, 
operational risks such as cyber security risk 
have increased in focus.
Such IT security risks have the ability to 
significantly disrupt the Group’s business, 
resulting in financial loss. The Group does not 
operate in a high‑ risk sector, yet the Group is 
committed to ensure that its network, 
applications and data are protected.
Strategy link 
–
Mitigation 
 – Foreign exchange risk – The Group 
undertakes limited foreign exchange 
transactions, with the UK and US 
businesses selling domestically with largely 
local input costs. Some capital expenditure 
requires foreign exchange purchases and 
management considers foreign exchange 
hedging strategies where significant 
exposures may arise.
 – Credit risk – Customer credit risk is 
managed by each subsidiary subject to the 
Group’s policy relating to customer credit 
risk management. The Group principally 
manages credit risk through management 
of customer credit limits. The credit limits 
are set for each customer based on the 
creditworthiness of the customer and the 
anticipated levels of business activity. 
These limits are initially determined when 
the customer account is first set up and 
are regularly monitored thereafter.
 – Liquidity risk – The Group’s policy is to 
ensure that it has sufficient funding and 
facilities in place to meet any foreseeable 
peak in borrowing requirements and 
liabilities when they become due. In March 
2017 , the Group entered into new facilities 
of £250 million, as set out in Note 18 of the 
Group financial statements.
 – Interest rate risk – The Group finances 
its operations through a mixture of retained 
profits and bank borrowings. The Group’s 
bank borrowings, other facilities and 
deposits are in Sterling and at floating 
rates. No interest rate derivative contracts 
have been entered into at the year end.
Mitigation 
The Company plays an active role in the 
Ibstock Pension Scheme – nominating up to 
half of the Trustees and the Group Chief 
Financial Officer attends and chairs Trustee 
meetings. The Ibstock Pension Scheme, which 
is a defined benefit scheme, was closed to 
future accrual in January 2017 following 
consultation with members. The Pension 
Trustees and their external advisers, as well as 
the internal pensions team, have significant 
expertise in the area and provide oversight. 
Following closure, the Scheme’s Statement of 
Investment Principles, which documents the 
Scheme’s investment strategy to provide 
appropriate security and achieve an 
appropriate balance between risk and return, 
was subject to review. An updated policy has 
been developed, after taking suitable advice, 
to ensure that investments continue to 
maintain appropriate balance following the 
Scheme changes.
Mitigation 
During the year, the Group has completed 
a review using an external cyber security 
programme framework, which provides 
coverage across the key areas of cyber 
security and aligns with industry standards. 
Good progress was made during 2017 in 
addressing the findings of the review

measure, the metrics used are consistent 
with those presented in our 2016 Annual 
Report and Accounts and there have 
been no changes to the bases of 
calculation. We have amended our ROCE 
calculation during 2017 in light of the 
recent guidance on APMs from the FRC 
and ESMA regulatory bodies and in order 
to provide a clearer, more comparable 
definition with other companies.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 38 Ibstock plc Adjusted EBITDA
Management measure the Group’s 
operating performance using Adjusted 
EBITDA, which increased by 7 .1% to 
£119.6 million in the year ended 
31 December 2017 . The increase is driven 
by the Group’s revenue growth in the UK. 
Input costs for the year were broadly in line 
with inflation at around 3%, the exception 
to this being energy which increased in 
both the UK and US by circa 16-18%. This 
significant increase was partially mitigated 
by the disposal of surplus carbon credits, 
which reduced this increase to circa 8%. 
We work with an external consultant 
throughout the year to manage our energy 
purchasing; and buy and sell these credits 
at opportune times. 
Adjusted EBITDA also includes a benefit 
of £1.7 million relating to the effective 
management of Research and 
Development claims for 2015 and 2016 
(2016: £ nil). Management anticipates 
that further claims will be achieved 
going forward. 
Our US operations saw previous headline 
infrastructure announcements fail to 
materialise during 2017 . Combined with a 
highly competitive residential market in the 
regions in which Glen-Gery operates, we 
saw adjusted EBITDA reduce by 12.1% 
during 2017 in constant currency terms. 
Overall the US accounts for 10% of the 
Group’s adjusted EBITDA (2016: 11%).
Cash flow and net debt
Cash generated from operations during 
2017 is shown in Table 1, below.
Our cash generation was in line with our 
expectations and operations remained 
strongly cash generative in the year ended 
31 December 2017 , with the Group’s cash 
conversion static at 88%. Adjusted free 
cash flow increased markedly due to 
increased profitability and reduced 
expenditure on major capital projects 
during the year although this was 
mitigated to some extent by greater 
taxation payments during 2017 . Taxation 
payments in the prior year were reduced 
due to tax relief on refinancing expenses 
incurred in 2015.
A net working capital balance at 
31 December 2017 of £48.2 million 
compares to £46.1 million at 31 December 
2016. Despite inventory destocking within 
our UK Clay operations, the movement 
reflects increased inventory in our US 
operations and UK concrete products 
(particularly roof tiles) as management 
sought to build inventory levels towards 
the year end. Trade receivable levels 
year-on-year also increased due to the 
higher sales activity in 2017 . These 
increases are offset to some extent by 
an increase in trade payables, which has 
arisen as a result of the increased activity 
in the final months of 2017 .

Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 39
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Taxation
The Group recorded a taxation charge 
of £9.9 million (2016: £20.5 million) on 
Group pre-tax profits of £83.4 million 
(2016: £110.9 million) for the year ended 
31 December 2017 , resulting in an 
effective tax rate (“ETR”) of 11.8% (2016: 
18.5%). The impact of the reduction in the 
US federal tax rate on the Group’s US 
deferred tax balance and the recognition 
of the tax benefit claimed in respect of 
the IPO transaction costs incurred during 
2015 had a significant impact on the 
effective tax rate as shown in note 10. 
Absent changes to the rates of deferred 
taxation, the Group’s ETR would have 
been 16.7% and 21.3% in the current and 
prior year, respectively.
Earnings per share
Statutory basic EPS reduced by 19% to 
18.1 pence in the year to 31 December 
2017 (2016: 22.3 pence) as a result of the 
Group’s reduced statutory profit after 
taxation which was boosted by the 
£30.3 million credit arising on the Group’s 
pension scheme closure, as discussed 
above. This had a 5.7 pence positive 
impact on the 2016 statutory EPS, which 
is not seen in the current year.
However, adjusted EPS
1
 of 21.4 pence per 
share increased by 18% – in line with prior 
years, this metric removes the impact of 
exceptional non-trading items, the fair 
value uplifts resulting from our acquisition 
accounting and non-cash interest impacts 
(net of the related taxation charge/credit). 
Adjusted EPS is the Group’s measure for 
calculating distributions to shareholders 
and has been included to provide a clearer 
guide as to the underlying earnings 
performance of the Group. A full 
reconciliation of our Adjusted EPS 
measure is included in Note 11.
Net debt
1
 (borrowings less cash) of 
£117 .0 million at 31 December 2017 , 
compares to £132.8 million at the prior 
year end. In March 2017 , the Group 
refinanced its debt arrangements and 
entered into a £250 million revolving credit 
facility (“RCF”) with a group of six major 
banks. The five-year facility contains 
interest cover and leverage covenant limits 
of 4x and 3x, respectively. These covenant 
requirements are consistent with our prior 
debt facility and the Group remains 
significantly within both limits. See 
Table 2 below.
Exchange rates
The Group is exposed to movements in 
exchange rates when translating the 
results of its US operations from US 
Dollars to UK Sterling. Sterling depreciated 
against the Dollar in the year to 
31 December 2017 , the average exchange 
rate of $1.28:£1 was below that of the 
equivalent period in 2016 ($1.35:£1) and 
has resulted in a £0.5 million benefit to 
Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 .
Exceptional items
In line with our accounting policy for 
exceptional items, we have excluded 
certain items from our Adjusted EBITDA 
to aid shareholders’ understanding of our 
underlying financial performance. 
Infrequent events, such as the non-cash 
interest expenses arising from our 
refinancing in March 2017 (see below) and 
the income statement credit of £1.7 million 
arising on the release of our provision for 
contingent consideration following Bain 
Capital’s disposal of interests in the 
Group’s shares, have been treated as 
exceptional in the current year. Further 
details of exceptional items are set out in 
Note 5 of the financial statements. 
Finance costs
Net finance costs of £11.4 million were 
incurred in the year (2016: £3.1 million). As 
noted above, the single largest element of 
the current year charge was exceptional 
finance costs of £6.4 million. These 
non-cash interest charges, which were 
treated as exceptional, arose in the year 
in respect of accelerated debt issue fees 
(£3.3 million) and accounting adjustments 
caused by the prior year interest rate 
change (£3.1 million) – the latter equivalent 
to a non-cash gain from the prior year, 
which had been similarly presented as 
exceptional in the comparative 
disclosures.
Dividend
A final dividend of 6.5 pence per ordinary 
share (2016: 5.3 pence) is being 
recommended for payment on 8 June 
2018 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 11 May 2018. 
This is in addition to our interim dividend 
paid in September 2017 of 2.6 pence per 
ordinary share (2016: 2.4 pence), resulting 
in a total dividend of 9.1 pence per 
ordinary share – 18.1% higher that the 
prior year (2016: 7 .7 pence). This is in line 
with our dividend policy, which is based 
on a pay-out ratio of 40-50% of adjusted 
profit after taxation over a business cycle. 
In 2017 , the Directors have selected a 
42.5% pay-out ratio in determining the 
proposed dividend (2016: 42.5%). 
Supplementary dividend policy
In addition, in light of the Group’s strong 
adjusted free cash flow, the Board has 
reviewed its capital allocation strategy 
and preserving the necessary flexibility 
to accommodate potential acquisition 
opportunities and consistent with its 
objective of maintaining a prudent balance 
sheet, has determined a supplementary 
dividend policy. This will assess the 
Group’s capacity for supplementary 
dividends annually, in light of our reducing 
net debt to adjusted EBITDA multiple and, 
if approved, will be of a similar scale to the 
prior year final dividend and paid 
alongside the Group’s interim dividend. 
Subject to market conditions and capital 
allocation priorities, the first supplementary 
dividend is expected to be announced in 
August 2018 for payment alongside the 
2018 interim dividend.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40 Ibstock plc Pensions
During 2016, the Group conducted a 
consultation with the UK defined benefit 
scheme members, regarding a proposal 
to close the scheme to future accrual for 
all active members. All members 
consented to this change and, from 
1 February 2017 , have joined the UK 
defined contribution scheme. This resulted 
in a £30.3 million non-cash credit, which 
was accounted for in our 2016 results. 
At 31 December 2017 , the defined 
benefit scheme was in an actuarial 
accounting surplus position of 
£46.1 million (31 December 2016: deficit of 
£28.7 million). At the year end, the scheme 
had asset levels of £659.4 million 
(31 December 2016: £683.6 million) 
against pension liabilities of £613.4 million 
(31 December 2016: £698.0 million). The 
improvement in the underlying balance 
sheet position over the year is primarily 
due to a combination of strong investment 
returns and actual inflation being lower 
than previously assumed. This was 
partially offset by a fall in corporate bond 
yields, which resulted in an increase in 
the value placed on the Scheme’s 
benefit obligations. 
The fall in liabilities also reflects the 
significant values transferred out of the 
scheme by members following the closure 
of the scheme to future accrual. The 
Group continues ongoing work with the 
scheme Trustees to de-risk the pension 
and to match asset categories investment 
strategy with the associated liabilities.
In the current year, in continuing to apply 
IFRIC 14, management has ceased to 
recognise an additional liability in respect of 
the minimum funding obligation following 
the receipt of legal advice regarding the 
Group’s ability to access a surplus (should 
one exist) in the pension scheme in the 
future. See Note 2 for further details of the 
Group’s interpretation of IFRIC 14, the 
relevant accounting standard. 
Within our US segment, certain 
employees are members of two multi-
employer post-employment schemes. 
At 31 December 2017 , a liability of 
£8.7 million (31 December 2016: 
£9.4 million) has been recognised in 
relation to these schemes.
Related party transactions
Related party transactions are disclosed 
in Note 29 to the consolidated financial 
statements. During the year, Bain Capital 
Partners LLC ceased to hold any ordinary 
shares in Ibstock plc and no longer has 
significant influence over the Group. There 
have been no other material related party 
transactions during the year ended 
31 December 2017 .
Subsequent events
With the exception of the final dividend 
noted above, there have been no further 
events subsequent to 31 December 2017 , 
which management believe require 
adjustment or disclosure. 
Going concern
The Group continues to meet its day to 
day working capital and other funding 
requirements through a combination of 
strong operational cash flows generated 
by the business and the long-term funding 
in place. As noted above, the Group 
agreed new banking facilities during the 
year, with a five-year £250 million RCF 
replacing the five-year £200 million loan 
and £40 million committed RCF facility in 
place at 31 December 2016. 
Risks and uncertainties
The Board assesses and monitors the 
key risks impacting the business on an 
on-going basis. The Group’s activities 
expose it to a variety of risks; economic 
conditions, government action and policy, 
government regulation and standards 
relating to the manufacture and use of 
building products, customer relationships 
and reputation, business disruption, 
recruitment and retention of key personnel, 
input prices, product quality, financial risk 
management and pension obligations.
The Group’s risk management approach 
together with these principal risks and 
mitigating actions are set out on pages 
32 to 37 .

Conclusion
In summary, the Directors reasonably expect, based on the 
evidence available, that the Group will continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of 
their assessment.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 42. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 38 to 41. In addition, Note 22 to the Group consolidated 
financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group regularly reviews market and financial forecasts, 
and has reviewed its trading prospects in its key markets.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for a period of 
at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements. The Board has concluded that the Going Concern 
basis of accounting of its financial statements is appropriate.

Viability Statement
Background
The Directors have undertaken a comprehensive assessment 
of the Group’s viability as a business – rigorously assessing its 
markets, the strength of its business model and the potential risks 
that could impact its ongoing success. This process involved 
carefully reviewing and assessing extensive evidence, from both 
internal and external sources, to evaluate the prospects for the 
Group over a long-term horizon.
Assessment
Management’s viability exercise, reviewed by the Audit Committee 
on behalf of the Board has informed the Directors’ assessment of 
the longer-term viability of the business, as part of the year-end 
review for the preparation of this Annual Report and Accounts, 
has robustly assessed the business model, strategy, market 
conditions, business planning, risks and the liquidity and solvency 
of the Group. The Group has leading positions within the markets 
in which it operates, as noted on pages 18 and 19, and its strategy 
(see pages 22 and 23) is aimed at continuing to strengthen its 
position in those markets and create value for its shareholders. 
The Group’s operations (see pages 3 to 5) expose it to a number 
of risks and the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties are 
noted on pages 34 to 37 . The Directors continually review those 
risks and determine the appropriate controls and further actions. 
They have further reviewed the impact within the context of the 
Group’s viability. The Group has limited exposure to interest rate 
risk and foreign exchange rate risk as described on page 37 .
Lookout period
In determining the lookout period to assess the prospects of the 
Group, the Directors decided that three years was the appropriate 
period over which to assess longer-term viability. The nature of 
the building products industry is that it is particularly sensitive to 
the level of economic activity, which is influenced by several 
factors outside of the Group’s control, including demographic 
trends, the state of the housing market, mortgage availability, 
mortgage interest rates and changes in household income, 
inflation and Government policy. 
Based on the evidence available, the Directors believe that it is 
reasonable to expect continued growth, and consider that a 
three-year period provides the most appropriate horizon over 
which to assess viability. The Directors have also considered 
the financing the Group has in place, which is agreed for a period 
in excess of the lookout period used. Following the facilities’ 
refinancing in the year, described in Note 18 to the Group 
consolidated financial statements, refinancing is therefore not 
considered a significant factor in this current assessment, but 
debt leverage compliance and the Group’s cash requirements 
are monitored on a continuous basis.
Stress testing
During the challenging market conditions of the recent past, the 
Group performed well, remaining cash positive and implementing 
a number of mitigating actions that allowed it to remain viable. 
Such mitigating actions remain available to the Directors today. 
The Group’s viability modelling has stress tested the budget in 
the following scenarios both individually and in combination:
Assumptions
In determining the viability of the Group, the Board made the 
following assumptions:
 – The economic climate in the geographies in which the 
Group operates remains in line with a broad consensus of 
external forecasts;
 – There is no material change in the legal and regulatory 
frameworks with which the Group complies;
 – There are no material changes in construction methods used 
in the markets in which the Group operates;

Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 43
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the 2017 Corporate Governance  
Statement to our shareholders.
The Board is responsible for the governance of the Group and 
recognises the importance of corporate governance in assisting 
the Group to deliver long-term success for its stakeholders. I am 
pleased to confirm that we have achieved full compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code throughout 2017 . 
Your Board manages the Company in a transparent, open and 
honest manner, which we achieve by maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance. The Board is ultimately responsible to 
shareholders for all our activities: for delivering our strategy and 
financial performance in the long-term interests of the Company, 
for efficiently using our resources and having regard to social, 
environmental and ethical matters. The Board approves the 
Group’s governance framework with the Board Committees 
contributing their specialist focus to key areas such as 
remuneration policy, internal controls and risk management 
and succession planning. 
While other sections of the Annual Report and Accounts cover 
our financial and operational achievements during the year, this 
section describes the effective leadership of the Board and how 
it endeavours to promote the highest standards of corporate 
governance throughout the Group.
My responsibility as Chairman is to ensure that the Board operates 
effectively and efficiently and that it upholds the high standards of 
corporate governance required for the long-term success of the 
Group. I believe the achievement of good governance is based on 
the appropriate level of oversight, good communication, a focus 
on the management of risks, a commitment to transparency and 
ensuring a culture of continuous improvement in standards and 
performance across the business.
The Board regularly reviews its level of oversight and the 
monitoring of risks over a variety of areas including strategy, 
acquisitions and disposals, capital expenditure on new projects, 
finance, people, and sustainability matters. It will continue to 
adapt to meet the evolving needs of the Group. The Board aims 
to ensure that good governance extends beyond the boardroom 
and is continually borne in mind in the successful delivery of the 
Group’s strategic priorities over both the short and long-term.
On 5 December 2017 the FRC published proposals for a revised 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the “revised Governance 
Code”), intended to reflect the changing business environment 
and to help UK companies achieve the highest levels of 
governance. I shall be working with your Board on the appropriate 
implementation of the recommendations of the revised 
Governance Code by the time it takes effect.
As announced on 11 October 2017 , Wayne Sheppard will retire 
from the Board in 2018. Wayne steered the company through its 
successful IPO and under his leadership Ibstock has delivered 
significant shareholder value in its first years as a public listed 
company. He will be succeeded as CEO by Joe Hudson, who joined 
the Board on 2 January 2018 as CEO Designate. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank Wayne for his immense contribution 
to Ibstock and his commitment to ensure a smooth transition.
On 31 December 2017 Lynn Minella stepped down from the 
Board, having joined the Company shortly after the IPO. Lynn, 
who has held a number of senior Human Resources roles, 
became chair of the Remuneration Committee on appointment. 
Lynn returned to the USA to take on an executive appointment. 
On behalf of the Directors, I should like to thank Lynn for the 
valuable contribution she has made to the Board. We appreciate 
the efforts Lynn has made to accommodate the Board since 
leaving the UK and wish her every success in her new role. 
I am pleased that Tracey Graham accepted the Board’s invitation 
to become Chair of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 
1 January 2018.
We have also commenced a search process for the appointment 
of two new Non-Executive Directors.
As announced on 14 February 2018, I shall be stepping down 
from the Board following conclusion of the 2018 AGM. Following 
my departure, as part of its long-term succession planning 
arrangements, Jonathan Nicholls (currently Senior Independent 
Director and Chair of the Audit Committee) will be appointed 
Chairman of the Board; Tracey Graham will be appointed as the 
Senior Independent Director, in addition to her current role as 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Justin Read will be 
appointed Chair of the Audit Committee, in each case subject to 
their re-election by shareholders at the AGM.
It has been a pleasure to be Ibstock’s Chairman and I am proud of 
what the Company has achieved since it listed in October 2015.

highest standards of 
corporate governance. 
Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 45
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Application of the main principles  
of the Code
During the 2017 financial year, the Company continued to apply 
the main principles of the Code, as follows: 
A. Leadership 
A.1 The role of the Board 
The Board met formally on nine occasions during the year. 
There is a clear schedule of matters reserved for the Board, 
which can be found on the Company’s corporate website, at 
http://www.ibstockplc.com/investors/corporate-governance. 
The Company maintains, at its expense, a Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance policy for the benefit of Group personnel 
including, as recommended by the Code, the Directors. This 
insurance policy does not provide cover where the Director or 
Officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
The Company has also provided an indemnity for its Directors to 
the extent permitted by the law in respect of liabilities incurred in 
office. The indemnity would not provide any coverage to the extent 
that a Director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
A.2 Division of responsibilities 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are clearly defined. 
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness 
of the Board. The Chief Executive is responsible for leading the 
day-to-day management of the Group within the strategy set by 
the Board. Details of the division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive can be found on the 
Company’s corporate website, at http://www.ibstockplc.com/
investors/corporate-governance.
A.3 The Chairman 
The Chairman sets the agenda for Board meetings, manages the 
meetings (in conjunction with the Company Secretary) and 
facilitates open and constructive dialogue during those meetings. 
A.4 Non-Executive Directors 
The Chairman promotes an open and constructive environment in 
the boardroom and actively invites the Non-Executive Directors to 
express their views. The Non-Executive Directors provide objective, 
rigorous and constructive challenge to management and hold 
meetings at which the Executive Directors are not present. 
Jonathan Nicholls is the current Senior Independent Director. 
Tracey Graham will take on this role following the 2018 AGM.
Chairman’s introduction continued
B. Effectiveness
B.1 The composition of the Board 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for regularly reviewing 
the composition of the Board. In recommending appointments to 
the Board, the Nomination Committee considers the range of 
skills, knowledge and experience required, taking into account 
the benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender.
B.2 Appointments to the Board 
The appointment of new Directors is led by the Nomination 
Committee. Further details of the activities of the Nomination 
Committee during the year can be found on pages 55 and 56. 
B.3 Commitment 
On appointment, Directors are notified of the time commitment 
expected from them which, in practice, goes beyond that set out 
in their letter of appointment. Permission must be sought from the 
Chairman before other external directorships, which may affect 
existing time commitments, are accepted.
Non-Executive Directors are expected to provide a time 
commitment to the Company of at least 25 days a year, and 
to recognise the need for availability in the event of a crisis. 
B.4 Development 
All new Directors receive an induction upon joining the Board. 
Training is made available to members of the Board in 
accordance with their requirements. Please see page 54 for 
details of Justin Read’s and Joe Hudson’s induction.
Directors may, at the Company’s expense, take independent 
professional advice and are encouraged to continually update 
their professional skills and knowledge of the business. 
B.5 Information and support 
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, 
ensures that all Board members receive accurate and timely 
information. 
The Directors of all Group companies, as well as the Board, have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. 
Independent external legal and professional advice can also be 
taken when necessary to do so. Furthermore, each Committee of 
the Board has access to sufficient and tailored resources to carry 
out its duties. 
The Board recognises 
the importance of 
creating a clear flow 
of communication 
between it and all 
shareholders, 
particularly with 
regard to business 
developments and 
financial results.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 46 Ibstock plc B.6 Evaluation 
During the 2017 financial year, the Board undertook an evaluation 
of its own performance and that of its Committees. Details of the 
evaluation can be found on page 54. 
B.7 Re-election
All Directors were subject to shareholder election or re-election 
at the 2017 AGM. All Directors are subject to annual election by 
shareholders. The names of Directors submitted for election or 
re-election, accompanied by sufficient biographical details and 
any other relevant information, are provided to shareholders to 
enable them to take an informed decision on their election.
C. Accountability 
C.1 Financial and business reporting 
The Board has established arrangements to ensure that reports 
and other information published by the Group are fair, balanced 
and understandable. The Strategic Report, set out on pages 1 to 
42, provides information about the Group’s performance, the 
Group’s business model, the Group’s strategy and the risks and 
uncertainties relating to the Group’s future prospects.
C.2 Risk management and internal control 
The Board sets the Group’s risk appetite and, via the Audit 
Committee, monitors and annually reviews the effectiveness of 
the Group’s systems of risk management and internal control. 
C.3 Audit Committee and auditors
The Board has delegated a number of responsibilities to the Audit 
Committee. The principal activities of the Audit Committee are 
summarised in the report presented by the Audit Committee 
Chairman on pages 59 to 64. 
D. Remuneration 
D.1 The levels and components of remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee sets the framework, policy and 
levels of remuneration which are designed to promote the 
long-term success of the Group. Remuneration is structured so 
as to link it to both corporate and individual performance, thereby 
aligning management’s interests with those of shareholders.
D.2 Procedure
The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the 
Board on the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Chairman 
and senior executives.
Details of the activities of the Remuneration Committee can be 
found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 83. 
E. Relations with shareholders 
E.1 Dialogue with shareholders
The Board takes an active role in engaging with shareholders. 
The Board particularly values opportunities to meet with 
shareholders and the Chairman ensures that the Board is kept 
informed about shareholders’ views. This is discussed further in 
‘Relations with shareholders’ on page 47 . 
E.2 Constructive use of the General Meetings
The AGM provides the Board with an important opportunity to 
communicate with shareholders, who are invited to meet the 
Board following the formal business of the meeting.
Share Dealing Code
The Company has adopted a code of securities dealing in relation 
to the Ordinary Shares. The code applies to the Directors, 
Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibilities and relevant 
employees of the Group.
Relations with shareholders
Highlights
 – Successful 2017 AGM
 – Executive Directors met with shareholders following 
announcement of the annual and interim results
 – Received constructive feedback from shareholder meetings
The Board recognises the importance of creating a clear flow of 
communication between it and all shareholders, particularly with 
regard to business developments and financial results. The Board 
aims to communicate on a regular basis and at present the 
Company utilises news releases, investor presentations and 
Company publications and will expand communication channels 
as appropriate. The Executive Directors conduct a round of 
meetings with analysts and investors following announcement of 
the full-year and interim results. The Company’s brokers prepare 
a report on the anonymised feedback received from those 
meetings, which is shared with the Executive Directors and the 
Non-Executive Directors. This process is one of the ways in which 
Non-Executive Directors have an opportunity to develop an 
understating of the views of the major shareholders. 
Jonathan Nicholls is the Senior Independent Director (“SID”). 
The SID is available to shareholders throughout the year if they 
have concerns that contact through the normal channels of the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or other Executive Directors 
have failed to resolve or for which such channels of communication 
are inappropriate. The option to meet has been proactively 
offered to shareholders on several occasions, but none have felt 
the need to take advantage of this opportunity.
During the time that Diamond (BC) S.à r.l. were a major 
shareholder Jonathan communicated with them on a regular 
basis through their representatives on the Board of Directors.
All shareholders are invited to the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting (the “AGM”), at which they will have the opportunity to 
meet and put questions to the Board. Details of the resolutions to 
be proposed at the AGM to be held on 24 May 2018 at 2:00 p.m. 
at Citigate Dewe Rogerson, 3 London Wall Buildings, London 
Wall, London EC2M 5SY, can be found in the Notice of Meeting. 
The Notice of Meeting, together with explanatory notes on the 
resolutions to be proposed and full details of the deadlines for 
appointing proxies, is contained in a circular which will be 
circulated to all shareholders at least 20 working days before 
the AGM, together with this Annual Report and Accounts. 
This document will also be available on the Ibstock plc website 
(www.ibstockplc.com/investors). Results of voting at the AGM 
will be announced to the London Stock Exchange and will be 
published on our website at www.ibstockplc.com/investors.

Board composition
The Code recommends that the Board of Directors of a UK 
premium listed company includes an appropriate combination 
of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, with independent 
Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) comprising 
at least half the Board. As at the year end, the Board comprised 
a Non-Executive Chairman, four independent Non-Executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors. The Board regards 
Jonathan Nicholls, Tracey Graham and Justin Read as 
independent for the purposes of the Code. Lynn Minella, who 
stood down from the Board on 31 December 2017 , was also 
regarded as independent for the purposes of the Code.
As explained on page 52, Matthias Boyer Chammard and 
Michel Plantevin stepped down from the Board on 24 May 2017 , 
following Diamond (BC) S.à r.l.’s disposal of all its shares in 
the Company.
Joe Hudson joined the Board on 2 January 2018 as Chief 
Executive Officer Designate.
As announced on 14 February 2018, Jamie Pike will step down 
from the Board following conclusion of the AGM on 24 May 2018 
and Jonathan Nicholls will become Chairman of the Board. 
We have commenced the search for two new independent 
Non-Executive Directors and will update the market in due course.

Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 51
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Non-Executive Directors
At the date of this Report, independent Non-Executive Directors 
comprise 50% of the Board, excluding the Chairman. The Board 
believes that these Non-Executive Directors, Jonathan Nicholls, 
Tracey Graham and Justin Read, possess strong independent 
character and judgement and bring a wide range of business 
experience both in areas related to and areas complementary 
to the activities of the Group.
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors and observer 
by the Controlling Shareholder
Diamond (BC) S.à r.l. (the “Controlling Shareholder”) was 
previously a Controlling Shareholder of the Company for the 
purposes of the Listing Rules. Under the terms of a Relationship 
Agreement (the “Agreement”) between the Company and the 
Controlling Shareholder entered into on 22 October 2015, the 
Controlling Shareholder had a right to nominate for appointment 
two Directors (each a “Shareholder Director”) to the Board of the 
Company whilst its and its associates’ shareholding in the 
Company was 25% or more; and to nominate for appointment 
one Shareholder Director to the Board of the Company whilst its 
and its associates’ shareholding in the Company was 10% or 
more. The Agreement fell away on 2 May 2017 when the 
Controlling Shareholder disposed of all its shares in the Company, 
and accordingly, Matthias Boyer Chammard and Michel Plantevin 
stepped down from the Board following the AGM held on 
24 May 2017 . 
The Board confirms that, during the period in which the 
Agreement was in force:
 – the Company complied with the independence provisions 
included in the Agreement;
 – in so far as the Company is aware, the independence 
provisions included in the Relationship Agreement were 
complied with by the Controlling Shareholder and its 
associates; and
 – in so far as the Company is aware, the procurement obligation 
included in the Relationship Agreement was complied with by 
the Controlling Shareholder.
Board Committees
The Board has established three principal Committees of the 
Board: an Audit Committee; a Nomination Committee; and 
a Remuneration Committee. Each Committee has formally 
delegated duties and responsibilities set out in its written Terms 
of Reference. If the need should arise, the Board may establish 
additional committees, to consider specific issues, as 
appropriate. The terms of reference for each of the Board 
Committees are available on the Company’s corporate website, 
at http://www.ibstockplc.com/investors/corporate-governance.
Details of each of the Board Committees and their activities 
during the year are set out in the separate Committee Reports 
commencing on pages 55, 59 and 66, which are incorporated 
into the Corporate Governance Statement by reference. The 
Chairman of each Committee reports the outcome of the 
meetings to the Board. Details of Committee memberships are 
included in the Directors’ biographies on pages 50 and 51.

Meetings and attendance
The Board held scheduled meetings on nine occasions during the year and expects to meet approximately eight times each year

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 52 Ibstock plc The table opposite shows those Committee meetings which each 
Director attended as a member of the Committee, rather than as 
an invitee. Where “N/A” appears in the table the Director listed is 
not a member of that Committee. 
The Board aims to hold at least two Board meetings each year 
at Group business locations, both in the UK and the US, to 
enable Board members to gain a deeper understanding of the 
Group’s operations. This also provides senior managers from 
across the Group with the opportunity to present to the Board as 
well as to meet the Directors at more informal occasions. During 
2017 the Board held a number of meetings at the Group’s 
business locations:
 – March – Ibstock Brick Limited, Chesterton and Parkhouse 
factories in Stoke on Trent. The Board visited these two 
factories that produce wire cut and soft mud bricks, 
respectively. They met with members of the management 
team at both operations and discussed operational matters 
and compared and contrasted the two different methods of 
brick production.
 – June – Glen-Gery Inc, Pennsylvania US. The Board undertook 
its annual three-day visit of the US business. During the tour the 
Board visited the Biglar and Hanley brick factories where they 
met staff and senior management. The Board also toured the 
Penn State College Campus where they viewed a number of 
prestigious buildings that had been constructed using products 
from the Glen-Gery factories. The Board also received 
presentations from senior management on Glen-Gery’s 
performance, prospects and strategic objectives. 
 – November – Supreme Concrete, Sittingbourne. The Board 
received presentations from management on the business’s 
operations and saw at first hand the pre-stressed concrete 
beam manufacturing process. 
During 2018 the Board will continue its programme of site visits 
which, it is anticipated, will include visiting the Ibstock, Forticrete 
and Supreme businesses in the UK and the annual three-day 
excursion to review Glen-Gery’s operations in the US.

Chairman, strategy, risk oversight, succession planning and the 
structure of the Board’s Committees. The process also provided 
the Board with the opportunity to make specific comments in 
response to a series of “open” questions. The questionnaire was 
completed by all Directors and the Company Secretary. A report 
on the outcome of the evaluation exercise was prepared and was 
presented to the Board at the December 2017 meeting.
As a result of conclusions drawn from the Board evaluation 
report, the Board has agreed to hold an annual Board strategy 
away day and to implement actions designed to support the 
newly appointed CEO designate.
Overall, the Board considered the performance of each Director 
to be effective and concluded that the Board and its committees 
continue to provide effective leadership and exert the required 
levels of governance and control and that each Director continues 
to contribute effectively and demonstrate commitment to his or 
her role. The Board will continue to review its procedures, 
effectiveness and development in the year ahead.
The Senior Independent Director met with the independent 
Non-Executive Directors, in the absence of the Chairman, to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance, taking into account the 
views of Executive Directors. The review concluded that the 
Chairman’s performance continued to be effective and that 
he demonstrates commitment to the role.
Development and advice
Justin Read was appointed a Director on 1 January 2017 . His 
induction programme included visits to the principal operations of 
the Group’s three UK based businesses where he met members 
of the management team. He was given guided tours of the 
factories and was introduced to the businesses’ products and 
manufacturing operations. Meetings were also held with the 
Executive Directors and senior members of the Group head 
office team. 
Joe Hudson was appointed a Director, and CEO designate, on 
2 January 2018. A tailored induction programme was prepared 
for him similar to that outlined above. In addition, Joe’s 
programme included meetings with the Group’s brokers. 
External directorships
Any external appointments or other significant commitments of 
the Directors require the prior approval of the Board. The external 
commitments of the Board are set out in their biographies on 
pages 50 and 51. The Board is content with the level of external 
directorships held by the Chairman and the independent 
Non-Executive Directors, as these do not impact on the time that 
any Director devotes to the Company. Furthermore, the Board 
believes that this external experience serves to enhance the 
capability of the Board.
As anticipated in last year’s report, Jamie Pike stepped down as 
Non-Executive Chairman and a Director of Tyman PLC at that 
Company’s AGM held in May 2017 .
As announced on 14 February 2018, Jamie Pike has accepted an 
appointment as Chairman of Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc with 
effect from 15 May 2018 and will step down from the Board of the 
Company on 24 May 2018, following conclusion of the AGM.

Nomination Committee activities
Succession planning 
The composition of the Board is constantly under review with 
the aim of ensuring that it has the depth and breadth of skills to 
discharge its responsibilities effectively. The Nomination 
Committee, through its review of succession planning, applies a 
similar approach to the layer of management that sits immediately 
below the Board.

Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Effectiveness continued
The aim of the Nomination Committee is to ensure that the Board 
and senior management are well balanced and appropriate for 
the needs of the business, the achievement of its strategy, and 
that the Board comprises Directors who are appropriately 
experienced and are independent of character and judgement. 
Before recommending new candidates, the Nomination 
Committee takes account of the balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity of psychological type, educational and 
professional background and gender. However, all appointments 
will always be made on merit. Additional information is included 
in the Strategic Report on page 27 .
We engaged Zygos Partnership, the external search firm, which 
has no connection to the Company, other than assisting with 
recruitment arrangements, to identify potential candidates to 
succeed Wayne Sheppard who, in October 2017 notified the 
Board of his intention to retire in 2018. Zygos Partnership worked 
with us to create a long list of candidates suitably qualified to 
undertake the role, taking into account our policy on diversity. 
A short list of suitable candidates was compiled, based on their 
industry and executive experience, and the Nomination 
Committee, together with the Executive Directors, met with the 
candidates. Following those meetings we were able to formulate 
our recommendation to the Board, which culminated in the 
appointment of Joe Hudson as CEO designate with effect from 
2 January 2018.
Lynn Minella stepped down from the Board on 31 December 
2017 , having relocated to the USA. Having reviewed the size and 
structure of the Board, the Nomination Committee engaged an 
external firm to commence a search process for a new Non-
Executive Director. 
We also conducted an in-depth review of the Group’s succession 
plan and considered the talent available below the Board level. 
The Nomination Committee’s review concluded that the 
Company has robust succession planning arrangements in place.
As announced on 14 February 2018, I will step down from the 
Board following the conclusion of the Company’s AGM on 24 
May 2018 and Jonathan Nicholls will become Chairman of the 
Board. Jonathan’s proposed appointment as Chairman follows 
a rigorous and detailed process conducted by the Nomination 
Committee, assisted by Zygos Partnership. Tracey Graham 
chaired the Nomination Committee when it was dealing with 
the appointment of a successor to the chairmanship.
Ensuring the Directors’ independence and commitment 
to their roles
In making recommendations to the Board on Non-Executive 
Director appointments, the Nomination Committee specifically 
considers the expected time commitment of the proposed 
Non-Executive Director and their existing commitments. 
Agreement of the Board is also required before a Director may 
accept any additional commitments to ensure possible conflicts 
of interest are identified and that they will continue to have 
sufficient time available to devote to the Company. Any other 
potential conflicts of interest are also considered at each 
Board meeting.
The Company’s Articles of Association, which are in line with 
the Companies Act 2006, allow the Board to authorise potential 
conflicts of interest that may arise and to impose limits or 
conditions, as appropriate, when giving any authorisation. 
During the year, and as at the date of this report, no conflicts were 
reported to the Board.
We reviewed the independence of Non-Executive Directors and 
formed the conclusion that the independent Non-Executive 
Directors named on pages 50 and 51 continue to be regarded 
as independent.
We reviewed the training requirements of the Board and 
agreed upon a suitable regime. The Chairman and the 
Company Secretary continue to identify broader areas of training 
for the Board as a whole and the Chairman will discuss and 
agree the training requirements with individual Directors as and 
when required.
We considered the time commitment required from the Non-
Executive Directors. The Nomination Committee concluded, 
through discussions with the Chairman and the Board and 
Committee evaluation process, that the Non-Executive Directors 
had committed sufficient time to fulfil their duties and that their 
performance continued to be effective.
Re-election of Directors
The composition of the Board has been reviewed by the 
Nomination Committee to ensure there is an effective balance 
of skills, experience and knowledge.
All Directors will retire at the AGM and those that wish to 
continue in office will offer themselves for election or re-election 
by shareholders.
Diversity
The Board acknowledges the aims, objectives and 
recommendations outlined in the Hampton-Alexander Review 
which is focused on ensuring talented women succeed by 
removing barriers to their success, and continuing to drive 
forward the momentum of the Davies Review – “Women on 
Boards”. We are aware of the need to achieve an appropriate 
balance of women on our Board and in senior positions 
throughout the Group. The Board also acknowledges the aims, 
objectives and recommendations of the Parker Review on ethnic 
diversity and the increased emphasis in the Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules on disclosure around diversity with 
regard to aspects such as age, gender and educational and 
professional background.
The Board does not, however, consider that it is in the best 
interests of the Group, or its shareholders, to set prescriptive 
diversity targets on the Board, or at senior management level, 
and we will continue to make appointments based on merit, 
against objective criteria to ensure we appoint the best individual 
for each role.
Approximately 17% of the Board are female, as at the date of this 
Report, and 14% of a population of senior managers are female. 
Additional information regarding the gender split across the 
Group can be found on page 27 of the Strategic Report. 
Board and Committee effectiveness
The Nomination Committee arranged an annual performance 
evaluation to be undertaken of the effectiveness of the Board, each 
Committee of the Board and of the contribution of each Director. 
The evaluation process took the form of a questionnaire 
completed by all members of the Board and the Company 
Secretary. A report on the outcome of the evaluation of the 
Nomination Committee’s effectiveness was presented to the 
Board and its Committees in December 2017 . The conclusion 
drawn from the review was that the Nomination Committee had 
operated effectively.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 56 Ibstock plc Highlights
Assessed risk management and internal 
controls systems as being effective
Reviewed the significant judgements made 
by management in preparing the 2017 
financial statements
Oversaw the successful transition of the 
external auditor 
Financial reporting
The Group maintains a financial control environment that is 
regularly reviewed by the Board. The principal elements of the 
control environment include comprehensive management and 
financial reporting systems and processes, defined operating 
controls and authorisation limits, regular Board meetings, clear 
subsidiary board and operating structures, and an outsourced 
Internal Audit function.
Internal control and risk management systems relating to 
the financial reporting process and the process for preparing 
consolidated accounts ensure the accuracy and timeliness of 
internal and external financial reporting.
Throughout each year, monthly detailed reforecasts, covering the 
income statement, cash flow and balance sheet are performed 
by each area of the Group and are consolidated to provide an 
updated view of expected performance for the current year. 
Ongoing financial performance is monitored through regular 
weekly reporting and monthly reporting cycles to Executive 
Directors and monthly reporting to the Board, which allows 
management to assess performance, and identify risks and 
opportunities at the earliest opportunity. 
Capital investment and all revenue expenditure is regulated by a 
budgetary process and authorisation levels, with post-investment 
and period end reviews as required. A comprehensive budgeting 
system allows managers to submit detailed budgets which are 
reviewed and amended by the Executive Directors prior to 
submission to the Board for approval.
The Group has an established and well understood management 
structure with documented levels for the authorisation of business 
transactions and clear bank mandates to control the approval of 
payments. The Group’s cash resources are managed by a 
centralised Treasury function.
Internal management reporting and external statutory reporting 
timetables and delivery requirements are well established, 
documented and controlled at the Group centre. 
The Group maintains computer systems to record and 
consolidate all of its financial transactions. These ledger systems 
are used to produce the information for the monthly management 
accounts, and for the annual statutory financial statements. The 
trading subsidiaries within the Group prepare their accounts 
under Financial Reporting Standard (“FRS”) 102. 
The accounts production process ensures that there is a clear 
audit trail from the output of the Group’s financial reporting 
systems, through the conversion and consolidation processes, 
to the Group’s financial statements.
Internal controls
The Board remains responsible for the effectiveness of internal 
control and risk management and keeps the systems under 
regular review.
The Board as a whole discusses, challenges and approves the 
Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Group’s systems of internal control are based on assessment 
of risk and a framework of control procedures to manage risks 
and to monitor compliance with procedures. The internal control 
systems are designed to meet the Group’s particular needs and 
the risks to which it is exposed and, by their nature, can provide 
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material loss to 
the Group or material misstatement in the financial accounts.
The Group has an ongoing process for the identification, 
evaluation and management of significant business risks, which 
has been in place for the year under review and up to the date 
of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts. The Board has, 
during the year, identified and evaluated the key risks and has 
ensured that effective controls and procedures are in place to 
manage these risks (see pages 32 to 37).
The Executive Directors meet regularly with representatives from 
the businesses to address financial, human resource, legal, risk 
management and other control issues.
The Board also retains its responsibility to approve the annual 
budget. Monitoring of the annual budget, following approval, is 
carried out through regular updates against budget circulated 
as part of the Chief Financial Officer’s report to the Board. In 
addition, the Board reviews all significant capital expenditure 
requests separately, after a general approval for the quantum of 
the capital expenditure budget has been granted. Measures such 
as these ensure that adequate levels of control and scrutiny are 
maintained over the budget and capital expenditure at Board 
level. The Board recognises that its Committees are generally 
only empowered to make recommendations to the Board for 
their approval, unless a specific authorisation to approve certain 
matters is granted. To facilitate information flows, a verbal update 
is given by the Chairman of the relevant Committee in the 
subsequent Board meeting following a Committee meeting.
The Audit Committee, on the Board’s behalf, has conducted 
a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of risk 
management and internal control during the year, in accordance 
with the FRC’s guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business Reporting. Details of the 
review can be found in the Audit Committee Report on page 61.
Risk management 
The Group’s risk management process includes both top-down 
and bottom-up elements to the identification, evaluation and 
management of risks.
Risk arises from the operations of, and strategic decisions taken 
by, every business and our approach to risk management is not to 
eliminate risk entirely, but rather provide the structural means with 
which to identify, prioritise and manage the risks involved in our 
activities. The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the 
Group’s risk management processes and internal control systems.
The Board has considered the nature and extent of risks it is 
willing to take in pursuit of the Group’s strategic objectives. It has 
assessed the Group’s risk appetite, which is set to balance 
opportunities for business development and growth in areas of 
potentially higher risk, whilst maintaining our reputation and high 
levels of customer satisfaction.
Accountability
Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 57
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information The Group’s appetite for risk is set depending upon the particular 
risk associated with our Group strategy: 
 – Safety – there is a low tolerance for health and safety related 
risks and no appetite for non-compliance with related health 
and safety legislation and statutory requirements;
 – Invest – the criteria for investment allocates the Group’s 
resources in a manner consistent with the Group’s strategy and 
planned internal rates of return; and 
 – Innovate – whilst delivering activity aimed at introducing 
innovative products, the Group accepts short-term margin 
dilution, but aims for market-leading operating margins and 
returns on capital. 
Following the appointment of RSM LLP as the Group’s 
outsourced Internal Auditor during 2016, an independent 
programme of audits was approved by the Audit Committee for 
completion in 2017 . At each of its meetings, the Audit Committee 
received an update from the outsourced provider as to progress 
in completion of the approved Internal Audit plan, details of any 
findings noted to date in completion of reviews, and management’s 
responses to recommendations resulting from the audits. 
The internal audit reviews conducted by the outsourced provider 
supplemented management’s own operational audit activities. 
The results of these management activities were reported to the 
Audit Committee throughout the year.
In considering the risks to which the Group is exposed, risk 
matrices are maintained and reviewed by each subsidiary entity 
within the Group. These matrices are the result of input and 
challenge undertaken by the senior managers within the entity 
and the Group’s Executive Directors, and are refreshed at least 
once per annum. At a Group level, the Board reviews these 
matrices and the analysis of potential exposures which exist 
within them. Risks are reviewed and monitored on an on-going 
basis using consistent measurement criteria.
The Audit Committee supports the Board in monitoring the risk 
exposures and is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of 
our risk management and internal control systems. The Audit 
Committee is assisted by the Group’s outsourced Internal Audit 
function in evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
our risk strategies and the internal controls implemented by 
management. During 2017 , no significant failings or weaknesses 
in the Group’s internal controls were identified. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Group-wide 
risks and mitigation prepared by management and informed by 
the subsidiary risk matrices. This review formed a key component 
of the Directors’ robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group – including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. These are set 
out in the table on pages 34 to 37 .
The Group’s Risk Management Framework is illustrated on 
page 33.
Risk management framework 
To effectively manage risk, operational level controls are 
embedded across the Group and form a key part of day-to-day 
processes. 
During 2017 , a key component of the Directors’ assessment of 
risk was management’s review of the risk matrices prepared by 
each subsidiary entity.
The Board maintained its ultimate responsibility for the Group’s 
control monitoring and provided direction to management in its 
assessment of Group-wide risk. 
Fair, balanced and understandable – a matter for the 
entire Board
As part of its considerations as to whether the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provide information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy, 
the Board took into account the following:
 – the Chairman and Chief Executive provided input to and agreed 
on the overall messages and tone of the Annual Report and 
Accounts at an early stage; 
 – individual sections of the Annual Report and Accounts were 
drafted by appropriate senior management with regular review 
meetings to ensure consistency of the entire document;
 – detailed reviews of appropriate draft sections of the 
Annual Report and Accounts were undertaken by the 
Executive Directors;
 – an advanced draft was reviewed by the Audit Committee and 
the auditors on a timely basis to allow sufficient consideration 
and was discussed with the Chief Financial Officer and senior 
management prior to consideration by the Board; and
 – the Chief Financial Officer, in his February 2018 Board paper, 
included a checklist of areas that the Board should take into 
account in considering the fairness, consistency and balance 
of the final draft of the Annual Report and Accounts including 
whether the Board considers that there are any omissions 
in information.
The Fair, Balanced and Understandable Statement appears on 
page 63.

for the year ended 31 December 2017 .
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the

preparation of the Viability Statement using a three-year lookout 
period, given the general comments provided by regulators 
during 2017 as to the prevalence of this time frame in 
companies’ viability statements. Following discussion, the 
Committee concurred with management as to the choice of 
a three-year period. The Viability Statement and the Going

 – Considered the adequacy of the Group’s procedures with 
regard to the objectivity and independence of the external 
auditor.
Internal Audit
 – Agreed a plan of work for the 2017/2018 Internal Audit 
programme with RSM and received reports from them on 
the Internal Audit programme conducted during the year. 
In reviewing the proposed plan of work, the Committee 
questioned the Internal Auditor and management as to the 
composition of the plan. This considered any specific areas 
of risk identified by either party in formulating the schedule. 
Following discussion, the Committee was satisfied with the 
2017/2018 work programme.
 – The Committee met with RSM, without management present 
on two occasions.
Audit Committee effectiveness
 – Received updates from Deloitte on compliance and changes 
in corporate governance matters and the regulatory framework.
 – Conducted the annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
Audit Committee.
 – Reviewed the Committee’s terms of reference and confirmed 
that they remained appropriate.
 – Reviewed training requirements of Committee members and 
received training and technical updates from the Company 
Secretary and Deloitte.
Accounting and key areas of judgement
A key factor in the integrity of financial statements is ensuring that 
suitable accounting policies are adopted and applied consistently 
on a year on year basis. The Audit Committee specifically uses 
the Audit Planning meetings in May and November each year to 
consider proposed accounting treatments for major transactions, 
significant reporting judgements and key assumptions related to 
those judgements. In addition, these matters are reviewed 
throughout the year.

Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Significant issues considered by the Committee during the year
Matter considered Committee’s response
Pension accounting
The Group has a defined benefit pension scheme 
in the UK, which was closed to future accrual 
from 1 February 2017 . Judgement is taken by 
management around the assumptions used, 
including the sensitivities to these assumptions, 
used by its actuary, to calculate the pension 
scheme assets and liabilities under IAS 19 (R) 
Employee benefits.
As at 31 December 2017 , in the UK scheme 
there was an actuarial accounting surplus of 
£46.1 million, as detailed in Note 20 to the 
financial statements.
The Committee reviewed the assumptions with management and sought views 
from the external auditor before it concluded on the appropriateness of the 
actuarial balances disclosed.
This review considered the financial assumptions used by management as part 
of the actuarial valuation and the range of possible assumptions using available 
market data to assess the reasonableness.
The Committee considered management’s judgement with regard to the Group’s 
ability to recognise a pension scheme surplus and assessed the legal advice 
received. The Committee arrived at the conclusion that management’s application 
of IFRIC 14 was appropriate. See also Note 2 to the financial statements on 
page 104.
In conclusion, the Audit Committee concluded that the actuarial assumptions 
used in the valuation of the period end pension liabilities were in an acceptable 
range and disclosed appropriately.
See also the Independent Auditor’s Report on page 89.
Indicators of impairment
The Group holds significant asset values in the 
form of mineral reserves, land and buildings and 
property, plant and equipment. These assets 
were subject to a detailed fair value exercise upon 
acquisition of the trading entities in February 
2015. For a number of assets, this exercise 
utilised the business’ performance projections in 
arriving at the fair value ascribed. Should actual 
performance subsequently fall below these 
projections, impairment of the asset values may 
be required under IAS 36 Impairment of assets. 
As at 31 December 2017 , the value of these 
non-current assets was £516 million.
The Committee considered the processes adopted by management in assessing 
whether, in their judgement, any indicators of impairment existed and whether any 
subsequent detailed impairment testing should be undertaken.
The Committee carefully considered management’s sensitivity analysis and 
assessed the impact on the analysis of changes to the underlying assumptions.
Following its review, the Committee concurred with management’s judgement 
that no indicators of impairment existed at the balance sheet date and, as such, 
no detailed impairment testing was required.
Management confirmed to the Committee that they were not aware of any 
misstatements, either material or immaterial, in the documents and information 
underpinning their assessment.
In conclusion, after reviewing the reports from management and consulting where 
necessary with the external auditors, the Committee was satisfied that the 
financial statements appropriately reported the value of the assets and that they 
were fairly stated.
Alternative Performance Measures
The Group presents a number of alternative 
performance measures (“APMs”) within its 
published financial information, including its 2017 
Annual Report and Accounts, with the objective 
of providing readers with a better understanding 
of financial performance in the period, in order to 
facilitate comparison with future periods and to 
assess trends in financial performance.
In light of the guidance issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority 
and the UK’s Financial Reporting Council, the Committee has understood and 
challenged management’s rationale for including an item as an exceptional item 
and the use of APMs.
Through discussion with management and the external auditor, the Committee 
has also sought to ensure that the policy for APMs is applied consistently and in 
compliance with the guidance provided.
Following these discussions, the Committee requested that management revise 
its Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) measure to ensure the revised 
calculation would result in fewer adjustments to statutory definitions, contain 
components more easily reconciled to the statutory financial statements, and 
(where relevant) provide a more consistent comparison with the Group’s peers.
The Committee concluded that the presentation of APMs gave additional clarity 
on performance and was reconciled appropriately to reported amounts, with 
sufficient prominence, thereby satisfying the requirements.
Audit Committee Report continued
Accountability continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 62 Ibstock plc Going Concern and Viability Statements
As requested by the Board, the Audit Committee reviewed the 
Going Concern and Viability Statements prepared with the 
assistance of management, together with the supporting 
documentation and sensitivity analyses. Details of the review 
process and the conclusion reached are set out on page 42. 
Following its review, the Audit Committee recommended the 
approval of both statements to the Board.
Fair, balanced and understandable
It is the Board’s responsibility to determine whether the 2017 
Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable. The Committee reviewed the process for 
preparing the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, reviewed 
management’s analysis of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts 
and how this met the objectives of providing fair, balanced and 
understandable disclosures, before forming the conclusion to 
recommend that the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts be 
approved by the Board as fair, balanced and understandable. 
Specifically, this included detailed consideration of the Alternative 
Performance Measures used within the 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts (see above significant issue considered by the 
Committee during the year). The Committee concurred with 
management that the effective use of such measures added 
greater insight for readers of the financial statements and aided 
comparisons over time and between companies. The Committee 
considered the impact of such measures on the fair, balanced 
and understandable nature of the report to ensure that the use 
of APMs did not obscure the “true and fair” nature of the 2017 
Annual Report and Accounts. The Committee’s role in that 
process is covered on page 62.
Internal controls and risk management
The Committee supports the Board’s assessment of 
principal risks and the Board’s review of the Group’s internal 
financial controls, as well as the internal controls and risk 
management process.
Internal Audit
Following the appointment of RSM LLP as the Group’s 
outsourced Internal Audit provider during 2016, the Committee 
received updates at each meeting on the progress against the 
agreed Internal Audit plan for 2017 . The rolling programme of 
reviews completed in 2017 included audits of the inventory 
management, purchase to pay, and sales to cash processes 
across the Group’s subsidiary entities. RSM also audited the 
financial close process and completed payroll reviews across 
remaining entities not covered in the prior year. In addition, 
the Committee requested a specific review of expenditure on 
the ongoing major capital project.
The external audit and review of its effectiveness
The Committee advises the Board on the appointment/
reappointment of the external auditors, their effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity, and discusses the nature and 
results of the audit with the external auditors. As part of the review 
of the effectiveness of the external audit process, the Committee 
conducted a formal evaluation process incorporating views from 
the relevant members of management. 
These reviews included:
 – the effectiveness of the external audit firm;
 – quality controls;
 – the audit team;
 – audit fee;
 – audit communications and effectiveness;
 – governance and independence;
 – ethical standards; and
 – potential impairment of independence by non-audit fee income.
In addition to the review of the formal management letter from the 
external auditors, which outlines how points raised by them have 
been addressed by management, feedback is sought from the 
external auditors on the conduct of members of the finance team 
during the audit process. I have also met with the lead audit 
partners outside the formal Committee process.
The external auditors are responsible for the annual statutory 
audits of the Group’s subsidiaries and other services which the 
Committee believe they are best placed to provide.
The Committee also considers the effectiveness of management 
in the external audit process in respect of the timely identification 
and resolution of areas of accounting judgement with input from 
the external auditors as appropriate; and the timely provision of 
the draft half-year results announcement and Annual Report and 
Accounts for review by the auditors and the Committee.
Having undertaken its review, the Committee is satisfied that the 
external auditor has been independent and effective. Deloitte has 
indicated its willingness to continue in office and the Committee 
has recommended Deloitte’s re-appointment to the Board. 
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte as the external auditor will 
therefore be proposed at the AGM to be held in May 2018.
This year is the first year that Deloitte has audited the Group’s 
financial statements. The lead audit partner is Jonathan 
Dodworth. Deloitte requires the lead audit partner to change after 
five years. As part of the 2017 audit, Deloitte confirmed that it was 
independent within the meaning of applicable regulatory and 
professional requirements. Taking this into account, and having 
considered the steps taken by Deloitte to preserve its 
independence, the Committee concluded that Deloitte continues 
to demonstrate appropriate independence and objectivity.

Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Audit Committee Report continued
Audit fee and non-audit services 
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor are set in Note 
6 to the Group consolidated financial statements. During the year 
Deloitte provided non-audit services in respect of the review of 
the interim financial statements for the six-month period ended 
30 June 2017 (£50,000) and of the management’s banking 
covenant compliance certification as at 31 December 2016 
(£6,000). Both services were for audit-related services and 
represent services that were carried out by members of the audit 
engagement team where the work involved is closely related to 
the work performed in the audit. The Committee considers that 
the external auditor continues to remain independent.
The non-audit services policy sets out clearly the non-audit 
services that may be provided by the external auditor. Under 
the policy, prior approval is required by the Committee for any 
non-statutory assignments where the fee would exceed £10,000, 
or where such an assignment would take the cumulative total of 
non-audit fees paid to the external auditors over 70% of that 
year’s statutory audit fees. However, when appropriate, a detailed 
calculation will be performed to ensure that the Group is 
compliant with the European Union’s New Statutory Audit 
Framework, which applied from 2017 .
Fraud, whistleblowing and the Bribery Act
The Committee is informed of any reported incidents under its 
whistleblowing policy. This policy is included in the Employee 
Handbook and sets out the procedure for employees to raise 
legitimate concerns about any wrongdoing in financial reporting 
or other matters such as:
 – potentially unlawful acts;
 – miscarriage of justice;
 – danger to the health and safety of any individual;
 – damage to the environment; or
 – improper conduct.
There were no concerns notified to the Group that required the 
attention of the Committee during the period under review and up 
to the date of this report. The fact that employees have used the 
whistleblowing hot line provides assurance to the Board that the 
system is working and that our colleagues are comfortable with 
the process.
The Committee also reviews the Group’s procedure for detecting 
fraud and the systems and controls in place to prevent a breach 
of anti-bribery legislation. The Group is committed to a zero-
tolerance position with regard to bribery. Anti-bribery guidance 
and training is provided to employees, as appropriate, applying 
what the Group has determined to be a risk-based and 
proportionate approach. The Group maintains a record of all 
employees who have received this guidance and training.
Committee effectiveness 
The effectiveness of the Committee was reviewed by both the 
Board and the Committee, in compliance with the Code. The 
evaluation was conducted by means of a questionnaire which 
was completed by all members of the Board and the Company 
Secretary. A report on the outcome of the evaluation of the 
Committee’s effectiveness was presented to the Board. The 
conclusion drawn from the review was that the Committee 
operates effectively.
The Committee considers that it has acted in accordance with its 
Terms of Reference and that it has ensured the independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness of the external and internal auditors.
The Company has complied throughout the year under review, 
and up to the date of this report, with the provisions of the 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
I shall be available to answer any questions about the Committee, 
our work and how we operate at the AGM on 24 May 2018.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder,
As the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
(“the Committee”), I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 .
This year, I was delighted to become Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee when Lynn Minella stepped down from the position 
on 31 December 2017 . All of us are very grateful to Lynn for her 
contribution and thank her for her dedicated service to the 
Committee. Following her example, my focus will be to continue 
to maintain a dialogue with our shareholders on remuneration 
matters and to ensure that the remuneration structure at Ibstock 
reflects best-practice standards. I have been a member of the 
Ibstock Committee for two years and also have significant 
experience as a Remuneration Committee Chair.
2017 has been a year of continued progress in our performance 
across all businesses with strong cash generation and shareholder 
value creation, including payments of dividends and sustained 
share price growth. 
After 22 successful years with the Group, including the last two 
as Chief Executive Officer of Ibstock plc, Wayne Sheppard 
announced his intention to retire in 2018. I would like to personally 
thank Wayne for his significant contribution to Ibstock’s 
performance. Wayne steered the Company through its 
successful IPO in 2015 and under his leadership Ibstock has 
delivered significant shareholder value in its first years as a public 
listed company.
Wayne will be succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by Joe 
Hudson, formerly Managing Director, Cement & Concrete 
Products at Aggregate Industries UK, who joined the Board as 
Chief Executive Officer Designate in January 2018.
Wayne will step down from the Board as Chief Executive Officer 
after a handover period but I am delighted to say that Wayne’s 
vast expertise will remain available to the Company until the end 
of 2018.
Members of the Committee as at the date of this report:
 – Tracey Graham (Chair)
 – Jonathan Nicholls
 – Jamie Pike
 – Justin Read
Structure of the report
 – Remuneration Committee Chair’s Annual Statement (pages 66 
and 67).
 – Directors’ Remuneration Report “At a glance” (pages 68 to 73).
 – Annual Report on Remuneration (including the summary 
approved Remuneration Policy) (pages 74 to 83).
The Remuneration Committee reviews the Policy on an ongoing 
basis and is comfortable that it remains appropriate as the 
structure by which to incentivise and motivate the leadership team 
to implement the Company’s strategic goals and ensure they are 
aligned with shareholder expectations heading into the 2018 
financial year. 
The application of the Remuneration Policy is therefore 
unchanged for 2018. The Committee will conduct a full review of 
the Remuneration Policy and its appropriateness in the coming 
year, as the new Chief Executive Officer comes on board and our 
current Policy reaches the end of its three-year term.
This report lays out the core principles of our Policy and our 
practices over the past year. I trust we have done this with the 
transparency and clarity that aids your understanding of both our 
intent and our activity.
Company highlights for the 2017 financial year
The Company has shown growth in 2017 with turnover increased 
by 4% to £452 million and adjusted earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) increased to 
£120 million (2016: £112 million), driven by our UK clay and 
concrete businesses.
Financial highlights for the year include:
 – Group revenue – £452 million;
 – Adjusted EBITDA – £120 million; and
 – Profit after tax – £74 million; reflecting the underlying strength 
of the business.
Operational highlights include:
 – UK Clay benefited from good activity levels within the UK 
new build housing sector with brick volumes well ahead year 
on year;
 – Continued growth in UK Concrete; and
 – Investment in additional UK brick capacity to meet demand.
In the US, revenue was down by 2%, principally reflecting a more 
competitive new build residential market and a less favourable 
product mix.
Further details of performance against the Company’s key 
performance indicators are detailed on pages 24 and 25 and the 
Financial Review on pages 38 to 42.
Remuneration Committee Chair’s  
Annual Statement
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 66 Ibstock plc Incentive outcomes in 2017
In line with our remuneration philosophy, incentive outcomes 
are largely driven by corporate performance and shareholder 
value creation.
The annual bonus for our Executive Directors, which is based 
60% on the Group’s financial performance, 20% on strategic 
measures and 20% on individual objectives, reflects the overall 
Group performance this year and paid out at 58.5%-59.5% of 
maximum opportunity. Further details of the annual bonus targets 
for the year and performance against those targets are provided 
on page 74. 
No long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) award vested in the year. The 
first grant of LTIP awards was made in 2016 and will vest in 2019.
Remuneration Committee decisions made during 2017
The Company’s remuneration strategy is designed to motivate 
our senior leaders to deliver strategic objectives, ensure customer 
focus based on quality and consistency, and to drive long-term 
value for our shareholders. These core elements are captured in 
our incentive framework for the Executive Directors. Further 
details of how our incentives and their measures align to the 
Company’s key strategic objectives can be found on page 68.
The Remuneration Policy was approved at the 2016 AGM on 
26 May 2016 and the Committee believe that it supports Ibstock’s 
business and remuneration strategy. No changes have been 
made to the Policy or its proposed operation for the coming year. 
The Committee will conduct a full review of the Remuneration 
Policy in 2018 in advance of a new Remuneration Policy to be put 
to shareholders at the 2019 AGM.
Key decisions made by the Committee during, and for, the 
financial year include:
 – Salary increase of 2.2% was awarded to the Chief Financial 
Officer, in line with the increase provided to the employee 
population. No increase was awarded to the outgoing Chief 
Executive Officer given his retirement from the business.
 – The Committee determined that the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer should receive annual performance 
bonus in respect of 2017 equal to 73.1% and 74.4% of base 
salary respectively, reflecting performance against the 
measures for the year.
 – 2017 LTIP awards of 100% of salary were granted to Wayne 
Sheppard and Kevin Sims. The grant levels and performance 
targets for the LTIP are consistent with the normal award policy 
– further details of the awards are provided on page 75. No 
LTIP award vested in the year as the first awards under the plan 
were made in 2016 which will vest in 2019.
 – The terms of Joe Hudson’s appointment as Chief Executive 
Officer Designate were approved by the Committee (details are 
available on page 79).
 – The arrangements in respect of Wayne Sheppard’s retirement 
from the business (details are available on page 79).
Further details on how our Remuneration Policy will be applied in 
practice for the 2018 financial year are set out on page 79. 
From January 2017 , we welcomed Justin Reed as a Non-
Executive Director and a member of the Remuneration 
Committee. Justin brings with him a wealth of experience, 
including Group Finance Director roles held at Segro and Speedy 
Hire, that will be of great benefit to Ibstock as we continue to 
develop our business.
Fairness and diversity
Creating a thriving and diverse workforce is a high priority for our 
business. However we recognise that we operate in an industry 
that historically has been associated with certain inherent 
challenges around diversity. We are fully committed to embracing 
the new developments in regulation and best practice to ensure 
that we, as a business, are contributing to the shift in the 
industry’s outlook and approach from the perspective of gender 
equality and diversity of skills, background and knowledge.
Shareholder engagement
We will continue to engage with our shareholders in a two-way 
communication process to maintain this support and to ensure 
we have a transparent executive reward structure aligned to 
shareholder experience. If you would like to discuss any further 
aspect of our remuneration strategy I would welcome your views.
We monitor shareholder reaction and commentary regarding our 
remuneration practices. At the recent Annual General Meetings 
shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favour of our current 
Remuneration Policy and the 2016 Remuneration Report (with 
99.36% and 99.39%, respectively). The details of the voting 
outcomes are presented on page 78.

Introduction
In this section, we:
1 –  set out the purpose of our Remuneration Policy and its linkage 
to our corporate strategic objectives; and
2 –  set out the remuneration outcomes for the 2017 financial year.
Our Remuneration Policy and its link to our Group strategy
The Group’s strategy is laid out below.
Ensuring the alignment of the Remuneration Policy to the 
Company’s strategy remains key for the Remuneration 
Committee in operating the Policy below in conjunction with 
our core principles of remuneration.
Strategic priorities

The maximum bonus 
(including any part of the 
bonus deferred into an 
Annual Deferred Bonus 
Plan (“ADBP”) Award) 
deliverable under the 
ADBP will not exceed 
125% of a participant’s 
annual base salary.
Net Promoter Score (“NPS”)

These measures target 
customer satisfaction and 
health and safety in the 
workplace and therefore 
support this objective.

The success in maximising 
operational excellence will be 
reflected through increased 
profitability and cash flow 
and the efficiency of any 
investment made through 
ROCE measurement.
ROCE, Adjusted EBITDA, 
Adjusted Operating Cash 
Flow, NPS
The efficient development of 
innovative products measured 
through ROCE and NPS 
performance will be reflected 
in increased profitability and 
cash flow. 
LTIP
Maximum annual award is 
normally 100% of salary.
Awards will vest at the end of 
three years.
For 2018, the performance 
conditions for awards are 
equally weighted between:
 – Adjusted Earnings per 
Share (“EPS”) growth; and
 – comparative Total 
Shareholder Return (“TSR”).
Adjusted EPS, TSR
The success in maximising 
operational excellence will 
be measured through the 
long-term Adjusted EPS 
growth targeted by the LTIP . 
In addition, sustained value 
generation will be reflected 
in the share price of the 
Company which will be 
measured through the 
Company’s TSR performance 
under the LTIP .
TSR
The generation of cash and 
profit growth targeted by the 
annual bonus will help 
enhance the value of the 
Company which will be 
measured through the 
success of the Company’s 
TSR performance against its 
comparators (a performance 
condition under the LTIP).

Our core principals of remuneration
 – To ensure senior executives are attracted, retained and 
motivated to drive the strategic development of the Company;
 – To incentivise the management team in extending the 
Company’s position in the building products industry; and
 – To deliver long-term sustainable growth.
The key elements of the Company’s strategy and how its 
successful implementation is linked to the Company’s 
remuneration are set out in the following table.

Annual bonus outcomes
Our 2017 bonus outcomes outlined below reflect the performance measures and targets put in place during our 2017 financial year and 
their level of satisfaction. The bonus measures for the Executive Directors are aligned to the Company’s key performance indicators 
(“KPIs”) which are outlined on pages 24 and 25.
Bonus value achieved
2017 bonus measures Wayne Sheppard Kevin Sims

Directors). Two-thirds of the 2017 bonus was paid in cash and one-third was deferred into shares for a period of three years.
Further details on the bonus outcomes can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 74.
Single figure remuneration for our Executive Directors
We set out below the single figure remuneration for our Executive Directors:
Executive Directors 2016 total 2017 total
Wayne Sheppard (CEO) £788,685 £906,300
Kevin Sims (CFO) £509,544 £625,223
The single figure table containing information for the 2016 and 2017 financial year for the Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors is set out in detail on page 74.
Equity exposure of the Executive Directors
Both existing Executive Directors have shareholdings substantially in excess of the Company’s minimum shareholding requirements 
which are currently 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 150% for the Chief Financial Officer.

Fairness, diversity and wider workforce considerations 
Ibstock is committed to creating an inclusive working environment and to rewarding our employees throughout the organisation in a fair 
manner. In making decisions on executive pay, the Remuneration Committee considers wider workforce remuneration and conditions. 
We believe that employees throughout the Company should be able to share in the success of the Company. We have, since our IPO, 
operated a very popular Save As you Earn (“SAYE”) plan and our intention is to continue this and to investigate additional opportunities 
for our employees to share in our success going forwards. We also believe that employees should have the opportunity to save for their 
futures and to this end we operate defined contribution Group personal pension plans in to which the Company and our employees 
make contributions.
As part of our commitment to fairness, we have introduced this section into our remuneration reporting which sets out more information 
on our wider workforce pay conditions, our CEO to employee pay ratio, our Gender Pay statistics, and our Diversity and Inclusion 
policy. Whilst we recognise there is much work still to do, we believe that transparency is an important first step towards making 
improvements in relation to these important issues. 
Area Considerations
Competitive 
pay and 
cascade of 
incentives
The Committee ensures that pay is fair throughout the Company and makes decisions in relation to the structure of 
executive pay in the context of the cascade of incentives throughout the business. The Committee’s remit extends 
down to Executives and senior management for which it recommends and monitors the level and structure of 
remuneration.

Statement of considerations of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Remuneration Policy for all employees is determined in terms of best practice and ensuring that the Company is 
able to attract and retain the best people. This principle is followed in the development of our Policy.
The remuneration strategy of the Company has been designed to ensure all employees share in its success through 
performance-related remuneration and share ownership. Awards under both the Annual and Deferred Bonus Plan 
and the Long-Term Incentive Plan will provide alignment between senior leaders and our shareholders based on 
overall corporate performance of the business.
For all UK employees, the Company has in place an SAYE Scheme and SIP (with local equivalents in other 
jurisdictions where possible). Currently, under these Plans all UK employees have the opportunity to purchase 
shares in the Company subject to certain restrictions.
The following table demonstrates how key objectives are reflected consistently in plans operating at all levels within 
the Company.

The Company uses a number of remuneration comparison measurements to assess fairness of pay structures 
across the Group. Detailed disclosure of our approach to fairness, diversity and wider workforce considerations is 
presented on page 70. In setting the Remuneration Policy for Directors, the pay and conditions of other employees 
of the Company are taken into account to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Company, including data 
on the remuneration structure for management level tiers below the Executive Directors, average base salary 
increases awarded to the overall employee population and the cascade of pay structures throughout the business.
As a Remuneration Committee, we are keenly aware of the sensitivity of shareholders and the wider public 
regarding remuneration, including the Government’s ongoing considerations for reforms to the governance 
framework in respect of executive pay. The Committee will continue to monitor developments closely and intends 
to embrace these changes and continue to comply with best practice reporting requirements as they come 
into force.
Pay 
comparisons
CEO ratio 
Our CEO to average employee pay ratio for 2017 is 22.5. This was measured as the ratio of CEO single figure pay 
realised in the year to average employee pay. To give context to this ratio, we have set out below a chart tracking 
CEO pay and average employee pay over time (where 2015 = 100) alongside Ibstock’s TSR performance over the 
same period. 
The Remuneration Committee has always been committed to ensure that CEO pay is commensurate with 
performance. The chart shows a clear alignment between shareholder returns and CEO single figure pay.

1 –  The Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration disclosed in the table above has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits 
excluding pension and annual bonus (including any amount deferred).
2 –  The employee pay has been calculated using the following elements: annual salary – base salary and standard monthly allowances, taxable 
benefits – car allowance and private medical insurance premiums; annual bonus – Company bonus, management bonus, commission and 
incentive payments. 
3 –  The change in the CEO’s taxable benefits was primarily due, as reported in the previous year, to a move from the company car policy to 
a car allowance.
Gender pay The UK Government Equalities Office legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees in the UK to 
disclose annually information on their gender pay gap. The first disclosure of the pay gap is based on amounts 
paid in the year to 5 April 2017 . The bonus gap is based on incentives paid in respect of the year to 5 April 2017 . 
As Ibstock Brick is the largest employing entity, we have chosen to report these figures in this report.
The mean gender pay gap at Ibstock Brick is 7%. This is significantly lower than the UK average of 17 .4% and the 
average for companies in the construction sector of 18.1%. This is mostly due to demographics within the Company. 
This can clearly be seen in the quartiles set out opposite, which show the number of male and female employees in 
each pay quartile:

Note: The figures quoted above are for the Ibstock Brick entity of Ibstock plc only. 
Ibstock’s current employee population reflects the traditional nature of the industry, with around 85% of roles being 
occupied by men, including a high percentage of males employed in factory based production roles, which is 
reflective of manufacturing as a whole. We are proud of the steps we have already taken and continue to take to 
encourage more females into the business. However, we clearly believe further continued actions need to be taken 
to increase the representation of women within our business.
We are therefore taking a number of actions aimed at encouraging greater diversity and a wide range of candidates 
internally and externally in our recruitment practices for all roles within the Company, including production areas 
where there is a significant under representation of women and where we have a range of diverse roles suitable for 
all. We are starting to get some success with a number of females joining our business in production operative roles 
and we have recently employed our first female electrical apprentice.
We have always offered a range of flexible working arrangements, including part time and job sharing arrangements. 
These arrangements are open to all employees and are decided on a case by case basis in line with our operational 
requirements.
Whilst we already have a number of females in Leadership roles, we have established an internal networking and 
mentoring scheme to provide female role models to support and encourage our female employees to develop and 
grow their careers with us. As part of this we have also formed a link with Aspire, an internationally recognised 
leadership, management and communication skills organisation. Aspire are currently leading a “MAD” (Making 
a Difference) movement focused on coaching and development for women in business.
Diversity policy Our Diversity and Inclusion and range of Family Friendly and Flexible Working policies have been developed to make 
sure we have harmonious working environments, where every person can grow their skills and thrive together to 
share in our success. They also ensure that all job applicants, employees and other workers (such as agency staff 
and consultants) are treated with dignity and respect regardless of any personal characteristics or circumstances.
In 2017 we implemented compliance refresher training for our people to remind everyone of the Company’s policies 
regarding equality and diversity and the commitment to the prevention of discriminatory practices, procedures and 
attitudes in our business. This training will be repeated on an annual basis with existing and new employees. In 
addition we will be carrying out some focused diversity training in 2018, including areas such as overcoming 
unconscious bias.

graph shows the Total Shareholder Return generated by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period 
of dividend income.
The Committee considers that the FTSE 250 is the appropriate index because the Company has been a member of this index since 
listing. This graph has been calculated in accordance with the Regulations. It should be noted that the Company listed on 27 October 
2015 and therefore only has a listed share price for the period of 27 October 2015 to 31 December 2017 .

The Remuneration Committee reviews the Policy on an ongoing basis and is comfortable that it remains appropriate as the structure by 
which to incentivise and motivate the leadership team to implement the Company’s strategic goals and ensure they are aligned with 
shareholder expectations heading into the 2018 financial year. 
The application of the Remuneration Policy is therefore unchanged for 2018. Details of the application of the policy for 2018 financial 
year are outlined on page 79.
Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed terms of reference, responsibility for the Remuneration Policy and for 
determining specific packages for the Executive Directors and other selected members of the senior management team. The Company 
consults with key shareholders in respect of the Remuneration Policy and the introduction of new incentive arrangements.
The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s website, www.ibstockplc.com/investors, and from the 
Company Secretary at the registered office.
Our main responsibilities are:
 – To determine and agree with the Board the broad Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors and other selected members of 
the senior management team;
 – To review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the Remuneration Policy; and
 – To review any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company or Group and to administer all aspects of any 
share scheme.
The Committee receives assistance from the Group HR Director and Company Secretary, who will attend meetings by invitation, except 
when issues relating to their own remuneration are being discussed. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer attend by 
invitation on occasions.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee retained the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) as independent remuneration adviser. During the 
financial year, PwC advised the Committee on all aspects of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and members of the 
Executive team. PwC also provided the Company with tax and accountancy advice during the year. The Committee is satisfied that 
no conflict of interest exists or existed in the provision of these services.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure 
objective and independent advice is given to remuneration committees. Fees of £59,500 (2016: £58,000) were provided to PwC during 
the year in respect of remuneration advice received.

Base salary
For 2018 base salaries will be:
 – Wayne Sheppard: £434,350 (no increase)
 – Joe Hudson: £435,000 (appointment salary)
 – Kevin Sims: £303,197 (2.3% increase)
Proposed salary increase is in line with the rises for all employees.
Pension

20% of gross basic salary.
Benefits
Standard benefits will be provided, including car allowance 
(£20,000 for Wayne Sheppard, £18,000 for Joe Hudson and 
£15,000 for Kevin Sims), private health cover, death in service cover 
and income protection.
See page 74 for further details.
Annual and 
Deferred Bonus 
Plan (“ADBP”)
Cash
Deferred award
For 2018 the maximum bonus opportunity will be 125% of salary for 
all Executive Directors. 
For 2018, the level of deferral in shares will be one-third of the bonus 
earned which will vest after three years based on continued 
employment with the Company. 
The Committee can determine the proportion of the bonus earned 
under the ADBP provided as an award of deferred shares to a 
maximum of 50% of bonus earned. 
The performance conditions and their weightings for the 2018 
annual bonus are as follows: 
 – Adjusted EBITDA (20%);
 – Adjusted Operating Cash Flow (20%);
 – ROCE (20%);
 – NPS (Net Promotor Score) (10%);
 – LTAs (Lost Time Accidents) (10%); and
 – Personal objectives (20%).
LTIP
 – In 2018 the maximum annual LTIP award of 100% of salary will be 
awarded to Joe Hudson and Kevin Sims.
 – The performance conditions for awards will be equally weighted 
between Adjusted Earnings per Share (“EPS”) growth and 
comparative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) assessed over 
a three-year performance period.
 – TSR performance of the Company compared to the FTSE 250 
(excluding financial services, real estate and equity investment 
trusts) – with threshold vesting for median performance against 
the index and full vesting for upper quartile performance; and
 – EPS growth – with threshold performance at 6% per annum 
growth and maximum performance at 16% per annum growth, 
straight line vesting between the points.
 – A two-year holding period will apply to the 2018 LTIP awards 
following vesting.
Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees
The Non-Executive Director fees are to remain the same as the 
previous year. The current fee levels are: 
 – Chairman – £175,000 
 – Board fee (including Committee membership) – £50,000 
 – Committee Chairmanship (per Committee) – £10,000 
 – Senior Independent Director – £5,000
Joe Hudson’s appointment
Joe Hudson joined the Company on 2 January 2018 as CEO designate. Full details of Joe’s remuneration are set out in the table above. 
In addition to the above terms, it was agreed to buy-out, on a fair-value basis, the value forgone by Joe in respect of share awards 
which he forfeited on cessation of employment with his previous employer. The award of 21,570 Ibstock plc ordinary shares of 1 pence 
each takes into account the partial satisfaction of the original performance period at the time of the buy-out. The buy-out award will 
vest, subject to Joe’s continued employment with Ibstock, on the first anniversary of his joining date.

Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Wayne Sheppard’s retirement
As noted on page 66 Wayne Sheppard will step down from the Board as CEO after a handover period. Wayne will remain available to 
the Company until the end of 2018. Full details of Wayne’s leaving terms will be set out in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Summary Remuneration Policy table
A summary of the approved Remuneration Policy is outlined below. No changes to the approved Policy were made in 2017 .
The full Policy as approved by shareholders on 26 May 2016 is available on our website at www.ibstockplc/investors/corporate-governance.
Element of remuneration Operation
Base salary The Committee ensures that maximum salary levels are positioned in line with companies of a similar size to Ibstock in 
the FTSE 250 (excluding financial services, real estate and equity investment trusts), validated against companies 
operating in a similar sector.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Committee considers:
 – remuneration practices within the Group;
 – the general performance of the Group;
 – salaries within the ranges paid by the companies in the comparator group used for remuneration benchmarking;
 – any change in scope, role and responsibilities; and
 – the economic environment.
An Executive Director’s base salary is set on appointment and reviewed annually or when there is a change in position 
or responsibility.
In general, salary increases for Executive Directors will be in line with the increase for employees.
Benefits The Executive Directors receive a company car or car allowance, private health cover, death in service cover and 
income protection.
Additional benefits may be offered such as relocation allowances on recruitment.
The maximum will be set at the cost of providing the benefits described.
Pension The maximum salary supplement in lieu of pension contribution will be 20% of gross basic salary.
Annual and Deferred Bonus 
Plan (“ADBP”)
The Remuneration Committee will determine the maximum annual participation in the Annual Bonus Plan for each year, 
which will not exceed 125% of salary.
The maximum value of deferred shares is 50% of the bonus earned, which vest after a minimum deferral period of three 
years based on continued employment.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
LTIP maximum grant is 100% of salary p.a. (150% in exceptional circumstances).
The Committee considers and sets the performance measures and targets for each LTIP award. See page 75 for the 
details of the 2017 LTIP grant.
The LTIP contains clawback and malus provisions.
Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) 
and The Sharesave Plan
The Company operates a SIP and Sharesave Plan in which the Executive Directors are eligible to participate (which is 
in line with HMRC legislation and is open to all eligible staff) to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the 
Company and thereby align their interests with shareholders.
Minimum shareholding 
requirement
The Committee has adopted formal shareholding guidelines that will encourage the Executive Directors to build up over 
a five-year period and then subsequently hold a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of base salary.
Adherence to these guidelines is a condition of continued participation in the equity incentive arrangements. This policy 
ensures that the interests of Executive Directors and those of shareholders are closely aligned.
 – CEO: 200% of salary.
 – CFO: 150% of salary.
Non-Executive Director and 
Chairman fees
The fees for Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman are set at broadly the median of the comparator group.
Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual fee and additional fees for chairmanship of committees. The Chairman does 
not receive any additional fees for membership of committees.
In general, the level of fee increase for the Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman will be set taking account of any 
change in responsibility and the general rise in salaries across the UK workforce.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the Non-Executive Directors and Chairman and may settle any 
tax incurred in relation to these.
Malus and clawback
The ADBP and the LTIP include best practice malus and clawback provisions.
Annual bonus Deferred bonus Long-Term Incentive Plan
Malus Up to the date of payment of a cash bonus To the end of the three-year deferral period To the end of the three-year vesting period
Clawback Three years post the bonus determination n/a Two years post-vesting
The Committee believes that the rules of the plans provide sufficient powers to enforce malus and clawback where required.
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 80 Ibstock plc Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report.
The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set 
out in those rules. In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it 
would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
It is the Committee’s intention that commitments made in line with its policies prior to Admission will be honoured, even if satisfaction 
of such commitments is made post the Company’s first AGM following Admission and may be inconsistent with policy.
Illustrations of the application of the Remuneration Policy
The charts below illustrate the total remuneration that would be paid to each of the Executive Directors, based on salaries at the start 
of the 2018 financial year, under three different performance scenarios: (i) minimum; (ii) on-target; and (iii) maximum. They also show the 
actual single figure of remuneration for the Executive Directors for the 2017 financial year, for comparison purposes.
The table overleaf sets out the assumptions used to calculate the elements of remuneration for each of these scenarios. The elements 
of remuneration have been categorised into three components: (i) fixed; (ii) annual bonus (deferred bonus); and (iii) LTIP .

Participation in the SAYE scheme has been excluded, given the relative size of the opportunity levels.
Pay at risk
The charts below set out the single figure of each Executive Director based on whether the elements remain “at risk”. For example:
 – payment is subject to continuing employment for a period (deferred shares and LTIP awards);
 – performance conditions have still to be satisfied (LTIP awards); or
 – elements are subject to clawback or malus for a period, over which the Company can recover sums paid or withhold vesting.
Figures have been calculated based on on-target performance (fixed elements plus 50% of maximum annual bonus and 50% of the 
maximum LTIP). The charts have been based on the same assumptions as set out above for the illustrations of the application of the 
Remuneration Policy.

appointed by letters of appointment. These are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. Each independent Non-
Executive Director’s term of office runs for a three-year period.
The initial terms of the Non-Executive Directors’ positions are subject to their re-election by the Company’s shareholders at the AGM 
and to re-election at any subsequent AGM at which the Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election.
All Directors wishing to continue to serve will be put forward for election/re-election by shareholders on an annual basis.

5 March 2018
Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 85
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards), including FRS 102, The 
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom 
and the Republic of Ireland, and applicable law. Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the Annual Report and 
Accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that year.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group consolidated financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard No1 requires Directors to:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern and prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and to disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each person who is a Director of the Company as at the date 
of approval of this report confirms that:
(a)  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are not aware; 
and
(b)  the Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to 
have taken as a Director in order to make him/herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors who were in office as at 31 December 2017 and 
who remain in office as at the date of this report (whose names 
and functions are given on pages 50 and 51) confirm that to the 
best of their knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Group and Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
 – the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
 – the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group 
and Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.

Directors on 5 March 2018 and is signed on its behalf by:

Practice).
Report on the audit of the financial 
statements
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in 
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services 
prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the 
group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the 
current year were:
 – Revenue recognition and customer rebates; 
and
 – Inflation and discount rate assumptions 
used in defined benefit pension scheme 
valuations.
This is our first year as auditor for the Group. 
The key audit matters identified in respect of 
rebates and pensions are the same as the 
prior year identified by the previous auditor 
(Ernst & Young LLP).
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group 
financial statements was £4.0m which was 
determined on the basis of profit before tax.
Scoping We performed full scope audits on the three 
UK trading components (Ibstock Brick, 
Forticrete and Supreme), Head office entities 
and the consolidation process. Agreed upon 
procedures were performed by a local audit 
team in respect of the US trading component, 
Glen-Gery.
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks 
and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement in note 1 to the 
financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them 
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s 
and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to 
add or draw attention to in relation to that statement required by 
Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, 
add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Ibstock plc
Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 87
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the Directors’ statements and 
considering whether they were consistent with the knowledge 
we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge 
obtained in the evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the 
group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
we are required to state whether we have anything material to 
add or draw attention to in relation to:
 – the disclosures on pages 32 to 37 that describe the principal 
risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 – the Directors’ confirmation on page 58 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; or
 – the Directors’ explanation on page 42 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the Directors’ statement 
relating to the prospects of the group required by Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained 
in the audit. 
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, 
add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Revenue recognition – customer rebates 
Key audit matter 
description
The Group enters into various agreements whereby it offers customers retrospective rebates according to the volume of 
transactions completed with that customer. The rebate agreements are complex in nature, with different types of rebates being 
offered to each customer, with the nature of those rebates differing across the product range. Due to the high level of 
complexity involved, we have determined that there was a potential for fraud through possible manipulation of this balance. 
The key audit matter in relation to customer rebates is pinpointed to the accuracy and completeness of the reduction against 
revenue in respect of rebates for customers in all divisions of the Group. 
Refer to note 1 (Accounting policies).
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We have performed the following procedures to address this key audit matter. We have: 
 – assessed the design and implementation of the controls to address the key audit matter in all divisions and the operating 
effectiveness of controls in the Brick and Forticrete divisions;
 – performed year-on-year analysis of revenue and rebates to understand any material changes in the rebate provision 
at a customer level;
 – selected a sample of customer rebate agreements, inspected the terms and dates, and recalculated selected rebates in 
accordance with the contract terms, including confirming the sales data on which the rebate calculations are based; 
 – reviewed the largest customers in each of the divisions and requested written confirmations from a sample of the largest 
customers to confirm that the rebate provided by the Group is the full rebate due to the customer for 2017; 
 – assessed the completeness of rebates by reviewing credit notes raised during 2017 and post year-end, reviewed whether 
payments had been made to customers where we had been informed that no rebate agreement was in place and made 
enquiries of management as to the existence of any other rebate arrangements; and
 – agreed a sample of rebates to settlement post year end. 
Key observations Our testing of a sample of rebate agreements did not identify any material differences in the level of rebate recognised 
as a reduction against revenue. 
We agree that there is no material misstatement in the level of rebates recognised for the year ended 31 December 2017 .
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
Report on the audit of the financial 
statements continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 88 Ibstock plc Inflation and discount rate assumptions used in defined benefit pension liability valuation 
Key audit matter 
description
The Group has a net defined benefit pension asset of £46.1m (gross liabilities of £613.4m) at 31 December 2017 (31 December 
2016: £28.7m net liability and £698.0m gross liabilities). 
There is a risk of material misstatement relating to judgements made in valuing the defined benefit pension scheme liabilities as 
small changes in the key model input assumptions such as the discount rate and inflation rate can have a significant impact on 
the valuation of the liability.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report, note 1 (Accounting policies) and note 20 (Post-employment benefit obligations).
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We performed the following procedures to address this risk. We have:
 – utilised our Pensions Analytics tool to assess the appropriateness of the inflation and discount rate assumptions used in 
respect of the UK scheme;
 – engaged Deloitte actuarial specialists in respect of the methodology adopted and to review the legal advice received in the 
year in respect of IFRIC 14 and the Company’s ability to access any surplus in the scheme;
 – considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the deficit to changes in these key 
assumptions; and
 – challenged management to understand the sensitivity of changes in assumptions and quantify a range of reasonable rates 
that could be used in their calculation with reference to comparator company and market data as at 31 December 2017 . 
Key observations From the work performed we are satisfied that the key assumptions applied in respect of the valuation of the defined benefit 
pension scheme liabilities are within a reasonable range.
We are satisfied that the recognition of a pension asset in the year (and reversal of the previous additional IFRIC 14 liability) 
is appropriate.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit 
work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Materiality £4.0m (2016: £3.6m by the previous auditor) £3.2m
Basis for determining 
materiality
5% of pre-tax profit (2016: 5% of profit before tax after 
adjusting for exceptional items)
2% of net assets, capped at component materiality.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We have selected profit before tax as our benchmark as it is 
the key focus for shareholders in assessing the performance 
of the Group.
We have adopted a different benchmark for determining 
materiality to that used by the predecessor auditor. We 
consider statutory profit before tax to be the most appropriate 
benchmark in the current year, as this is the key focus for 
shareholders in assessing the performance of the Group. 
The approach in the prior year was to use profit before tax 
after adjusting for exceptional items. In the current year, 
pre-tax exceptional items of £4.9m have been recognised 
(2016: £32.0m gain before tax from exceptional items).
Net assets are considered to be an appropriate benchmark 
for the Company given that it is mainly a holding company. 
A set percentage of group materiality was applied to the 
Company based upon the scoping of components, assessing 
the risk within the Company compared to others within 
the group.
1
1. PBT £83.4m
2. Group materiality £4.0m 
2
Component materiality 
range £1.6m to £3.2m
Audit Committee reporting 
threshold £0.2m
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £200,000 (2016: 
£180,000) for the group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 89
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of 
the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at a group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focussed our group audit scope 
primarily on the audit work at the three UK trading components 
(Ibstock Brick, Forticrete and Supreme). Full audits were 
performed in these locations. Our audit work at these locations 
was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual 
entity which were lower than group materiality ranging from 
£1.6 million to £3.2 million At the Group level, we also tested head 
office entities and the consolidation process. In total this provided 
coverage of 80% of revenue, 95% of profit before tax and 85% of 
the net assets. Specified audit procedures were performed on 
the remaining revenue, profit and net assets by a local audit team 
in respect of the US trading component, Glen-Gery.

The parent company is located in Ibstock and audited directly by 
the group audit team. The Group team is also responsible for the 
Head Office entities and the consolidation. The component team 
in the US perform audit work and report into the Group team. As 
part of the 2017 audit, a senior member of the group audit team 
visited the US component to direct and scope the specified audit 
procedures, meeting with management and the local Deloitte US 
team. For all components we attend the local close meetings.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report 
that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report 
to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other 
information include where we conclude that:
 – Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by 
the Directors that they consider the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
 – Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of 
the audit committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit committee; or
 – Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ statement 
required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
Report on the audit of the financial 
statements continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 90 Ibstock plc Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate 
the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory 
requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit:
 – the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and 
of the parent company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified any material 
misstatements in the strategic report or the Directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if 
in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were 
appointed by the Board of Directors on 24 May 2017 to audit the 
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017 and 
subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of 
the firm is one year.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report 
to the audit committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the 
audit committee we are required to provide in accordance with 
ISAs (UK).

Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information 1. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Authorisation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of Ibstock plc, which has 
a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 5 March 2018. 
The balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by 
W Sheppard and K Sims.
Ibstock plc is a public company limited by shares, which is 
incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly 
traded. The registered office is Leicester Road, Ibstock, 
Leicestershire LE67 6HS and the company registration number 
is 09760850.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Ibstock plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern 
basis, under the historical cost convention.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling 
and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except 
where otherwise indicated. The significant accounting policies are 
set out below.
Basis of consolidation and acquisition accounting
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of Ibstock plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 
2017 . The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the 
same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent 
accounting policies. All intra-Group balances, transactions, 
income and expenses and profit and losses resulting from 
intra-Group transactions have been eliminated in full. Subsidiaries 
are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains 
control and cease to be consolidated from the date on which the 
Group no longer retains control. Details of all the subsidiaries of 
the Group are given in Note 28.
The subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. 
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or 
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for 
business combinations by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments 
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their 
fair value at acquisition date. The excess of the consideration 
transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recognised as goodwill. If the consideration 
transferred is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, 
negative goodwill arises and is recognised directly in the 
income statement.
An estimation of the fair value is made for contingent 
consideration in accordance with IFRS 3 at the time of a business 
combination. Where there is a contractual obligation to settle the 
liability in cash based on events within the Company’s control this 
contingent consideration is accounted for as a credit to equity 
within other reserves and is not subsequently adjusted.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the business review on pages 16 and 17 . The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Director’s Report on 84 
and 85. In addition, Note 22 to the financial statements includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures 
to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group regularly reviews market and financial forecasts, and 
has reviewed its trading prospects in its key markets. As a result 
it believes its trading performance will demonstrate continued 
improvement in the coming periods, and that liquidity will 
remain strong.
The Board has reviewed the latest forecasts of the Group and 
considered the obligations of the financing arrangements. 
Given the continued strong liquidity of the Group the Board has 
concluded that the going concern basis of accounting of its 
financial statements is appropriate.
In addition, see the Group’s Viability Statement set out on 
page 42.
New standards, amendments and interpretations 
not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and 
interpretations are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 
2017 , and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated 
financial statements. None of these is expected to have a 
significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities, and a new credit loss model for calculating impairment 
to financial assets. The standard is effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, which is the year 
ending 31 December 2018 for the Group. Based on the work 
carried out to date the Group does not expect any material 
changes to its financial statements as a result of the standard.
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with 
revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, 
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising 
from an entity’s contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a 
good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and 
obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard 
replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ 
and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, which is the 
year ending 31 December 2018 for the Group. The Group has 
completed an assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 and 
determined that the standard will have no material impact on 
the Group’s financial reporting.
Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 98 Ibstock plc IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ sets out the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both 
parties to a contract, i.e. the lessee and the lessor. IFRS 16 
requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease 
payments and a ‘right of use asset’ for virtually all lease contracts. 
IFRS 16 is effective from 1 January 2019. A company can choose 
to apply IFRS 16 before that date but only if it also applies IFRS 15 
‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. On adoption, the 
Group will recognise a right of use asset and a lease liability 
based on the net present value of the payments required under 
each of its leases. The operating lease charge, currently 
recognised in EBITDA, will be replaced by the depreciation of 
the right of use asset and interest on the lease liability. As well 
as a change to the line items in the income statement, it is also 
expected to change the profile of the net charge recognised in 
the income statement over the lease term.
The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, 
however, the impact will depend on the facts and circumstances 
at the point of adoption and upon the transition choices adopted. 
The Group’s current operating lease commitments are disclosed 
in Note 26.
There are no other IFRSs, Annual improvements or IFRIC 
interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected 
to have a material impact on the Group and there are no current 
plans to early adopt any of the above-mentioned standards.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”), who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Finance Officer of the Group. The CODM 
reviews the key profit measure, ‘Adjusted EBITDA’ disaggregated 
by UK and US based on geographical location and the 
organisational structure of the Group.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional 
currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented 
in “Sterling” (£), which is the Group’s presentation currency.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations 
(i.e., subsidiaries with a functional currency that is not ‘Sterling’) 
are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
reporting date and their results are translated at the actual rates 
prevailing at the date of the transactions (or average rates, with a 
reasonable approximation) and the effect of fair value adjustment 
on the assets and liabilities are treated as part of the assets and 
liabilities of a foreign operation. The currency translation 
differences are recorded in the currency translation reserve within 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in the 
currency translation reserve.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when 
deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow 
hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. The Group does 
not currently undertake such hedges. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash 
equivalents are presented in the income statement within net 
finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are 
presented in the income statement.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, except for borrowing 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a 
substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use, in 
which case they are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. 
Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when expenditures 
for the asset and borrowing costs are being incurred and the 
activities to prepare the asset for its intended use are in progress. 
Where significant, borrowing costs are capitalised up to the date 
when the project is completed and ready for its intended use.
There were no borrowing costs capitalised during the year.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at the cost to the Group 
less depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment 
includes directly attributable costs.
Depreciation is provided on the cost of all other assets (except 
assets in the course of construction and land), so as to write off 
the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the 
expected useful economic life of the assets concerned, as follows:
Asset classification Useful life 
Land Not depreciated 
Freehold buildings 20–50 years 
Plant, machinery and equipment 5–40 years 
Mineral reserves Amortised on a usage basis
Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for mineral 
deposits with economic potential and is not capitalised. 
Evaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of 
deposits or other projects that have been identified as having 
economic potential and in obtaining permissions to extract clay. 
Capitalisation of evaluation expenditure within ‘Mineral reserves’ 
commences when there is a high degree of confidence that the 
Group will determine that a project is commercially viable, i.e., the 
project will provide a satisfactory return relative to its perceived 
risks, and therefore it is considered probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the Group.
Mineral reserves may be declared for an undeveloped project 
before its commercial viability has been fully determined. 
Evaluation costs may continue to be capitalised during the period 
between declaration of reserves and approval to extract clay as 
further work is undertaken in order to refine the development 
case to maximise the project’s returns.
Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 99
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information 1. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The carrying values of capitalised evaluation expenditure are 
reviewed for impairment by management. Mineral reserves are 
amortised on a usage basis.
Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and revised where expectations are significantly 
different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation 
charge for current and future periods is adjusted accordingly.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets
Separately acquired brands and non-contractual customer 
relationships are shown at historical cost. Brands and customer 
relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method to allocate the cost of brands and customer 
relationships over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Asset classification Useful life 
Brands 10–50 years 
Customer relationships 10–20 years
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis 
of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific 
software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful 
lives of three to five years.
For further details see Note 12.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation such as 
brands and non-contractual customer relationships and property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in 
use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are 
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely 
independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). Prior 
impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are 
reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its 
present location and condition. Raw materials, consumables and 
goods for resale are recognised on a weighted average cost 
basis, while work in progress and finished goods are held at 
direct cost and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following 
categories: at fair value through profit or loss and loans and 
receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which 
the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial 
assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this 
category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the 
short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category 
are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 
12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities 
greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. 
These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans 
and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash 
and cash equivalents’ in the balance sheet.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised 
on the trade-date – the date on which the Group commits to 
purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at 
fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried 
at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair 
value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, 
and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash 
flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred 
and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards 
of ownership. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. No financial assets are 
held for trading other than derivatives.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for 
merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course 
of business. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are 
classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-
current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount 
reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset the recognised amounts a nd there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be 
contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the 
normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency 
or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents 
includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less and bank overdrafts (if any). In the 
consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that 
have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if 
payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating 
cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as 
non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 100 Ibstock plc Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs incurred. All other costs are 
expensed as incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Finance cost on borrowings is treated as an expense in the 
income statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred 
on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised within 
property, plant and equipment.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as 
transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee 
is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no 
evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be 
drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity 
services and amortised over the period of the facility to which 
it relates.
An exchange of debt instruments with substantially different terms 
is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial 
liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a 
substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability 
is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial 
liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Employee benefits
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including 
both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
Pension obligations
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 
Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group 
has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions 
if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees 
the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior 
periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a 
defined contribution plan.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension 
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually 
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service 
and compensation.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined 
benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of 
plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually 
by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest 
rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in 
the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have 
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related 
pension obligation.
Where defined benefit schemes have a surplus, the surplus is 
recognised if future economic benefits are available to the entity 
in the form of a reduction in the future contributions or a right to 
refund. See Note 2 for the judgement made regarding the 
application of IFRIC 14.
The current service cost of the defined benefit plan is recognised 
in the income statement in employee benefit expense, except 
where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the 
defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the 
current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income. The net 
interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets, taking account of any changes in the defined benefit 
asset/liability during the period as a result of contributions and 
benefit payments. This cost is included in interest expense in the 
income statement.
When the benefits of a defined benefit plan are changed or when 
the plan is curtailed, the change in the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation arising that relates to the plan 
amendment or curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or 
loss on its occurrence. Before determining the past service cost 
(including curtailment gains or losses) or a gain or loss on 
settlement, the net defined benefit obligation (asset) is remeasured 
using the current fair value of plan assets and current actuarial 
assumptions (including current market interest rates and other 
current market prices) reflecting the benefits offered under the 
plan before the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience 
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged 
or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which 
they arise.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to 
publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no 
further payment obligations once the contributions have been 
paid. The Group recognises contributions payable to defined 
contribution plans in exchange for employee services in employee 
benefit expense.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; 
and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood 
that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by 
considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is 
recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any 
one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase 
in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as 
interest expense.
The restoration provision is to fund future obligations at a number 
of sites that the Group is associated with and where the Group 
has any constructive obligation to restore once it has fully utilised 
the site. The restructuring provision covers current and former 
employees who have ceased working on grounds of ill health and 
is a liability payable to their normal retirement date. Other provisions 
relate to provisions for sites used for landfill and for onerous 
contracts to cover the exposure that the Group has for both 
current property leases where the rent being paid is significantly 
higher than the current market rents and also vacant properties. 
All of these provisions are discounted on an annual basis.
Provisions for dilapidations are recognised on a lease by lease 
basis and are based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely 
committed cash outflows. 
Off-market rental provisions relate to leases acquired as part 
of business combinations.

1. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable for 
goods supplied by the Group, exclusive of local sales tax and 
trade discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. 
All of revenue is attributable to the principal activities of the 
Group being the manufacture and sale of concrete products, 
clay facing bricks and associated special shaped and fabricated 
clay products.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, which is 
usually on despatch of goods. For “bill and hold” sales, in which 
delivery is delayed at the buyer’s request but the buyer takes title 
and accepts billing, revenue is recognised when the buyer takes 
title, provided: (a) it is probable that delivery will be made; (b) the 
item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer 
at the time the sale is recognised; (c) the buyer specifically 
acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; and (d) the usual 
payment terms apply. Revenue is not recognised when there is 
simply an intention to acquire or manufacture the goods in time 
for delivery.
Customer rebates
Provisions for rebates to customers are based upon the terms 
of individual contracts, generally coterminous with the Group’s 
financial year end, and are recorded in the same period as the 
related sales as a deduction from revenue. The Group estimates 
the provision for customer rebates based on the terms of each 
agreement at the time the revenue is recognised.
Other income
Other income is attributable to rental income from properties, 
landfill and gas activity. Other expenses represent associated 
expenses. This is not deemed to be a principal activity of 
the Group.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred, 
except that development expenditure incurred on an individual 
project is carried forward when its future recoverability can 
reasonably be regarded as assured. Any expenditure carried 
forward is amortised in line with the expected future sales from 
the related project. Research and development costs capitalised 
are not material.
Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the 
income statement, those material items of income and expense 
which, because of the nature and the expected infrequency of 
the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to 
allow shareholders to understand better elements of financial 
performance in the financial period, so as to assess better trends 
in financial performance. Further detail on exceptional items are 
given within Note 5.
The Directors believe that the use of Alternative Performance 
Measures (“APMs”) provides useful information for shareholders. 
These measures are consistent with how the underlying business 
performance is measured internally. Detailed descriptions of 
APMs used throughout these financial statements are included 
within Note 3.
APMs used by the Group are generally not defined under IFRSs 
and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures 
reported by other companies. 
It is not intended that either adjusted measure is a substitute for, 
or superior to, statutory measurements.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except 
for tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or recoverable on the 
taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions 
and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination may be 
uncertain. The calculation of the tax charge therefore necessarily 
involves a degree of estimation and judgement. The tax liabilities 
are based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due 
and tax assets are recognised on the basis of probable future 
recoverability. This requires management to exercise judgement 
based on their interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of 
settlement of tax liabilities or recoverability of tax assets. To the 
extent that the final outcome differs from the estimates made, tax 
adjustments may be required which could have a material impact 
on the tax charge and profit for the year in which such a 
determination is made.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
included in the financial statements. However, deferred tax 
liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition 
of goodwill; deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
The amount of deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not subject to discounting.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which 
the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary 
differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint arrangements, except for deferred tax liabilities where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled 
by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary 
differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the 
temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is 
sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities where these have been levied by the same tax authority 
on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities 
within the Group where there is an intention to settle the balances 
on a net basis.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 102 Ibstock plc Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Ibstock plc shareholders are recognised 
in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved in general meeting, or when paid in the 
case of an interim dividend.
Assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for 
sale only if available for immediate sale in their present condition 
and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed 
within one year from the date of classification. Such assets and 
disposal groups are measured at the lower of carrying amount 
and fair value less the costs to sell. Non-current assets classified 
as held for sale (or that form part of a disposal group classified 
as held for sale) are not depreciated or amortised.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives services 
from employees as consideration for equity instruments (for 
example, options or shares) of the Group. The fair value of the 
employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
equity instruments is recognised as an expense. The total amount 
to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
instruments granted:
 – including any market performance conditions (for example, 
an entity’s share price);
 – excluding the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, 
sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity 
over a specified time period); and
 – including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, 
the requirement for employees to save or holding shares for 
a specific period of time).
At the end of each reporting year, the Group revises its estimates 
of the number of instruments that are expected to vest based on 
the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. It 
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, 
in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to 
equity. In addition, in some circumstances employees may 
provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the 
grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising 
the expense during the year between service commencement 
period and grant date.
For the equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the fair 
value of the share instruments granted is derived from established 
option pricing models. Further details on share-based payments 
are set out in Note 25.
2. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires management 
to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting 
policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical 
judgements and estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
The Group has identified the following critical accounting policies 
under which significant judgements, estimates and assumptions 
are made and where actual results may differ from these 
estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may 
materially affect financial results or the financial position reported 
in future periods.
Estimates
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed by 
management on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in 
the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future 
period affected. The areas involving significant risk resulting in 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
Mineral reserves
Upon acquisition by Figgs Topco Limited on 26 February 2015, 
mineral reserves were recorded at their fair value. The 
determination of the mineral reserves requires significant 
judgements and estimates to be applied, and these are reviewed 
regularly and updated.
Factors such as the availability of geological and extraction 
data, material performance and both the assessment of 
compliance with, and likelihood of extensions to, planning 
permissions, all impact upon the determination of the Group’s 
estimates of its mineral reserves. Management’s valuations are 
based on the expected future usage of reserves using production 
data, information from in-house geologists and input from 
external consultants.
Mineral reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment 
of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the 
consolidated financial statements. Estimates of mineral reserves 
are also used to calculate depreciation charges for the Group’s 
mineral reserves. The impact of changes in minerals is dealt with 
prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the 
asset over the expected future production. See Note 13 for details 
of the carrying value of the mineral reserves.
Defined benefit pension schemes – valuation of liabilities
The Group’s accounting policy for defined benefit pension 
schemes requires management to make judgements as to 
the nature of benefits provided by each scheme and thereby 
determine the classification of each scheme. For defined benefit 
schemes, management is required to make annual estimates and 
assumptions about future returns on classes of scheme assets, 
administration costs, changes in benefits, inflation rates, life 
expectancy and other pensioner demographics.
The assumptions used may vary from year to year, which 
would affect future net income and net assets. Any differences 
between these assumptions and the actual outcome also affect 
future net income and net assets. In making these estimates and 
assumptions, management considers advice provided by external 
advisers, such as actuaries. These assumptions are subject to 
periodic review.
Note 20 describes the assumptions used together with an 
analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Judgements
The below judgements made by management in the process of 
applying the Group‘s accounting policies have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recorded in the financial statements.

2. Critical accounting judgements and estimates 
continued
Impairment of intangible and non-current assets
Determining whether intangible and other non-current assets 
are impaired requires judgement and estimation. The Group 
periodically reviews intangible and non-current assets, for 
possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate, in management’s judgement, that the carrying amount 
of an asset may not be recoverable. Such indicating events would 
include a significant planned restructuring, a major change in 
market conditions or technology, expectations of future operating 
losses, or negative cash flows.
The Group did not record any impairment charges during the 
year ended 31 December 2017 as management’s judgement, 
based on a rigorous assessment, was that there were no 
indicators of impairment.
A requirement for an impairment test also arises when a non-
current asset is classified as being held for sale, at which time it 
must be remeasured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair 
value less cost to sell. Management’s assessment was to retain 
all assets held for sale at their carrying value since this is 
exceeded by the fair value less costs to sell.
Non-GAAP items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial 
statements where management believes it is necessary to do 
so to provide further understanding of the financial performance 
of the Group. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in its 
assessment of performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the earnings 
before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation adjusted 
for exceptional items. A full reconciliation is included at the foot of 
the Group statement of comprehensive income within the 
financial statements.
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the 
income statement, those material items of income and expense 
which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the 
events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better elements of financial 
performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with 
future periods and to assess trends in financial performance.
Exceptional items are disclosed in Note 5. The reconciliation 
of prior year statutory reported results for the year ended 
31 December 2017 to the adjusted EBITDA referred to within 
this Annual Report and Accounts is included under the 
Comprehensive Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
described in Note 3.
Defined benefit pension schemes – surplus recognition
In accounting for defined benefit plans, management is required 
to make judgements in relation to the application of International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee guidance IFRIC 14 
and its applicability to Ibstock plc. This judgement concerns the 
Group’s ability to recognise an actuarial surplus/notional surplus 
on the UK defined benefit pension scheme, should such a 
surplus/notional surplus arise in future. The Group has considered 
the application of this guidance, including proposed amendments 
to IFRIC14 published as an exposure draft in June 2015. In the 
current year, in continuing to apply IFRIC 14, management has 
ceased to recognise an additional liability in respect of the 
minimum funding obligation following the receipt of legal advice 
regarding the Group’s ability to access a surplus (should one 
exist) in the pension scheme in the future. Further detail of the 
Group’s pension schemes is included within Note 20.
3. Alternative performance measures
Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”) are disclosed within 
the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts where management 
believes it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding 
of the financial performance of the Group. Management uses 
APMs in its own assessment of the Group’s performance. It is 
not intended that APMs are a substitute for, or superior to, 
statutory measures. None of the APMs are outlined within IFRS 
and they may not be comparable with similarly titled APMs used 
by other companies.
Exceptional items
The Group presents items as exceptional on the face of the 
income statement, those items of income and expense which, 
because of the materiality, nature and/or expected infrequency 
of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation 
to allow shareholders to understand better elements of financial 
performance for the year, so as to facilitate comparison with 
future years and to assess trends in financial performance. 
Details of all exceptional items are disclosed in Note 5.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is the earnings before interest, taxation, 
depreciation and amortisation adjusted for exceptional items. 
A full reconciliation is included at the foot of the Group 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income within the 
financial statements.
Adjusted EPS
Adjusted EPS is the basic earnings per share adjusted for 
exceptional items, amortisation and depreciation on fair value 
uplifted assets and non-cash interest net of taxation (at the 
Group’s effective tax rate). A full reconciliation is provided in 
Note 11.
Net debt
Net debt is defined as the sum of cash and total borrowings at 
the balance sheet date. Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net 
debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above). 
Return on capital employed
Return on capital employed (“ROCE”) is defined as earnings 
before interest and taxation adjusted for exceptional items as a 
proportion of the average capital employed (defined as net debt 
plus equity excluding the pension deficit/surplus). The average is 
calculated using the year end balance and corresponding 
preceding reported year end balance (year end or interim).

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 104 Ibstock plc Cash conversion
Cash conversion is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA after movements in working capital less maintenance capital expenditure and share-
based payments, to adjusted EBITDA. The calculation of the cash conversion ratio is set out within Table 1 of the Financial Review.
Constant currency
Constant currency measures are used in management’s description of performance within the Strategic Report. Where used, constant 
currency figures translate all amounts for our US segment using the average US dollar rate for the year ended 31 December 2016 
(£1:$1.34574).
Cash flow before major projects
Cash flow before major capex is a key performance indicator of cash flow prior to capital expenditure on major projects. This represents 
adjusted EBITDA plus share-based payment costs less cash flow on maintenance capital expenditure and adjusted for changes in 
working capital. A reconciliation is provided on page 39 within the Financial Review.
Adjusted free cash flow
Adjusted free cash flow represents cash flow before major projects (defined above) less expenditure on major projects and cash 
outflows for taxation, net interest costs and post-employment benefits. 
4. Segment reporting
As explained in Note 1, the management team considers the reportable segments to be the UK and the US. The key Group 
performance measure is Adjusted EBITDA, as detailed below, which is earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation 
adjusted for exceptional items. Transactions between segments are carried out at arm’s length. No aggregation of segments has 
been applied.

Exceptional administration expenses
Pension closure costs which arose in the year ended 31 December 2017 represent residual professional advisor fees associated with 
the closure of the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme, which took place in the year ended 31 December 2016.
The release of a provision for contingent consideration of £1,740,000 arose in the year following the disposal of all interests in the Group 
by Bain Capital LLC (see Note 29).
Exceptional finance costs
Exceptional finance costs arising in the current year resulted from the refinancing of the Group’s loan in March 2017 , representing 
£3,286,000 of accelerated loan deal fees and £3,100,000 of interest charges as a result of the effective interest method of accounting. 
Further detail of the Group’s refinancing is provided in Note 18.
2016
Included within the prior year are the following exceptional items:
Exceptional cost of sales
Exceptional cost of sales in the prior year of £353,000 represent redundancy costs associated with restructuring the Group’s operations 
in Ravenhead. Similar activities resulting in these costs are only expected to arise infrequently.
Pension closure costs
Professional advisor fees of £731,000, together with employee compensation payments of £908,000 were incurred in the prior year in 
relation to the closure of the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme. Due to the non-recurring nature of the closure, these costs 
were treated as exceptional. A curtailment gain of £30,317 ,000 also arose in 2016 as a result of the Group’s decision to close the UK 
defined benefit scheme to future accrual.
Transaction costs
Professional fees and other costs of £102,000 incurred in the prior year were classified as exceptional. These costs are directly 
attributable to acquisition activity arising in the year and were classified as exceptional due to their non-recurring nature.
Exceptional finance income
Exceptional finance income in the year ended 31 December 2016 resulted from gains made on foreign currency contracts around the 
date of the UK’s EU Referendum. Similar gains are not expected to recur.
All exceptional items in the year ended 31 December 2016 were settled in cash, other than the compensation costs accrued at the 
balance sheet date and pension curtailment gain that is non-cash in nature based on actuarial valuation of the Group’s UK defined 
benefit pension scheme as at 31 December 2016.

Tax on exceptional items 
2017
The pension closure costs of £211,000 and the exceptional finance costs of £6,386,000 are tax deductible in full in the current year 
whilst the £1,740,000 release of contingent consideration is not taxable.
2016
Apart from the following items, exceptional items are taxable or deductible in full in the current year:
(i)  The curtailment gain of £30,317 ,000 is not taxable in the current year. A deferred tax expense of £5,850,000 has been recognised 
in the year.
(ii)  Administrative expenses include additional employer pension contributions of £265,000 arising from the closure of the Group’s UK 
defined benefit pension scheme. These pension contributions are tax deductible on a paid basis and a deferred tax asset of £51,000 
has therefore been recognised.

The enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 22 December 2017 has resulted in a £4,042,000 reduction in the Group’s US 
deferred tax assets and liabilities. This deferred tax benefit is reflected in the tax expense reported for the year as shown above.
The tax expense for the year includes a credit of £2,113,000 relating to UK tax relief claimed but not previously recognised in respect 
of IPO transaction costs incurred in 2015.
The tax expense for the prior year includes a deferred tax credit of £185,000 relating to the recognition of US state tax losses arising as 
a result of the US business entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement declaring, retrospectively, a taxable presence in New York 
State and New York City since 2013.
There are no income tax consequences for the Company in respect of dividends declared prior to the date of authorisation of these 
financial statements and for which a liability has not been recognised.
The Group expects its effective tax rate in the future to be affected by the geographical mix of profits and the different tax rates that will 
apply to those profits, the outcome of any future tax audits as well as the impact of changes in tax law.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK from 20% to 19% came into force with effect from 1 April 2017 . The 
further rate reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted in Finance Act 2016 on 6 September 2016. The impact of 
these tax rate changes are reflected in these financial statements.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 112 Ibstock plc 11. Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to the parent shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number 
of options outstanding during the year. Where the average share price for the year is lower than the option price the options become 
anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The number of shares used for the earnings per share calculation are as follows:
Year ended
31 December 
2017
’000s
Year ended 
31 December 
2016
’000s
Basic weighted average number of shares 406,361  406,025 
Effect of share incentive awards and options 2,321  2,671 
Diluted weighted average number of shares 408,682  408,696 
The calculation of adjusted earnings per share is a key measurement of management that is not defined by IFRS. The adjusted EPS 
measures should not be viewed in isolation, but rather treated as supplementary information.
Adjusted earnings per share figures are calculated as the Basic earnings per share adjusted for exceptional items, amortisation and 
depreciation on fair value uplifted assets and non-cash interest expenses. All adjustments are made net of the associated taxation 
impact at the Group’s Effective Tax Rate.
A reconciliation of the statutory profit to that used in the adjusted earnings per share calculations is as follows:

Contingent consideration of £2,260,000 (2016: £4,000,000) relates to potential future obligations for payments to the vendor of the 
acquisition of the trading businesses completed in February 2015. As part of the Tax deed within the Share sale agreement (“SSA”), 
the Group was committed to make a payment to the vendor of half of any tax relief, over a contracted amount, received by the acquired 
business as a result of the Group’s one-off pension payment. The amount was payable to the vendor during the period whilst the 
acquired entities remained under ownership of the original purchaser greater than 20%. The fair value of the future obligation was 
estimated at £4,000,000, with a range being nil to £4,000,000.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 , the original purchaser ceased to hold any shares within the acquired entities (see Note 29 for 
details). Consequently, an amount of £1,740,000 has been released from the amount originally provided as contingent consideration.

As at 31 December 2017
In March 2017 , the Group entered into a new £250 million Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”). The facility has no fixed repayment terms 
during its five-year term. The Group must comply with covenant requirements relating to interest cover (4x) and leverage (3x) and report 
to the banks on a six-monthly basis. The RCF attracts interest of between 1% and 2.25% plus LIBOR depending upon the leverage 
ratio. During the year, amounts between £150 million and £180 million have been drawn on facility.
The Group has an overdraft facility of £10 million as part of the Group’s cash pooling arrangements. 
As at 31 December 2016
A £240 million facilities agreement covering the following financial instruments were entered into as part of the strategic planning for the 
Initial Public Offering in October 2015:
Bank borrowings at 31 December 2016
A five-year £200 million facility was entered into in September 2015 and first drawn in October with mandatory repayments of £15 
million due on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th anniversary dates subject to the Group’s right to elect not to make one of the repayment 
instalments due during the term of the loan. The borrowings attracted interest of between 1.25% and 2.50% depending on leverage 
ratio (defined as consolidated total net debt as a proportion of consolidated EBITDA) plus LIBOR (or EURIBOR for any loan in Euro) per 
annum, payable either three or six monthly at the option of the Group. A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn element of the 
facility based on 35% of applicable margin. This was repaid in March 2017 .
Revolving credit facility (“RCF”) at 31 December 2016
A new RCF for £40 million over five years was entered into in September 2015. The borrowings attract interest of between 1.25% and 
2.50% depending on leverage ratio (defined as above) plus LIBOR (or EURIBOR for any loan in Euro) per annum, payable either one, 
three or six monthly at the option of the Group. In the current year, the RCF was drawn on five occasions for values ranging from 
£2,975,000 to £7 ,075,000. At 31 December 2016, the full facility was undrawn. This facility was cancelled in March 2017 .
The carrying value of financial liabilities have been assessed as materially in line with their fair values. No security is currently provided 
over the Group’s borrowings.

(i)  The restoration provision comprises obligations governing site remediation and improvement costs to be incurred in compliance with 
applicable environmental regulations together with constructive obligations stemming from established practice once the sites have 
been fully utilised. The key estimates associated with calculating the provision relate to the cost per acre to perform the necessary 
remediation work as at the reporting date together with determining the year of retirement. Estimates are updated annually based on 
the total estimated available reserves and the expected extraction rates. Whilst a significant element of the total provision will reverse 
in the medium term (two to 10 years), the majority of the legal and constructive obligations applicable to mineral-bearing land will 
unwind over a 30-year timeframe. In discounting the related obligations, expected future cash outflows have been determined with 
due regard to extraction status and anticipated remaining life.
(ii)  Provisions for dilapidations, which arose as contingent liabilities recognised upon the business combination in the prior year, are 
recognised on a lease by lease basis and are based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely contractual cash outflows, which are 
estimated to occur over the lease term.
(iii)  Other provisions relate to provisions for the Restructuring, Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), product warranties, 
landfill and onerous contracts. The restructuring provision covers current and former employees who have ceased working on 
grounds of ill health and is a liability payable to their normal retirement date. The SERP is a defined contribution retirement plan in 
respect of basic salary entitlements for Executive Directors. The product warranties are based on the estimate of the cost of fulfilling 
customer warranty claims. The estimate is derived principally from historical data appropriately adjusted for specific risk factors. 
Under the Group’s standard sales terms, the Group repairs or replaces items that fail to perform satisfactorily for one year from the 
date of delivery to the customer. It is expected that most of this expenditure will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet 
date. The landfill provision relates to the restoration of the associated sites and environmental remediation required by legislation. 
The onerous contract provision provides cover for the exposure that the Group has for both current property leases where the rent 
being paid is significantly higher than the current market rents and vacant properties at acquisition. Overall these provisions are not 
deemed material.
The Group holds insurance performance bonds with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company in respect of the Group’s maintenance and 
remediation obligations in respect of sites from which materials are being extracted. The bonds are typically in favour of the Department 
of Environmental Protection within the relevant jurisdictions. At 31 December 2017 the value of the bonds amounted to £1,674,000 
(31 December 2016: £1,538,000). The maximum term on the bonds outstanding at that date is July 2018. The bonds are typically 
renewed on an annual basis at comparable levels.

The Group participates in the Ibstock Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”), a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK. The Scheme 
has four participating employers – Ibstock Brick Limited, Forticrete Limited, Anderton Concrete Products Limited, Figgs Bidco Limited 
(from 26 February 2015) and Tyrone Brick Limited (up to 26 February 2015). The Scheme is funded by payment of contributions to a 
separate trustee administered fund. The scheme is a revalued earnings plan and provides benefits to its members based on their length 
of membership in the scheme and their average salary over that period. Following consultation with members, accounting for the 
scheme’s closure to future accrual occurred in the year ended 31 December 2016. As a result, benefits were reassessed as active 
members were transferred to deferred membership.
The Scheme is administered by trustees who employ independent fund managers for the investment of the pension scheme assets. 
These assets are kept entirely separate from those of the Group.
Total annual contributions to the Scheme are based on independent actuarial advice, and are gauged to fund future pension liabilities 
in respect of service up to the balance sheet date. The Scheme is subject to independent actuarial valuation at least every three years 
using the projected unit method.
The valuation used as at 31 December 2017 has been based on the results of the 30 November 2014 valuation, as updated for 
changes in demographic assumptions, as appropriate. The next valuation will be based on the results as at 30 November 2017 , 
which is currently underway.
Through its defined benefit pension plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks that are inherent in such plans and arrangements. 
There are, however, no unusual, entity-specific or plan-specific risks, and no significant concentrations of risk. The risks can be 
summarised as follows:
 – asset value volatility, with the associated impact on the assets held in connection with the funding of pension obligations and the 
related cash flows;
 – changes in bond yields, with any reduction resulting in an increase in the present value of pension obligations, mitigated by an 
increase in the value of plan assets;
 – risk of volatility in inflation rates as pension obligations are generally linked to inflation; and
 – life expectancy, as pension benefits are provided for the life of beneficiaries and their dependents.

The Company and Trustees intend to de-risk the Scheme’s investment strategy by moving towards a position that is predominantly 
liability matching in nature. This involves an Asset Liability Management (“ALM”) framework that has been developed to achieve 
long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the Scheme. Within this framework the ALM objective is to match 
assets to the pension obligations by investing in risk-reducing assets (such as long-term fixed interest and index-linked securities). 
The Company actively monitors the investment strategy to ensure that the expected cash flows arising from the pension obligations 
are sufficiently met.

All equities and bonds have a quoted market price in an active market. Properties and cash and cash equivalents are quoted. 
Liability Driven Investments (“LDI”) are funds constructed to reduce the risk within the scheme. They help to mitigate against movements 
in inflation or interest rates by moving in a similar way to the liabilities following market movements. The funds are constructed from gilts 
and swaps. The Scheme’s LDI fund is managed by BMO, is predominantly unquoted and is set up as a ‘bespoke pooled fund’ with 
valuations undertaken on a regular basis with rebalancing occurring on a quarterly basis to reflect the movements in the scheme’s 
other assets and cash flows. To reduce volatility risk, an LDI strategy forms part of the Trustees’ management of the scheme assets, 
comprising UK gilts, repurchase agreements and derivatives. At 31 December 2017 , the LDI held assets valued at £409,639,000 and 
liabilities of £190,132,000. The liabilities comprised repurchase agreements, which are entered into to better offset the schemes 
exposure to interest and inflation rate, whilst remaining invested in assets of a similar risk profile.

The Group contributed 16.0% of pensionable salaries to the Scheme during the year reported up to the date at which active members 
ceased to accrue benefits (1 February 2017). Based on the most recent valuation, a payment schedule was agreed with the Trustees of 
the Ibstock Pension Scheme so that the schemes deficit can be eliminated. This included the Group contributing 16% of pensionable 
salaries to the scheme in the year ended 31 December 2016 and up to 1 February 2017 , which is no longer required following the 
closure of the scheme to future accrual. Additionally, a further £7 ,000,000 per annum is payable under the schedule of contributions 
until May 2021. This schedule of contributions is revised at the time of each funding valuation. As noted above, a funding valuation as at 
30 November 2017 is currently underway. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 20 years (2016: 20 years). 
In the year ended 31 December 2017 , other costs related to the closure of the scheme to future accrual of £211,000 (2016: £1,639,000) 
were incurred and classified as exceptional (see Note 5).
The principal assumptions used by the actuary in his calculations were: 
31 December 
2017
Per annum
31 December 
2016
Per annum
Discount rate 2.45% 2.80%
RPI inflation 3.15% 3.35%
CPI inflation 2.15% 2.35%
Rate of increase in salary n/a n/a
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.65% 3.75%
Commutation factor 15.52 15.52
Mortality assumptions: life expectancy from age 65
For a male currently aged 65 22.60 years 22.70 years
For a female currently aged 65 25.00 years 25.30 years
For a male currently aged 40 24.50 years 25.10 years
For a female currently aged 40 26.90 years 27 .80 years
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected changes to life expectancy. The life expectancies quoted for members 
currently aged 40 assume that they retire at age 65 (i.e., 25 years after the balance sheet date).
The principal financial assumption is the real discount rate, being the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation. The discount 
rate is based on the market yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term to the defined benefit obligations. 
The obligations are primarily in Sterling and have a maturity of some 20 years. If the real discount rate increased/decreased by 0.25%, 
the defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2016 would decrease/increase by approximately 5%.

(b) Multi-employer scheme
The Group participates in two multi-employer defined benefit pension schemes, being Aluminium, Brick and Glass Workers 
International Union (“AB&GW”) and National Integrated Group Pension Plan (“NIGPP”), which are both held in the United States. As 
the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities for these schemes as insufficient information is available on which 
to calculate this split (as confirmed with the schemes actuaries), they are accounted for on a defined contribution basis. The charge for 
the year to December 2017 is £267 ,000 (year ended 31 December 2016: £243,000). The Group is not liable for any other contributing 
entities within either scheme. For exit from the schemes by the Group at the most recent actuarial valuation, it was estimated that the 
withdrawal liability for the schemes equalled £15,527 ,000 (2016: £18,346,000) and £2,171,000 (2016: £1,836,000) for the AB&GW and 
NIGPP , respectively, although management currently do not have any plans on withdrawing from either scheme.
The minimum contribution requirements for the AB&GW scheme are based on a minimum monthly charge per active employee, with 
the minimum contribution requirements for the NIGPP scheme being based on a minimum charge per hour worked. The expected 
contributions to the plan for the next annual reporting year, being the year ending December 2018, is £381,000. In respect of the 
AB&GW scheme, based on the total contributions made in 2017 to the multi-employer schemes, the level of participation the Group 
made compared to other participating entities was 85% and the Group has circa 70% of all members (active, deferred and retired). 
In respect of the NIGPP scheme, based on the proportion of the withdrawal liability against total plan liabilities, the level of participation 
the Group made compared to other participating entities was less than 1%.
In total, the AB&GW plan has a deficit as at 31 December 2017 of £18,189,000 (2016: £21,284,000). The contribution rates agreed to be 
paid by the Group include an element of rehabilitation funding with respect to the total plan deficit. For this scheme, the arrangements 
gives rise to a present obligation and as such a liability has been recognised of £8,735,000 (2016: £9,389,000) for future committed 
contribution amounts as at 31 December 2017 , with an associated recognised deferred tax asset of £2,292,000 (2016: £3,727 ,000). 
This has been calculated by discounting the future cash flows, which accrete at 7% per annum in line with the rehabilitation funding 
plan as set by the scheme Trustees, at a rate commensurate with the time value of money using a 20-year US treasury rate (2.58%) 
given the duration of the rehabilitation funding plan runs to 2034. This calculation is based on management’s estimated number of 
employees in future years. The movement in the current year is primarily driven by the movement in the Sterling: Dollar exchange rate. 
The Trustees meet annually to reassess the funding contribution increase – this has been set at the 7% rate since 2012. Based on the 
contribution rates and total withdrawal liability for the NIGPP plan, management has determined any present obligation arising from 
the plan is immaterial.
(c) Defined contribution plan
The Group operates defined contribution schemes under the Ibstock pension scheme, the Supreme Concrete Limited pension 
scheme, the Anderton Concrete pension scheme and the Supreme Concrete Group Personal Plan. Contributions by both employees 
and Group companies are held in externally invested, externally-administered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes, and thereafter has 
no further obligations in relation to the scheme. The total cost charged to income in relation to the defined contribution scheme in the 
year was £5,170,000 (year ended 31 December 2016: £1,536,000).

The enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 22 December 2017 has resulted in a £4,042,000 reduction in the Group’s US 
deferred tax assets and liabilities. A deferred tax credit of £4,042,000 has been recognised in the income statement.
There are no unrecognised deferred tax assets or liabilities as at 31 December 2017 . In the prior year, a deferred tax asset of £2,113,000 
in respect of tax losses and tax depreciation was not recognised.

Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, credit sales and deposits with banks and is managed on a Group basis. This risk 
arises from transactions with banks, such as those involving cash and cash equivalents and deposits. To reduce the credit risk, the 
Group has concentrated its main activities with a Group of banks that have strong, independently verified credit ratings. For each bank, 
individual risk limits are set based on its ﬁnancial position, credit ratings, past experience and other factors. The utilisation of credit limits 
is regularly monitored.
The Group has significant sales contracts with a number of ‘blue-chip’ companies and accordingly the Directors believe there is a 
limited exposure to credit risk, but this is actively monitored at Board level. The Group’s policy on credit risk requires appropriate credit 
checks on potential customers before sales commence.

Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk, being currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk. In the post 
acquisition period the Group’s interest rate risk arises principally from the revolving credit facility and bank borrowings which attract 
floating rate interest, see Note 18. The Group manages its interest rate risk by using a floating rate debt with varying repayment terms. 
The Group also does not trade in derivative financial instruments and so is not considered to be exposed to other price risk. 
The exposure to currency risk is considered low.
The exposure in different currency of financial assets and liabilities is as follows:

There are no material differences between the fair values and the book values stated above.
The Group has negligible risk to currency fluctuations as the majority of assets and liabilities are held in the same functional currency.
Liquidity risk
The Group has generated sufficient cash from operations to meet its working capital requirements and finance its investing activities. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by entering into committed bank borrowing facilities to ensure the Group has sufficient funds 
available, and monitoring cash flow forecasts to ensure the Group has adequate borrowing facilities.

22. Financial instruments – risk management continued
Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 13 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects 
the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:
Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).
All of the Group’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 1 except for contingent consideration which has been 
categorised as Level 3. There were no transfers between levels during the year.
Financial instruments in Level 3
The Group’s financial instruments that are categorised under level 3 are contingent consideration relating to the acquisition of the 
trading businesses in February 2015. The techniques used to value these obligations are included in Note 17 .
The following table presents the changes in Level 3 instruments for the year ended 31 December 2017 .

Capital risk management
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings disclosed in Note 18 after deducting cash and bank balances) 
and equity of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Note 24.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares, or borrow additional debt.
The Group must comply with two covenants each half year from 30 June 2017 . The covenants are certain ratios of interest cover and 
leverage, which are monitored on a regular basis by the Board. At the year end date, management believes significant headroom exists 
on both covenant conditions.
Dividend policy
Our dividend policy is based on a pay-out ratio of 40–50% of adjusted profit after taxation over a business cycle. This adjusted profit 
measure can be seen in Note 11 to the Group financial statements. Following the announcement of our dividend policy at the time of 
the Group’s IPO in October 2015, Directors remain confident that the dividend policy remains appropriate. At 31 December 2017 , the 
parent maintains significant distributable reserves of £409 million.
The Directors intend that the Company will pay an interim dividend equal to one-third of the prior year’s full year dividend, with a final 
dividend in respect of each financial year as the balance to the total annual dividend, to be announced at the time of the announcement 
of the interim and final results, respectively. The Directors believe that a policy of paying one-third of the prior full year dividend as an 
interim in the following half-year period provides greater certainty to shareholders.

24. Reserves
Share premium account
The share premium account is used to record the aggregate amount or value of premiums paid when the Company’s shares are 
issued/redeemed at a premium.
Currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements 
of foreign subsidiaries.
Other reserves
Other reserves in the prior year relate to contingent consideration arising on acquisition where there is no contractual obligation to 
settle the contingent consideration in cash based on events outside the Group’s control. As part of the Share Sale Agreement with the 
previous owner of the acquired entities, half of all proceeds above a contracted amount, received by the acquired trading business on 
the sale of certain land assets in the future, shall be payable to the seller. Sale of land assets is in the control of the Group and 
accordingly was recognised in equity. Contingent consideration was recognised in relation to this, based on management’s best 
estimate of £1,109,000 from an estimated range of nil to £3,800,000. During the year ended 31 December 2017 , the purchaser ceased 
to hold any shares in Ibstock plc, as set out in Note 29, and as a result the amount of £1,109,000 has been transferred from Other 
reserves to Retained earnings within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve of £369.1 million arose on the acquisition of Figgs Topco Limited by Ibstock plc in a prior period and is the 
difference between the share capital and share premium of Figgs Topco Limited and the nominal value of the investment and 
preference shares in Figgs Topco Limited acquired by the Company.

Executive share option plans
The Group operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), a Share Option Plan (“SOP”) and an Annual and Deferred Bonus Plan 
(“ADBP”) share-based payment awards for selected management.
(a) LTIP
The Group granted LTIPs during the year for key management at the discretion of the Board and this has been approved by the 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced share options. The LTIP 
awards contain performance conditions dependent upon the growth of the Group’s earnings per share (“EPS”) and total shareholder 
return (“TSR”). Please refer to the information given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 83 for details in relation to the 
vesting conditions in relation to the LTIP .
During the year, 731,007 options (2016: 755,311) over Ordinary shares of 1p each were granted to management under the LTIP and 
73,684 shares (2016: 263,981) were exercised at a weighted average share price at the date of exercise of £2.52 (2016: £1.76). During 
the year ending 31 December 2017 , 108,313 options (2016: nil) lapsed.
(b) SOP
The Group granted options under the Share Option Plan during the year at the discretion of the Board and this has been approved by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Under the SOP 484,570 options (2016: 360,423 options) over Ordinary shares of 1p each 
were granted to management. To date, no options have been exercisable under the SOP and 81,538 options (2016: nil options) 
lapsed. Awards granted in the year under the scheme have a specified exercise price of 211.8p (2016: 195.4p) and the weighted 
average exercise price of options outstanding is 208.5p. The SOP has an employment condition of three years and no other 
performance conditions.
(c) ADBP
The ADBP incorporates the Company’s executive bonus scheme as well as a mechanism for the deferral of bonus into awards over 
Ordinary shares. The ADBP operates in respect of the annual bonus earned for the financial year. The Board can determine that part of 
the bonus earned under the ADBP is provided as an award of deferred shares, which take the form of a £nil cost option. The maximum 
value of deferred shares is 50% of the bonus earned. The first deferred awards over Ordinary shares under the ADBP was made in 
relation to the 2016 year end bonus with options issued in March 2017 . The main terms of these awards are a minimum deferral period 
of three years, during which no performance conditions will apply; and the participants’ employment at the end of the deferral period. In 
the current year, 9,593 options lapsed and at 31 December 2017 , an amount of £76,000 (2016: £89,000) had been recorded in accruals 
for the award relating to the bonus earned for the year ending 31 December 2017 .
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 132 Ibstock plc All employee share schemes
In addition to the Executive share option plans, the Group has two all-employee share-based payment arrangements – the Save As You 
Earn (SAYE) and Share Incentive Plan (SIP) awards:
(d) SAYE
In order to participate in the Group’s Sharesave Plan, an employee must enter into a linked savings contract with a bank or building 
society to make contributions from salary on a monthly basis over a three or five-year period. A participant who enters into a savings 
agreement is granted an option to acquire Ordinary shares under the Sharesave Plan at a specified exercise price. The total number of 
awards issued under this scheme in the period ended 31 December 2015 equalled 3,760,262, of which 623,671 have lapsed and 
29,733 were exercised in the year ending 31 December 2017 . There have been no further awards in the current or prior years.
(e) SIP
On 18 December 2015, the Company announced a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) following the Group’s IPO. Subject to qualifying 
employment conditions, all employees were entitled to apply for free shares up to a value of £800 depending on their period of service. 
The number of shares issued under the SIP in the year ended 31 December 2016 was 553,150. The free shares have a three-year 
employment condition and no further vesting conditions. In the year ended 31 December 2017 , 53,950 shares lapsed and 4,650 shares 
were provided to good leavers.
The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the LTIP , SOP and ADBP awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2017 
are detailed below:

Company statement of changes in equity
Ibstock plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 139
Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Authorisation of financial statements
The Parent Company financial statements of Ibstock plc (“the 
Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 were 
authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 5 March 2018 
and the balance sheet was signed on its behalf by W Sheppard 
and K Sims.
Ibstock plc is a public company limited by shares, which is 
incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly 
traded. The Company’s Ordinary shares are traded on the 
London Stock Exchange. The registered office is Leicester Road, 
Ibstock, Leicestershire LE67 6HS and the Company registration 
number is 09760850.
Summary of significant accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable accounting standards, the Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of 
Ireland (“FRS 102”) and the Companies Act 2006. As a qualifying 
entity, as defined by FRS 102, the Company has elected to adopt 
the reduced disclosure exemptions set out with paragraph 1.12 of 
FRS 102, as described below.
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern 
basis, under the historical cost convention.
The Company has not disclosed the information required by 
regulation 5(1)(b) of the Companies (Disclosure of Auditors 
Remuneration and Liability Limitation Agreements) Regulations 
2008 as the Group accounts of the Company are required to 
comply with regulation 5(1)(b) as if the undertakings included in 
the consolidation were a single group.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the business review on pages 16 and 17 . The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Director’s Report on 84 
and 85. In addition, Note 22 to the Group financial statements 
include the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group regularly reviews market and financial forecasts, and 
has reviewed its trading prospects in its key markets. As a result 
it believes its trading performance will demonstrate continued 
improvement in the coming periods, and that liquidity will 
remain strong.
The Board has reviewed the latest forecasts of the Group and 
considered the obligations of the financing arrangements. Given 
the continued strong liquidity of the Group the Board has 
concluded that the going concern basis of preparation for the 
financial statements of the Company is appropriate. In addition, 
see the Group’s Viability Statement set out on page 42 of the 
Group financial statements.
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiaries are included at cost stated at the 
historical value at the time of investment less any provisions 
for impairment and net of merger and Group reconstruction 
relief available.
Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share based 
compensation plans on behalf of the Group. The fair value of the 
employee services received under such plans is capitalised as an 
investment in the Company’s subsidiary until such time as 
intra-Group recharges are levied by the Company to recover this 
cost from its subsidiaries. Upon recharge, the amounts recharged 
is treated as a return of capital contribution and recorded as a 
credit to equity (up to the value of the initial share based payment 
treated as a capital contribution). Any recharge in excess of the 
capital contribution is recognised within the Company income 
statement. The amount to be recognised over the vesting period 
is determined by reference to the fair value of share based 
payments. For further details of share based payments, see 
Note 25 of the Group financial statements.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Ibstock’s shareholders are recognised in 
the Company’s financial statements in the periods in which the 
final dividends are approved in the Annual General Meeting, or 
when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Financial instruments
(i) Objectives and policies
The Company, in common with its Group subsidiaries, must 
comply with the Group’s finance guidelines that set out the 
principles and framework for managing Group-wide finances. 
Further information on the Group’s policies and procedures is 
available in the Group financial statements. The Company does 
not enter into speculative treasury arrangements.
(ii) Price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk
Foreign exchange risk management
The Company primarily transacts in Sterling and therefore 
exposure to foreign exchange risk is regarded as low.
Credit risk management
For the Company, this risk arises from cash and cash equivalents 
and deposits with banks. This is managed on a Group basis and 
there are a number of initiatives underway to mitigate this risk. 
These include concentrating activities with a group of banks that 
have strong, independently verified credit ratings. For each bank, 
individual risk limits are set based on its financial position, credit 
ratings, past experience and other factors.
Liquidity planning, trends and risks
The Company has sufficient committed borrowing facilities to 
meet planned liquidity needs with headroom, through facilities 
provided by the Group.
The Company has adopted IAS 39 for ‘recognition and 
measurement of financial instruments’.
(iii) Financial assets
Financial assets, including preference shares, trade and other 
receivables, loans to fellow Group companies and cash and bank 
balances, are initially recognised at fair value.
Such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
(iv) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including trade and other payables and loans 
from fellow Group companies, are initially recognised at fair value. 
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, 
using the effective interest rate method in accordance with 
IAS 39.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 140 Ibstock plc Taxation
Taxation expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax 
recognised in the reporting year. Tax is recognised in the profit 
and loss account, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
In this case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity respectively.
During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions 
and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination may be 
uncertain. The calculation of the tax charge therefore necessarily 
involves a degree of estimation and judgement. The tax liabilities 
are based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due 
and tax assets are recognised on the basis of probable future 
recoverability. This requires management to exercise judgement 
based on their interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of 
settlement of tax liabilities or recoverability of tax assets. To the 
extent that the final outcome differs from the estimates made, tax 
adjustments may be required which could have a material impact 
on the tax charge and profit for the period in which such a 
determination is made.
(i) Current tax
Current tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of 
the taxable profit for the year or prior years. Tax is calculated on 
the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the year end.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns 
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is 
subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the 
tax authorities.
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax arises from timing differences that are differences 
between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as 
stated in the financial statements. These timing differences arise 
from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments 
in periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences at the 
reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax 
assets are only recognised when it is probable that they will be 
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other 
future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are 
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing differences.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new Ordinary shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, from the proceeds.
Related parties
The Group discloses transactions with related parties which 
are not wholly owned within the same Group. Where appropriate, 
transactions of a similar nature are aggregated unless, in the 
opinion of the Directors, separate disclosure is necessary to 
understand the effect of the transactions on the Group 
financial statements.
Disclosure exemptions
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, 
the Company has elected to adopt the reduced disclosure 
exemptions set out in paragraph 1.12 of FRS 102, because 
the Company prepares Group consolidated financial statements, 
as described below:
(a) under FRS 102 (Section 1.12(b)), the Parent Company is 
exempt from the requirements to prepare a cash flow statement 
on the grounds that it cash flows are included within the Ibstock 
plc Group consolidated financial statements.
(b) The Parent Company is a qualifying entity and has taken 
advantage of the exemption from disclosing key management 
compensation (other than Directors’ emoluments) under FRS 102 
(Section 1.12(e)), as it is a parent entity whose separate financial 
statements are presented alongside the consolidated financial 
statements, which contain the requisite equivalent disclosures.
(c) The Parent Company is a qualifying entity and has taken 
advantage of the exemption from disclosing certain financial 
instrument disclosures under FRS 102 (Section 1.12(c)), as it is a 
parent entity whose separate financial statements are presented 
alongside the consolidated financial statements, which contain 
the requisite equivalent disclosures.
(d) The Company has elected to avail itself of the disclosure 
exemption within FRS 102 (Section 1.12(d)) in relation to certain 
share-based payment disclosure requirements as it is a parent 
entity whose separate financial statements are presented 
alongside the consolidated financial statements, which contain 
the requisite equivalent disclosures.
(e) The Company has taken advantage of the reduced disclosure 
exemption under FRS 102 (Section 1.12(a)) and is not required to 
follow the requirements of paragraph 4.12(a)(iv) of FRS 102 and 
as such only disclose a reconciliation of shares outstanding at 
between the beginning and end of the year, and not the prior year.
In addition, the Company has taken the exemption within Section 
33 of FRS 102 from disclosing intragroup transactions with wholly 
owned subsidiaries.
2.(b) Critical accounting judgements and estimates
No critical judgements or estimates were made in applying 
the Company’s accounting policies for the year ended 
31 December 2017 .
3. Employee information
The Company has no employees. Non-Executive Directors of the 
Company are employed under letters of appointment. Full details
